Apparently realizing this is their one shot to kill ObamaCare and remake the whole health-care safety net, the Republicans seemed to have crammed every last ounce of cruelty and hypocrisy they could muster into the bill.\n\nHere's a rundown of the BCRA's greatest hits.\n\n1. It's basically a plan to destroy Medicaid. That's the government program that provides health insurance for low-income Americans. It covers more people than Medicare, most of its beneficiaries are children, the elderly, and the disabled, and it pays the bulk of Americans' long-term care and nursing home costs.\n\nObamaCare massively expanded eligibility for the program, and the BCRA would phase that expansion out by 2024.\n\nBut the BCRA would also massively cut the pre-ObamaCare Medicaid program as well. It would force states to spend less Medicaid dollars per person. (Though there's a carve-out for the least-populated states, where per person Medicaid costs are the highest.) And it would give states the option of imposing work requirements on beneficiaries.\n\nBut most importantly, it would first cap the program's growth rate to the inflation rate in medical prices, then change it to the inflation rate for the entire economy in 2025. This is a gargantuan cut in the share of spending the federal government was expected to contribute in the future \u2014 far larger than the 25-percent cut envisioned by the House GOP.\n\nFinally, the BCRA also drops the income eligibility threshold for premium subsidies to zero. That's significant because, under ObamaCare, you didn't get the subsidies if you were poor enough, because Medicaid would step in. So in a sense, the BCRA is really a plan to slowly strangle Medicaid and replace it with subsidies to buy private coverage.\n\nWhich brings us to the next point \u2026\n\n2. Its subsidies for private insurance premiums are terrible. ObamaCare included subsidies to help people afford the premiums on the state-based insurance exchanges it created. And one of ObamaCare's big problems is that these subsidies are too skimpy. The BCRA's subsidies would be even skimpier.\n\nInstead of phasing out at 400 percent of the federal poverty line, like they do under ObamaCare, the BCRA's subsidies would phase out at 350 percent. More than that, though, it would rejigger the formula that calculates subsidies for everyone: Americans at all income levels from 0 to 400 percent of the federal poverty line would often be expected to pay a bigger share of their premiums out of pocket. Their subsidies would also be benchmarked to significantly less generous coverage plans than under ObamaCare, with deductibles that could skyrocket by as much as 60 percent. Americans will basically have to pay much more for worse health insurance.\n\nThis obviously contradicts all the promises that Republicans and President Trump have made on the issue. It's also worth noting that Trump's own base \u2014 older Americans in rural areas \u2014 will be the people hit hardest by these cuts.\n\n3. All this pays for massive tax cuts for the wealthy. You can see this in the Congressional Budget Office's score of the House version of TrumpCare. The BCRA is similar enough \u2014 it keeps virtually all the House's tax cuts, and its Medicaid cuts are deeper over the long run \u2014 that the CBO's analysis generally applies to it, too. The House plan would cut Medicaid by $834 billion and premium subsidies by $276 billion over 10 years. Then it would cut taxes on employers, big medical businesses, and wealthy Americans by $874 billion over the same period, with a little change left over for deficit reduction.

So it can't even be justified as an incentive to boost economic growth.\n\nIn other words, the whole bill is basically a giant giveaway to the wealthy, paid for by cutting health care to the poor.\n\n4. It would hypocritically resurrect insurer \"bailouts.\" The Senate bill would create funds to help insurance companies provide coverage when the individual markets are unstable. It would allocate $50 billion between 2018 and 2021 to \"fund arrangements with health insurance issuers to address coverage and access disruption and respond to urgent health-care needs within states.\" It would allot another $62 billion in grants that states can apply for between 2019 and 2026 for similar purposes.\n\nOn the policy merits, this is actually a good idea.
