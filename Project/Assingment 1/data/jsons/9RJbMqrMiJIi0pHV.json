They will be faced with a great flood of ideas they had never encountered before, and encouraged to face each new experience with a fresh and open mind without any preconceptions. But the 2016-2017 academic year is not an ordinary year \u2014 we are all faced with a polarized national community. The approval levels for both major party candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, are at historic lows. This election has torn rifts in families, ruined friendships, infected social media and invaded nearly every aspect of our social lives.\n\nAs freshmen attempt to make new friends, meet their roommates and get to know their floor, there is a temptation to make assumptions about someone based on their political beliefs. Some people will be more transparent and more enthusiastic about their political leanings than others.\n\nAt the same time, sometimes political beliefs do reflect character of a person. The nominees of the two major parties are endlessly attacked for poor manners, untrustworthiness, dishonesty and many other negative characteristics. Many hold the opinion that the support of one presidential nominee or the other reflects an endorsement and reflection of those negative character traits as well. There is a kernel of truth in that our political beliefs are representative of our personal values.\n\nHowever, that does not necessarily mean a Trump supporter is racially insensitive or a habitual liar. Neither does that mean a Clinton supporter likes to push legal and ethical boundaries for their own benefit.
