It was attacked on July 13 by Willem Van Spronsen .\nVan Spronsen timed the attack to the early hours of the morning , managing to ignite one car \u2014 which is on fire at the start of the video , then explodes into an even bigger conflagration about 23 seconds in . At 38 seconds the video captures voices shouting what sounds like commands , then four seconds later gunfire erupts , momentarily drowning out the shrill fire alarm .\nAuthorities have speculated that Van Spronsen was trying to ignite a propane tank on the property , perhaps to start a larger explosion that could have endangered the 1,300 ICE detainees , some 100 GEO Group employees and other ICE employees there at the time .\nThe video was captured by GEO Group employees whose shifts had ended . They were walking out of the building when they spotted Van Spronsen with a rifle and flares , which he was apparently using as fire starters .\nThe employees grabbed walkie-talkies and a video camera , and were able to get a notification to police , who responded .\nVan Spronsen \u2019 s attack has been labeled domestic terrorism .
