But we , too , made Ferguson because we 're complicit in a system of criminal justice that disproportionately harms black men , and therefore , the black community . We made Ferguson because we do not address the vast and growing injustices for America 's poor -- black and white .\nWe made Ferguson because too many of us would rather tweet than get involved in the messiness of local politics and community building . The hard work of solving problems does n't happen from hashtag campaigns or writing blog posts and articles -- like this one .\nWe made Ferguson because we have more tolerance for riots after sporting events than for citizens protesting injustice .
