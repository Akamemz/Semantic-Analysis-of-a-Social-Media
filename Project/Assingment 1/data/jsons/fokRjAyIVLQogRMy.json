    "content": "President Donald Trump \u2019 s top health official is testing a new tactic in his bid to lower drug costs : Sound more like the boss .\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has slammed drugmakers for their \u201c runaway price increases , \u201d accused insurers of keeping customers in the dark and warned that drug industry middlemen are gaming the system , in what those close to Azar refer to as his \u201c bully pulpit \u201d strategy . It \u2019 s reminiscent of Trump \u2019 s frequent accusations that pharmaceutical companies are \u201c getting away with murder . \u201d\nThe tone is a change for the former pharmaceutical executive , who \u2019 s cultivated a reputation as a mild-mannered pragmatist . But it \u2019 s designed to serve a calculated purpose : Scare the drug industry into voluntarily cutting prices , because the administration can only do so much without Congress .\n\u201c It \u2019 s carrot and stick , \u201d said one person familiar with the strategy . \u201c You \u2019 re with us or against us . It \u2019 s your call , but being against us is not going to stop us . \u201d\nThe Trump administration \u2019 s drug price plan unveiled earlier this month largely embraced the status quo , leaning on dozens of regulatory tweaks and promises to tackle bigger issues down the road .

Bernstein . \u201c It \u2019 s not my impression that anybody sitting there in the board seats is particularly concerned . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s little the administration can actually do on its own to make a measurable dent in drug prices by the end of the year , with Congress eager to steer clear of major health care debates before the midterm elections .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight , every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox .

He and other top health officials in recent weeks have alternately touted the way their efforts will ultimately punish bad actors and urged the drug industry to pre-empt that reckoning by slashing their own prices now .\n\u201c We look forward to working with industry to build a better drug-pricing system , \u201d Azar said in a speech two days after debuting the blueprint . \u201c But if the industry isn \u2019 t willing to work with us , President Trump and his administration will keep turning up the pressure . \u201d\nHe \u2019 s also suggested that skeptics who dismiss the plan as soft either don \u2019 t understand it or don \u2019 t want to .\n\u201c Even stock analysts , who are really quite smart individuals generally , totally missed the boat here , \u201d Azar told \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Pulse Check podcast , a few days after he railed against the media \u2019 s coverage of the plan and pledged to go \u201c through them and around them \u201d to hammer home its importance .\nThat \u2019 s not quite as blunt as Trump \u2019 s talk about drug company profits or the president 's pledge to ensure the pharmacy benefit managers that serve as intermediaries between insurers and drugmakers \u201c won \u2019 t be so rich anymore \u201d \u2014 threats that momentarily drove stock prices downward and put the entire industry on edge .\nBut the principle behind Azar \u2019 s approach is the same , people close to the planning process said .\nMuch as corporations fearful of being targeted by a Trump tweet scrambled to curry favor after the 2016 election , Azar is betting health care companies will be eager to show they \u2019 re tackling drug prices voluntarily to avoid a regulatory crackdown he insists is on the way .\n\u201c In the very near short term , progress is going to be made through voluntary actions , \u201d said a person familiar with the secretary \u2019 s thinking . \u201c The best way to get voluntary actions is to make sure people understand they \u2019 re going to be watched and called on the table if they \u2019 re not with the program . \u201d\nThe constant tough talk serves a more political purpose as well , sending the message that the Trump administration is working on a problem the public wants addressed \u2014 even if there \u2019 s little evidence the government can single-handedly drive down prices .\nThe next step is for HHS to back up Azar \u2019 s words with so-called sunshine tactics that identify companies that are hiking prices or trying to thwart competition .\nA new FDA database , for example , lists all the brand drug manufacturers that the agency says are using a \u201c gaming tactic \u201d to block competing generic drugs \u2014 a clear attempt at shaming companies into abandoning the practice . A more extreme proposal that Azar has floated is requiring drugmakers to disclose product prices in advertisements . That \u2019 s already run into practical and legal questions , but one Azar confidant argued the mere suggestion could bring more transparency , even if the requirement is never implemented .\n\u201c That sure would be an easy , voluntary thing a company could do if they wanted to play ball , \u201d the confidant said , adding that there may be data collection and enforcement authorities HHS can lean on over the next few months to ratchet up the pressure .\nBut that all assumes that the industry will fold in the face of some stern speeches and finger-pointing .
