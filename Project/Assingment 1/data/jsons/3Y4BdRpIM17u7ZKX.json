    "content": "There once was a man named Martin Luther King Jr. who actually lived and breathed . He was a radical who believed in the redistribution of wealth , argued for slave reparations and that wrote that moderate whites who didn \u2019 t speak out on racism were just as bad as the Ku Klux Klan . Seventy-five percent of Americans disapproved of that man when he was killed by a white supremacist in 1968 .\nThen , there is the Martin Luther King Jr. that exists in the collective white memory . Through a complex combination of whitewashing , self-guilt and the intentional rewriting of history that absolves them of their hatred , they have painted a sanitized , impressionist portrait of a civil rights icon whose dreams were fulfilled by America \u2019 s unwavering commitment to justice and equality .\nOut of whole cloth , they managed to fabricate a fantastic hologram of King that is ahistorical , but still \u201c based on a true story. \u201d Their Martin was a lover , not a fighter . They remember a socially conservative , respectable reconciler ; not an anti-establishment revolutionary . And , for their sake , his doctrine of nonviolent resistance was eventually reduced to simple \u201c nonviolence . \u201d\nThere once was a country who stole whole human beings from another continent , dragged them across an ocean and kept them as property out back while they created a country based on the universal laws of freedom and liberty . Even when that country , in theory , realized the hypocrisy of its ways , the only way it could end slavery was by fighting what still stands as the bloodiest war in that country \u2019 s history . Then Jim Crow ... yadda yadda ... The civil rights movement ... blah blah blah ... The Civil Rights Act and , viola \u2014equality !\nThen there is the America that exists in the white mind .\nEven the most obstinately delusional acolyte for post-racial America will not say that racism has been eliminated . They will , however , tell you how much better things have gotten . They honestly think that most white people are not racist and that America is not a racist country . They believe that everyone in America has access to the \u201c American dream \u201d that only exists in the Caucasian imagination .\nOn Saturday , the Boston Globe published a piece by writer Jeff Jacoby explaining that racism in America has been reduced to only a \u201c minor problem \u201d that has grown \u201c less toxic and less entrenched . \u201d\nJacoby laughably supported his argument by cherry-picking polls and statistics that reveal how white people are now willing to allow negro families to live next door ; how whites have more black friends than they once did and how black people are now free to date outside their race .\nJacoby concludes his picture of this utopian America by writing :\nNone of this is to claim that racial ugliness has vanished outright , or that racial concerns can be safely ignored . It is to claim that despite the occasional eruption of racist hatred or cruelty , and despite the coarse racial crudeness of the incumbent president , the American people are far removed from the bigots of yesteryear . In less than two generations , the United States transformed itself from a largely racist society to a largely non-racist one . \u201c We shall overcome , \u201d King and the civil rights heroes vowed . Inspired by their courage , uplifted by their moral leadership , Americans did just that .\nI can \u2019 t blame Jacoby and those of his ilk for stanning for that version of America . It sounds like Wakanda for white people . Oh , how beautifully reassuring it must be to believe that the combination of hard work and hope can turn fiction into a tangible thing and that hatred and cruelty have been reduced to \u201c occasional eruptions . \u201d\nEvery day , the staff of \u2588\u2588\u2588 lays out a list of the stories we will cover . As the list grows , at least once a day , someone will announce that they have discovered a brand new story that we missed . Many times , that story has been covered by another writer on staff , or it has already been discussed . When this happens , someone will invariably quote one of two recurring inside jokes .\nEither they will say \u201c Michael Harriot doesn \u2019 t read \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201d ( Yes , I am probably the most frequent butt of this joke ) or they will just point to the long list of stories we have decided to cover and say :\nApparently , Jeff Jacoby doesn \u2019 t read \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the news , anything written by or about Martin Luther King Jr. or American history .\nIf he did , he \u2019 d know a little more about racism , MLK or America \u2019 s past and present .\nEven white liberals and progressives believe racism is an invisible feeling of hatred and intolerance that only exists in the minds of Nazis , Klansmen and people named Donald Trump . Like white people have done with the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. , Jacoby has finessed the definition of racism until it has become microscopically narrow . They think it is as abstruse as liberty or freedom . But racism is a tangible , measurable thing .\nInstead of postulating about feelings and sentiment we can examine the actual words in Dr. King \u2019 s most famous speech and see how much progress America has made on race .\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia , sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood .\nIf there exists a \u201c table of brotherhood \u201d in Georgia , it is the voting booth . In 1964 , the year before the passage of the Voting Rights Act , an NAACP report said black voting registration numbers were kept low because of \u201c systematic programs of repression , reprisal , trickery and intimidation . \u201d\nFifty-four years later , Georgia \u2019 s black voters were kept from sitting at the table of brotherhood by former secretary of State and current governor , Brian Kemp , who used a new-millennium system of voter suppression that targeted black voters with \u201c reprisal , trickery and intimidation . \u201d\nThere is non-debatable data and accessible court rulings that show how Kemp and others purge black voter registrations , disproportionately toss out ballots in majority-black districts and disqualify black voters .

Mississippi \u2019 s black felony disenfranchisement rate is twice the national average and the state incarcerates three black people for every white person it sends to prison . Black receive prison sentences that are 20 percent longer than whites who commit the same crime . In 2018 , this \u201c largely non-racist \u201d utopia continued to arrest , incarcerate and kill black people disproportionately .\nSo much for the dream about an oasis of justice and freedom .\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character .\nA 2014 study published in the American Psychological Association \u2019 s Journal of Personality and Social Psychology revealed that black boys are viewed as older and less innocent than whites kids the same size and age .
