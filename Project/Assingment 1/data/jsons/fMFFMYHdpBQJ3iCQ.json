Using his personal fortune to solicit donors on social media and leaning on the email list he had put together during his campaign calling for the impeachment of President Trump , Steyer was able to qualify for the October debates , leading to complaints from some of the other candidates in the race that he had bought his placement with the frontrunners .\nSteyer made it his focus to try to attract African-American voters , stating in nearly every debate that he was the only candidate on stage in favor of reparations for slavery . His expenditures in South Carolina divided Democrats there , with some accusations that he was attempting to buy support . Steyer was also outspoken in his support for emergency action on climate change , which he also tied to race .\n\u201c I believe that in every major policy area , there is an unspoken area about race , \u201d Steyer said in a January interview with Yahoo News . \u201c For instance , I \u2019 m saying climate is my No . 1 priority . I \u2019 m also saying our climate plan is called a justice-based climate plan .
