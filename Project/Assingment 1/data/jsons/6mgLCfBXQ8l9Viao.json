Media does n't hold back on Obama\nPresident Barack Obama is damaging his presidency , weakening America \u2019 s standing in the world , and displaying \u201c inexplicable \u201d incompetence .\nThe media figure making those accusations isn \u2019 t Bill O \u2019 Reilly or Rush Limbaugh , Charles Krauthammer or Glenn Beck . The critic doesn \u2019 t host a right-wing talk show , anchor a Fox News program , or write for the pages of the Weekly Standard . In fact , he \u2019 s not even a conservative .\nIt \u2019 s Joe Klein , the Time Magazine political columnist . \u201c Obama has lost some serious altitude : In the world , with the Congress , and most importantly with the American people , \u201d Klein , a veteran journalist and political moderate , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nKlein isn \u2019 t alone : In recent months , and especially since the start of the Syria mess , Obama has been enduring some of the toughest and most widespread press criticism of his four-and-a-half years as president . It isn \u2019 t just coming from the usual suspects on the right . Increasingly , the skepticism is coming from the center and even from the left \u2014 from White House reporters , progressive editorial boards , foreign policy experts and MSNBC hosts .\nAnd Obama has mostly himself to blame for the recent wave of media negativity ( although the Republicans have been glad to lend a hand ) . To hear the press tell it , his handling of the Syria crisis has been confusing and contradictory at best , making him appear weak on the international stage . His administration \u2019 s persecution of whistleblowers and surveillance of the press are at odds with the promises he made as a candidate . His inability to push a progressive agenda through congress makes him appear ineffective .\nIn interviews with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , reporters and pundits from across the ideological spectrum noted that Obama has fewer and fewer safe harbors in the fourth estate . Five years ago , the media was seen as being so sympathetic to the junior Senator from Illinois that it irked even his Democratic challengers .
