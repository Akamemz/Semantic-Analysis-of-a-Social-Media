    "content": "When Donald Trump was running for president , many critics worried about the way he would make decisions while in office . Trump is a man prone to emotional outbursts with little knowledge about public policy issues ; it was easy to spin worst-case scenarios in which he might put the country in danger on a whim .\nIt now looks like those fears are coming to life \u2014 that Trump has decided to put the global economy at risk because he was in a pissy mood .\nThe evidence for this scary-sounding theory comes from a Friday afternoon report published by NBC News , tracing Trump \u2019 s recent decision to slap large tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum . These tariffs have already prompted threats of retaliation from America \u2019 s leading trade partners ; European Union President Jean-Claude Juncker has discussed putting tariffs on blue jeans , bourbon , and Harley-Davidson motorcycles \u2014 three iconic American exports . Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo is openly warning that Trump \u2019 s actions may cause another recession .\nSo how did Trump come to such a monumental decision ? According to NBC \u2019 s sources in the White House , it was because he got some bad press :\nAccording to two officials , Trump \u2019 s decision to launch a potential trade war was born out of anger at other simmering issues and the result of a broken internal process that has failed to deliver him consensus views that represent the best advice of his team . On Wednesday evening , the president became \u201c unglued , \u201d in the words of one official familiar with the president \u2019 s state of mind . A trifecta of events had set him off in a way that two officials said they had not seen before : Hope Hicks \u2019 testimony to lawmakers investigating Russia \u2019 s interference in the 2016 election , conduct by his embattled attorney general and the treatment of his son-in-law by his chief of staff . Trump , the two officials said , was angry and gunning for a fight , and he chose a trade war .\nThink about that for a second .

Even after his initial outburst , Trump apparently didn \u2019 t bother to consult with his economic and diplomatic advisers on the best way to implement these tariffs . In fact , almost no one important was warned of Trump \u2019 s monumental decision before it was made , and the White House did virtually nothing to prepare for the all-too-predictable angry response from foreign leaders :\nThere were no prepared , approved remarks for the president to give at the planned meeting , there was no diplomatic strategy for how to alert foreign trade partners , there was no legislative strategy in place for informing Congress and no agreed upon communications plan beyond an email cobbled together by Ross \u2019 s team at the Commerce Department late Wednesday that had not been approved by the White House . No one at the State Department , the Treasury Department or the Defense Department had been told that a new policy was about to be announced or given an opportunity to weigh in in advance .\nThe reason this kind of thing hasn \u2019 t happened before , according to report after report from inside the White House , is that Trump \u2019 s advisers have been able to keep his impulses in check .
