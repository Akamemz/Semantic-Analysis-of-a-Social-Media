Holder Jr. \u2019 s decision to appoint two U.S. attorneys to investigate the recent spate of national security leaks , rejecting Republican arguments that only an outside counsel would be independent enough for such a task .\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney on Monday briefly said \u201c there is no need for a special counsel \u201d to look into the national security leaks , arguing that \u201c these things have been consistently investigated \u201d by the Justice Department .\n\u201c There are very capable people in the Department of Justice , \u201d he said , referring all additional questions to the Justice Department .\nMr. Holder on Friday announced the decision to tap two U.S. attorneys to look into the leaks of classified material , but Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , the leading critic of the national security breaches , immediately rejected the decision to allow the Justice Department to investigate the administration .\n\u201c We are confident the two U.S. attorneys hand-picked by Attorney General Holder are fine men . However , if there was ever a situation where we needed an outside special counsel that would enjoy bipartisan acceptance and widespread public trust , it is now , \u201d Mr. McCain and Sen.

There were obvious leaks , but they weren \u2019 t from the White House . \u201d\nLast week at a Capitol Hill news conference , the Republican and Democratic leaders of both House and Senate intelligence committees pledged to work together to draft legislation tightening up the law on disclosures of classified information .\nSuch disclosures are not necessarily themselves criminal acts , but there are an arsenal of criminal charges prosecutors can bring to bear .

Mueller III showed that from 2005 to 2009 , 183 referrals were made . Only 17 investigations were launched , and these succeeded in identifying among them a total of 15 suspects .
