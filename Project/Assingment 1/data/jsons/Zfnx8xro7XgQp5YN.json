O \u2019 Malley hammers away on guns . And not surprisingly , Trump is mentioned .\nThere were only three candidates on the stage in the latest Democratic presidential debate , but each had plenty of big moments as they argued about taxes on the middle class , intervention abroad and the safety of their campaign data . Here are the most memorable , important and explosive moments from Saturday 's ABC News debate :\nRight out of the gate , Sen. Bernie Sanders apologized for this week 's data breach , in which Sanders campaign staffers improperly accessed voter data from Hillary Clinton 's campaign . And Clinton accepted his apology .\n\u201c Yes , I apologize , \u201d Sanders said . \u201c Not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton , and I hope we can work on an independent investigation , I apologize to my supporters . \u201d\nClinton said she was looking forward to moving beyond the scuffle .\n\u201c I very much appreciate that comment , Bernie , '' Clinton said . `` It is important that we go forward on this . I know that you now have your data back and there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen . ... Now that ... we 've resolved your data , we 've agreed on an independent inquiry , we should move on . Because I do n't think the American people are all that interested in this . ''\nAll the candidates pivoted to attack Donald Trump again and again during the debate , repeatedly using him as a foil . At one point , Clinton contrasted Trump \u2019 s rhetoric on fighting Islamic terrorists with former President George W. Bush 's repeated statements that the United States was not at war with all Muslims .\n\u201c George W. Bush has done this , I give him credit , \u201d Clinton said before saying that Trump is becoming ISIS \u2019 best recruiter . `` They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists . ''\nAfter Clinton defended instituting a no-fly zone over Syria , Sanders brought up Clinton 's vote to go to war in Iraq over a decade ago to contrast their foreign policies .\n`` Our differences are fairly deep on this issue , '' Sanders said . `` We disagreed on the war in Iraq . ... I say this with due respect , I worry that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences could be . '' After bringing up Iraq again as well as Libya , Sanders continued : `` Yes , we could get rid of [ Syrian President Bashar ] Assad tomorrow , but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS . ... Getting rid of dictators is easy , but you have to think of what will come after . ''\nClinton shot back : \u201c With all due respect , senator , you voted for regime change in Libya . ... All of these are very difficult issues . I know that , I 've been dealing with that for a very long time . \u201d\n4 . Clinton : U.S. 'where we need to be ' on ISIS\nClinton sounded an optimistic note on the country 's ability to handle the threat of ISIS , also known as the Islamic State : `` We now finally are where we need to be . We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS , which is a danger to us as well as the region . ''\nThe comments followed talk about the challenge of Syria : `` I think it 's fair to say , Assad has killed , by last count , about 250,000 Syrians . The reason we are in the mess we 're in , that ISIS has the territory it has , is because of Assad . I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of state , because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now . And so , when we look at these complex problems , I wish it could be either/or . I wish we could say yes , let 's go destroy ISIS and let 's let Assad continue to destroy Syria , which creates more terrorists , more extremists by the minute . No . We now finally are where we need to be . ''\n5 . O'Malley thunders away on guns to contrast with opponents\nMartin O \u2019 Malley jumped in , talking over the moderators , to hit both Sanders and Clinton on guns . While touting his gun control record in Maryland , O'Malley called both of them inconsistent and squishy on the issue .\n\u201c Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year , \u201d O \u2019 Malley said . \u201c Look , what we need is not more polls , we need more principles. \u201d He continued , saying both Clinton and Sanders exemplified the `` flip-flopping political approach of Washington . \u201d\nThe other two Democratic candidates didn \u2019 t take that lightly . \u201c Whoa , whoa , let \u2019 s tell the truth here , \u201d Sanders said , with Clinton adding \u201c Yeah , let \u2019 s tell the truth here. \u201d Both said O'Malley misrepresented them , with Sanders touting his past campaigns in Vermont and Clinton ticking off her support for the Brady Bill and closing loopholes for gun sellers .\n6 . Clinton calls for gun control as part of terrorism response\nAsked about how to handle the threat of domestic and lone-wolf terrorism after the San Bernardino , California , attack , Clinton brought gun control into the conversation : `` If you only think about the coalition abroad , you \u2019 re missing the point because we need a coalition at home . \u2026 Arming more people \u2014 to do what ? \u2014 I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism . ''\nOnce again , Clinton hit out at Trump : `` I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from Republicans , particularly Donald Trump , is sending a message to Muslims in the United states and around the world that there is \u2026 a war against Islam . ''\n7 . Clinton splits with New Hampshire 's governor on halting refugees\nAsked about Democratic New Hampshire Gov . Maggie Hassan \u2019 s call for the federal government to stop accepting Syrian refugees , Clinton split with the popular governor , who has endorsed Clinton and is running for Senate in 2016 .\n8 awkward moments from the Democratic debate A collection of awkward moments from the debate on Saturday . poster= '' https : //v.\u2588\u2588\u2588.com/images/1155968404/201512/506/1155968404_4668687291001_Awk-.jpg ? pubId=1155968404 ''\n\u201c I do n't think a halt is necessary , \u201d Clinton said , instead saying that the screening process should be \u201c very tough \u201d but that did not mean keeping all refugees from coming to the U.S. \u201c We do n't want to make it seem that we are turning into a nation of fear . \u201d\nO \u2019 Malley joined in too , saying \u201c there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees . \u201d\n8 .
