    "content": "An independent panel appointed by the Pentagon and Congress said Thursday that President Obama \u2019 s strategy for sizing the armed services is too weak for today \u2019 s global threats .\nThe National Defense Panel called on the president to dump a major section of his 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review ( QDR ) and write a broader strategy that requires the military to fight on multiple fronts at once .\nIt also said the shrinking U.S. armed forces , which are being downsized to fit that strategy and budget cuts , is a \u201c serious strategic misstep on the part of the United States. \u201d The forces \u2019 numbers spelled out in Mr. Obama \u2019 s QDR are \u201c inadequate given the future strategic and operational environment . \u201d\nThe warning comes as Mr. Obama is under criticism from many Republicans and some Democrats for his standoff policy toward Syria and his limited response to a June offensive by an al Qaeda offshoot that has gobbled up swaths of territory in Iraq .\nCongress authorized the panel of outside experts to review the QDR , a strategy for shaping the active and reserve force . Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel appointed the co-chairmen : former Defense Secretary William Perry , who served under President Bill Clinton , and retired Army Gen. John Abizaid , who ran U.S. Central Command during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq .\nThe panel \u2019 s report said the past several years of budget cuts and mandated reduction in personnel and weapons have stirred deep unease among allies who would count on the U.S. in a crisis .\n\u201c Not only have they caused significant investment shortfalls in U.S. military readiness and both present and future capabilities , they have prompted our current and potential allies and adversaries to question our commitment and resolve , \u201d the report said . \u201c Unless reversed , these shortfalls will lead to a high-risk force in the near future . That in turn will lead to an America that is not only less secure but also far less prosperous . In this sense , these cuts are ultimately self-defeating . \u201d\nIt calls the defense cuts \u201c dangerous \u201d as \u201c global threats and challenges are rising. \u201d The experts point to China \u2019 s and Russia \u2019 s new territorial claims , nuclear proliferation by Iran and North Korea and al Qaeda \u2019 s rapid rise in Iraq .\nThe panel knocks Mr. Obama \u2019 s QDR for reducing the military \u2019 s global mission from being able to defeat two enemies nearly simultaneously to defeating one and denying the objectives of a second . The report calls on Mr. Obama to expand this overriding mission statement .\n\u201c The international security environment has deteriorated since then , \u201d the report said of the QDR , which was released earlier this year . \u201c In the current threat environment , America could plausibly be called upon to deter or fight in any number of regions in overlapping time frames . \u201d\nRep. Howard P. \u201c Buck \u201d McKeon , California Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , said the independent review shows the QDR was more concerned with justifying budget cuts than meeting global security needs .\n\u201c It is the same conclusion many Americans have already reached , \u201d Mr. McKeon said . \u201c There is a cost when America does not lead , and there are consequences when America disengages .
