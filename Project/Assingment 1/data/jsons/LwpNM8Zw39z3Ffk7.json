And what they \u2014 at least Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \u2014 charge is that ISIS is President Obama's fault, because he withdrew troops from Iraq in 2011 \u2014 when he should have kept them there to keep a lid on the insurgency.\n\nLet's Break It Down:\n\nThe Claim:\n\n\"Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq. He left, and when he left al Qaida was done for. ISIS was created because of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana.\" \u2014 former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\n\nThe Big Question:\n\nOK, maybe it's actually two questions:\n\nIs Obama responsible for the timing of the troop withdrawal from Iraq? Did that withdrawal cause the rise of ISIS?\n\nAnd there are answers for both, though not simple ones.\n\nThe Long Answer:\n\nFirst, we have to decide on a starting point.\n\nMany Democrats, and even a few Republicans, say we should look back to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. That, and the dismantling of the entire security force, created an angry, mainly Sunni demographic, which fueled the insurgency that would later become ISIS.\n\nOthers go back further, pointing out the strong links between Saddam Hussein's brutal Baathist regime, and the structure, methods and, indeed, commanders of ISIS.\n\nBut if we take the invasion as a given, and Saddam Hussein as history, we can begin the answer to the first question --\n\nWas Obama responsible for the timing of the withdrawal?\n\nIt was President George W. Bush who signed the Status of Forces agreement in 2008, which planned for all American troops to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011.\n\n\"The agreement lays out a framework for the withdrawal of American forces in Iraq \u2014 a withdrawal that is possible because of the success of the surge,\" he said in a joint press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki at the time.\n\nMoments later, an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at the president. It is important to remember most Iraqis saw the Americans as occupiers and blame them for civilian deaths.\n\nYouTube\n\nMaliki summed up the sentiment at the time, thus:\n\n\"The incomplete sovereignty and the presence of foreign troops are the most dangerous, most complicated and most burdensome legacy we have faced since the time of dictatorship. Iraq should get rid of them to protect its young democratic experiment.\"\n\nThousands of American troops had died, and by the time Obama announced the withdrawal, fully three-quarters of Americans supported the withdrawal (though a majority of Republicans did not).\n\nStill, many had real concerns al Qaeda wasn't done for. And there were some, including U.S. senators, saying the troops should stay just in case things went downhill. They say Obama should have sold the idea, hard, to Maliki.\n\nIraq analyst Kirk Sowell said Obama never really tried.\n\n\"This is one of the criticisms of Obama \u2014 that he sort of wanted the negotiations to fail,\" Sowell said, \"and, so, he didn't even talk to Maliki until it was basically all over.\"\n\nThe State Department's lawyers said troops couldn't stay in Iraq unless the Iraqi parliament authorized them to do so, including granting them immunity from Iraqi law. The Iraqi parliamentarians would never OK such a decision, with Iraqi popular opinion staunchly against U.S. troops staying.\n\nSowell saw State's decision as a deliberately insurmountable obstacle.\n\n\"It was a barrier that was very high,\" he said, \"and there was no way it was going to be jumped over.\"\n\nBut, does Obama bear responsibility for the timing of the troop withdrawal? On balance, no.\n\nHe was following through on an agreement made by Bush and abiding by the will of the Iraqi and American people.\n\nAlright so, onto the next question --\n\nDid the withdrawal of troops lead to the rise of ISIS?\n\nBack then, in 2011, there was no ISIS. The group didn't exist under that name yet. There was just their predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, which had been at the forefront of the terrible insurgency in Iraq. But many thought it was licked.\n\n\"All of the intelligence that we had gathered, all of the results of the surge, all of the detainees we had in our detention system, all of the information we had coming to us from people on the ground, from the tribes indicated that al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated,\" said Ret. Col. Peter Mansoor, who served in Iraq.\n\nThat surge was the influx of American soldiers, and the way the U.S. military organized Sunni tribes to fight against insurgents. The Americans paid them, helped arm them and gave them air cover.\n\nOne of those tribal leaders, Sheikh Hamid Taees, told me: \"In May of 2006, I worked closely with the American side to rid Anbar of terrorism and al Qaeda, and actually we killed a large number of al Qaeda fighters.\"\n\nBut by the time of that comment, early in 2014, al Qaeda was beginning to get a grip on Sunni areas again, including that province of Anbar.\n\nMany Sunni sheikhs say once the American soldiers left, the minority Sunni population of Iraq suffered under a government dominated by the Shiite majority.

The world simply turned its face from us and gave Maliki the permission to attack the demonstrations and kill hundreds of innocent demonstrators.\")\n\nSo some Sunnis were drawn back to the insurgency. ISIS found supporters and gained ground. And, yes, much of that could have been prevented by a big U.S. troop presence.\n\nThe other thing that happened after the American military left was that the Iraqi army deteriorated dramatically.\n\n\"They really did become relatively complacent, and then flat out just didn't train,\" said Major-General Paul E.

And that wasn't going to be permanently solved by American troops.\n\nAnother crucial thing is Syria. For reasons completely beyond Obama's control, after 2011, Syria sank into civil war. Suddenly, just over Iraq's borders were vast ungoverned spaces and lots of weapons. It became a safe haven for ISIS to grow in.\n\nThe Republican candidates have the benefit of hindsight now, but they couldn't have predicted all the things that contributed to the growth of ISIS back then. And neither could Obama.\n\nThe Short Answer:\n\n1. No, Obama shouldn't shoulder the full burden for the timing of the withdrawal of troops;\n\n2. Yes, a significant American troop presence would have helped slow the growth of ISIS\n\nBut with the significant caveat that there were many other factors that enabled ISIS to become strong \u2014 and they weren't all predictable in 2011.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's fact-checking series, \"Break It Down,\" in which we try to cut through the spin and put things in context.
