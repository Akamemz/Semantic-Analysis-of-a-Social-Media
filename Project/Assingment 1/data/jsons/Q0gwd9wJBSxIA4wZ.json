    "content": "According to critics of the Iran deal , Obama got played . If he had just waited , they argue , painful economic sanctions would have forced the Iranians to cave completely . And when that happened , the United States could have taken down Iran 's nuclear program entirely , instead of just limiting it .\nThis narrative sounds compelling . It 's also a total fantasy . The way sanctions actually worked means that the longer the US waited to make a deal , the worse it would have been .\nMiles Kahler , a distinguished professor at American University , put this point really well in a piece for Brookings . Kahler 's basic point is that the deal is n't just an agreement between America and Iran \u2014 it 's a deal between America , Iran , and America 's international partners . People who say there was a better deal do n't really understand what countries like Russia and China wanted out of the negotiations :\nEach of [ America 's ] negotiating partners\u2014three European allies , Russia , and China\u2014paid a higher economic price for these economic sanctions in trade and investment foregone than the United States , whose companies have had ( and will continue to have ) limited economic exchange with Iran since the revolution , prevented by layers of unilateral sanctions imposed by successive U.S. administrations . Without the support of its negotiating partners for extending or deepening sanctions , their effectiveness would be immediately undermined . Given the greater opportunity cost of sanctions for them\u2014particularly for Russia and China\u2014it is difficult to imagine that they would follow any U.S. pursuit of a tougher bargain .

But because they previously traded a lot with Iran , they were also suffering a lot from the sanctions . America did n't have strong trade ties with Iran in the first place , so it felt much less economic pain . But Germany and China did n't want to give up the money they could make from Iran forever . If Obama walked away from this deal , these countries would likely have given up on sanctions altogether \u2014 and the prospect of a `` better deal '' would have vanished .\nThis is a very basic , fundamental point , but no deal critic has been able to answer it in a remotely plausible fashion .
