    "content": "The Affordable Care Act - a law that took months ( or possibly years , depending on your history of the ideas in it ) from drafting to passage in 2009-2010 - was a law that , modern partisan ideology being what it is , could have only been drafted and passed in an era of Democratic supermajority . The end of the era of Democratic supermajority is the genesis of the problems the law is seeing today .\nThe Supreme Court late last week agreed to take up the case of King v. Burwell , which focuses on the meaning of a certain phrase in ACA and whether or not the vague language means that the federal government can subsidize federal health exchanges .
