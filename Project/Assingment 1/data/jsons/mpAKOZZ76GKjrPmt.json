    "content": "After Republicans failed -- in dramatic fashion -- to repeal the Affordable Care Act over the summer , some lawmakers fretted about the status of their nascent tax overhaul , their re-election prospects and their overall ability to govern .\nNow , with the tax bill on the verge of heading to President Trump \u2019 s desk , GOP lawmakers are touting it as a major legislative victory and a signature issue to run on in 2018 .\n\u201c I thought it was really important for the economy , and really important for the performance record of this Congress -- and in that order , \u201d Sen. Roy Blunt , a member of party leadership , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I think the real reason to pass it is the significant economic benefit to families and to the ability to compete . But I think without any question it \u2019 ll make a difference in how Congress is evaluated . \u201d\nThe Senate passed the bill early Wednesday morning by a party-line vote of 51-48 hours after the House passed it , 227-203 , with only 12 Republicans voting no and no Democrats voting yes .\nThe House will have to re-vote Wednesday , however , after several minor provisions were removed from the bill because they didn \u2019 t meet strict rules for the budget procedure Republicans are using to avoid a filibuster in the Senate . The changes are unlikely to alter the vote tally in the House .\nThe tax measure , while a less comprehensive overhaul than originally imagined by Republicans , makes major changes to both the corporate and individual tax systems . It cuts the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent , increases the deduction for so-called pass-through businesses , lowers the rates of individual tax brackets and doubles the standard deduction , while significantly limiting several popular tax deductions . It also repeals the individual mandate from the Affordable Care Act .\nRep. Pete Sessions , a Texas Republican whose district is being targeted by Democrats in 2018 , said the bill provided a capstone for the party \u2019 s first year with unified control of government .\n\u201c We had to have today to be able to say we were doing our job that we said we \u2019 d do , \u201d Sessions said immediately after the House vote . \u201c We delivered by the end of the year . Did the Dallas Cowboys win the game in the third quarter ? No . It took to the last minute of the game , and then the Dallas Cowboys won . \u201d\nStill , Republicans face a serious hurdle in selling their legislation to the public , as polling has shown it to be widely unpopular .\nThe Tax Policy Center , in an analysis of the main provisions of the final version of the bill , found that 80.4 percent of people would receive a tax cut that averaged $ 2,140 , while 4.8 percent would see a tax increase averaging $ 2,770 . But in a CNN poll released Tuesday , only 21 percent of voters said they would be better off if the bill was passed into law , while 37 percent said they would be worse off , and 36 percent said they would be about the same .\nRepublicans acknowledge the public remains unconvinced they \u2019 ll benefit from the legislation , but are adamant that once it takes effect , that pattern will shift .
