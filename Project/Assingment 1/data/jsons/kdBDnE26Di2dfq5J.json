    "content": "Devin Nunes speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill , October 2017 . ( Carlos Barria/Reuters )\nThe FBI and Democrats don \u2019 t have good reasons for wanting to prevent its disclosure to the public .\nIt appears very likely that President Trump is going to allow the disclosure , in some form , of the memo on alleged FISA abuse authored by majority staff of the House Intelligence Committee under the direction of Chairman Devin Nunes ( R. , Calif. ) . It could happen as early as today . As one would expect , both sides of the dispute over the memo are intensifying their pre-publication efforts to influence public reaction \u2014 as discussed here in last week \u2019 s column considering objections to the memo .\nSince before the Republican-led committee voted ( along partisan lines ) to seek the memo \u2019 s declassification and publication , the FBI has been complaining that it was not permitted to review the memo . As I explained last week , this was a very unpersuasive complaint . Having stonewalled the committee \u2019 s information requests for several months , the Bureau and Justice Department are hardly well positioned to complain about being denied access ; the committee , by contrast , has every reason to believe they would have slow-walked any review in order to delay matters further .\nAll that aside , the FBI was guaranteed access to the memo before its publication because of the rules of the process . Once the committee voted to disclose , that gave the president five days to object . During that five days , Trump \u2019 s own appointees at the FBI and DOJ would have the chance to pore over the memo and make their objections and policy arguments to their principal , the president , and to the rest of the Trump national-security team . This tells us the real objection was not that they were barred from reviewing the memo ; it is that they were barred from reviewing it on a schedule that would make it more difficult to derail publication .\nFox News reports that FBI director Christopher Wray reviewed the memo on Capitol Hill on Sunday \u2014 before the committee even voted to release it . Subsequently , two senior FBI officials \u2014 one each from the Bureau \u2019 s counterintelligence and legal divisions \u2014 reviewed the memo and \u201c could not point to any factual inaccuracies \u201d in it , according to an unnamed source who spoke to Fox .\nThere has followed the usual gamesmanship that intensifies public cynicism about \u201c the Swamp. \u201d Based on their review of the memo , the FBI and committee Democrats sought some changes . Though committee Republicans did not agree that these edits were necessary , they nevertheless agreed to make them . Democrats promptly used this accommodation \u2014 which they and the FBI had requested \u2014 to argue that publication should now be withheld because the memo has been \u201c materially \u201d and \u201c substantively \u201d altered since the committee votes . Nunes counters that the edits are minor and include mere grammatical fixes . Given that the people who are complaining about the changes are the ones who insisted on them , the chairman rejects what he calls an \u201c increasingly strange attempt to thwart publication of the memo . \u201d\nApparently unable to cite inaccuracies , the Bureau has shifted to the objection we anticipated last week \u2014 namely , that the memo takes things out of context . The purported omission of material information , it is said , has the effect of making the memo misleading . The FBI put out a statement Wednesday asserting that it had \u201c grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo \u2019 s accuracy . \u201d\nThe committee and such other informed critics as Senator Lindsey Graham have been suggesting that the FBI and Justice Department used allegations from the Steele dossier in an application for a FISA Court warrant but did not tell the judge important facts about the dossier ( specifically , that the dossier was an unverified anti-Trump opposition-research project , commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign ) . Thus , Chairman Nunes \u2019 s hard-edged response to the FBI \u2019 s statement was what one would expect : If anyone knows about \u201c material omissions , \u201d it is the FBI . \u201c It \u2019 s clear , \u201d Nunes states , \u201c that top officials used unverified information in a court document to fuel a counter-intelligence investigation during an American political campaign . \u201d\nIf the memo does not contain factual misstatements and the major complaint is that it is incomplete because salient facts are omitted , that is an easy problem to solve . I elaborated on that in last week \u2019 s column :\nAs with any summary , there is always a danger of [ the memo \u2019 s ] being misleading . This [ is comparable to ] a recurring problem in judicial proceedings , where the need to boil voluminous information down to its essence is obvious . The problem is solved by the so-called rule of completeness : If a party contends that his adversary is taking information out of context or otherwise omitting essential details necessary to an accurate understanding of a document , the party may propose that the necessary context or details be included . An example : Smith tells the police , \u201c I was in the bank but I didn \u2019 t rob it. \u201d At the trial , the prosecutor disingenuously suggests to the jury that Smith was implicitly admitting guilt when he told the police \u201c I was in the bank \u201d the day it was robbed . Smith would then be entitled to introduce his complete statement \u2014 the \u201c but I didn \u2019 t rob it \u201d portion is necessary to the jury \u2019 s understanding that , far from implicitly admitting guilt , Smith explicitly denied guilt .\nIn the column , I was addressing claims by committee Democrats , but these echo the complaint the FBI is making now . We pointed out that the simple way forward was for Democrats to propose the inclusion of any details necessary to correct any misimpressions , or to prepare their own memo that would reveal the hidden details and illustrate that Republicans were engaged in partisan spin .
