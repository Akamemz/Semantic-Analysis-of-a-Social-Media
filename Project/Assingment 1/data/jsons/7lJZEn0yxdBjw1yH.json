    "content": "In April 2012 , Ms. Yellen told a New York audience that the Fed had not done enough to stimulate the economy in the aftermath of the great recession . Ms. Yellen , like most of Fed officials , had underestimated the depth of the recession and overestimated the strength of the recovery . The speech was part of a campaign of many months , most of it waged behind the scenes , to convince her colleagues that the Fed could and should do more .\nBut some Fed officials were waxing skeptical about the Fed \u2019 s capacity to provide additional help , or worrying about the potential cost . In the months after the April speech , Ms. Yellen \u2019 s advocacy would be drawn into increasingly sharp contrast with the views of the newest professor on the Fed \u2019 s board , the Harvard economist Jeremy C. Stein , who began to fret publicly that the central bank \u2019 s efforts could destabilize financial markets .\nMs. Yellen \u2019 s views have prevailed so far . She is not personally close with Mr. Bernanke , but they respect each other and have broadly agreed about monetary policy , according to people familiar with the relationship . Together with a number of allies , they forged a consensus in the fall of 2012 for the Fed to expand both of its principal campaigns to spur job creation : more asset purchases , and an extended commitment to low interest rates .\nLast month , despite mounting internal pressure to scale back the bond purchases , Ms. Yellen and her allies prevailed again . The Fed surprised investors by announcing that it would postpone any retreat as a renewal of Washington \u2019 s episodic fiscal crisis once again threatened the recovery .\nThe Fed \u2019 s stance has been a disappointment to some observers who believe stronger action is required to reduce unemployment more quickly , even as it continues to worry those who fear the Fed has exhausted its abilities .\nThe inconsistent , sometimes contradictory pronouncements of Fed officials in recent months also have roused the ire of investors who find the Fed \u2019 s new transparency more confusing at times than its former obfuscation .\nMs. Yellen has largely avoided public comment since June , seeking to avoid any impression that she is campaigning for Mr. Bernanke \u2019 s job .
