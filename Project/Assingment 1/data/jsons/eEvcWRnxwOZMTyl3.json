    "content": "The rivalry between Sens . Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio flared Tuesday at the final Republican primary debate of the year , as all the leading GOP candidates battled to show their tough-on-terror credentials .\nDonald Trump , as in past debates , sparred sharply with his rivals on stage over his controversial proposals , notably his call to ban Muslims from entering the country . But the changing dynamics in the race appeared to drive frequent clashes between the senators from Texas and Florida \u2013 who are now battling to be the Trump alternative in the race as Ben Carson slides in the polls .\nWith the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , Calif. , refocusing the race squarely on security issues , Cruz from the outset tried to sound a tough message against radical Islam .\n\u201c We will utterly destroy ISIS , \u201d Cruz vowed , later adding : \u201c ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism will face no more determined foe than I will be . \u201d\nBut he repeatedly was challenged by Rubio over his Senate positions \u2013 including for legislation reining in NSA metadata collection . Rubio accused Cruz of helping take away a \u201c valuable tool \u201d for security officials , while Cruz said : \u201c Marco knows what he \u2019 s saying isn \u2019 t true . \u201d\nRubio later cited a budget vote by Cruz to say : \u201c You can \u2019 t carpet bomb ISIS if you don \u2019 t have planes and bombs to attack them with . \u201d\nRubio followed up on his attacks against Cruz Wednesday , calling out Cruz 's `` tough talk '' on Fox and Friends .\n`` All this tough talk , Ted stood up there said ' I 'm going to utterly destroy ISIS . ' Anyone can say that , but what are you going to do it with ? \u201d Rubio said , accusing the Texas senator of supporting a budget that cuts defense spending and voting against defense authorization bills .\nNew Jersey Gov . Chris Christie used the arguing to contrast his own executive experience against the senators \u2019 legislative history . He described their jobs as \u201c endless debates about how many angels on the head of a pin from people who have never had to make a consequential decision . \u201d\nBut Rubio and Cruz returned to the fray later on as they tried to cast each other as soft on illegal immigration . \u201c I led the fight against [ Rubio \u2019 s ] legalization-amnesty bill , \u201d Cruz charged .\nSome analysts had expected the tensions Tuesday to flare between Trump and Cruz , as the Texas senator surpasses Trump in Iowa polls and is surging nationally . But Cruz avoided taking on Trump in favor of Rubio \u2013 he even jokingly backed Trump \u2019 s plan to build a border wall .\n\u201c We will build a wall that works , and I \u2019 ll get Donald Trump to pay for it , \u201d Cruz said .\nLater on , Trump backed off comments where he said Cruz acted in Congress like \u201c a bit of a maniac. \u201d Trump said Tuesday , \u201c He \u2019 s just fine , don \u2019 t worry about it . \u201d\nInstead , Trump took heat mostly from former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush , who slammed Trump \u2019 s plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States as \u201c not a serious proposal . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s a chaos candidate , and he \u2019 d be a chaos president , \u201d Bush said .\nTrump fired back that \u201c Jeb doesn \u2019 t really believe I \u2019 m unhinged \u201d and only went after him because he \u2019 s \u201c failed in this campaign . \u201d\nThe Trump-Bush acrimony simmered throughout the debate , with Bush later telling Trump he can \u2019 t \u201c insult your way to the presidency , \u201d and Trump once again reminding Bush that his poll numbers have plummeted while Trump is leading .\nWhether Bush \u2019 s attacks will help the struggling candidate remains to be seen . Perhaps more consequential is whether Rubio or Cruz can present himself as more capable of taking on the country \u2019 s security challenges .\nBush followed up on his criticism of Trump on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning , saying : `` I just do n't think he 's ready from day one to be President of the United States . ''\n\u201c He has made it clear that he gets his foreign policy advice from the shows , he makes it clear hew thinks Hillary Clinton was a great negotiator with Iran , he thinks ISIS wasn \u2019 t a threat just two months ago \u2013 he \u2019 s not a serious candidate , \u201d Bush said .\nAll the leading candidates , though , focused on the terror threat throughout the CNN-hosted primary debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas \u2013 an event held just hours after Los Angeles closed its school system over a terror threat .\nCiting that closure , which is now thought to have been prompted by a hoax threat , Christie said children will be going back to school filled with anxiety . And he said the country \u2019 s overall security environment has been hurt by President Obama and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s policies .\nChristie cited his experience as a federal prosecutor , and governor , in saying that under a Christie presidency , \u201c America will be safe . \u201d\nCarson also dismissed \u201c PC \u201d concerns about some of his own plans for taking on the terror threat .\n\u201c We are at war \u2026 We need to be on a war footing , \u201d Carson said , while later making an argument against toppling foreign dictators . He compared the situation to being on a plane , where passengers in an emergency are advised to use oxygen masks themselves before helping others .\n\u201c We need oxygen right now , \u201d Carson said , adding the government needs to think of the needs of the American people before solving everyone else \u2019 s problems .\nAs before , Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul questioned Trump \u2019 s policy proposals , including to restrict the Internet to clamp down on ISIS \u2019 social media use . \u201c Do you believe in the Constitution ? \u201d Paul said of Trump supporters . Trump clarified he \u2019 s only talking about restricting the Internet in parts of Iraq and Syria .\nAnd when Trump suggested that the money spent toppling Mideast dictators could have been better spent on building America \u2019 s roads and bridges , former HP CEO Carly Fiorina compared him to Obama .\n\u201c That \u2019 s exactly what President Obama has said .
