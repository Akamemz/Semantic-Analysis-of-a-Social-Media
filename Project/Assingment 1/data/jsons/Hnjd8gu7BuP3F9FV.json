For each nonexempt family member without coverage , \u201c the taxpayer will owe a payment , \u201d according to guidance from the Internal Revenue Service .\nThe penalty starts at $ 95 for low-income taxpayers in 2014 , rising to $ 659 in 2016 . Higher-income taxpayers who reject coverage will pay more \u2014 1 percent of their income in 2014 , rising to 2.5 percent in 2016 .\nPeople who are not legal residents of the U.S. are exempt from the mandate , although undocumented immigrants are not eligible for government benefits under the law either .\nAmerican Indians , many of whom obtain care through the government \u2019 s Indian Health Care system , also are exempt , although The Associated Press recently reported on concerns the law defines qualified Indians and their tribal affiliations too narrowly .\nOther exemptions apply to those who do not earn enough to file a tax return , who will not be covered by Medicaid because their state chose not to expand the program under Mr. Obama \u2019 s law , and those who can not afford even the cheapest qualified health plan .\nBut the most interesting cases are the exemptions based on belief . There is a \u201c religious conscience \u201d clause for such groups as the Old Order Amish or Old Order Mennonites , who restrict or bar contact with modern society and also have never paid into Social Security or Medicare .\n\u201c They just don \u2019 t do insurance , \u201d said Timothy S. Jost , a health care analyst at the Washington and Lee University School of Law . \u201c Groups like that are exempt . \u201d\nTo secure the exemption , the groups must certify to the IRS they are conscientiously opposed to public and private insurance and that their religious group provides a reasonable level of living for its members and has existed continuously since Dec. 31 , 1950 .\nA second contingent , Christian-based health care sharing ministries such as Samaritan , are exempted because they pick up their own costs .\nThe Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries \u2019 website says ministries have members in all 50 states and share $ 165 million per year for health care . To qualify for the exemption from Mr. Obama \u2019 s health care law , a member must belong to a ministry that has existed in some form since 1999 .\nIf Congress had refused to shelter the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites from the individual mandate , it would have created a high-profile standoff .\n\u201c They would have gone to prison over it , \u201d said Donald B. Kraybill , a specialist on the Amish and senior fellow at the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania . \u201c There was a great deal of concern but it was kind of a no-brainer . \u201d\nHe said the roughly 280,000 Amish and 50,000 Mennonites in the U.S. emphasize a strong separation between church and state , so they don \u2019 t feel they should obtain public benefits they view as \u201c handouts . \u201d\nDespite their lack of formal insurance , the Amish are model patients because they pay cash and will not sue doctors for malpractice , and the hospital does not have to deal with the paperwork associated with big insurers , said Mr. Kraybill , whose most recent book , \u201c The Amish , \u201d was published in April .\n\u201c They know these people will pay , \u201d he said . \u201c They have a very good track record . \u201d\nThe Amish are not homogenous and have varying approaches to health care , but serious injuries or illnesses do result in medical bills .

In doing so , they say , members reap the benefit of monthly payments that are far lower than insurance premiums and a community-driven system that replaces corporate red tape with prayer cards .\n\u201c It \u2019 s nicer to get a call from someone saying they \u2019 re praying for you than a computer slip in the mail from an insurance company that says your bill \u2019 s been paid , \u201d Mr. Edwards said .\nUnlike insurance , sharing ministries do not pool health risks or face state regulations mandating reserves of capital or surpluses .
