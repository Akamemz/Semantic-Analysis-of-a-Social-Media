The court did not unravel the law itself , but questioned the validity of the allegedly outdated criteria used to select which states would be singled out .\nFollowing the decision , Holder had publicly pledged to aggressively use his department \u2019 s power to block or halt any new state laws it views as discriminatory . He took his first step in that direction on Thursday .\nHolder , during a speech to the Urban League in Philadelphia , said that based on evidence of racial discrimination presented last year in a redistricting case in Texas , `` we believe that the state of Texas should be required to go through a preclearance process whenever it changes its voting laws and practices .

Rick Perry said in a statement .\nTexas Republican Sen. John Cornyn accused Holder of trying to go around the high court . `` This decision has nothing to do with protecting voting rights and everything to do with advancing a partisan political agenda , '' Cornyn said .\nBut Holder , in calling for the court action , said that in Texas , there is a history of `` pervasive voting-related discrimination against racial minorities . ''\nIt is the department 's first action to address the voting rights law following the Supreme Court 's decision on June 25 , `` but it will not be our last , '' Holder said .\nIn the Texas case , the department is not directly intervening but was filing what 's known as a statement of interest in support of the private groups that have filed suit .\nA three-judge panel in San Antonio has been looking at Texas voting maps since 2011 , when the court threw out boundaries drawn by a then-GOP supermajority in the statehouse .\nUnder the direction of GOP Gov . Rick Perry last month , the Legislature ratified those interim maps as permanent over the objection of Democrats , who still believe the maps are biased and underrepresent minorities .\nThe requirement to obtain `` pre-approval '' from either the Justice Department or a federal court before making changes to voting laws is available when intentional voting discrimination is found .\nHolder also said : \u201c Despite the court 's decision , I believe we must regard this setback not as a defeat but as an historic opportunity for Congress to restore and even to strengthen modern voting protections . ''\n`` Even as Congress considers updates to the Voting Rights Act in light of the court 's ruling , we plan , in the meantime , to fully utilize the law 's remaining sections to ensure that the voting rights of all American citizens are protected .
