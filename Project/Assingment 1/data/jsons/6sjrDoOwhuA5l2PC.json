Yesterday , more than two months after the terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi left four Americans dead and the American response a confused mess , the Pentagon finally got around to releasing its version of the timeline of military response to the crisis to the Associated Press \u2014 when most newspapers and broadcast networks had closed up shop for the day . Small wonder , too , because the timeline showed that it took 19 hours for military assistance to arrive ( via Twitchy ) :\nNew Pentagon details show that the first U.S. military unit arrived in Libya more than 15 hours after the attack on the consulate in Benghazi was over , and four Americans , including the ambassador , were dead . A Defense Department timeline obtained by The Associated Press underscores how far the military response lagged behind the Sept. 11 attack , due largely to the long distances the commando teams had to travel to get to Libya . Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and his top military adviser were notified of the attack about 50 minutes after it began and were about to head into a previously scheduled meeting with President Barack Obama . The meeting quickly turned into a discussion of potential responses to the unfolding situation in Benghazi , where militants had surrounded the consulate and set it on fire . The first wave of the attack at the consulate lasted less than two hours . \u2026 But there have been persistent questions about whether the Pentagon should have moved more rapidly to get troops into Libya or had units closer to the area as the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on America approached . In particular , there was at least a 19-hour gap between the time when Panetta first ordered military units to prepare to deploy \u2013 between midnight and 2 a.m. local time in Tripoli \u2013 and the time a Marine anti-terrorism team landed in Tripoli , which as just before 9 p.m .\nWhy so long ? The Pentagon claims that the situation was \u201c murky , \u201d that they didn \u2019 t understand whether a hostage situation might develop , and also claimed not to have been aware of any specific threats . That would be news to anyone following the Benghazi story in some depth . Ambassador Chris Stevens warned repeatedly of threats to the Benghazi mission for months , requesting more security . On the day of the attack , three hours before it began and roughly five hours before Stevens was killed , the Benghazi consulate alerted State that radical Islamist terrorists had begun \u201c gathering weapons and gathering steam , \u201d plus a note that their security team of Libyan militia had taken pictures inside the compound for no apparent reason earlier that day .\nPut this in the context of the date and place .

It took place in Benghazi , where the US government and everyone else knew these terrorist groups acted openly , having been freed from the oppression of the Qaddafi regime by Barack Obama and NATO a year earlier . The Benghazi mission was in the middle of a city that had no effective government control . And the reason that the Pentagon couldn \u2019 t anticipate the attack on Benghazi and have its assets positioned for immediate response , with all of the above intel , would be \u2026 ?\nPanetta said that based on a continuous evaluation of threats , military forces were spread around Europe and the Middle East to deal with a variety of missions .
