    "content": "Shortly following Donald Trump \u2019 s upset victory in November , the Obama administration and the legacy media began telling us that Obamacare enrollment was skyrocketing due to fear of the president-elect \u2019 s pledge to repeal the law . Three days after the election , for example , CNN produced this headline : \u201c Obamacare sign-ups surge after Trump \u2019 s election. \u201d Obama himself boasted in December about \u201c the biggest day ever for Healthcare.gov. \u201d Well , like everything else these people told us , this was hogwash . The actual signup numbers are in , and they are the lowest ever . What happened ? CNN reports that the slump was caused by\u2026 er\u2026 Trump .\nThat \u2019 s right , the same \u201c news \u201d outlet that claimed fear of Trump was driving enrollments to record highs now says that the President is the cause of Obamacare \u2019 s worst signup year ever . And former Obama administration officials are singing the same refrain . The Hill reports , \u201c A former Obama administration official estimates that nearly 500,000 people missed out on ObamaCare enrollment this year because of moves by the Trump administration. \u201d This comes from Joshua Peck , former chief marketing officer for HealthCare.gov , who claims that Trump accomplished this dark deed by pulling a few ads at the end of the enrollment period .\nThis fiction ignores the outrageous premiums and deductibles that characterized the 2017 Obamacare plans . It also fails to acknowledge the paucity of choices offered by the exchanges . As the Daily Signal points out , \u201c The Heritage Foundation finds that insurer competition in the Obamacare exchanges is worse than ever in 2017 , with 70 percent of counties having only one or two insurers selling coverage. \u201d This is nearly twice the number of counties that offered so few choices last year . Note to Mr. Peck and anyone else afflicted with economic illiteracy \u2014 when you raise prices ( on health plans or widgets ) while reducing choice , you get fewer buyers .\nAnd that is precisely what happened . The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , reported Friday that the cost of the plans offered by HealthCare.gov experienced \u201c a 25 percent increase over the previous year in the average premium\u2026 as well as a 28 percent decline in the number of [ insurers ] participating over the past year. \u201d Thus , the paltry 9.2 million signup total not only falls short of last year \u2019 s figure , it continues Obamacare \u2019 s consistent record of failing to hit its enrollment targets . As Jeffrey Anderson wrote in the Weekly Standard last year , the shortfall had already reached 24 million before the 2017 enrollment period had begun :\nThree years ago , on the eve of Obamacare \u2019 s implementation , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) projected that President Obama \u2019 s centerpiece legislation would result in an average of 201 million people having private health insurance in any given month of 2016 . Now that 2016 is here , the CBO says that just 177 million people , on average , will have private health insurance in any given month of this year \u2014 a shortfall of 24 million people .\nThis failure to hit its enrollment goals has plagued Obamacare since its comically inept rollout . As Sharyl Attkisson wrote six months after the launch , the actual number of Americans newly insured by the \u201c Affordable Care Act \u201d fell far short of the 8 million figure promulgated by the Obama administration : \u201c Assuming the most positive estimates \u2014 that 85 percent of the 8 million enrollees have paid their premiums and 43 percent had coverage before \u2014 the newly insured would number only about 3.9 million. \u201d Even if the administration \u2019 s estimate had not been deliberately fudged , it would have amounted to well under a third of CMS projections .\nThe enrollment pace was nearly as lethargic during Obamacare \u2019 s second enrollment period as it had been for 2014 , and the gory details of the 2016 plan year are provided above . In other words , lackluster signup totals have constituted an ongoing failure of the \u201c Affordable Care Act \u201d since it was first foisted on an unwilling electorate . Yet the legacy media and various refugees from the Obama administration still expect us to believe that the sorry signup performance reported Friday by CMS is somehow the fault of a president who took office three weeks ago .
