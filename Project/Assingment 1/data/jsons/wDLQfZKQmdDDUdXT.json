    "content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller could have a tough time making an obstruction of justice case stick against President Trump , according to legal analysts , who said he will have to overcome a number of \u201c unique hurdles \u201d \u2014 not the least of which is a decades-old Justice Department ruling that a sitting president can \u2019 t be charged .\nAnalysts say it will be up to Mr. Mueller to decide whether to accept the long-standing opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel , which ruled in 1973 and again in 2000 that a president has immunity from criminal prosecution .\nIt \u2019 s also not clear that FBI investigations count as \u201c proceedings \u201d that could be obstructed under one of the legal statutes that might be cited in an obstruction case , according to a legal memo prepared last month by the Congressional Research Service .\n\u201c Courts have not reached consensus on whether an FBI investigation meets this standard , \u201d the report says of 18 U.S.C . 1505 , which applies generally to obstruction of administrative proceedings .\nMr. Mueller \u2019 s office declined to comment Thursday on reports that the special prosecutor \u2019 s probe had expanded from Russian meddling in the November presidential election to questions of whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the Russia investigation .\nSeparately , Sen. Richard Burr , North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , and Sen. Mark R. Warner , the panel \u2019 s ranking Democrat , confirmed their own investigation of Russian hacking and suspected collusion would not be looking into the obstruction of justice claim .\n\u201c Obstruction is criminal \u2014 there \u2019 s a criminal aspect to that , \u201d Mr. Burr told CNN . \u201c It \u2019 s never been part of our [ investigation ] . \u201d\nBut Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , which also is investigating the Russian hacking case , said he is pressing to inquire about obstruction of justice .\n\u201c I think it needs to be part of the investigation , \u201d Mr. Schiff told Politico on Thursday . \u201c Congress has to get to the bottom of whether anybody is interfering or obstructing any investigation in any way . \u201d\nSeveral Republican lawmakers said claims of obstruction of justice , which got new life when fired FBI Director James B. Comey testified on Capitol Hill last week , are a distraction .\n\u201c What we really need to be looking at is Russian interference , their willingness and desire to hack into our systems , \u201d Rep. Mark Meadows , North Carolina Republican and chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nMr. Trump , through his Twitter account , was again angrily attacking leaks of a possible obstruction of justice case . He said he was the victim of a \u201c witch hunt \u201d without precedent in U.S. history .\nThe president again called the Russia probe an attempt by Democrats to distract from their election loss and from the scandals surrounding Hillary Clinton \u2019 s email server .\n\u201c You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history \u2014 led by some very bad and conflicted people ! \u201d Mr. Trump tweeted . It was an apparent reference to reports that Mr. Mueller , a former FBI director , was too close to Mr. Comey and that some of the investigators he has recruited have donated to Democratic politicians .\nMr. Trump and his defenders also say the Mueller probe has been a source of damaging leaks , including news of the obstruction of justice investigation and a Washington Post report Thursday evening that the special counsel is reportedly looking into the finances and business dealings of Jared Kushner , Mr. Trump \u2019 s son-in-law and a top White House adviser .\nJamie Goerlick , Mr. Kushner \u2019 s attorney , said it was not clear what the probe entailed but added , \u201c It would be standard practice for the special counsel to examine financial records to look for anything related to Russia . Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about Russia-related matters . He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry . \u201d\nLegal analysts said it will be up to Mr. Mueller , a former FBI director appointed by the deputy attorney general to oversee the probe , to interpret his own boundaries .\n\u201c If Mueller concludes that he is bound by the OLC opinions or if he concludes it \u2019 s the right conclusion , then there is a genuine issue on how far he can press a criminal investigation into the president \u2019 s own conduct , \u201d said Philip Allen Lacovara , a former U.S. deputy solicitor general who served as counsel to Watergate special prosecutors Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski .\nThe Office of Legal Counsel opinions \u2014 which concluded that \u201c the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting president would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions \u201d \u2014 coincided with probes into the actions of President Nixon and President Clinton .\nMr. Lacovara advised the Watergate special prosecutors handling the Nixon investigation that the president doesn \u2019 t have any sort of unique immunity from the law . Nixon never faced any criminal proceedings before he resigned in 1974 facing impeachment by the House , and he was pardoned shortly after he left the White House by his successor , Gerald Ford .\nWhether the Justice Department \u2019 s stance would stand up in court is untested , the Congressional Research Service reported .\n\u201c The DOJ opinion \u2014 issued in 1973 and reiterated in 2000 \u2014 shows nonetheless that an obstruction of justice prosecution against a sitting president , as opposed to other members of the executive branch , would face unique hurdles , \u201d the report states .\nJohn Carlin , who was an assistant attorney general for national security in the Obama Justice Department , doesn \u2019 t expect Mr. Mueller to test those uncharted waters .\n\u201c Mueller , who has spent nearly his entire career working for the Justice Department , seems unlikely to confront the office \u2019 s conclusion head-on , given its role as the executive branch \u2019 s foremost legal authority , \u201d Mr. Carlin wrote in an analysis published last week in The Washington Post .\nThe statute governing the appointment of a special counsel states that the counsel \u201c shall comply with the rules , regulations , procedures , practices and policies of the Department of Justice. \u201d But that doesn \u2019 t mean the outside investigator does everything the same way agents handling a Justice Department investigation would be required .\nFor instance , criminal wiretaps sought by the special counsel wouldn \u2019 t have to be approved by Justice Department \u2019 s criminal division . The special counsel is also expected to seek guidance from offices within the department about polices and practices except in \u201c extraordinary circumstances , \u201d under which doing so might be inappropriate . In that case , he is to consult with Mr. Rosenstein instead .\nBut concluding that there is a case for obstruction of justice will be a tricky endeavor in and of itself , said Kenneth W. Starr , who acted as an independent counsel investigating President Clinton .\n\u201c Obstruction of justice is really a hard crime to make out , \u201d Mr. Starr told CNN on Thursday . \u201c It \u2019 s not just that you want the investigation to go away , that you suggested the investigation goes away . You have to take really affirmative action . \u201d\nMr. Starr said it was too soon to determine whether obstruction charges could be substantiated in Mr. Trump \u2019 s case . Based on the information made public thus far about Mr. Trump \u2019 s interactions with Mr. Comey , Mr. Starr said he didn \u2019 t think there was enough evidence to bring such charges .\nIf charges are not filed , there is some question as to how much Mr. Mueller could choose to make public about the results of his investigation .\nThe special counsel is required to send a confidential report to the attorney general \u2014 in this case to Mr. Rosenstein \u2014 detailing the decision made about whether or not to bring charges . But there is no guarantee that such a report would be made public .\nMr. Carlin suggested that congressional leaders should try in advance to obtain assurances that if Mr. Mueller uncovers potential evidence of criminal conduct by Mr. Trump , \u201c that evidence will be disclosed in detail to Congress once the investigation is concluded . \u201d\nIf others are criminally charged , then the special counsel \u2019 s team could detail Mr. Trump \u2019 s actions in their charging documents and label the president as an unindicted co-conspirator \u2014 a tactic employed with Nixon .\nControversy continued to swirl with a Washington Post report Wednesday in which unidentified sources claimed Mr. Mueller \u2019 s investigation had expanded beyond Russian meddling to include an exploration of Mr. Trump \u2019 s recent conduct \u2014 including the firing of Mr. Comey on May 9 .\nThe Post reported that Mr. Mueller is seeking to interview Trump administration officials uninvolved with the presidential campaign , including Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats , National Security Agency Director Adm. Michael S. Rogers and former NSA Deputy Director Richard Ledgett , with the goal of assessing whether anyone tried to block the Russia probe .\nA spokesman for Mr. Mueller told The Times on Thursday that Office of Special Counsel simply had no comment on the direction of the special counsel \u2019 s probe , but Mr. Trump \u2019 s personal attorney said through a spokesman that the leaks were \u201c outrageous , inexcusable and illegal . \u201d\nA source close to Mr. Coats confirmed that the director of national intelligence would be interviewed by Mr. Mueller but suggested that the director had not been notified by about the focus of the questions .
