    "content": "Late last week , as the furor over the Inspector General report was raging , I devoted a fair amount of my radio show to arguing that Hillary Clinton should have been charged and prosecuted over her email scandal -- the DOJ 's handling of which was the subject of the IG 's findings . I 've already written extensively about Mrs. Clinton 's egregious misconduct , highlighting the reasons why it was n't just a series of stupid mistakes , and pushing back against unpersuasive arguments about the nature of her actions . It seems as though this same sticking point has also been bothering Harvard-trained attorney , former JAG officer , and former Cornell Law School lecturer David French , who made his case for prosecution at National Review Online on Friday . His indictment , rooted in personal experience and deep understanding of the relevant statutes , is compelling :\nAfter reading the analysis , I just flat-out don \u2019 t buy that Hillary \u2019 s conduct \u2014 and her senior team \u2019 s conduct \u2014 didn \u2019 t meet that standard . The key reason for my skepticism is the nature of the classified information sent and received . Remember , as Comey outlined in his infamous July 5 , 2016 statement , Hillary sent and received information that was classified at extraordinarily high levels ... If you \u2019 ve ever handled classified information , you understand that there are often judgment calls at the margins . When I was in Iraq , I often made the first call about classification . In other words , I determined whether to send information up the chain via the unclassified system ( NIPRNet ) or the classified system ( SIPRNet ) . Entire categories of information were deemed classified by default . Other categories were commonly unclassified . But sometimes , I had to make a choice . And sometimes , the choice wasn \u2019 t clear .\nThe lack of clarity , however , wasn \u2019 t between unclassified and Top Secret . Much less between unclassified and Top Secret/Special Access Program ( TS/SAP ) . There might be tough calls between unclassified and confidential \u2014 or maybe between unclassified and secret . But the gap between unclassified and Top Secret , much less SAP , was and is vast , yawning , and obvious . In fact , the IG noted that \u201c some witnesses expressed concern or surprise when they saw some of the classified content in unclassified emails. \u201d I bet they did ... It \u2019 s important to remember that one can \u2019 t generally simply copy/paste or forward emails from classified to unclassified systems . ( That \u2019 s likely why the emails on her homebrew system didn \u2019 t contain classified headers . ) A person has take information from one source and summarize it or painstakingly type it out on another platform . All of that takes effort . All of it requires intention .\n'Over-classification ' may be a real issue , but as French states , the problem here was not `` at the margins . '' Obviously and very highly classified material -- including about dealings with Iran and North Korea 's nuclear program -- were sent and received through Hillary 's bootleg server , to the point that some witnesses were shocked to learn about the type content that was recklessly compromised . As for his point about the effort and intent that 's required to move classified information from a classified system into an unclassified one , that was illustrated in stark relief by Hillary 's own virtual paper trail in at least one case , in which she ordered a subordinate to strip the 'identifying heading ' from a classified memo and send it over regular email , `` nonsecure . '' Hillary repeatedly claimed that none of the emails on her server were classified ( a laughable lie ) , then switched to saying none were classified at the time they were disseminated ( also a lie ) . Desperate , she then turned to arguing that none were marked classified at the time they were disseminated .\nThis distinction is irrelevant , a misleading tautology , and also a lie . It 's irrelevant because she signed a binding nondisclosure agreement , under penalty of perjury , that it was her duty to recognize and safeguard classified information , explicitly marked and unmarked as such . Go back and read French 's argument about why the top secret and Special Access Program content was unambiguously classified . She knew better . It 's a misleading tautology because in any cases , in order for emails to be marked as classified , they would have to go through a review process . In the vast majority of instances involving her home-brew server , emails were never reviewed ( and therefore never marked ) because the official system was bypassed ; that was the whole point . It is also a lie because in at least two instances , there were classified markings on the messages . Hillary told investigators that she did n't know what they meant . They did n't believe her because her explanation was insultingly absurd . But they could n't definitively prove that she was lying . I repeat : All of this required intent and constituted extreme recklessness that rose to the level of gross negligence .\nFrench also writes , `` the IG time and again noted that ( among other things ) the FBI focused on the apparent lack of intent to violate the law and the lack of a clear precedent for initiating a prosecution under similar facts . It also describes how the FBI wrestled with the definition of 'gross negligence ' \u2014 concluding that the term encompassed conduct 'so gross as to almost suggest deliberate intention ' or 'something that falls just short of being willful . ' '' Even though the portion of the Espionage Act that applied to Hillary 's actions does not call for proof of intent to merit charges , that was the standard Comey decided to consider ( and defensibly so , according to the IG ) . I 'd therefore like to close with three more observations about Mrs. Clinton 's demonstrable intent :\n( 1 ) The initial act of going through the hassle and process of establishing a private , off-book email server practically screams intent . Clinton 's motivation was very likely to work around official channels in order to exert full control over the flow of information ( even while making it much easier for hostile actors to penetrate ) vis-a-vis public records requests . She was planning on running for president again , and wanted to be able to use email in such a way that was convenient for her , but impervious to oversight . If and when she needed inconvenient emails do disappear , she controlled the server on which they were housed , and she could destroy them as needed . She ended up doing precisely that , too , deleting thousands of emails -- many of which were never recovered . She lied about whether any of them were work-related ( a large number were , and at least three were classified ) . She also lied about why she installed the server in the first place . Her provable lies purporting to explain her actions further legitimize the more cynical explanations and point to intent .\n( 2 ) Within three weeks of the existence of Clinton 's rules-breaking , unsecure server being publicly exposed , an underling destroyed the contents of her inbox and used a digital tool called BleachBit to permanently wipe the server clean . He later told FBI agents that this was precipitated by an `` oh sh * t '' moment . Again , Clinton proceeded to lie about the nature of those deleted emails . This is the destruction of evidence , followed by lying about what had been destroyed . Short of a video recording of Mrs. Clinton stating , `` I intend to handle classified material in a grossly negligent manner , '' what more is needed to divine intent ?\n( 3 ) All the lying matters . As Trey Gowdy so skillfully demonstrated in his grilling of Director Comey under oath , prosecutors often use `` false exculpatory statements '' -- i.e . lies -- to prove criminal intent . It 's arguably true that Mrs. Clinton may not have verifiably lied to the feds ( though she was almost certainly misleading in some answers , and FBI agents believed that she 'd lied to them ) . But it 's unquestionably true that she lied , routinely and brazenly , to the American people about these matters . When you add the reams of false exculpatory statements on top of Clinton 's willful act of commission ( ordering the server be installed ) , and the deliberate , frantic destruction of important evidence that could have shed further light on the extent of her recklessness , the `` intent '' picture looks quite clear . James Comey gave Hillary the ultimate gift by declining to recommend charges , despite his subsequent actions and decisions that harmed her campaign .",
