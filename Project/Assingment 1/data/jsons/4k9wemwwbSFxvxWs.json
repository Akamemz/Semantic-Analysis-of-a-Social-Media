    "content": "In a surprise moment at the end of his Dallas rally on the eve of Super Tuesday , former Vice President Joe Biden called former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke up to the stage -- and vowed to put O'Rourke , who has said the government should forcibly seize assault rifles from Americans , in charge of gun-control efforts .\nAlso at the rally , Biden accepted the endorsements of onetime rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar , as the Democratic party 's moderate wing rallied behind Biden to challenge anti-establishment frontrunner and self-described `` democratic socialist '' Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt .\n`` Ladies and gentlemen , tomorrow , March 3 , 2020 , I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden , '' O'Rourke announced to applause at the rally 's conclusion .\nO'Rourke called President Trump an `` existential threat '' to `` free and fair elections , '' and urged rallygoers to view Biden as the `` antithesis of Donald Trump , '' someone who is `` decent , kind , caring , and empathetic . ''\nBiden , taking the microphone after O'Rourke spoke , then announced , `` I want to make something clear -- I 'm gon na guarantee you , this is not the last you 're seeing of this guy -- you 're gon na take care of the gun problem with me , you 're gon na be the one who leads this effort . I 'm counting on you , I 'm counting on you , we need you badly . ''\nO'Rourke has previously said he would like to seize all Americans ' AR-15 assault rifles , promising : `` Hell , yes , we 're going to take your AR-15 , your AK-47 , '' at a Democratic primary debate last year , shortly before his campaign collapsed .\n`` Joe Biden promises Beto O'Rourke , who pushed for gun confiscation for legal gun owners , will 'be the one who leads ' his gun control effort , '' observed GOP Rapid Response Director Steve Guest . `` 2020 Democrats are unambiguous about their anti-Second Amendment agenda . ''\nWrote NBC News ' Benjy Sarlin : `` Biden hugging Beto going 'You \u2019 re going to take care of the gun problem for me ! ' is a thing you will see in a Republican ad someday . ''\nThe moment was yet another headache for Biden as he struggles to appeal to gun owners . Last week , he bizarrely declared that `` 150 million '' Americans -- approximately half the country -- had died due to gun violence since 2007 .\nSeparately , Biden spent most of his time attacking President Trump , rather than his remaining rivals Elizabeth Warren , Sanders and Mike Bloomberg .\nAfter Sen. Klobuchar , D-Minn. , spoke earlier in the rally , Biden immediately sought to draw a contrast between her and Trump , saying the White House entirely lacks `` empathy and decency . ''\n`` Folks , I knew -- I believed that he was n't going to be a very good president , '' Biden said . `` But I have to admit to you that Donald Trump , well , I did n't have any idea how much it was always going to be about Donald Trump . It 's having a corrosive impact . It 's having a corrosive impact on our children . ''\nBiden continued : `` The days of Donald Trump 's divisiveness will soon be over . Folks , there 's two ways people get inspired . They get inspired by great leaders like Lincoln and Roosevelt and Kennedy and Obama , but they also get inspired by very bad leaders . No , I really mean it . This president has sort of ripped the band-aid off , exposed just how venal he 's become , and how he has literally strangled the life out of the Republican Party . ''\n`` You 're gon na take care of the gun problem with me . '' \u2014 Joe Biden to Beto O'Rourke\nAt the same time , in Minnesota , Sanders and top surrogate Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar were rallying a boisterous crowd at a competing rally . Within hours , 14 states and one U.S. territory will head to the polls in contests that will award a whopping one-third of total delegates to the Democratic National Convention .\n`` It looks like St. Paul is ready for a political revolution , '' Sanders said to cheers .\nAt the rally in delegate-rich Texas , however , Biden and his new supporters argued that most voters want `` evolution '' and not a drastic change . Buoyed by his emphatic victory in Saturday 's South Carolina primary , Biden has argued he 's the only candidate who can realistically win over minority support and defeat Trump .\nKlobuchar , who formally suspended her campaign earlier Monday , declared that Biden was the only sensible choice for voters who feel `` tired of the noise and the nonsense '' of today 's politics .\n`` How great is it to be here in Dallas , Texas ? '' Klobuchar asked . `` And how great it is to be here with my family . ... And with Vice President Biden ! And how wonderful it is to be standing next to him on a stage when it is n't the debate stage ? '' ( Biden later joked that Klobuchar had `` won all the debates . '' )\nIt 's time , Klobuchar said , for Americans to `` join hands instead of pointing fingers . ''\n`` We need to unite our party and our country , and to do it not just with our words but with our actions , '' Klobuchar continued . `` It is up to us , all of us , to put our country back together , to heal this country , and then to build something even greater . I believe we can do this together . And that is why , today , I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president . ''\nKlobuchar and Biden then hugged as cheers of `` Let 's go , Joe ! '' broke out . Later , Klobuchar noted that Minnesota was also voting on Tuesday , and urged voters there to support Biden as well , amid concerns that her sudden withdrawal might actually help Sanders win the state .\nBiden went on to thank Buttigieg for his endorsement earlier in the day as well . Speaking to supporters , Biden said Pete reminded him of his late son Beau during the debates -- a compliment Biden then falsely said he had not made before about any other politician .\n`` I \u2019 m looking for a leader , I \u2019 m looking for a president , who will draw out what \u2019 s best in each of us , \u201d Buttigieg , who ended his campaign Sunday , told reporters prior to the rally . \u201c We have found that leader in vice president , soon-to-be president , Joe Biden . \u201d\nBYRON YORK : WHY BUTTIGIEG , KLOBUCHAR VOTERS MIGHT NOT BACK BIDEN\nIn Minnesota , Sanders praised both Buttigieg and Klobuchar even as the two were in Texas to boost Biden .\n`` Tonight , I want to open the door to Amy 's supporters , to Pete 's supporters , '' he said . `` I know there are political differences , but I also know that virtually all of Amy 's supporters and Pete 's supporters understand that we 've got to move toward a government that believes in justice , not greed . ''\n`` I \u2019 ve known Amy for a very long time , and she is one of the hardest workers I know , '' Sanders said of Klobuchar before going on to call Buttigieg 's campaign `` historic '' and `` brave , '' noting that Buttigieg would have been the first openly gay president .\nBiden currently trails Sanders by just eight pledged delegates ( 56 to 48 ) in the race to get the 1,991 necessary to secure the Democratic party 's nomination at this summer 's convention in Milwaukee . Party leaders had feared that the splintering moderate vote would allow Sanders to rack up victories in a series of high-stakes Super Tuesday contests and possibly gain an insurmountable advantage in the delegate count .\nHowever , former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has resisted calls to clear the path for Biden , predicting Monday that Democrats would have a contested convention .\n`` The most likely scenario for the Democratic Party is no one has a majority -- it goes to a convention where there 's horse-trading ; there 's compromise , '' Bloomberg said at a Fox News town hall in Manassas , Va. , one of the states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday . `` It does n't even have to be the leading candidate ; it could be the one with a smaller number of delegates . ''\nDespite his endorsements and win by a massive margin in South Carolina 's primary on Saturday , Biden remains vulnerable on a variety of fronts , including his repeated gaffes . On Monday , he slipped up twice during an earlier rally -- at one point , badly garbling the Declaration of Independence before giving up , and at another , saying `` Super Thursday '' was coming up .\nAnd , although the Biden campaign reported back-to-back days of $ 5 million fundraising hauls following his South Carolina win , the former vice president has struggled to raise money more broadly .\nIn Silicon Valley , which dominated by the tech sector , many wealthy donors prioritize executing a data-driven plan -- and Biden \u2019 s rocky campaign pushed many toward Buttigieg or Bloomberg in recent months , financiers say .\nBiden 's team is waging a quiet campaign to win them over , yet many are taking a wait-and-see approach .\nAt Monday 's gaffe-riddled rally , Biden notably did n't take any shots at Bloomberg and instead aimed his barbs at Sanders -- in an apparent sign that Bloomberg is n't viewed as a significant threat .\nFor his part , as midnight approached , Trump weighed in on Twitter to make clear he felt Biden 's misstatements were very much a liability .\n`` WOW ! '' Trump wrote . `` Sleepy Joe doesn \u2019 t know where he is , or what he \u2019 s doing . Honestly , I don \u2019 t think he even knows what office he 's running for ! ''",
