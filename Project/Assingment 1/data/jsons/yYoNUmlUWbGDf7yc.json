    "content": "The Trump administration slapped sanctions on two dozen Russian individuals and spy agencies Thursday , officially blaming them for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , as the U.S. government joined its top European allies in blaming the Kremlin for a nerve gas assassination attempt on a former Russian spy in Britain this month .\nAmong those targeted for the sanctions were 13 Russian nationals and three organizations already indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation . They included Yevgeny Prigozhin , an oligarch known as Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2019 s \u201c chef . \u201d\nThe poisoning of the former Russian double agent and his daughter is the first chemical weapons attack in Europe since World War II , the U.S. and its allies said , accusing Moscow of violating international laws . The Kremlin has denied any role in the attack and vowed to retaliate after British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats , the biggest such move by the government since the end of the Cold War .\nBut President Trump , acting on sanctioning powers granted by Congress months ago , was more muted in his criticism of the regime in Moscow and again avoided rebuking Mr. Putin personally .\nAsked if Mr. Putin was behind the nerve gas attack on Russian defector Sergei Skripal , Mr. Trump replied , \u201c It looks like it . \u201d\n\u201c A very sad situation \u2014 it certainly looks like the Russians were behind it , \u201d Mr. Trump told reporters during an Oval Office event with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in advance of St. Patrick \u2019 s Day . \u201c Something that should never , ever happen . We \u2019 re taking it very seriously , as I think are many others . \u201d\nMr. Trump didn \u2019 t mention the sanctions or Russian meddling in the election , an issue that has been a sore point for the president since Democrats used it to try to question the legitimacy of his White House win . The president \u2019 s continued reluctance to call out Mr. Putin has raised eyebrows among Mr. Trump \u2019 s political foes and allies in Washington .\nBritish officials have been far more blunt in criticizing Russia , even as the U.S. , France and Germany signed on to a letter saying there was \u201c no plausible alternative explanation \u201d to the nerve gas attack and calling it an assault on British sovereignty .\nThe Russian government \u201c should go away and shut up , \u201d British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson told reporters .\nThe Russians hit with U.S. sanctions were involved in election meddling and cyberattacks , including what Treasury Department and national security officials said were attacks on the U.S. energy grid , aviation system and infrastructure . It was the first time the administration fingered Russia for cyberattacks that began at least two years ago .\nTreasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said the sanctions were part of a \u201c broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia . \u201d\n\u201c The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyber activity , including their attempted interference in U.S. elections , destructive cyber-attacks , and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure , \u201d he said in a statement .\n\u201c We have already started working on our reciprocal measures , \u201d said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov . He didn \u2019 t elaborate on what response to expect .\nMoscow has denied involvement in the poisoning , and Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied \u2014 including directly to Mr. Trump last year \u2014 that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election .\nThe sanctions target the Russian spy agency FSB and Russia \u2019 s military intelligence agency GRU , as well as the Internet Research Agency , which Mr. Mueller has signaled was behind much of the cybermeddling in the presidential election .\nTreasury officials blamed the GRU and the Russian military for trying to interfere in the U.S. vote and for launching the \u201c NotPetya \u201d ransomware attack that wreaked havoc last year across the U.S. , Europe and Asia .\nHouse Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Edward R. Royce applauded the sanctions and said more needs to be done .\n\u201c Russian cyberactors have been weaponizing information and targeting critical U.S. infrastructure undeterred for years , \u201d said the California Republican . \u201c As our midterm elections approach , we must send a clear message that attacks on our political process will not be tolerated . \u201d\nDemocrats slammed the sanctions for being too little , too late .\n\u201c OK , it took 14 months , multiple indictments , and a poisoning in Britain \u2026 but \u2026 finally . Now we must protect our elections going forward , \u201d tweeted Sen. Amy Klobuchar , Minnesota Democrat .\nRep. Adam B.
