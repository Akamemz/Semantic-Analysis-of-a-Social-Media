    "content": "Some of the biggest donors on the left plan to meet behind closed doors next week in Washington with leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement and their allies to discuss funding the burgeoning protest movement , \u2588\u2588\u2588 has learned .\nThe meetings are taking place at the annual winter gathering of the Democracy Alliance major liberal donor club , which runs from Tuesday evening through Saturday morning and is expected to draw Democratic financial heavyweights , including Tom Steyer and Paul Egerman .\nThe DA , as the club is known in Democratic circles , is recommending its donors step up check writing to a handful of endorsed groups that have supported the Black Lives Matter movement . And the club and some of its members also are considering ways to funnel support directly to scrappier local groups that have utilized confrontational tactics to inject their grievances into the political debate .\nIt \u2019 s a potential partnership that could elevate the Black Lives Matter movement and heighten its impact . But it \u2019 s also fraught with tension on both sides , sources tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe various outfits that comprise the diffuse Black Lives Matter movement prize their independence . Some make a point of not asking for donations . They bristle at any suggestion that they \u2019 re susceptible to being co-opted by a deep-pocketed national group \u2015 let alone one with such close ties to the Democratic Party establishment like the Democracy Alliance .\nAnd some major liberal donors are leery about funding a movement known for aggressive tactics \u2015 particularly one that has shown a willingness to train its fire on Democrats , including presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders .\n\u201c Major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression , \u201d said Steve Phillips , a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes . He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson , Missouri , over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown . And Phillips and his wife , Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler , are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement .\nThe movement needs cash to build a self-sustaining infrastructure , Phillips said , arguing \u201c the progressive donor world should be adding zeroes to their contributions that support this transformative movement. \u201d But he also acknowledged there \u2019 s a risk for recipient groups . \u201c Tactics such as shutting down freeways and disrupting rallies can alienate major donors , and if that 's your primary source of support , then you 're at risk of being blocked from doing what you need to do . \u201d\nThe Democracy Alliance was created in 2005 by a handful of major donors , including billionaire financier George Soros and Taco Bell heir Rob McKay to build a permanent infrastructure to advance liberal ideas and causes . Donors are required to donate at least $ 200,000 a year to recommended groups , and their combined donations to those groups now total more than $ 500 million . Endorsed beneficiaries include the Center for American Progress think tank , the liberal attack dog Media Matters and the Democratic data firm Catalist , though members also give heavily to Democratic politicians and super PACs that are not part of the DA \u2019 s core portfolio . While the Democracy Alliance last year voted to endorse a handful of groups focused on engaging African-Americans in politics \u2015 some of which have helped facilitate the Black Lives movement \u2015 the invitation to movement leaders is a first for the DA , and seems likely to test some members \u2019 comfort zones .\n\u201c Movements that are challenging the status quo and that do so to some extent by using direct action or disruptive tactics are meant to make people uncomfortable , so I \u2019 m sure we have partners who would be made uncomfortable by it or think that that \u2019 s not a good tactic , \u201d said DA President Gara LaMarche . \u201c But we have a wide range of human beings and different temperaments and approaches in the DA , so it \u2019 s quite possible that there are people who are a little concerned , as well as people who are curious or are supportive . This is a chance for them to meet some of the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement , and understand the movement better , and then we \u2019 ll take stock of that and see where it might lead . \u201d\nAccording to a Democracy Alliance draft agenda obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , movement leaders will be featured guests at a Tuesday dinner with major donors . The dinner , which technically precedes the official conference kickoff , will focus on \u201c what kind of support and resources are needed from the allied funders during this critical moment of immediate struggle and long-term movement building . \u201d\nThe groups that will be represented include the Black Youth Project 100 , The Center for Popular Democracy and the Black Civic Engagement Fund , according to the organizer , a DA member named Leah Hunt-Hendrix . An heir to a Texas oil fortune , Hunt-Hendrix helps lead a coalition of mostly young donors called Solidaire that focuses on movement building . It \u2019 s donated more than $ 200,000 to the Black Lives Matter movement since Brown \u2019 s killing . According to its entry on a philanthropy website , more than $ 61,000 went directly to organizers and organizations on the ground in Ferguson and Baltimore , where the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in April sparked a more recent wave of Black Lives-related protests .
