John McCain (Ariz) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.).and Rubio hold the keys to Tillerson\u2019s confirmation. McCain said in an interview this week that he still has \u201cconcerns\u201d about Tillerson. If those hawks aren\u2019t convinced that the oil executive is appropriately cool to Putin and Russia as secretary of state, it would signal deeper problems for Tillerson\u2019s fate.\n\nTillerson has done at least three mock confirmation hearings -- called \u201cmurder boards\u201d -- and the people running them are confident he can answer difficult questions.

But if Tillerson makes a misstep, particularly on Russia, it could undermine his support within the Republican Party.\n\nHow Democrats deal with Tillerson\n\nInterviews with several Democrats indicate their cross-examination will center on how the man who helmed the massive energy conglomerate for a decade can change course to focus solely on the interests of the United States. Expect lots of questions about how Tillerson can avoid conflicts of interest related to ExxonMobil, which operates in dozens of countries around the world.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the CEO of ExxonMobil your responsibility is to shareholders.
