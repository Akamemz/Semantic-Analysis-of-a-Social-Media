    "content": "A Dad , A Daughter , A Disappearing Act : Love And Mourning On Father 's Day\nThe first time he did so was right after my teenage mother told him she was pregnant with me .\nOver the next few years , he would suddenly reappear and disappear . It was never in person , but through telephone calls and letters across the ocean from his home in Trinidad and Tobago to mine in Barbados . His `` here today , gone tomorrow '' routine made for a rocky relationship between us ; my mother , Victoria , raised me as a single parent .\nIt would take almost a quarter-century before we met in person .\nAfter that , my dad and I eventually ( and somewhat miraculously ) built not just a parent-child relationship , but also a very dear friendship . We evolved from hostile father-daughter interactions to a father who doted on his first-born and a daughter whose heart danced upon hearing her father 's sweet singsong Trinidadian accent .\nIt seemed as if my dad had retired as a magician \u2014 no longer pulling disappearing stunts . For almost a decade , he was a constant in my life , and albeit late , I came to know and love what it felt like to have both a mother and a father .\nBut another decade has now passed \u2014 and today marks the 10th Father 's Day since my father again disappeared for what may have been the final time , as I fear he might be dead .\nI never called my father `` Daddy '' or `` Dad . '' He was simply Lee , short for Leonard . It was weird to address him as anything else , even after we had formed a close bond .\nI met Lee the year I turned 23 . It was a year of many firsts : my first trip to Trinidad ; first time participating in that nation 's renowned carnival and first time traveling with friends to another country to watch our wonderful West Indies cricket team play .\nIt was the latter that paved the way to meeting my father for the first time . That moment is one of the most emotional of my life . But it was initiated by neither my father nor me .\nAt the time , my friend and now late West Indies ' cricket legend , Malcolm Marshall , was the team 's coach . `` Maco , '' as he was affectionately known , knew my story and had long encouraged me to meet my father . Knowing I would be in Trinidad that weekend , Maco contacted my father and invited him to the hotel where the team was staying .\nOn the morning of the cricket match , en route to Queen 's Park Oval , I stopped by the hotel to collect my tickets from Maco . And standing with him was a man \u2014 unknown to me , yet familiar-looking \u2014 and an adorable boy of about 7 or 8 years old . The man began to walk in my direction . And I began to tremble .\nAs Maco uttered the words `` this is your father , '' the stranger grabbed and held me tightly , breaking down in tears . I , too , started to cry , as did the little boy \u2013 his youngest son and my half brother Lyndon .\n`` My daughter , Maquita , '' were the first words Lee said to me . `` I am so sorry . ''\nWhen my father and I regained our composure , Maco sat us down . He advised me to forgive and pleaded with my father to take his role seriously . He then gave us the tickets to go off and enjoy the cricket match together .\nLee was an amicable man , a charmer and social butterfly . I lost count of all the people who walked up to him and in the rawest of Trinidadian accents , asked : `` Lee , is how she look like you so , uh dat yuh daughtah ? '' He was ever at my beck and call , bringing drinks and food , repeatedly checking to see if I was doing OK .\nThat day , I felt proud to be called his daughter .\nA couple of years later , I moved to Trinidad to work as a freelance reporter . My father insisted that I come live with him and Rosie , his wife of about 20 years .\nI walked into their living room \u2014 and froze . There , on the wall were framed photos of me through the years . He often did n't respond to my letters \u2014 but had saved and displayed all the photos I had sent .\nWhen Rosie showed me my room , I was in awe again . They knew I loved teddy bears and had adorned my bed with them . To protect me from the vicious Trinidadian mosquitoes , they had secured netting over my bed . They bought groceries to prepare my favorite meals , and Rosie , knowing I loved to cook , even taught me to prepare several local dishes . My father took me to his favorite entertainment event \u2013 Panorama , a steel band competition and vital part of Trinidad 's Carnival .\nBut it was n't always a party with Lee and me . In fact , many of our early interactions when I first moved into his home ended up in disagreements . I was already set in my ways as a 20-something who had been living on her own in Barbados . I was not open to being told by a father who did n't raise me how long to stay on the phone , when to go out and with whom , or what time to come home from partying . And Lee seemingly could n't come to terms with the fact that I was an adult and not a little girl .\nPlus , I resented him for deserting my mother and me . One day , I asked him why .\n`` I do n't know , '' he said . `` I do n't have an answer . ''\nThis only made me angrier . After all those years , that was the best he could offer ?\nIt would take some intervention from my mother \u2014 who gave Lee pointers on how to relate to me and encouraged me to forgive him \u2014 for Lee and I to finally get along .\nWhen I eventually went back to Barbados for work , Lee and I kept in weekly phone contact . One day , in the early 2000s , Rosie called to say that Lee had been rushed to the hospital and was in critical condition . I immediately flew to Trinidad . Unbeknownst to him , Lee was a diabetic and had gone into a diabetic coma . Luckily , he received treatment in time , which saved his life .\nRosie helped nurse Lee back to health , changing his diet and keeping his blood sugar under control . Because of his diabetes and the fact that I had come so close to losing him , I made sure to stay in contact when I went to New York in 2005 to further my studies .\nLee and I talked several times a month , and like a true dad , he was always concerned about whether I had enough money for tuition , rent or groceries . From time to time , either he or Rosie would call to say , `` Go to Western Union , uh send something fuh yuh . ''\nLee and I never missed each other 's birthday or any other special occasion . He once said , `` I know if only one of my four children calls me , it would be you . ''\nSo when I tried without success to reach him for his birthday on Nov. 30 , 2008 , I knew something was wrong . Lee never answered or returned my calls . A month later , at Christmas , I still could not reach him .\nI was especially worried because of some events earlier in the year . Rosie had died suddenly in April after suffering a heart attack , and Lee had been depressed when he had called with the tragic news . Then , at the start of summer , he called to deliver another equally sad message ; his mother , my grandmother , had also suddenly taken ill and died . While I did n't think he was the type to be so deeply drenched in grief to take his own life , I was concerned that both deaths were unbearable for him .\nIn January 2009 , after countless efforts to get some word on Lee , I got a call from an employee at Trinidad 's Ministry of Sport and Youth Affairs in Port-of-Spain , where Lee had worked for several years . She informed me that he had been missing from work since early December and that searches by colleagues yielded nothing . My brother Lyndon said our Aunt Jean had filed a missing person report , but the police also came up empty-handed . My brothers Lyndon , Glen and other relatives and friends combed the St. Augustine area where Lee last resided \u2014 with no success .\nLee 's passport , identification card , important documents and all his clothing were found at his home not far from the University of the West Indies . None of his friends had heard from or seen him in months . When anyone called , his cellphone would ring and ring . For at least three years after his disappearance , I would call Lee 's phone and it would still ring .\nI 've endured endless sleepless nights . I 've cried my eyes dry . I 've exhausted all possibilities for help on the matter . Every day , I pray for an answer . Just these past few weeks , I tried again with my search , reaching out to a former Columbia University classmate , a journalist in Trinidad .
