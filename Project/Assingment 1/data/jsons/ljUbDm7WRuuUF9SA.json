Obama plans to increase limits on access to bulk telephone data , call for privacy safeguards for foreigners and propose the creation of a public advocate to represent privacy concerns at a secret intelligence court . \u201d\nThe contrast\u2014between the government \u2019 s vast surveillance powers and the meager limits it places on those powers\u2014got me thinking about the media , scandal and public opinion . It 's telling that the Times stories got little to no traction on cable yesterday .\nThere was a huge media uproar , of course , when Ed Snowden leaked his documents to the Guardian and the Washington Post . The sheer magnitude of the NSA \u2019 s snooping , from phone calls to emails and extending to all the major tech companies , was hard to absorb .\nBut a huge wave of public outrage never really materialized .
