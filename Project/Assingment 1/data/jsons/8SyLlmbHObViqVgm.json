I watch , I say , \u2018 That \u2019 s not the bill we \u2019 re passing . \u2019\nBut does Trump really know what \u2019 s in the bill he \u2019 s passing , or trying to pass ?\nWith the help of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Jacob Gardenswartz , I collected and read absolutely everything Donald Trump has said publicly about the AHCA . The transcripts cover speeches , rallies , meetings with congressional leaders , interviews with friendly news outlets , and , of course , tweets .\nI learned a few things from the exercise . First , Trump has a very limited set of talking points on health care , and he repeats the same words and sentences constantly \u2014 his comfort zone on both the issue and the legislation is very narrow .\nSecond , Trump seems confused about what the GOP bill does . It is possible , of course , that he knows more than he is saying , and has decided to simply say things that aren \u2019 t true . But it \u2019 s also possible he \u2019 s being spun by more ideologically motivated advisers ( that \u2019 s certainly the narrative pro-Trump outlets like Breitbart are pushing ) .\nThird , Trump has bought into a caricature of Obamacare \u2019 s condition that heavily informs his thinking on both the politics and the policy of the AHCA . This could prove more consequential than people realize .\nThe AHCA does literally none of the things Trump says it does\nOn March 8 , Trump laid out his case for the American Health Care Act . Here \u2019 s what he said :\nIt follows the guidelines I laid out in my congressional address : a plan that will lower costs , expand choices , increase competition , and ensure health care access for all Americans . This will be a plan where you can choose your doctor . This will be a plan where you can choose your plan .\nThese talking points are familiar enough that it \u2019 s easy to let them fade into the background . But it \u2019 s worth taking them seriously . This is Trump \u2019 s case for the bill he \u2019 s backing . Does he know that literally every single one of these points is wrong ?\nThe AHCA doesn \u2019 t lower costs . Apples to apples , the Brookings Institution estimates \u201c that premiums would be 13 % ( ~ $ 1,000 ) higher under the AHCA than under current law , holding plan generosity and the individual market age distribution fixed at their current law levels. \u201d To the extent that the AHCA sees lower premiums , it \u2019 s because older people can \u2019 t afford care and younger people buy sparer plans . That is no one \u2019 s idea of lowering costs .\nThe rest of the problems flow from there . Most people will have fewer affordable choices under the AHCA because their subsidies will be so much smaller ( and many people will have no affordable choice at all , and so will go uninsured ) . Competition is likely to fall as the marketplaces shrink \u2014 fewer consumers wielding smaller tax credits will not prove an attractive market to insurers .\nThe idea that the AHCA will \u201c ensure health care access for all Americans \u201d is sufficiently absurd that I \u2019 m not even going to spend time on it .\nBut the idea that it will let you choose your doctor and plan is more interesting \u2014 it seems entirely possible to me that Trump doesn \u2019 t realize the limited choices people complain about in Obamacare are the result of people being unable to afford more generous plans with broader networks , and it seems likely to me that he doesn \u2019 t know the AHCA will make that problem worse , or why conservative health reformers think that \u2019 s a good thing .\nYou all remember , you can keep your doctor , you can keep your plan . I know , Greg , you \u2019 ve never heard that , right ? But it was said many , many times , and it turned out to be not true . This is the time we \u2019 re going to get it done .\nThis is either an extremely foolish thing to say or it is the comment of a man who doesn \u2019 t realize that the plan he \u2019 s backing would , in a stroke , mean millions of people could no longer afford the subsidized insurance they were using , and would react with fury and surprise when they realize they were betrayed .\nThe absolute constant in Trump \u2019 s health care rhetoric is the idea that Obamacare is dead no matter what he does .\n\u201c Remember , folks , \u201d he said in Nashville , \u201c if we do n't do anything , Obamacare is gone . It 's not like , oh gee , it 's going to be wonderful in three years . It 's gone . It 's gone . It 's gone . Not working . It 's gone . \u201d\nHe went even further at a meeting of the Republican Study Committee :\n`` I also want people to know that Obamacare is dead . It \u2019 s a dead health care plan .

And only because everyone knows it \u2019 s on its last dying feet , the fake news is trying to say good things about it , okay . Fake media . And there is no good news about Obamacare . Obamacare is dead . And unless we gave it massive subsidies in a year from now , or six months from now , it \u2019 s not even going to be here .
