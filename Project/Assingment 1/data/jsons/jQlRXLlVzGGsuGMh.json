One year , I was even invited to join a panel , and I enjoyed jousting with attendees while playing the role of pi\u00f1ata at their party .\nThis month , Netroots Nation met in Philadelphia . The choice was no accident . Pennsylvania will probably be the key swing state in 2020 . Donald Trump won it by only 44,000 votes or seven-tenths of a percentage point . He lost the prosperous Philadelphia suburbs by more than Mitt Romney did in 2012 but more than made up for it with new support in \u201c left behind \u201d blue-collar areas such as Erie and Wilkes-Barre .\nYou \u2019 d think that this history would inform activists at Netroots Nation about the best strategy to follow in 2020 . Not really . Instead , Netroots events seemed to alternate between pandering presentations by presidential candidates and a bewildering array of \u201c intersectionality \u201d and identity-politics seminars .\nSenator Elizabeth Warren pledged that , if elected , she would immediately investigate crimes committed by border-control agents . Julian Castro , a former Obama-administration cabinet member , called for decriminalizing illegal border crossings . But everyone was topped by Washington governor Jay Inslee . \u201c My first act will be to ask Megan Rapinoe to be my secretary of State , \u201d he promised . Naming the woke , purple-haired star of the championship U.S. Women \u2019 s Soccer team , he said , would return \u201c love rather than hate \u201d to the center of America \u2019 s foreign policy .\nIt is true that a couple of panels tried to address how the Left could appeal to voters who cast their ballots for Barack Obama in 2012 but switched to Trump in 2016 . \u201c How \u2019 d we lose the working class ? Ask yourself , what did we do for them ? \u201d asked Rick Smith , a talk-show host who explores labor issues , adding :\nYou called them stupid . You marginalized them , took them for granted and you didn \u2019 t talk to them . For 20 years , the right wing has invested tremendous amounts of money in talk radio , in television , in every possible platform to be in their ears , before their eyes , and on their minds .
