And they \u2019 ve often imposed their choices on agencies , according to more than a dozen people inside and close to the administration .\nMany Cabinet nominees joined the administration believing they \u2019 d have wide latitude to pick lieutenants , but they \u2019 re beginning to realize Trump \u2019 s powerful advisers are looking over their shoulders . The White House \u2019 s approach has already slowed hiring \u2014 and the dozens of vacancies at key agencies could make it more difficult to implement some of Trump 's policy proposals .\nSo far , Trump has nominated fewer than three dozen of the 550 most important Senate-confirmed jobs , according to an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service , a nonprofit group that advised Trump officials during the presidential transition .\nTop officials at the Defense and Homeland Security departments have disagreed with White House aides over potential deputy hires and political appointees , administration and government officials say . Some candidates dropped out of the bid for national security adviser because Trump 's team appeared reluctant to let them pick their own people , sources say .\nA White House official said it was the Trump administration \u2019 s right to hire at agencies across the board . \u201c We won the election because people wanted us to run the government , \u201d this person said . `` We are putting our people in place to do that .
