For example , Iran would continue adding to its stockpile of low-enriched uranium , meaning uranium enriched to reactor grade , or less than 5 percent purity . But the United States maintains that under details of the agreement it can not yet disclose , the overall size of Iran \u2019 s stockpile would not increase .\nThe reason appears to be that Iran would agree to convert some of its medium-enriched uranium \u2014 fuel enriched to 20 percent purity , or near bomb grade \u2014 into an oxide form that is on the way to becoming reactor fuel .
