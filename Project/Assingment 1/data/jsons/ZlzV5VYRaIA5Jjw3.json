This is how they used to be . [ crickets ] Yeah , there actually weren \u2019 t any . So how did we get from here \u2014 [ crickets ] \u2014 to here ? We \u2019 ll start in 1937 with former Senator Hugo Black , who \u2019 s being congratulated . That \u2019 s because he \u2019 s just been confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice . He \u2019 s also been outed as a former member of the Ku Klux Klan . So to explain himself , he gets on the radio . \u201c I did join the Klan . I later resigned . I never rejoined. \u201d People are not happy . They \u2019 re basically asking : How could the Senate Judiciary Committee let this guy through ? Answer : Since the first hearing back in 1873 , for this guy , there were no standard ways of holding hearings for Supreme Court nominees . They didn \u2019 t have to go and testify , and the hearings didn \u2019 t need to be made public . The senators reviewed the nominees among themselves . But then came a couple of amendments to the Constitution . The upshot is they gave more voting power to the people . So the senators needed to start paying more attention to public opinion . And they \u2019 re paying attention when Black \u2019 s controversial confirmation drives Americans to ask : Why are these hearings private ? It \u2019 s a big reason why the next nominee to come along gets a public hearing . And it \u2019 s not just a public hearing , it \u2019 s the first that includes no-holds-barred questioning by the committee . Things are beginning to change . Then World War II comes , and goes . America is suddenly a superpower . Business booms , suburbs grow . \u201c The protest took the form of a boycott. \u201d And we see the beginning of the modern civil-rights era . In 1954 , the court rules to end racial segregation in schools . And this marks a point where we really start to see the court using its power to shape parts of American society . That means Americans take a greater interest in who is on the court . That means even more pressure on senators to vet these candidates . Starting with the first nominee after the Brown decision , almost every nominee will have a public hearing . Now change is in full swing . \u201c I Have a Dream , \u201d the march from Selma , \u201c The Feminine Mystique. \u201d The court keeps making controversial rulings on race discrimination , gender discrimination , personal privacy . That means more public interest , more pressure on senators , more issues to parse in the hearings . So the hearings get longer . But just wait . 1981 \u2014 game changer . \u201c Good evening . Sandra O \u2019 Connor \u2014 \u201d First woman nominated to the Supreme Court , first nomination hearing to be televised . The longer senators talk , the more TV time they get . The more TV time they get , the more they can posture for voters watching at home . [ senators talking ] So the more they talk . With the cameras rolling , we \u2019 ll see 10 out of the 12 longest hearings ever . One of those is for Robert Bork \u2014 \u201c With a negative recommendation of 9 to 5. \u201d \u2014 who famously doesn \u2019 t make the cut . Now onto the aughts . There \u2019 s an 11-year gap between nominees . Meanwhile , America has become more politically divided , so has the Senate . \u201c Over and over again \u2014 \u201d \u201c Wait just a second \u2014 \u201d \u201c How many times do we do this before \u2014 \u201d Here \u2019 s Chief Justice Roberts to explain what happened next . \u201c I mean , you look at two of my colleagues , Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg , for example . Maybe there were two or three dissenting votes between the two of them. \u201d Yep , three votes against Ginsburg in 1993 . No votes against Scalia in 1986 . \u201c Now you look at my more recent colleagues and the votes were , I think , strictly on party lines. \u201d That \u2019 s pretty much right . \u201c And that doesn \u2019 t make any sense. \u201d And that \u2019 s how we got here . \u201c I \u2019 m not looking to take us back to quill pens. \u201d Very long \u2014 \u201c Nah , I just asked you where you were at on Christmas. \u201d [ laughter ] Always very political \u2014 \u201c So your failure to answer questions is confounding me. \u201d \u2014 very public Supreme Court confirmation hearings . Also , something else to notice : Sometimes these nominees give pretty similar answers . \u201c The right to privacy is protected under the Constitution in various ways. \u201d \u201c And it protects the right to privacy in a number of ways. \u201d \u201c In various places in the Constitution. \u201d \u201c In a variety of places in the Constitution. \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s protected by the Fourth Amendment. \u201d \u201c The Fourth Amendment certainly speaks to the right of privacy. \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s founded in the Fourth Amendment. \u201d \u201c The first and most obvious place is the Fourth Amendment . \u201d",
