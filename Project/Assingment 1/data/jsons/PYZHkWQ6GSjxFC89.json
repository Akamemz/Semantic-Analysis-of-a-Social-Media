Campaigns are supposed to be hard fought , but statements like those made by Stephanie Cutter belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works . ''\nThe challenge capped a frenzied and nasty day on the campaign trail .\nEarlier , Romney released a new ad calling Obama dishonest and asking if the American people can `` trust him to lead '' if he `` does n't tell the truth . '' The release which accompanied the ad in an email to reporters also cited Obama 's `` lies and exaggerations . ''\nThe ad titled , `` No Evidence , '' was an aggressive rebuttal to Obama 's claims that Romney outsourced jobs while at the helm of Bain Capital .\n`` There was no evidence that Mitt Romney shipped jobs overseas , '' a narrator says in the ad .\nBut the Obama campaign pushed back in a statement charging the ad is part of Romney 's `` big Bain lie . ''\nRelying on the report in the Globe claiming government documents reveal Romney remained CEO of Bain for three years longer than he claimed , the Obama camp statement went on to say the ad is `` based on a false premise . ''\nIn a filing with the SEC in February 2001 , Bain Capital listed Romney as the company 's `` sole shareholder , sole director , chief executive officer and president .
