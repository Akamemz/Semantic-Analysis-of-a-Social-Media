    "content": "This week the Supreme Court unblocked most aspects of President Trump 's executive order limiting entry into the United States , signaling that the restrictions are likely to be upheld . That makes sense , because the reasons that two federal appeals court offered for upholding injunctions against Trump 's order are unpersuasive . But the fact that Trump 's policy is legal does not make it smart .\nThe original version of Trump 's order was issued in great haste a week after he took office , and it showed . The 90-day ban on entry by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries ( Iran , Iraq , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria , and Yemen ) applied to current visa holders , including people working and studying in the United States , and legal permanent residents , who were barred from returning home after traveling abroad .\nAdding to the confusion , the travel ban took effect immediately , stranding residents and visitors in mid-trip without notice . The result was dismay and disorder at airports around the world as officials , travelers , and lawyers grappled with the new policy .\nAfter the order was blocked by the courts , Trump issued a revised version on March 6 , clarifying that the travel ban did not apply to legal permanent residents , who have a right to due process when the government tries to prevent their re-entry , or to current visa holders , whose hosts may have standing to sue . Notably , the order issued by the Supreme Court on Monday says that while the case is pending the travel ban should not be enforced against visa applicants or would-be refugees with a `` bona fide relationship '' to Americans , such as relatives , students accepted by U.S. universities , employees hired by U.S. companies , or lecturers booked to speak here .\nThe revised order also eliminated Iraq from the list of targeted countries and excised language favoring religious minorities from the section imposing a 120-day moratorium on admission of refugees . Critics cited that preference as evidence that the order was motivated by anti-Muslim bias .\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit nevertheless concluded that the March 6 order `` in context drips with religious intolerance , animus , and discrimination . '' The context that the court deemed relevant consisted mostly of statements made by Trump or his surrogates before and after the election , including his support for `` a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States . ''\nBut that is not the policy Trump actually tried to implement , and relying on his campaign comments to conclude that his executive order is a `` Muslim ban '' in disguise leads to strange results . The plaintiffs conceded , for example , that if Hillary Clinton had been elected president and issued exactly the same executive order , it `` could be constitutional . ''\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit relied on a different rationale when it upheld an injunction against Trump 's order , saying he exceeded his statutory authority because he did not make an evidence-based determination that admitting the people he wants to exclude would be `` detrimental to the interests of the United States . '' But that was really just another way of saying that Trump 's policy , which is supposedly aimed at protecting Americans from terrorists , is half-baked and empirically unsound .\nThat much is true . Since 1975 , no terrorist from any of the countries covered by the travel ban has killed anyone in the United States , and the odds of being killed by a refugee are infinitesimal .\nIn any case , it has never been clear why a travel ban was necessary for Trump to deliver the `` extreme vetting '' he promised . Even the `` total and complete '' Muslim ban he originally proposed was supposed to last only as long as it took to `` figure out what is going on , '' which according to his executive orders means three months .\nTrump has been president for more than five months .
