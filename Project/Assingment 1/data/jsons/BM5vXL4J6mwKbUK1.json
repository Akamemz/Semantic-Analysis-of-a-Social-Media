There \u2019 s even one that shows him dead even with Clinton in the deep , deep-blue state of New Jersey . Isn \u2019 t that exactly the kind of candidate delegates would and should turn to if they become unbound after the first ballot ? Well , that \u2019 s his argument anyway .\nSorry , Gov .

As Trump \u2019 s supporters keep reminding us , Ronald Reagan was running anywhere from 18 to 23 points behind President Jimmy Carter in the spring of 1980 . One reason ex-President Gerald Ford flirted with entering the race\u2014apart from a grudge from 1976\u2014was that , as Time magazine noted at the time , \u201c Ford shares the fears of many Republicans that Reagan can not win if the Democrats re-nominate Jimmy Carter . \u201d\nEven if the numbers are sound , there \u2019 s a reason that they might spell out the wrong strategy for the campaign : `` Electability '' is n't the message that galvanizes a party base , and for good reason .\nIn 2000 , every survey showed that Sen. John McCain would run far better against Vice President Al Gore than did George W. Bush . Around the time of New Hampshire , McCain had an 8-point lead , while Bush and Gore ran even .\nBut McCain was a heretic . He opposed the mammoth tax cuts proposed by Bush and congressional Republicans , preferring to see some of the surplus\u2014yes , there was a surplus back then\u2014go toward reducing the debt .

Russ Feingold , the most liberal Democrat in the Senate , to write a bill banning most soft money from campaigns ( this was the law ultimately eviscerated by the Supreme Court ) .\nThat \u2019 s one of the reasons McCain won Republican voters only in New Hampshire and in his home state of Arizona . His margins elsewhere came from independents . For Republicans , he did not represent them as well as Bush did .\nAnd that goes to the heart of the issue .

Conservatives had expected that Eisenhower , as the first Republican president since 1932 , would repeal the New Deal ; instead he augmented and expanded programs like Social Security , thereby giving them bipartisan legitimacy . \u2026 He approved anti-recessionary stimulus spending , extended unemployment compensation , and raised the minimum wage . He pioneered federal aid to education and created the largest public-works program in history in the form of the interstate highway system . He levied gasoline taxes to pay for the highway construction , and believed that cutting income taxes when the federal government was running a deficit would be an act of gross fiscal irresponsibility . \u201d\nFrom that perspective , it \u2019 s unimaginable that today \u2019 s GOP , which is far more conservative than it was in Ike \u2019 s time , would turn to such an ideologically suspect candidate no matter how \u201c electable \u201d he or she was . In that sense , the GOP base shares the view expressed by ex-Sen. Jim DeMint when he said he \u2019 d rather have 30 strong conservatives than 50 centrist Republicans .

In June, he was running third behind President George H.W. Bush and\u2014in first place\u2014Texas businessman Ross Perot. (Note: Springtime polls often elevate independent candidates\u2014in 1980, John Anderson was running as high as 24 per cent against Carter and Reagan.) So there\u2019s reason for Republicans looking at Kasich to be skeptical about these numbers.\n\nEven if the numbers are sound, there\u2019s a reason that they might spell out the wrong strategy for the campaign: \"Electability\" isn't the message that galvanizes a party base, and for good reason.\n\nIn 2000, every survey showed that Sen.
