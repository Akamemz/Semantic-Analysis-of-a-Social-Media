This place exists today because of them . \u201d\nThe school \u2019 s experience is part of a national dialogue that includes a House subcommittee hearing today on a bill on \u201c reparations , \u201d a word that carries with it a wide range of definitions . Even among the Georgetown descendants , there \u2019 s no consensus about what form , if any , reparations or reconciliation should take .\nThis spring , students at Georgetown University in Washington voted in favor of having undergraduates pay a \u201c reconciliation contribution \u201d of $ 27.20 each semester . The funds would benefit descendants of people enslaved by Maryland Jesuits , including the GU272 \u2013 a group sold in 1838 to help keep Georgetown afloat .
