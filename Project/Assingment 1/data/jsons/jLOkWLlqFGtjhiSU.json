''\n`` I think ( the president 's ) hand would have been strengthened significantly if Congress would have given him the authority for a surgical strike to degrade ( Syria 's ) chemical weapons use and he look like a commander in chief , '' Rogers said , though he faulted the president for failing to adequately explain why an attack against Syria would be in the United States ' security interests .\n`` All of that confusion allowed Putin to step in and fill the void .

''\nOn Saturday , the U.S. and Russia reached a deal on a framework that would allow Syria to hand over control of its chemical weapons . The deal , however , does not include a threat of military force should Syria fail to follow through with giving up its stockpiles .\nThat 's a big mistake , Rogers told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley .\n`` Not one ounce of chemical weapons came off the battlefield , but we 've given up every ounce of our leverage when it comes to trying to solve the broader Syrian problem , because we 've taken away a credible military threat , '' he said .\nRogers warned the `` indecisiveness '' of the Obama administration in the past few weeks `` gave the diplomatic advantage '' to Russian President Vladimir Putin .\n`` They saw it .
