Devens , Mass. , U.S . Marshals Service spokesman Drew Wade said .\nThe FMC Devens is a federal prisons facility for male inmates who require specialized or long-term medical or mental health care , according to the facility 's website .\nThe move comes a day after New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg revealed the suspects had Times Square in their sights before law enforcement authorities put an end to their bloody terror spree .\n`` New York was next on their list of targets , '' Bloomberg said of Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan. \u201c The fact is , New York City remains a prime target for those who hate America and want to kill Americans . \u201d\nPolice Commissioner Ray Kelly said the brothers , Muslims from Dagestan , a breakaway republic in Russia , hatched their plot to attack Times Square while driving the streets of Cambridge last Thursday in a Mercedes SUV they had carjacked from a man who later escaped .\nKelly called the New York plot `` spontaneous , '' and said they had six bombs with them in the car , some of which they hurled at police cars hours later when they were being pursued in a chase that culminated in Tamerlan Tsarnaev 's death .\nOne of the bombs the brothers had in the stolen car was a pressure cooker bomb , identical to one used in the marathon attack , and packed with gunpowder and shrapnel , Kelly said . Both Kelly and Bloomberg noted surveillance cameras , a contentious subject in New York , played a key role in solving the bombing in Boston , Bloomberg 's hometown . Still , the mayor said there was no way of knowing if the brothers could have pulled off a second attack in America 's largest city .\n`` We don \u2019 t know if we would have been able to stop the terrorists had they arrived here from Boston , '' Bloomberg said . He said he did not know of a specific target within Times Square .\nTimes Square was targeted by Muslim terrorist Faisal Shahzad in a failed 2010 plot . Kelly said at least one Tsarnaev brother was photographed in Times Square last year , first on April 18 and then later on an unspecified day in November .\nKelly said the plot was revealed in a bedside interrogation of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev while he was in the hospital earlier this week . Kelly said Tsarnaev told investigators during his first interrogation that they were headed to New York City to `` party . '' Subsequent questioning , however , revealed that the two brothers decided spontaneously that they would travel to Manhattan to detonate their remaining explosives , Kelly said .\nThe 19-year-old suspect spoke to FBI agents intermittently over a 16-hour period before a federal judge showed up at the hospital and read him his Miranda rights , after which he clammed up , according to law enforcement sources . But another senior law enforcement official , speaking to FoxNews.com , characterized the brothers ' plans to go to New York as `` aspirational , at best . ''\n`` I would n't say 'plot , ' it was just talk , '' the source said .\nThe brothers are suspected of setting two bombs at the finish line of the race April 15 .
