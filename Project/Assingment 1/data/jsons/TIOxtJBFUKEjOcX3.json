In an indication of the national stakes , that push is largely funded by a $ 20,000 contribution from a national progressive group called America Votes . The Morse campaign said the donation came through the group 's local Colorado office .\nThe recall group 's main funding comes from a $ 14,000 contribution from a nonprofit run by a local conservative consultant , Laura Carno .

'' ' Carno said . `` This is n't what Colorado stands for . ''\nIn an interview , Morse seemed resigned to facing a recall vote after signatures are verified . He believes national gun-rights supporters are using his district to make a national statement about the political peril officials face if they take on gun control .\n`` That 's what 's going on here . They want to take out the Senate president , '' Morse said .\nThe organizer of the Morse recall effort , Anthony Garcia , did n't disagree . Garcia does n't live in Morse 's district but in the northern Colorado town of Brighton . Garcia said Morse was targeted not just because of his votes for gun control but because he 's a prominent Democrat from a competitive district .\n`` It 's as much about saying Colorado is angry as it is about getting one guy out , '' Garcia said . `` Legislators need to know when citizens are outraged that they ca n't ignore the people . ''\nImmediate accountability seems to be a common thread in recall attempts , said Joshua Spivak , who tracks recall elections nationwide at the Hugh L. Carey Institute for Government Reform at Wagner College in New York . Technology makes it easier to organize , Spivak said , and modern-day voters watching political activity in real time on Twitter and TV are n't content to wait until another election to show their displeasure when they feel ignored .\nSpivak said at least 169 officials at all levels of government faced recalls last year , up from 151 the year before . The number this year could go even higher , he said .\nMost recalls actually fail , as in the case last year of Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker , a Republican who survived a recall election after attacking collective bargaining rights for state employees . But compared with re-election campaigns , when incumbents face up to 75 percent likelihood of winning , Spivak said recall elections have a much lower rate of success for incumbents .\nIn Colorado last year , seven recall efforts made it to ballots , all local races , Spivak said . Of those seven , two officials were ousted and two more resigned .\nNationwide , 108 recalled officials last year lost or left office after a recall . That makes the recall a powerful tool -- and one likely to be used more often , Spivak said .\nBack in Colorado Springs , a couple of Morse opponents defended the recall attempt as the best way for citizens to keep their representatives accountable .\n`` I believe in gun rights . And he did n't listen . He 's supposed to represent the people , and when he does n't do that , what are supposed to do ? Nothing ? '' asked Bianca McCarl , a 40-year-old merchandiser who is supporting Morse 's recall .\nAssuming the Morse recall goes to ballots , with an election to be held by late summer , the incumbent holds a slight party registration advantage in the district . He believes most voters liked his gun votes .\nHe 's counting on the support from voters like Joan Muir , a retiree who placed a pro-Morse sticker on her car bumper after seeing other cars carrying messages calling for his ouster . In an interview , Muir said she was dismayed by the recall campaign .\n`` I live here .
