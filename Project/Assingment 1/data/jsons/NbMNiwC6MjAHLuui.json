    "content": "Jeff Sessions has resigned as President Trump \u2019 s Attorney General , after months of harassment . But his legacy is going to get the last laugh . If President Trump and all his appointees left office tomorrow , instead of Sessions , the mark Sessions has left on policy would be the most enduring .\nWhile other Cabinet officials have gotten sucked into White House drama or caught in their own venal scandals , Sessions has generally kept his attention on doing his job \u2014 even at the cost of his relationship with the president . He \u2019 s pulled every available lever to redirect the considerable resources of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) to fight the crimes he considers most serious : violent crimes , drug crime , and , most notably , violations of immigration law .\nThe DOJ \u2019 s role in the immigration system isn \u2019 t widely understood , but it \u2019 s crucial . Illegal entry and reentry aren \u2019 t just the most commonly prosecuted federal crimes \u2014 they make up a majority of all federal convictions . The litigation the DOJ chooses to file can help tilt the balance between state , federal , and local governments as the three try to negotiate who gets to help \u2014 or has to help \u2014 enforce immigration law . Perhaps most importantly , the part of the deportation process that has so far posed the biggest obstacle to mass deportation \u2014 the immigration court system \u2014 is under Sessions \u2019 s control .\nSessions , at heart , is a prosecutor . He understands the complicated and sensitive legal system he currently wields power over as well as anyone \u2014 but he understands it as a weapon with which to protect America against people who would do it harm . And while his peers in the Republican Party tried to strike a balance between \u201c good \u201d legal immigrants and \u201c bad \u201d illegal ones , he has always taken a skeptical attitude toward immigrants and immigration , period , believing that the burden of proof ought to be on an immigrant to prove that she deserves to come to or stay in the US , and preferring , always , to keep worthy people out rather than let anyone unworthy in .\nImmigration brought Trump and Sessions together . The issue has defined both their political careers : Trump \u2019 s , short but meteoric , through the Republican ranks in the 2016 presidential campaign and into the White House ; Sessions \u2019 s , a decades-long sojourn in the wilderness of immigration hawkishness while the Republican Party retained some moderation on the issue throughout the Bush and Obama years .\nTrump gave Sessions a legacy , bringing the Republican Party closer to him . Then Sessions spent two nearly-thankless years laboring to give Trump one , using every power he possessed as attorney general to ensure that the scales of justice tip toward punishment of unauthorized immigrants as often as possible .\nJeff Sessions \u2019 s entire career built toward the task of \u201c ending illegality \u201d in immigration\nIn an administration whose most senior policy officials are either total policy neophytes ( Ben Carson , Jared Kushner ) or at least unaccustomed to the stakes and scrutiny of federal policymaking ( Ryan Zinke , Scott Pruitt , John Kelly ) , Jeff Sessions stood apart . He has spent decades in the business of federal law , as a federal prosecutor and senator .\nIt \u2019 s no coincidence that Sessions was the anomaly in Trump \u2019 s Cabinet , the seasoned vet in a clubhouse full of rookies . Sessions is among the few veterans of Republican Party governance who could serve helpfully in a Trump administration , because his policy positions weren \u2019 t mainstream among congressional Republicans until Trump came along .\nSessions has long been particularly concerned about immigration to America , in ways most Republican policymakers simply were not . He often found himself leading a faction of his own party \u2014 often a small one \u2014 against bipartisan efforts endorsed or at least tolerated by Republican leadership . In 2013 , during the Senate \u2019 s most recent comprehensive immigration reform fight , Sessions took a lonely stand against the bipartisan \u201c Gang of Eight \u201d immigration bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 and then had to quarterback the bill \u2019 s opponents on the Senate floor when then-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to steer his caucus one way or the other on the bill .\nPart of what distinguished Sessions from other Republicans was his skepticism not just of illegal immigration but of all immigration . As Sessions has put it , more people want to move to the United States than the country could ever possibly accept ; the dividing line between whom the country should accept and whom it shouldn \u2019 t , he believes , should be determined by the American people based on who they feel serves the \u201c national interest \u201d \u2014 defined as assimilating into American culture and helping the fortunes of American workers .\nThe other part , subtler but no less important , was his attitude toward unauthorized immigrants . Sessions isn \u2019 t just an immigration hawk who rejects \u201c amnesty \u201d for unauthorized immigrants who have settled in the US ; he has long advocated that the federal government has an obligation to \u201c end illegality \u201d in the immigration system , full stop .\nOther immigration hawks \u2014 most notably President Trump himself \u2014 seize on specific high-profile incidents to make their points : A caravan of a few hundred Central American asylum seekers becomes a symbol for a tide of dubious asylum claimants ; a particularly gruesome MS-13 murder becomes evidence that \u201c sanctuary cities \u201d should be eradicated .\nSessions has generally preferred a logical , categorical approach : The problem with unauthorized immigration is that it is illegal , and that illegality itself causes real pain to American citizens . Because Sessions doesn \u2019 t rely on \u201c bad \u201d unauthorized immigrants to make his point , he doesn \u2019 t open the door for sympathy toward \u201c good \u201d ones .\nTrump took to Twitter to reassure DACA recipients that they \u2019 d be able to stay ; it was Sessions who made the case to the public that , in fact , it was better for America that they leave .\nOn one side , Sessions believes , stand \u201c special interests \u201d like immigrant advocacy groups , unions , and corporations . On the other side stand \u201c the American people , \u201d who are personally afflicted by unauthorized immigration , and rank-and-file immigration agents who were ( before Trump ) ignored by their own superiors in Washington . And in Sessions \u2019 s view , elected officials have too often landed on the wrong side .\n\u201c The American people have pleaded with us to end the illegality , \u201d he argued on the Senate floor during the 2013 immigration debate , \u201c and create a lawful system that serves the national interest \u2014 a system we can be proud of . And for 30 years , Congress has failed . \u201d\nThe Republican Party has come to Sessions . In 2014 , he was named the head of the immigration subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee . The following year , Donald Trump seized momentum in the Republican presidential primary by attacking immigration as a threat to Americans \u2019 personal and national security , and Sessions saw an opportunity . He was among the first members of Congress to endorse Trump . He and his staff took the lead in writing policy proposals . And when Trump was elected , Sessions was named to one of the most powerful positions in the federal government .\nJeff Sessions took control of the system that is key to mass deportation\nIn Trump \u2019 s first year , arrests of unauthorized immigrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agents ( responsible for immigration enforcement in the \u201c interior \u201d of the US , away from the border ) spiked 41 percent \u2014 nearly enough to make up for a steep decline in the number of immigrants crossing the border and getting caught by Border Patrol .\nBut the Trump administration can \u2019 t arrest its way to mass deportation . It has to fix the immigration court system . And Jeff Sessions knew that very well .\nImmigrants arrested within the US are entitled to a hearing in immigration court \u2014 and that legal process can stretch on for months , even years . The backlog of pending immigration court cases is now over 650,000 . The average case currently pending in court has been pending for 711 days . And because immigrants who \u2019 ve been living in the US for longer and don \u2019 t have criminal records are likely to fight deportation harder and longer , arresting more of those immigrants \u2014 as ICE is doing \u2014 is likely to swell the backlog even more than arresting the same number of immigrants with criminal records would .\nIn speeches , Sessions characterized immigration courts as gummed up by frivolous asylum claims and sabotaged by \u201c dirty immigration lawyers \u201d trying to sneak their clients into legal status they don \u2019 t deserve . ( Among a certain group of immigration lawyers , \u201c dirty immigration lawyer \u201d has become a \u201c nasty woman \u201d \u2013like badge of honor . ) He made it clear not just that immigration courts aren \u2019 t moving quickly enough , but that people who deserve to be deported aren \u2019 t getting deported quickly enough ( or at all ) .\nBut Sessions didn \u2019 t use his leadership of the DOJ simply to make the immigration court system more efficient . He used the full extent of his power as attorney general to reduce the likelihood that a case gets resolved ( quickly or otherwise ) in an immigrant \u2019 s favor \u2014 removing tools and resources that make courts more efficient but improve immigrants \u2019 odds of winning their cases , while pressuring immigration judges to plow through cases at an unheard-of rate . He removed the safety valves from the pipeline while increasing the pressure .\nThanks to Sessions , judges are forced to decide immigrants \u2019 fate in a matter of hours\nIn early April , the DOJ sent a memo to all immigration judges telling them that \u201c efficiency \u201d would now factor into their performance reviews . The DOJ set standards that it called \u201c benchmarks \u201d : Judges would need to complete at least 700 cases a year to earn a \u201c satisfactory \u201d rating , while completion of fewer than 560 cases would lead to a judge being deemed \u201c unsatisfactory . \u201d\nImmigration judges and lawyers assailed the \u201c benchmarks \u201d as quotas . But a DOJ source shrugged about the new directive to the Washington Post , saying that 700 cases was only \u201c three cases a day. \u201d The National Association of Immigration Judges , the judges union , estimates that when you account for the days court isn \u2019 t in session and other factors , it \u2019 s more like four cases a day .\n\u201c Anecdotally , \u201d said judges union head Ashley Tabaddor this spring , \u201c we \u2019 re not aware that this is a number that is even close to being reasonable . \u201d\nThe \u201c benchmarks \u201d get into the details of court proceedings too . In cases where the judge has to review the judgment of an asylum officer about whether an asylum seeker can claim a \u201c credible \u201d fear \u201d or \u201c reasonable fear \u201d of persecution or torture , the DOJ says the judge should be able ( 85 percent of the time ) to make a decision that same day .\nImmigration lawyers worry that they simply can \u2019 t put together a compelling case in that time . \u201c Often [ you need ] documents from overseas that take time to get , documents from hospitals in other countries , to document your persecution claim , \u201d says Karen Lucas of the American Immigration Lawyers \u2019 Association .\nImmigration court cases are famously complex \u2014 if a judge considers all the possible outcomes . But if she \u2019 s just rubber-stamping deportations , they go much faster . And immigration judges and lawyers alike are deeply concerned that at the pace of three or more rulings a day , there is no way for immigration court to become anything other than a deportation assembly line .\nSessions worked to reduce options for judges and immigrant defendants\nAt the same time that the DOJ told judges that cases need to go faster , though , it made moves to eliminate some things that allowed cases to go faster but made it more likely that immigrants won .\nIn April , for example , the DOJ announced abruptly that it was suspending a program that offered group \u201c legal orientation \u201d workshops to immigrants in detention centers \u2014 explaining to them how court hearings worked ( necessary because there \u2019 s no right to a lawyer in immigration court ) and what options they might have to prevent a deportation order .\nThe DOJ claimed it was \u201c pausing \u201d the legal orientation program to evaluate its effectiveness . But the lead contractor , the Vera Institute for Justice , says they received an email from DOJ telling them \u201c there is not intent that the program will be renewed . \u201d\nThe Vera Institute was blindsided \u2014 not least because the legal orientation program had been evaluated in 2012 , and found to make the system more efficient . Because immigrants weren \u2019 t fighting hopeless cases , court cases took an average of 12 fewer days to resolve and the government saved an average of six nights in detention costs \u2014 for a total savings of $ 17.8 million a year over and above the cost of administering the orientation .\n\u201c This seems totally contrary to the Department of Justice \u2019 s interests , \u201d Oren Root of Vera told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in April . \u201c Their biggest problem , from their point of view , is getting cases concluded . And here is a tool that is proven by their own study to be effective in doing that . \u201d\nThe DOJ reversed its decision to suspend legal orientations under pressure from members of Congress . But it re-evaluated the program \u2019 s effectiveness \u2014 and found , in a report with what the Vera Institute called \u201c insurmountable flaws , \u201d that it was actually a cost-waster for the federal government .\nThere \u2019 s a similar pattern in the cases that Sessions referred to himself for review from the Board of Immigration Appeals , a tactic he used aggressively in the second half of his short tenure . In May , Sessions ruled that judges couldn \u2019 t move cases off their docket by closing them without a deportation order \u2014 and opened the door to the reopening of 350,000 cases that had already been closed this way .\nSessions proceeded to put severe constraints on judges \u2019 ability to grant asylum to victims of violence from non-state actors ( like domestic abusers or gangs ) , and limit judges \u2019 abilities to delay a hearing to let the immigrant apply for legal status elsewhere . At the time of his resignation , his office was working on new opinions in cases regarding whether asylum-seekers had the right to a bond hearing and whether judges could dismiss their cases without a hearing at all .\nAll these changes , and threatened changes , to immigration courts would create a ratchet . Judges would have to get through more cases due to the \u201c performance measures , \u201d without being able to move cases off their docket by closing them \u2014 their primary tool of docket control over the past few years . They \u2019 d have to make rulings in asylum cases more quickly , without giving immigrants time to present evidence , and without being able to grant asylum on the basis of domestic violence . They \u2019 d have to find time for hopeless cases that immigrants might not have tried to fight if they had gone through \u201c legal orientation \u201d \u2014 taking time away from cases immigrants could actually win if given the chance .\nSessions reshaped the DOJ , and the Trump administration , in his image\nNone of this was the work of someone content to grab a few headlines every couple of months by giving a red-meat speech about lawless immigrants . It was the work of an attorney general who understands the immigration system exceedingly well and is devoted to wreaking as much change in it as possible .\nEvery Trump administration initiative on immigration , to the extent that it \u2019 s had teeth at all , has been given those teeth by Sessions and the DOJ .\nThe first iteration of the \u201c travel ban \u201d was too legally flimsy to live . The second and third versions were worked over by Sessions \u2019 s Office of Legal Counsel and have now been in place in some form since June 2017 .\nThe decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program was delivered by Sessions , and his DOJ is continuing to fight it in court in the face of several judicial setbacks .\nBoth the DHS and the DOJ were legally directed to deny grants to \u201c sanctuary cities , \u201d but only the DOJ has aggressively tried to do it \u2014 though that , too , has been smacked down in the courts . And while Trump threatens to pull ICE out of California and praises Texas for being tough on immigration , it \u2019 s Sessions \u2019 s DOJ that \u2019 s waging the battles over what cities can be compelled to do on immigration enforcement \u2014 though , again , unsuccessfully so far .\nIt was also Sessions who issued a memo directing US attorneys to prosecute every immigrant referred to them by DHS for the federal misdemeanor of \u201c illegal entry \u201d \u2014 giving teeth to an otherwise unrealistic promise from Trump to end \u201c catch and release. \u201d And while Trump ( and DHS ) are blamed for the widespread use of family separation this spring and early summer , Sessions \u2019 s \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy , as announced to great fanfare in San Diego in May , was what turned family separation into a matter of standard practice for immigrants who cross into the US illegally rather than waiting at a port of entry like a road checkpoint .\nWithout Sessions , initiatives like these \u2014 things that are easy to proclaim but harder to follow through on \u2014 might collapse into mere symbolism , like the US-Mexico border wall .\nBut it would be a mistake to bet on it .\nSessions has already seeded the federal government with his outlook and knowledge . As much as his fingerprints are all over the Trump administration \u2019 s immigration policy \u2014 at least the parts that work \u2014 not all of those fingerprints are being left by Sessions himself ; many are being left by staff he mentored or worked closely with , now in seats of power throughout the government .\nFirst and foremost , of course , is Stephen Miller , who served Sessions for years before joining the Trump campaign but appears to have succeeded where Sessions failed in retaining Trump \u2019 s ear .\nIn the DOJ , there \u2019 s longtime staffer Gene Hamilton , who masterminded the end of DACA as a DHS adviser and then moved to DOJ to reunite with his old boss . Another former Sessions staffer , Alan Hanson , runs the Office of Justice Programs \u2014 responsible , among other things , for disbursing local and state law enforcement grants .\nAnd then there are the staffers from elsewhere on the Hill who worked closely with Sessions when he was the leading ( and arguably only ) immigration restrictionist in the Senate \u2014 and therefore an intellectual center of gravity . US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director L. Francis Cissna and adviser Kathy Nuebel Kovarik were both on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Sessions chaired its immigration subcommittee . Dimple Shah , an adviser at DHS headquarters , worked for Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( R-VA ) , the House Judiciary Committee chair who revealed himself during his tenure as a closet immigration hawk , championing bills written by a staff who worked closely with Sessions on strategy ( and who were reportedly involved in the drafting of the first travel ban ) .\nSessions \u2019 s influence could even extend beyond the political appointee layer of the federal government , into the civil service itself . Democrats in Congress claim they \u2019 ve heard disturbing reports from whistleblowers : that the DOJ is withholding or rescinding hiring offers to would-be immigration judges and members of the Board of Immigration Appeals , \u201c based on the perception that candidates hold political or ideological views that do not align with those of the Trump Administration. \u201d In a request to the DOJ inspector general , Democrats concluded that \u201c in multiple cases , the Department appears to have withdrawn offers of employment with explanations that suggest a pretext for improper political motives . \u201d\nGiven that the DOJ has hired over 100 new immigration judges to address the court backlog , ideological discrimination in hiring those judges would amount to court-packing \u2014 and would color the bench of immigration courts for decades .\nOn immigration , there have usually been two types of people in the Trump administration : the hawks who know what they \u2019 re doing , and the people who defer to the hawks . Sessions didn \u2019 t just lead the hawks \u2014 he stocked their ranks so fully that they can continue without him . Meanwhile , beyond the tweets and bombast , the machine that sends immigrants from arrest to deportation will clank along with alarming efficiency until it \u2019 s stopped by a new administration \u2014 long after Sessions is gone .",

In cases where the judge has to review the judgment of an asylum officer about whether an asylum seeker can claim a \u201ccredible\u201d fear\u201d or \u201creasonable fear\u201d of persecution or torture, the DOJ says the judge should be able (85 percent of the time) to make a decision that same day.\n\nImmigration lawyers worry that they simply can\u2019t put together a compelling case in that time. \u201cOften [you need] documents from overseas that take time to get, documents from hospitals in other countries, to document your persecution claim,\u201d says Karen Lucas of the American Immigration Lawyers\u2019 Association.\n\nImmigration court cases are famously complex \u2014 if a judge considers all the possible outcomes. But if she\u2019s just rubber-stamping deportations, they go much faster. And immigration judges and lawyers alike are deeply concerned that at the pace of three or more rulings a day, there is no way for immigration court to become anything other than a deportation assembly line.\n\nSessions worked to reduce options for judges and immigrant defendants\n\nAt the same time that the DOJ told judges that cases need to go faster, though, it made moves to eliminate some things that allowed cases to go faster but made it more likely that immigrants won.\n\nIn April, for example, the DOJ announced abruptly that it was suspending a program that offered group \u201clegal orientation\u201d workshops to immigrants in detention centers \u2014 explaining to them how court hearings worked (necessary because there\u2019s no right to a lawyer in immigration court) and what options they might have to prevent a deportation order.\n\nThe DOJ claimed it was \u201cpausing\u201d the legal orientation program to evaluate its effectiveness. But the lead contractor, the Vera Institute for Justice, says they received an email from DOJ telling them \u201cthere is not intent that the program will be renewed.\u201d\n\nThe Vera Institute was blindsided \u2014 not least because the legal orientation program had been evaluated in 2012, and found to make the system more efficient. Because immigrants weren\u2019t fighting hopeless cases, court cases took an average of 12 fewer days to resolve and the government saved an average of six nights in detention costs \u2014 for a total savings of $17.8 million a year over and above the cost of administering the orientation.\n\n\u201cThis seems totally contrary to the Department of Justice\u2019s interests,\u201d Oren Root of Vera told Vox in April. \u201cTheir biggest problem, from their point of view, is getting cases concluded. And here is a tool that is proven by their own study to be effective in doing that.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ reversed its decision to suspend legal orientations under pressure from members of Congress. But it re-evaluated the program\u2019s effectiveness \u2014 and found, in a report with what the Vera Institute called \u201cinsurmountable flaws,\u201d that it was actually a cost-waster for the federal government.\n\nThere\u2019s a similar pattern in the cases that Sessions referred to himself for review from the Board of Immigration Appeals, a tactic he used aggressively in the second half of his short tenure. In May, Sessions ruled that judges couldn\u2019t move cases off their docket by closing them without a deportation order \u2014 and opened the door to the reopening of 350,000 cases that had already been closed this way.\n\nSessions proceeded to put severe constraints on judges\u2019 ability to grant asylum to victims of violence from non-state actors (like domestic abusers or gangs), and limit judges\u2019 abilities to delay a hearing to let the immigrant apply for legal status elsewhere. At the time of his resignation, his office was working on new opinions in cases regarding whether asylum-seekers had the right to a bond hearing and whether judges could dismiss their cases without a hearing at all.\n\nAll these changes, and threatened changes, to immigration courts would create a ratchet. Judges would have to get through more cases due to the \u201cperformance measures,\u201d without being able to move cases off their docket by closing them \u2014 their primary tool of docket control over the past few years. They\u2019d have to make rulings in asylum cases more quickly, without giving immigrants time to present evidence, and without being able to grant asylum on the basis of domestic violence. They\u2019d have to find time for hopeless cases that immigrants might not have tried to fight if they had gone through \u201clegal orientation\u201d \u2014 taking time away from cases immigrants could actually win if given the chance.\n\nSessions reshaped the DOJ, and the Trump administration, in his image\n\nNone of this was the work of someone content to grab a few headlines every couple of months by giving a red-meat speech about lawless immigrants. It was the work of an attorney general who understands the immigration system exceedingly well and is devoted to wreaking as much change in it as possible.\n\nEvery Trump administration initiative on immigration, to the extent that it\u2019s had teeth at all, has been given those teeth by Sessions and the DOJ.\n\nThe first iteration of the \u201ctravel ban\u201d was too legally flimsy to live. The second and third versions were worked over by Sessions\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel and have now been in place in some form since June 2017.\n\nThe decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was delivered by Sessions, and his DOJ is continuing to fight it in court in the face of several judicial setbacks.\n\nBoth the DHS and the DOJ were legally directed to deny grants to \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d but only the DOJ has aggressively tried to do it \u2014 though that, too, has been smacked down in the courts. And while Trump threatens to pull ICE out of California and praises Texas for being tough on immigration, it\u2019s Sessions\u2019s DOJ that\u2019s waging the battles over what cities can be compelled to do on immigration enforcement \u2014 though, again, unsuccessfully so far.\n\nIt was also Sessions who issued a memo directing US attorneys to prosecute every immigrant referred to them by DHS for the federal misdemeanor of \u201cillegal entry\u201d \u2014 giving teeth to an otherwise unrealistic promise from Trump to end \u201ccatch and release.\u201d And while Trump (and DHS) are blamed for the widespread use of family separation this spring and early summer, Sessions\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, as announced to great fanfare in San Diego in May, was what turned family separation into a matter of standard practice for immigrants who cross into the US illegally rather than waiting at a port of entry like a road checkpoint.\n\nWithout Sessions, initiatives like these \u2014 things that are easy to proclaim but harder to follow through on \u2014 might collapse into mere symbolism, like the US-Mexico border wall.\n\nBut it would be a mistake to bet on it.\n\nSessions has already seeded the federal government with his outlook and knowledge. As much as his fingerprints are all over the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy \u2014 at least the parts that work \u2014 not all of those fingerprints are being left by Sessions himself; many are being left by staff he mentored or worked closely with, now in seats of power throughout the government.\n\nFirst and foremost, of course, is Stephen Miller, who served Sessions for years before joining the Trump campaign but appears to have succeeded where Sessions failed in retaining Trump\u2019s ear.\n\nIn the DOJ, there\u2019s longtime staffer Gene Hamilton, who masterminded the end of DACA as a DHS adviser and then moved to DOJ to reunite with his old boss. Another former Sessions staffer, Alan Hanson, runs the Office of Justice Programs \u2014 responsible, among other things, for disbursing local and state law enforcement grants.\n\nAnd then there are the staffers from elsewhere on the Hill who worked closely with Sessions when he was the leading (and arguably only) immigration restrictionist in the Senate \u2014 and therefore an intellectual center of gravity. US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director L. Francis Cissna and adviser Kathy Nuebel Kovarik were both on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Sessions chaired its immigration subcommittee. Dimple Shah, an adviser at DHS headquarters, worked for Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), the House Judiciary Committee chair who revealed himself during his tenure as a closet immigration hawk, championing bills written by a staff who worked closely with Sessions on strategy (and who were reportedly involved in the drafting of the first travel ban).\n\nSessions\u2019s influence could even extend beyond the political appointee layer of the federal government, into the civil service itself. Democrats in Congress claim they\u2019ve heard disturbing reports from whistleblowers: that the DOJ is withholding or rescinding hiring offers to would-be immigration judges and members of the Board of Immigration Appeals, \u201cbased on the perception that candidates hold political or ideological views that do not align with those of the Trump Administration.\u201d In a request to the DOJ inspector general, Democrats concluded that \u201cin multiple cases, the Department appears to have withdrawn offers of employment with explanations that suggest a pretext for improper political motives.\u201d\n\nGiven that the DOJ has hired over 100 new immigration judges to address the court backlog, ideological discrimination in hiring those judges would amount to court-packing \u2014 and would color the bench of immigration courts for decades.\n\nOn immigration, there have usually been two types of people in the Trump administration: the hawks who know what they\u2019re doing, and the people who defer to the hawks. Sessions didn\u2019t just lead the hawks \u2014 he stocked their ranks so fully that they can continue without him. Meanwhile, beyond the tweets and bombast, the machine that sends immigrants from arrest to deportation will clank along with alarming efficiency until it\u2019s stopped by a new administration \u2014 long after Sessions is gone.",
