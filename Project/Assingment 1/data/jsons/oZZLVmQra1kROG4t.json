It has been clear from the beginning that Trump does not accept small-d democratic norms .\nIn the first Republican primary debate last August , Trump , running as a Republican , refused to say that he would support the eventual nominee . That 's fair enough , on its own , especially considering that several of the other GOP candidates eventually refused to do so . But it was also a warning : Trump would honor the norms of the electoral process ; he would not , as a matter of course , accept its legitimacy .\nThe rejection of both the norms and legitimacy of democracy has been a consistent theme throughout Trump 's public career . In 2012 , after Barack Obama won the election , Trump went on a long twitter rant , arguing that the election was `` a total sham and a travesty '' and that `` we are not a democracy . ''\nThroughout the campaign , Trump has treated the norms of democracy\u2014peace , acceptance , respect for the electoral process and for the limits of presidential power\u2014with disdain if not outright hostility .\nAt his rallies , he has explicitly encouraged supporters to engage in violent acts against protesters . Since winning the nomination , he has repeatedly declared that the election is rigged , raising the specter of voter fraud that has been consistently , repeatedly proven to be almost entirely imaginary . Before that , he warned darkly that if his nomination did not go through at the Republican convention there might be riots .\nOver and over again throughout his campaign , Trump has disrespected the Constitution and promised to violate its most essential rules . He has dismissed the idea of free speech , promised to seize the assets of foreign nationals , and suggested that Muslims should be forced to register in a federal database . He has repeatedly promised to order the military to commit war crimes . He has derided core constitutional principles , arguing , dismissively , that `` the Constitution is not a suicide pact .

At last night 's debate , he repeatedly dismissed the notion , confirmed by multiple U.S. intelligence agencies , that Russia was behind the hack of democratic emails , and seemed to side with Putin for having outsmarted the United States .
