As I write , Republicans are publicly accusing Democrats of manufacturing ballots to steal elected offices , while Democrats charge that Republicans somehow gerrymandered state borders to swipe victories in Senate races . It 's as if the members of America 's two dominant political tribes so despise each other that assuming some degree of decency on each other 's part is out of the question . So hang on for a ride that 's not getting smoother anytime soon .\n`` Many Americans think people in the other party are ignorant , spiteful , evil and generally destroying the country , '' Kim Hart of Axios reports of a new poll conducted just before the election by SurveyMonkey . `` About half of Democrats think Republicans are ignorant ( 54 % ) and spiteful ( 44 % ) . Likewise , about half of Republicans think Democrats are ignorant ( 49 % ) and spiteful ( 54 % ) . 21 % of Democrats think Republicans are evil , and about the same share of Republicans ( 23 % ) think Democrats are evil .

'' Hethington and Weiler draw on data compiled by the American National Election Studies .\nSo Americans are at daggers-drawn , and it appears that their mutual dislike is increasing in intensity .\nMaking the situation more potentially intractable is the vast gulf between the tribes not just in terms of their partisan associations , but also what motivates them .
