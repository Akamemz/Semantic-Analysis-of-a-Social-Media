This year , it needed help from foul-mouthed anti-Trumper Samantha Bee and the press itself to do it .\nJournalists who campaigned against President Trump both before and after the election questioned the need for the White House Correspondents \u2019 Dinner this year . Trump helped burn the script by refusing to attend and TBS \u2019 theoretical comedian held a counter event the elite flocked to . NBC said Bee \u2019 s \u201c Not The White House Correspondents Dinner \u201d \u201c upstaged \u201d the traditional event .\nThat was easy . \u201c Nerd prom , \u201d as it is called inside the Beltway , became a minor event on its own night . It headlined two ancient news icons who helped take down a president more than 40 years ago . The comic host devoted most of his stand-up to attacking the president , who was elsewhere and making a series of Nazi , Holocaust and N-word jokes that were more hate than humor .\nJournalists and Hollywood listened to the buzz and chose to see Bee \u2019 s harder-edged attack on the president and his supporters . Guardian columnist Lucia Graves\u200f correctly characterized the Samantha Bee event as \u201c a fancy protest , but it 's still very much a protest . \u201d\nTrump took a different tactic , holding a campaign-style event in Pennsylvania that let the media have it with both barrels . The president \u2019 s special assistant Cliff Sims\u200f emphasized the contrast . \u201c While the DC elite don their black ties and ballgowns , @ POTUS will be with the People in Penn. \u201d Vice President Mike Pence started it off to a roaring crowd telling them , \u201c America is back . \u201d\nTrump slapped the media hard , as always : \u201c A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation \u2019 s capital right now , \u201d said Trump , with huge crowd support . He noted that the D.C. event was \u201c without the president \u201d to large cheers . When he mentioned the media covering his rally , the crowd booed them .\nTrump continued to slam the media . \u201c Media outlets like MSNBC and CNN are fake news. \u201d He gave journalists a harsh assessment . \u201c Let \u2019 s rate the media \u2019 s 100 days because , as you know , they are in disgrace. \u201d He added , \u201c The media deserves a very big , fat failing grade . \u201d\nThe Correspondents \u2019 Dinner had become an embarrassment -- an event the media obsessed about . Top journalists rubbed elbows with actors and actresses , major donors and prominent politicians -- the very people they are supposed to report on the rest of the year .\nABC News said it was , \u201c typically one of Washington \u2019 s hottest events , \u201d like that \u2019 s a good thing . It even involved a red carpet photo spot just like Hollywood award shows . This year , CBS \u2019 \u201c resident cartoonist \u201d Liza Donnelly\u200f was \u201c live-drawing \u201d the event and Politico ran a \u201c White House Correspondents Dinner party guide. \u201d The Hill cautioned about the 2017 dinner and its \u201c weirdness \u201d factor . Where was that comment every other year ?\nThe war between the press and Trump meant several press figures wanted to either skip the dinner or cancel it entirely . Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan was one who wanted it over , saying it was time to \u201c stick a silver-plated fork in it. \u201d Bear in mind , Trump had even been booed by the press at the event way back in 2011 . Now that he won , it was time to cancel the event in the eyes of the \u201c neutral \u201d press .\nTrump \u2019 s absence took the air out of the annual event that had always included jokes at both the presidents \u2019 and media \u2019 s expense . Bee seized on it to hold a publicly anti-Trump event that was , allegedly , pro-free press -- \u201c dirty words and all. \u201d It drew a star-studded crowd , including \u201c Alysia Reiner of \u2018 Orange Is the New Black , \u2019 Retta of \u2018 Parks and Recreation \u2019 and Matt Walsh of \u2018 Veep \u2019 \u201d according to NBC . They were joined by numerous CNN staffers such as Don Lemon , Jake Tapper , \u201c Dana Bash , Jim Acosta and Brianna Keilar. \u201d Add to it , political types like Valerie Jarrett , and Black Lives Matter spokesman Deray McKesson . The after party featured Elvis Costello .\nIt was exactly the kind of event ordinary Americans despise .\nBee \u2019 s \u201c party for the press \u201d featured comedian Will Ferrell , who appeared as George W. Bush , mocking Trump , of course . \u201c For the longest time I was considered the worst president of all time \u2014 that has changed , \u201d Ferrell told an applauding audience , according to Hollywood Reporter . \u201c I needed eight years , a catastrophic flood , a war built on a lie and an economic disaster . The new guy only needed a hundred days . \u201d\nBee showed how Democrats and journalists ( occasionally those aren \u2019 t the same ) can \u2019 t get over Hillary Clinton losing . Vulture.com wrote up her concluding segment : \u201c Samantha Bee closed out her \u201c Not the White House Correspondents \u2019 Dinner \u201d with a bang at the DAR Constitution Hall on Saturday . Taking a page out of \u201c The Man in the High Castle \u2019 s \u201d playbook , Bee ended her special by imagining a world where Hillary Clinton , not Donald Trump , was elected president of the United States. \u201d As part of tying the left and the press closer , the event \u2019 s swag bag included \u201c free press \u201d T-shirts .\nAll this came at a very bad time for journalists -- after years of layoffs and declining status . Now , journalism is unpopular as a profession and with the public . \u201c Broadcaster is the second worst job of the year , and newspaper reporter takes the top spot , \u201d according to Career Cast .\nA recent poll doesn \u2019 t make it look any brighter in the eyes of the audience . \u201c In the new poll , roughly half ( 51 percent ) of Americans said the national political media \u2018 is out of touch with everyday Americans , \u2019 compared with 28 percent who said it \u2018 understand the issues everyday Americans are facing , \u2019 \u201d according to the Morning Consult .\nD.C. \u2019 s elite journalists , outfitted in the night \u2019 s fancy dresses and black-tie outfits , seemed a throwback to yesteryear when they controlled the levers of American society .\nJournalists long loved the Correspondents \u2019 Dinner . It gave them a chance to celebrate Democratic presidents and openly attack Republican ones . That was before 2017 . The Trump-era news media don \u2019 t hide their contempt for conservatives . The previous comedy lineup was usually openly hostile to the right -- Stephen Colbert , Seth Meyers and Larry Wilmore , for example .\nThis year was worse . The Hollywood Reporter even had a comedy writer create a phony speech for Trump had he attended the event . Danny Zuker , a writer-producer on ABC 's comedy \u201c Modern Family , \u201d uncovered \u201c the remarks that might have been if POTUS had n't decided to sit this one out . \u201d\nHe joked about \u201c The failing New York Times , \u201d \u201c a record for attendance , \u201d launching missiles into Iraq or Syria and making fun of Trump \u2019 s marriage . \u201c You 're monsters . You 're worse than ISIS . Sean Spicer says you 're worse than Hitler . Kill yourselves , \u201d he concluded as Trump .\nThis year \u2019 s dinner was in the identical vein . It featured the pair of journalists who took down a previous Republican president -- Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein -- an unsubtle statement by the supposedly neutral press . It included a video clip from actor Alec Baldwin impersonating Trump , telling them to \u201c Keep up the good work. \u201d And \u201c The Daily Show \u2019 s \u201d Hasan Minhaj was the comic relief -- yet another wild , left-wing voice .\nMinhaj opened up joking about the \u201c series finale of the White House Correspondents \u2019 Dinner. \u201d \u201c We got ta address the elephant who \u2019 s not in this room , \u201d \u201c he is in Pennsylvania because he ca n't take a joke. \u201d He then proceeded to work his way through the administration ( House Slytherin ) underlining why Republicans should consider whether to ever attend in the future .\nHe went after Trump ( Russia jokes , tan jokes , the \u201c Orange Man behind the Muslim ban \u201d ) , Betsy DeVos ( rich joke ) , Steve Bannon ( Nazi joke ) , Rick Perry ( IQ joke ) , Mike Pence ( afraid of women joke ) , Jeff Sessions ( Confederate joke , N-word joke ) , Sean Spicer ( Holocaust joke ) and Fox News ( Bill O \u2019 Reilly jokes that got applause , Jesse Watters jokes , Muslim jokes ) .\nHe made some other press jokes with USA Today , MSNBC and CNN all targets to more softball mockery . Then he went on a riff comparing journalists to minorities . He was periodically serious , \u201c Do I come up here and try to fit in ? Not ruffle any feathers ? Or do I say how I really feel ? \u201d He did , endlessly bashing the administration while claiming he was asked not to do so .\nMinhaj made his mark during the Radio Television Correspondents Association Dinner with an incredible comment : \u201c What we saw in Orlando was one of the ugliest cocktails of the problems that we still see here in America , a cocktail of homophobia , xenophobia , lack of access to mental health care , and sheer lack of political will .... Is this what you [ Congress ] want your legacy to be ? ... That you were complicit in the deaths of thousands of Americans ? \u201d\nHe followed the equally liberal Larry Wilmore who hosted in 2016 . Yet journalists pretended they were surprised Trump didn \u2019 t attend .\nNevertheless , White House Correspondents \u2019 Association President Jeff Mason shouted into the wilderness at this year \u2019 s event : \u201c We are not fake news .
