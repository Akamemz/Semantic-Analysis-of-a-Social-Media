Johnson goes further, \"I'm not advocating legalization of other drugs, but if we legalized all drugs tomorrow, the world would be a better place. Ninety percent of the drug problem is prohibition-related.\"\n\nBoth candidates sounded pretty libertarian to me.\n\n\"We don't buy the dog food that either party is selling,\" said Weld. \"We don't buy government making decisions for people in their private lives, part of the Republican Party platform, and we don't buy the Democrats' penchant for spending money that we don't have.\"\n\nDo Libertarians have a chance?
