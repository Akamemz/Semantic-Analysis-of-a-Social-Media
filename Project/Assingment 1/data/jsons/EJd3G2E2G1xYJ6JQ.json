No one wants to know more than Speaker John Boehner .\nBoehner intends this week to set a date for the election to succeed him .

Yet if Ryan does n't run , GOP lawmakers and senior aides doubt the election will be wrapped up by Oct. 30 , when Boehner planned to leave Congress . Boehner , who has pledged to remain in place until a new speaker is chosen , could be forced to stay put and deal with thorny budget issues and raising the debt ceiling as a lame-duck speaker . His internal clout has been severely diminished , and he would likely have to cut deals with Democrats to get any measures passed while still holding onto the speaker 's gavel .\nBoehner , who has a condominium in Florida and enjoys his golf , is itching to get out of the Capitol and wrap up his congressional career , allies say . But he has raised $ 300 million for House Republicans since 2009 , spending hundreds of days a year on the road , and he is n't going to leave the party in the lurch . Boehner is willing to stay for some of November but does not expect to be in Congress come Thanksgiving , according to multiple aides with knowledge of his plans . The end of the year or the end of 2016 ? That 's a pipe dream for Boehner loyalists .\nRyan is n't making this easy for anyone .
