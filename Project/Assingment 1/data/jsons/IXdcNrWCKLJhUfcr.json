    "content": "The city of Somerville , Massachusetts , has passed an ordinance making it one of the first cities in the nation to officially recognize polyamorous relationships . The city no longer limits the number of people included in a partnership .\nThe change , which was unanimously passed by the city council last week , required only a minor shift in language . Instead of defining a relationship as an `` entity formed by two persons , '' Somerville now legally defines it as `` entity formed by people . ''\nThe Somerville Journal reports that the momentous revision actually came about as a last-minute addition .\nCouncilor Lance Davis , chair of the Legislative Matters committee , was drafting new legislation to recognize domestic partnerships \u2014 something the city had yet to do . According to Davis , that ordinance was revised to bring requirements for domestic partnerships in line with those of other marriages .\n`` During our initial conversations , a couple things jumped out , '' Davis said . `` The first draft required domestic partners to notify the city of any change of address , which struck me as not in line with what married folks have to do , and required that they reside together , which again struck me as something I 'm not required to do as a married person , so we got rid of those provisions . ''\nThen , only an hour before the ordinance was set to be voted on , Councilor J.T . Scott asked why its wording confined a partnership to just two people .\n\u2033 [ He ] reached out and said , 'Why is this two ? ' And I said , ' I do n't have a good answer , ' '' Davis told the Journal . `` I tripped over my words a bit , and played devil 's advocate , but I had no good reason . So , I pulled it out , went through quickly making whatever word changes necessary to make it not gendered or limited to two people . ''\nThe new language went before the council on June 25 , and was signed into law by the city 's mayor four days later .\nIt 's estimated that 4 % to 5 % of people living in the U.S. are currently participating in polyamorous relationships , or what 's otherwise known as consensual or ethical non-monogamy , a practice in which partners maintain more than one sexual or romantic relationship with each others ' knowledge and consent . For comparison , that means non-monogamy is about as prevalent as the number of Americans who identify as LGBTQ , which is estimated to be about 4.5 % of the American population .\nDavis said that he 's `` consistently felt that when society and government tries to define what is or is not a family , we 've historically done a very poor job of doing so ... It has n't gone well , and it 's not a business that government should be in , so that guided my thinking on this . ''\nIt is illegal in all 50 states to be married to more than one person \u2014 which is known as polygamy , not polyamory . Polyamorous people who try different kinds of arrangements \u2014 such as a married couple with steady outside partners \u2014 run into their own legal problems .\nThere is no legal framework for polyamorous families to share finances , custody of children or the rights and responsibilities that come with marriage .
