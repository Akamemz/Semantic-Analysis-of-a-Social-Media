    "content": "DETROIT , Michigan \u2014 Donald Trump , the 2016 GOP presidential nominee , delivered a positive and uplifting message filled with hope and opportunity here at the Great Faith Ministries International church .\nIn addition to Dr. Ben Carson and Omarosa , \u2588\u2588\u2588 accompanied Trump on the trip to Detroit to provide an original and behind-the-scenes look into how he is offering an uplifting message to all Americans\u2014including the black community .\n\u201c Our nation is too divided . We talk past each other , not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on , \u201d Trump told the church-goers from the podium , where he briefly spoke about why he was there . \u201c They don \u2019 t know . They have no clue . I \u2019 m here today to learn . So that we can together remedy injustice , in any form . And so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s speech on the podium came after he taped an interview with Bishop Wayne Jackson , who along with his wife Dr. Beverly Jackson , serve as the senior pastors for the inner city Detroit church . The interview will air next week .\nAfter the interview , before Trump \u2019 s speech , he sat in the front row of the church \u2019 s pews for the opening of the Saturday service\u2014and even danced along a little bit with the black leaders as the service opened up with a few upbeat songs . Later in the day , with Carson as his guide , Trump visited Carson \u2019 s boyhood home in Detroit\u2013walking down Carson \u2019 s street talking to the people there , many of whom seemed supportive of what Trump is doing .\nIn the speech in the church , Trump laid out how the permanent political class has failed everyone in the United States including America \u2019 s black communities .\n\u201c Our political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself , \u201d Trump said . \u201c I want to reform that system so that it works for you , everyone in this room . I believe true reform can only come from outside the system . I really mean that . Being a businessman is much different than being a politician because I understand what is happening . And we are going outside the establishment . \u201d\nTrump has already successfully defined himself as a candidate of change , while his opponent Hillary Clinton represents the status quo . In this Detroit event , however , aides to Trump note he took a different tact : His new aim , in addition to representing change , is to begin representing \u201c hope \u201d \u2014and a positive outlook for the United States with an uplifting policy agenda designed to fix problems for everyone in the country .\n\u201c What we \u2019 re seeing is a fundamental shift in the campaign , \u201d Jason Miller , Trump \u2019 s senior communications adviser , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Mr . Trump was already the change candidate , but this week his message of inclusion and optimism made him the hope candidate as well . With Hillary having abandoned the campaign trail in order to dodge questions about her continual ethics issues , I \u2019 m not sure how she ever gets that back . \u201d\nTrump offered policy specifics for the inner cities : he called for a revitalized Motor City , with \u201c factories everywhere \u201d and \u201c new roads and bridges \u201d as well as \u201c new schools\u2014especially schools . \u201d\nBut the most important promise in Trump \u2019 s speech came at the end of that line , when the billionaire businessman and political outsider promised the people of Detroit\u2014and really everyone nationwide who was listening as the speech was carried live on major networks\u2014 \u201c new hope . \u201d\nThe themes of \u201c hope \u201d and \u201c change \u201d are strong in the American electorate , and it \u2019 s those two promises that propelled Barack Obama\u2014America \u2019 s sitting two-term president\u2014into the White House in 2008 . Many , whether they like Obama or not , do not believe he has delivered on the promises he made of hope and change . Many believe he has failed , and has become one of the most divisive presidents along party lines in history , alienating millions of Americans who don \u2019 t support his agenda .\n\u201c Mr . Trump is working hard for all votes because he wants to be a voice for all Americans , \u201d Trump \u2019 s national spokeswoman Katrina Pierson , who is also black and accompanied the campaign on this Detroit trip , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c He came to Detroit to listen , and became a voice of hope . \u201d\nPierson noted his positive tone in this speech , before a church congregation in the inner city\u2014which drew him a standing ovation after he quoted from Scripture\u2014is a problem-solving themed agenda .\n\u201c He gave a positive uplifting speech and delivered a strong policy agenda for economic growth , education , and prosperity for communities that have suffered under insider politicians , \u201d Pierson said .\nIn the event , Omarosa , the former Apprentice contestant , noted , \u201c the spirit was so high. \u201d At one point , Trump even held up and kissed a baby .\n\u201c Did you see how many \u2018 amens \u2019 Donald Trump got ? \u201d she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 backstage after Trump spoke . \u201c It was just incredible to see him connect with the parishioners and really bring a powerful word of hope to this congregation . I thought it was phenomenal . \u201d\nOmarosa , who \u2019 s also now a pastor as Trump noted in his speech , said Trump is clearly gaining support in the black community .\n\u201c You were in the room , \u201d she said . \u201c You felt the spirit . It was authentic . It was a very natural connection because they know that Mr. Trump is going to fight for them . When he talked about jobs , when he talked about the economy , when he talked about his family and his faith , they connected , because those are things that all Americans worry about . They \u2019 re worried about their families , they \u2019 re worried about their futures . And they \u2019 re very excited about someone who \u2019 s going to put God back into the schools , God back into every element of our lives . Unapologetically , Mr. Trump is a man of faith . \u201d\nCarson echoed Omarosa in his own exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c I thought it was extremely well done , \u201d Carson said of the event backstage afterwards . \u201c Donald Trump was well-received by the audience here and it \u2019 s very important for people to see for themselves rather than have this man interpreted for them by the media that has another agenda . The whole concept of togetherness and strength , we have radical Islamic terrorists who want to destroy us . And we \u2019 re just going to make it easy for them if we try to destroy ourselves . We need somebody who really wants to look at the totality\u2014how do we Make America Great Again ? We can \u2019 t make it great again unless every part is great , including cities like Detroit . \u201d\nAfter Trump was so well received in this Detroit church , Bishop Jackson bestowed upon him a prayer shawl on stage before Trump moved on to his next stop in the inner city .\nCarson , Trump \u2019 s former rival in the primaries turned strong supporter , advised him on the way here on messaging and tone , and the results of the advice Trump is taking not just from Carson but others in his inner circle including Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-AL ) , former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani , his running mate Indiana Gov . Mike Pence and more , is showing up in the analytics . Carson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Trump is gaining support in the black community .\n\u201c You look at the NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll that was out a couple of weeks ago , he got 1 percent of the black vote , \u201d Carson said . \u201c A week later he got 8 percent of the black vote . I suspect it will only go up because he \u2019 s reaching out . In the past , the black community felt there was really no other alternative except the Democrats\u2014even though the Democrats weren \u2019 t doing anything for them . I think it \u2019 s good to introduce some competition here . Let the Democrats come up with something that really works . And let the Republican come up with something that works , and let people make a decision based on something intelligent rather than blind loyalty . \u201d\nThat NBC polling is hardly the only indicator that Trump \u2019 s support in the black community is increasing , despite media claims otherwise . In fact , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported after his speech in West Bend , Wisconsin , in the wake of recent Milwaukee riots , Trump \u2019 s appeal in the black community according to Los Angeles Times polling increased multiple fold up to more than 14 percent . And the way that the Democratic Party\u2014and particularly Hillary Clinton\u2014are responding to it is not by offering any substantive criticism or alternative policy-focused solutions for America \u2019 s struggling inner cities like Detroit . Instead , she went to Reno , Nevada , a little more than a week ago to slam Trump as a racist in her speech , bashing the \u201c alt-right \u201d in the wake of Trump \u2019 s hiring of Stephen K. Bannon\u2014\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 executive chairman who is currently on leave from this network\u2014as his campaign CEO . Carson said Hillary Clinton \u2019 s attacks on Trump over race are \u201c absurd \u201d and a \u201c desperate play . \u201d\n\u201c Really , when you stop and think about it , the real racism are the people who think that people have to think a certain way\u2014they have to act a certain way\u2014and if they don \u2019 t they \u2019 re an \u2018 Uncle Tom , \u2019 they \u2019 re a \u2018 traitor , \u2019 what have you , \u201d Carson said . \u201c That \u2019 s ridiculous . That \u2019 s the most racist thing I \u2019 ve ever heard . \u201d\nIndeed , during his speech , Trump made a reference back to the fact that the party that nominated him for president\u2014the Republican Party\u2014freed the slaves under President Abraham Lincoln , who was a Republican . Republicans have led the way on Civil Rights for more than a century , championing the civil rights reforms of the 20th Century , and have led the way on women \u2019 s rights as well .\n\u201c Becoming the nominee of the Party of Abraham Lincoln \u2014 a lot of people don \u2019 t realize that Abraham Lincoln , the great Abraham Lincoln was a Republican \u2014 has been the greatest honor of my life , \u201d Trump said . \u201c It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the Party but more important the future of the country and the community . \u201d\nTrump has , in previous interviews with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , expressed how proud he is to carry on this Republican tradition of leading on civil and women \u2019 s rights while Democrats choose to not only not lead , but in many cases work on the other side . In this speech\u2014in the aforementioned policy specifics\u2014Trump laid out how he plans to lead on the 21st Century \u2019 s civil rights agenda , an agenda focused on jobs , education and opportunity for all .\nJust like with previous civil rights movements , Democrats\u2014who have nearly unanimously ruled America \u2019 s inner cities for decades , in some cases more than half a century , driving their economies into the ground\u2014are on the other side of the civil rights agenda .\n\u201c I believe that we need a civil rights agenda for our time , \u201d Trump said . \u201c One that ensures the rights to a great education \u2014 so important \u2014 and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really , really great job . A good paying job and one that you love going to every morning . That can happen . We need to bring our companies back . \u201d\nPastor Darrell Scott , a Cleveland-area black pastor and Trump supporter who was in attendance in Detroit on Saturday , issued a statement from the campaign shortly after the event .\n\u201c In his remarks today , Donald Trump called for a new civil rights agenda that includes the right to a safe community , the right to a great education and the right to a secure job , \u201d Scott stated . \u201c These civil rights are in addition to the fundamental , constitutional civil rights of our society and the absolute commitment to equal protection , ending discrimination and safeguarding the dignity of all citizens \u2013 and that includes their inviolable freedoms and liberties . Mr. Trump will also defend our religious freedoms , and the freedom of Americans from all communities to worship in peace . \u201d\nIn addition to Scott \u2019 s statement , the Trump campaign detailed the policy specifics in a press release designed to address each of the \u201c civil rights agenda \u201d items and more . It \u2019 s because of these efforts that Lynne Patton , a black woman executive who has worked for the Trumps in various capacities for years , was so proud of her boss in Detroit on Saturday .\n\u201c I could not have been more proud to stand by this incredible man \u2019 s side today , \u201d Patton , who in addition to serving as the Trump campaign \u2019 s Trump family ambassador is working on minority engagement for the campaign , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c The immediate bipartisan headlines that followed praising my boss \u2019 call for unity , inclusion , dialogue acceptance commitment & opportunity can not even begin to measure the level of energy & excitement that enveloped us from the moment we stepped off the plane . The Motor City will prosper once again under a Trump Administration . \u201d\n# Detroit was a huge success today ! In case you missed my interview with @ kimguilfoyle on @ greta , here it is ! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 https : //t.co/exsMduYcXR \u2014 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Lynne Patton ( @ LynnePatton ) September 3 , 2016\nPatton became a surprise star at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July , where she delivered a sizzling speech about how Donald Trump and his family care about everyone\u2014a speech that came after a video she crafted detailing how Trump \u2019 s companies have hired more minority and women executives than any other she \u2019 s worked at . What Patton , Omarosa and so many others who have worked with Trump over the years suggest is that the real estate magnate has always cared about the black community ; and that he wasn \u2019 t attacked by Democrats on racial lines until he ran for president as a Republican . Trump , despite the mainstream media narrative to the contrary , has a long and deep history of breaking racial barriers and working African American leaders on issues of equality and civil rights .\n\u201c As someone who has been with this family each and every day for the past seven years , I know Mr. Trump\u2014I know his heart and I know his passion for this country to be true , \u201d Patton said at the RNC . She continued :\nTonight , as we stand in the shadow of one of the darkest months in modern American history I know now more than ever that Donald Trump is the law and order leader we need to heal a wounded and divided nation . We all watched , horrified and helpless , as a radical Islamic terrorist targeted members of the LGBTQ community in Orlando . We \u2019 ve seen discord in our urban communities sparked by the senseless deaths of young black men in Baton Rouge , in Minnesota , and far too many places around this country . We watched in horror as our nation \u2019 s finest were gunned down in Dallas and Baton Rouge as they sought to protect the very people protesting them . But in order to heal as a nation , we must stop viewing these incidents as attacks on the LGBTQ community or attacks on the black community or even attacks on the law enforcement community . They are attacks on America , they are attacks on our values , they are attacks on the very foundation of civil society . Sadly , there is not one person in this room who can deny that historically black lives have mattered less . My life mattered less , and whether we like it or not , there are people out there who still believe this to be true . But tonight , as a minority myself , I personally pledge to you that Donald Trump knows that your life matters , he knows that my life matters , he knows that LGBTQ lives matter , he knows that veterans lives matter , and he knows that blue lives matter . This country is sadly more divided than it was eight years ago . But tonight , don \u2019 t hope for change : Be the change .\nTo wrap it all up , it wouldn \u2019 t have been a complete day if Trump didn \u2019 t thank the law enforcement community in Michigan for everything they do . Back at his plane before heading back to New York City , Trump took individual photos with many of the officers who were part of his security detail during the Detroit trip\u2013and a group photo with all of them .\nIn contrast to Trump , Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee for president , goes for days without doing public events . In fact , it has now been 273 days since she held a press conference .",

Instead, she went to Reno, Nevada, a little more than a week ago to slam Trump as a racist in her speech, bashing the \u201calt-right\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s hiring of Stephen K. Bannon\u2014Breitbart News\u2019 executive chairman who is currently on leave from this network\u2014as his campaign CEO. Carson said Hillary Clinton\u2019s attacks on Trump over race are \u201cabsurd\u201d and a \u201cdesperate play.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, when you stop and think about it, the real racism are the people who think that people have to think a certain way\u2014they have to act a certain way\u2014and if they don\u2019t they\u2019re an \u2018Uncle Tom,\u2019 they\u2019re a \u2018traitor,\u2019 what have you,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.

A good paying job and one that you love going to every morning. That can happen.

Mr. Trump will also defend our religious freedoms, and the freedom of Americans from all communities to worship in peace.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Scott\u2019s statement, the Trump campaign detailed the policy specifics in a press release designed to address each of the \u201ccivil rights agenda\u201d items and more. It\u2019s because of these efforts that Lynne Patton, a black woman executive who has worked for the Trumps in various capacities for years, was so proud of her boss in Detroit on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI could not have been more proud to stand by this incredible man\u2019s side today,\u201d Patton, who in addition to serving as the Trump campaign\u2019s Trump family ambassador is working on minority engagement for the campaign, told Breitbart News. \u201cThe immediate bipartisan headlines that followed praising my boss\u2019 call for unity, inclusion, dialogue acceptance commitment & opportunity cannot even begin to measure the level of energy & excitement that enveloped us from the moment we stepped off the plane. The Motor City will prosper once again under a Trump Administration.\u201d\n\n#Detroit was a huge success today! In case you missed my interview with @kimguilfoyle on @greta, here it is! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 https://t.co/exsMduYcXR \u2014 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Lynne Patton (@LynnePatton) September 3, 2016\n\nPatton became a surprise star at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, where she delivered a sizzling speech about how Donald Trump and his family care about everyone\u2014a speech that came after a video she crafted detailing how Trump\u2019s companies have hired more minority and women executives than any other she\u2019s worked at. What Patton, Omarosa and so many others who have worked with Trump over the years suggest is that the real estate magnate has always cared about the black community; and that he wasn\u2019t attacked by Democrats on racial lines until he ran for president as a Republican. Trump, despite the mainstream media narrative to the contrary, has a long and deep history of breaking racial barriers and working African American leaders on issues of equality and civil rights.\n\n\u201cAs someone who has been with this family each and every day for the past seven years, I know Mr. Trump\u2014I know his heart and I know his passion for this country to be true,\u201d Patton said at the RNC. She continued:\n\nTonight, as we stand in the shadow of one of the darkest months in modern American history I know now more than ever that Donald Trump is the law and order leader we need to heal a wounded and divided nation. We all watched, horrified and helpless, as a radical Islamic terrorist targeted members of the LGBTQ community in Orlando. We\u2019ve seen discord in our urban communities sparked by the senseless deaths of young black men in Baton Rouge, in Minnesota, and far too many places around this country. We watched in horror as our nation\u2019s finest were gunned down in Dallas and Baton Rouge as they sought to protect the very people protesting them. But in order to heal as a nation, we must stop viewing these incidents as attacks on the LGBTQ community or attacks on the black community or even attacks on the law enforcement community. They are attacks on America, they are attacks on our values, they are attacks on the very foundation of civil society. Sadly, there is not one person in this room who can deny that historically black lives have mattered less. My life mattered less, and whether we like it or not, there are people out there who still believe this to be true. But tonight, as a minority myself, I personally pledge to you that Donald Trump knows that your life matters, he knows that my life matters, he knows that LGBTQ lives matter, he knows that veterans lives matter, and he knows that blue lives matter. This country is sadly more divided than it was eight years ago. But tonight, don\u2019t hope for change: Be the change.\n\nTo wrap it all up, it wouldn\u2019t have been a complete day if Trump didn\u2019t thank the law enforcement community in Michigan for everything they do. Back at his plane before heading back to New York City, Trump took individual photos with many of the officers who were part of his security detail during the Detroit trip\u2013and a group photo with all of them.\n\nIn contrast to Trump, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, goes for days without doing public events. In fact, it has now been 273 days since she held a press conference.",
