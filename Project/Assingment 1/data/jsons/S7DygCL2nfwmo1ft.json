Dozens have been killed . The government of Viktor Yanukovych , having lost all credibility weeks ago , has decided to behave as if it now has nothing to lose and no one , outside of Moscow , to impress .\n\u201c Government \u201d may in fact be too strong a term to use to describe what \u2019 s left of power structures . Yanukovych already appears more warlord than president . His police force has been firing indiscriminately into the crowds with automatic weapons , joined by roving gangs of loyalist paramilitary units\u2014titushki\u2014who are conspicuous by their own automatic weapons and their yellow arm bands , the latter to keep the police from shooting at them . Hotels have become field hospitals . Bodies of protestors have been found without heads ; others have been laid out in rows reminiscent of Aleppo .\nTwo Ukrainian journalists were recently yanked out of taxis and beaten savagely , one shot in the chest and killed . Evidence of execution-style gunshots with armor-piercing bullets has emerged . Ukrainian authorities , too , have been shot and killed in what now threatens to become all-out civil war and certainly has the telltale signs of one . Barricades erected line the Maidan , or Independence Square in Kiev , as they do in other cities around the country , sometimes with World War II cannons-cum-monuments . Tires and government buildings have been set alight with Molotov cocktails , their fires burning through the night amidst strangely playful green laser light shows . Before long , this mood suggests , someone \u2019 s tanks will be rolling into city streets in a replay of Hungary in 1956 or Prague in 1968 .\nPerhaps the most salient development today was the report that Russia \u2019 s spetsnaz ( special forces ) have been deployed by Putin to help put down what was once a peaceful protest movement , but now is seen as a mayhem of Molotov cocktails and riots . According to Tyzhden , a Ukrainian weekly , one such officer was \u201c captured \u201d by protestors and displayed before the Euromaidan masses today , his martial insignia of a double-headed eagle , proof to many , if proof were needed , of where he came from and who \u2019 s actually running the show in Kiev . ( Toomas Hendrik Ilves , the president of Estonia , who knows something about Russia \u2019 s infiltration of its next-door neighbors , credited this report as plausible and tweeted a link to the Tyzhden article . The Russian embassy in Tallinn accused him of spreading \u201c lying tweets \u201d \u2014before deleting the accusation . )\nWhy did I say it was alarming that this present state of affairs was not foreseen by the West ? Because Putin told us what was imminent . He always has the courtesy to notify in advance , even if we choose not to listen .\nSergei Glazev is his right-hand-man on Russia \u2019 s \u201c integration \u201d with Ukraine , which is more properly understood as re-colonization . Yanuykovych \u201c has a choice , \u201d Glazev last month told the house organ of Gazprom , Russia \u2019 s state-owned gas company and , up until now , Putin \u2019 s preferred tool for getting what he wants out of Europe . \u201c Either he defends Ukrainian statehood and puts down the insurrection\u2026or he risks losing power , in which case Ukraine faces growing chaos and internal conflict with no escape to be seen . \u201d\nThe consequences for not putting down the \u201c insurrection \u201d were further spelled out by the Kremlin . When Yanukovych appeared to go wobbly and offered conciliatory gestures to the opposition late last month ( like an Arab dictator in trouble , he sacked and swapped his cabinet , mainly for cosmetic effect , in January ) , Putin threatened to withhold the $ 15 billion loan which first enticed Yanukovych to defy the majority of Ukrainians by quashing a very modest but symbolically important association agreement with the European Union . Was it a coincidence , then , that the first day the shooting started\u2014Monday\u2014was also the day that Putin \u2019 s Finance Ministry announced that Yanukovych \u2019 s punishment would not be meted out and that $ 2 billion of that loan would instead be dispensed after all ? Dialogue may get you trade agreements with Brussels , but crushing skulls gets keeps the bribes coming from Moscow .\nIt pays to remember that while Putin was , since his St. Petersburg days , always an obvious Chekist and mafioso , he didn \u2019 t really start to become one in the Western imagination until the end of his first term , after the so-called \u201c color revolutions \u201d kicked off in the former Soviet states , including and especially in Ukraine . This is because his response to these democratic ferments was to eliminate any and all possibility that they might flourish where they started or , god forbid , spread to Russia itself . His scapegoats then , as now , were the United States and Europe , which he blamed for mucking about in his backyard . So began a gradual and fitful process of re-Sovietization which , since Putin \u2019 s return to the presidency , has accelerated rapidly . That return , and that acceleration , are not coincidences either .\nThe Russian Putin blames the most for bungling Ukraine \u2019 s Orange Revolution is Dmitry Medvedev , erstwhile placeholder president , now relegated to the position of sinecurist premier and scapegoat for of Russia \u2019 s expanding domestic problems . Medvedev is further burdened with being the meek fool who botched the Russo-Georgian summer war of 2008 ( he started it too late and finished it too early , according to Putin ) and allowed NATO to depose Muammar Gaddafi with a no-fly zone . Never again , Dima .\nMedvedev \u2019 s antithesis is a man named Vladislav Surkov , the variously and sporadically employed \u201c grey cardinal \u201d of the Kremlin , who is credited with consolidating Putin \u2019 s power , post-Orange Revolution , and conceiving of the concept of \u201c sovereign democracy , \u201d now Russia \u2019 s second largest export after oil . Indeed , Surkov has become the Scarlet Pimpernel of Euromaidan , allegedly spotted here , there and everywhere in Ukraine , yet existing only ( so far ) as a sinister rumor .\nSurkovian is an adjective that Westerners would do well acquaint themselves with when trying to understand what \u2019 s happening in either Kiev or Moscow . It means politics taken to the level of a retrovirus : co-opt anything organic , trick it into thinking it \u2019 s still healthy , then liquidate it by slow measures . It means agents provocateurs and pseudo-oppositions and just enough meaningless liberty to make society not care about the real thing . It means fashioning loyalist youth-mobs which set upon a very green and very limited genuine opposition by depicting it as a Nazi fifth column of the U.S. State Department . It means unleashing hell when the moment is right and then presenting the aftermath as a warning of what happens if the status quo is not maintained .
