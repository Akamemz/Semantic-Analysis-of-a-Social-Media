    "content": "( CNN ) The aggressive Jeb Bush that his allies have been waiting for emerged this week -- and it was an attack on his family that got him going .\nThe former Florida governor launched his most forceful attempt yet to paint Donald Trump as an unserious candidate unfit for the foreign policy decisions that face the country 's commander in chief .\nFirst , he punched back hard at Trump 's suggestion that his brother , George W. Bush , bore responsibility for the September 11 , 2001 , attacks and that Trump could have prevented them .\nIn a series of interviews , Bush then questioned Trump 's intellectual heft and understanding of complex world events .\nTuesday , he leveled his most blistering critique to date , with a National Review op-ed accusing the real estate magnate of echoing `` the attacks of ( liberal filmmaker ) Michael Moore and the fringe left '' on national security issues .\n`` Let 's be clear : Donald Trump simply does n't know what he 's talking about , '' Bush wrote , adding that Trump 's `` bluster overcompensates for a shocking lack of knowledge on the complex national-security challenges that will confront the next president . ''\nThis is a critical moment for Bush , who like other establishment Republicans has been unable to break through against Trump . As much as Bush and his allies like to talk about having resources for the long game early next year , the next few weeks are key for whether his foreign policy message and electability arguments will click into place and capture the interest of voters .\nPolls have shown very little excitement about his candidacy in any sector of the Republican base . That fact is not only evident in polls , but also in interviews with voters on the ground in early states who often describe Bush as lacking dynamism , enthusiasm and energy .\nDespite heavy advertising in New Hampshire and an impressive list of endorsements in the early states , a CNN/ORC Poll released this week showed Bush tied in an unimpressive third place with Florida rival Marco Rubio at 8 % .\nAnd even after raising $ 13.4 million last quarter , many heavy-hitting Republican donors -- particularly those who supported Mitt Romney -- are still on the sidelines , attracted to the candidacy of Marco Rubio and eying other contenders like John Kasich and even Chris Christie .\nAs part of the campaign to assuage concerns of donors and allies who have watched in surprise as he struggles , Bush 's longtime strategist Mike Murphy -- who runs the Right to Rise super PAC -- also emerged in a rare interview to blast Trump as a `` false zombie front-runner '' and outline his `` theory of the race '' on why Bush will outlast the other GOP candidates .\n`` He 's dead politically , he 'll never be president of the United States , ever , '' Murphy said of Trump in an interview with Bloomberg Politics . Murphy , who is legally prohibited from coordinating with the Bush campaign , jabbed Trump by predicting that his bid would collapse and adding `` I do n't think you can be a front-runner if you 're totally un-electable . ''\nNoting that he 's worked with Bush for 18 years , Murphy argued that Bush `` builds slowly and gets better and better , '' pointing to his improved debate performances as an example of that .\nSome of Bush 's most stalwart supporters have long felt that a pivot to foreign policy could help his standing in the field .\nHis exchange with Trump after the real estate magnate called his brother 's administration `` a disaster '' during the CNN debate was one of his strongest performances of the night , and this week 's 9/11 debate seemed to help him sharpen his critiques of Trump .\nBush allies still believe Rubio is vulnerable on the question of experience because of his short stint in the U.S. Senate and the ease with which his rivals could compare him to Barack Obama , who won the presidency just four years into his first term on Capitol Hill .\nAnd while his bungled response to questions about his brother 's decision to invade Iraq created problems for Bush earlier this summer , the renewed debate over 9/11 this week offered Bush an opening to critique Bill Clinton 's handling of Osama bin Laden in the 1990s .\n`` The Clinton administration made a mistake of thinking bin Laden had to be viewed from a law enforcement perspective , '' Bush said in an interview with FOX 's Sean Hannity . `` Similarly , President Obama 's polices seemed to be focused on that as well . ''\nMurphy appeared to use Bush 's air war this week to emphasize the candidate 's staying power .\n`` He can outlast the noise , his candidate performance will be excellent and we 're an amplifier , '' Murphy said in the Bloomberg Politics interview , alluding to the $ 100 million war chest raised by the independent group earlier this summer . Laying out the super PAC 's strategy for navigating the primary , he argued that the group can keep Bush on the air and get his message out through the gantlet of primaries .\n`` We see February 1 to March 15 , 45 days , as our period to seize the nomination and get in front , '' Murphy said , outlining his theory of the race . `` We have the resources to pursue that campaign .
