Additionally , Illinoisans will be able to carry up to 500 milligrams of THC in a cannabis-infused product , such as gummies .\nThe law creates the Restore , Reinvest and Renew program , which will give 25 percent of cannabis revenues to communities disproportionately impacted by disinvestment \u2014 after legalization costs associated with enforcement and expungement of old records are met .\nMedical marijuana patients will be able to have five plants in their homes \u2014 a change made during negotiations among lawmakers earlier this year .\nThere were also changes made in the expungement provisions of the measure , which would have initially automatically expunged hundreds of thousands of marijuana possession convictions .\nNow , convictions dealing with amounts of cannabis up to 30 grams will be dealt with through the governor \u2019 s clemency process , which does not require individuals to initiate the process . For amounts of between 30 and 500 grams , the state \u2019 s attorney or an individual can petition the court to vacate the conviction .\nNew conflict of interest provisions were also added , which ban lawmakers and their family members , as well as state employees , from being able to get a cannabis business license for two years . New changes also included strengthening language to ensure employers can maintain a zero tolerance drug policy .\nDesigned to address concerns about impaired driving , the bill also includes the addition of a DUI Task Force led by Illinois State Police to examine best practices .
