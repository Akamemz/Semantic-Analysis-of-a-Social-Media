    "content": "Hollywood joined forces Tuesday with Democrats vowing to fight Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai \u2019 s proposal to repeal net neutrality , an Obama-era rule once described by Sen. Ted Cruz as \u201c Obamacare for the internet . \u201d\nAn alliance of celebrities , progressives and liberal lawmakers denounced Mr. Pai \u2019 s draft plan to dismantle the 2015 Title II regulations , enacted to ensure that high-speed internet providers treat web traffic equally and prevent them from charging different prices for different services .\n\u201c Taking away # NetNeutrality is the Authoritarian dream , \u201d said actor Mark Ruffalo , who stars as the Hulk in \u201c Thor : Ragnarok. \u201d Comedian Patton Oswalt urged foes to \u201c bombard \u201d Mr. Pai with messages against the draft proposal .\n\u201c I know . We \u2019 ve faced a lot of issues threatening our democracy in the last year , \u201d actress Alyssa Milano tweeted . \u201c But honestly , the @ FCC and @ AjitPaiFCC \u2019 s dismantling of # NetNeutrality is one of the biggest . THIS IS A HUGE DEAL . \u201d\nThe outcry is unlikely to sway Mr. Pai , who decried net neutrality as \u201c heavy-handed , utility-style regulations \u201d that have stymied investment , deterred innovation and placed the federal bureaucracy in charge of the internet .\nHe described the FCC \u2019 s party-line vote two years ago under pressure from President Obama to impose the regulatory framework as a mistake .\n\u201c Under my proposal , the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet , \u201d Mr. Pai said in a statement . \u201c Instead , the FCC would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that \u2019 s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate . \u201d\nHis draft , which he shared Tuesday with the other four commissioners , would also increase transparency by restoring the oversight role of the Federal Trade Commission .\n\u201c Additionally , as a result of my proposal , the Federal Trade Commission will once again be able to police ISPs , protect consumers , and promote competition , just as it did before 2015 , \u201d Mr. Pai said . \u201c Notably , my proposal will put the federal government \u2019 s most experienced privacy cop , the FTC , back on the beat to protect consumers \u2019 online privacy . \u201d\nDemocrats were not convinced . \u201c The FCC is siding with big corporations by releasing a plan to claw back # NetNeutrality rules , \u201d said Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand , New York Democrat . \u201c They were hoping you wouldn \u2019 t notice . We must fight back to defend a free and open internet . \u201d\nNet neutrality may not be a burning issue for most voters , but it became a cause celebre in Hollywood in part after comedian John Oliver began championing the rule as host of \u201c Last Week Tonight \u201d in 2014 .\nNARAL Pro-Choice America said the proposed repeal \u201c would make it harder to get information on how and where to access abortion . And it will make it harder for activists to organize against Trump \u2019 s anti-choice , racist , extremist agenda . \u201d\nHow ? NARAL said the Title II rule change would allow \u201c extremists to pay to block access to accurate information about reproductive health \u201d by loosening rules on internet service providers such as Verizon and Comcast .\nRepublicans have dismissed the uproar as politically motivated fearmongering , pointing out that the rules established under President Clinton were in place for nearly 20 years , prompting $ 1.5 trillion in investment and resulting in what Mr. Pai called \u201c an internet economy that became the envy of the world . \u201d\n\u201c Some of America \u2019 s greatest companies were born on the internet , \u201d Sen. Steve Daines , Montana Republican , said in a statement . \u201c By dismantling harmful internet regulations , American companies will have an open internet that allows their business , and our economy , to grow . \u201d\nRep. Steve Scalise , Louisiana Republican , called the 2015 rules \u201c a solution in search of a problem that didn \u2019 t exist \u201d and described them as \u201c 1930s-era utility-style regulations [ that ] have no business being applied to the internet in the 21st century . \u201d\nThe only disagreement among Republicans came from those who have advocated for a legislative solution rather than an FCC vote that could easily be overturned under a Democratic administration .\n\u201c The last administration \u2019 s approach of regulating the internet with Depression-era phone rules is deeply flawed , \u201d said Sen. John Thune , South Dakota Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation . \u201c While I support Chairman Pai \u2019 s efforts as an improvement , I still strongly believe the only way to create long-term certainty for the internet ecosystem is for Congress to pass a bipartisan law . \u201d\nSen. Mike Lee , Utah Republican , introduced legislation in May to scrap the rule requiring internet service providers to treat all web traffic the same . House Republicans passed a bill to do so in April 2016 .\n\u201c Now is the time to end government micromanagement of the internet and let it thrive without federal , state , or local meddling , \u201d Mr. Cruz , Texas Republican , said in a tweet .\nThe proposed rule change is expected to pass , given that two of the commission \u2019 s five members \u2014 Mr. Pai and Michael O \u2019 Rielly \u2014 voted against net neutrality when it came up for a vote in 2015 , and a third , Commissioner Brendan Carr , has said he would vote for the repeal .\n\u201c I look forward to casting my vote in favor of restoring the 20-year , bipartisan approach under which the free and open internet flourished , \u201d Mr. Carr said in a Tuesday statement .\nThe commission \u2019 s Democrats , Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel , are expected to vote against the proposal .
