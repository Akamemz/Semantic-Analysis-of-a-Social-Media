It \u2019 ll be interesting to see how the Democrats fare on their \u201c America sucks ! \u201d platform . The last week has seen Team Donkey take brave stands against the flag and celebrating our military , and you would half expect them to next advocate something insanely suicidal , like taking your health insurance or forcing you to pay for illegal aliens \u2019 doctors .\nWho are these lunatics ? Do they really think this is going to play in America as well as it does in Chicago , Manhattan and Scat Francisco ?\nNot that they would know it , since they don \u2019 t know any real Americans .
