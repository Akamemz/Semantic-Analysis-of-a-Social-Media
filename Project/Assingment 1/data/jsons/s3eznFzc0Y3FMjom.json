    "content": "Nearly a century and a quarter ago , several dozen Yiddish-speaking socialists published in New York City on April 22 , 1897 the first issue of Forverts , the name inspired by Vorwarts , the house organ of the German socialist party . Over the decades Forverts became The Forward , a metropolitan daily in Yiddish with a nationwide circulation of more than a quarter of a million . It remained a synthesis of socialist claptrap , depicted preposterously as something having to do with Judaism .\nToday The Forward is in English , but it continues to rejoice in , well , now it \u2019 s \u201c progressivism. \u201d Its circulation is only 30,000 , \u201c a small publication with an outside influence \u201d according to an appraisal last week by the sympathetic and generally liberal NPR . What we can say is that , in the era of new and influential politically conservative Jewish websites , The Forward remains a relic of left-wing Judaism . You would find more support for Israel in many Christian churches than among the newspaper \u2019 s editors who , not incidentally , also remain in that perennial socialist time-warp , as if Marx had never been discredited , and as if Bernie Sanders had studied economics and that he is coherent .\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions \u2019 s decision on March 2 \u201c to recuse himself from dealing with investigations relating to Russia \u2019 s involvement in the elections , \u201d observed Nathan Guttman in The Forward the next day , \u201c make [ Deputy Attorney General Rod ] Rosenstein , once he wins Senate confirmation , the government official who would lead the probe into Trump \u2019 s Russian connections\u2026 \u201d\nRod J. Rosenstein has integrity . Even this leftist publication The Forward described the 52-year-old Rosenstein as \u201c the least partisan figure \u201d Trump has appointed . Noting that Harvard Law School graduate Rosenstein was the longest-serving U.S attorney , the article reported that he had worked in the Bill Clinton Justice Department before serving as the U.S. attorney for Maryland under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama . Hardly a cheerleader for President Donald Trump , the newspaper quoted law professor Carl Tobias praising Rosenstein \u2019 s \u201c independence \u201d and \u201c professionalism. \u201d All this was written before the Senate \u2019 s recent overwhelming confirmation of Rosenstein to be deputy attorney general under the contentious and barely-confirmed Attorney General Jeff Sessions . President Trump in January had picked Rosenstein as acting attorney general after Trump had sacked acting AG ( and Obama holdover ) Sally Yates January 30 for insubordination . Yates a few days ago testified disingenuously . All this brings us to :\n2 . Democrats supported Rod J. Rosenstein to be deputy attorney general . On April 3 the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 19-to-1 ( this is not a typo ) to report the Rosenstein nomination to the full Senate . Only Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal voted no , because Rosenstein said he would appoint a special counsel ( for the Russia investigation ) \u201c whenever I determine it \u2019 s appropriate based on the polices and procedures of the Department of Justice \u201d ; that wasn \u2019 t good enough for Blumenthal who wanted Rosenstein \u2019 s absolute commitment to appoint a special prosecutor . Rosenstein , Blumenthal conceded , is \u201c what we value in the Department of Justice : someone committed to the rule of law. \u201d But Blumenthal was the lone committee vote against Rosenstein because \u201c I have been surprised and disappointed that he has failed to heed my request. \u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who is no shrinking violet , praised Rosenstein \u2019 s \u201c reputation of integrity that \u2019 s unusual for this administration \u2019 s nominees. \u201d And two weeks ago the U.S. Senate confirmed Rosenstein \u2019 s nomination by the razor-thin margin of 94-to-6 . At that time , the right-wing extremist , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer noted that Rosenstein \u201c had developed a reputation for integrity . \u201d\nThat was then , this is now . Remember it was just a few months ago that assorted prominent Democrats wanted Comey \u2019 s scalp . And even this week Comey again made a fool of himself with his \u201c mildly nauseous \u201d conditional mea culpa , explaining that if he had to do it all over again , he would still exercise bad judgment and demonstrate incompetence . Now , they are aghast that Trump fired Comey abruptly , when presumably he should have done so earlier . Hence , there must be a sinister motive . When Democrats were on the networks last night charging a cover-up , they were asked for proof and offered none .\nCNN \u2019 s Jeffrey Toobin , who alternates at the network between political kibitzer and legal analyst , said the firing of FBI Director James Comey is an \u201c extraordinary abuse of power \u201d and a \u201c dark day \u201d for America . MSNBC \u2019 s Chris Matthews is famous mainly for saying on his network that covering Barack Obama gave him a \u201c thrill up his leg , \u201d a phrase open to new interpretation , given the newly-published critically acclaimed biography of Obama that implies that as a young man Obama was sexually ecumenical . Matthews finds the Comey firing to be \u201c a little whiff of fascism. \u201d Toobin has termed yesterday the \u201c Tuesday night massacre \u201d that will \u201c disgrace \u201d Donald Trump . For balance on CNN even Richard Nixon \u2019 s lawyer John Dean , who threw his client under the bus , said comparisons to Nixon \u2019 s firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox as part of the \u201c Saturday night massacre \u201d were overdrawn . And we \u2019 re not just talking day of the week .\nIn contrast , Alan Dershowitz last night on CNN said that Jim Comey lacked the credibility to be the FBI Director and should have resigned because neither Democrats nor Republicans have confidence in him . Dershowitz , himself a liberal Democrat , said that Trump had previously and appropriately replaced Acting AG Sally Yates ; Dershowitz saw no connection between the two firings ( Yates and Comey ) . Indeed , Dershowitz suggested his fellow liberals take a deep breadth and monitor who Trump names as Comey \u2019 s successor . What a concept \u2014 see if Trump appoints a political hack as FBI Director ; or perhaps he will appoint someone greatly respected for probity in the mold of , well\u2026 Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein ? As a talking-head expert , Dershowitz is proving to be , for CNN , volatile and unpredictable , even nuanced in his view of Trump and the administration .\n( Note to Toobin , Matthews , and the mainstream media : Firing the FBI Director does not end the bureau \u2019 s ongoing investigation . It continues . )\nIf you believe Toobin and Matthews and the pervasive hysteria among the liberal media ( a redundancy ) , then you have to assume that Rod Rosenstein , quite implausibly , is part of the conspiracy to obstruct justice , that is , to scuttle the current Department of Justice investigation into the Trump-Russia allegations and to cover-up the cover-up . That is like knowing when to sell your stocks before the crash , and also when to get back in the market precisely before it recovers .\nAfter all , Jeff Sessions recused himself , so Rosenstein is the point man in a sensitive , potentially explosive investigation involving the president of the United States and those around him , so are we to assume that Rosenstein is not the honest man and consummate professional , so acknowledged repetitively and contemporaneously by even Democrat partisans ? Of course , Rosenstein is irrelevant , I suppose , if Trump appoints a crook to head the FBI . But won \u2019 t that be obvious ?\nWhat \u2019 s more , President Trump \u2014 in his letter to Comey firing him , cited not only AG Sessions but Deputy AG Rosenstein . Indeed , it is Rosenstein \u2019 s two-page memorandum to Sessions that makes the masterfully succinct case against Comey . Titled \u201c Restoring Public Confidence in the FBI , \u201d the memorandum is worth reading .\nTo summarize , Rosenstein notes that FBI Director Comey on July 5 , 2016 , usurped the Attorney General \u2019 s authority when he ( Comey ) concluded the case against Hillary Clinton should be closed without prosecution . Quite simply , this was not his decision to make . We all recall the bumbling charade , where Comey explained all the reasons why Hillary should be indicted and prosecuted , and we waited for the punch line . But it seems that Comey had unilaterally concluded and now said she should not be prosecuted \u2014 thus also taking off the hook then Attorney General Loretta Lynch , who had recused herself , after her awkward meeting with Bill Clinton , the possible criminal defendant \u2019 s spouse , on the airport tarmac . Absent Comey \u2019 s mind boggling acrobatics , the DOJ would have had to make the call on Hillary .\nIn the Rosenstein memorandum , which is receiving insufficient attention , Rosenstein noted that Comey \u2019 s news conference with its \u201c derogatory information \u201d about Hillary was \u201c a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do. \u201d There is much more \u2014 quite simply , the memorandum will be memorialized in history as the definitive judgment on why Comey should have been replaced by President Trump at the outset .\nBut he wasn \u2019 t .

The Rosenstein memorandum was perhaps proofread and finalized on May 9 , but surely the AG knew it was in the works . No leaks , here !\nBy all account , Trump , Sessions , Rosenstein , et . al . were playing such inside baseball they did not even know Comey was in Los Angeles .
