    "content": "Early last year , when federal investigations into public corruption dominated the headlines , a longtime ally of House Speaker Michael Madigan gave a little advice to a ComEd vice president , according to an explosive court document filed Friday .\nLobbyist Mike McClain allegedly told the utility executive that , \u201c I would say to you don \u2019 t put anything in writing . \u201d\nThe two then discussed a \u201c favor \u201d for Madigan that federal prosecutors now say was part of a brazen , years-long Chicago-style bribery scheme that sent $ 1.3 million to Madigan \u2019 s associates for doing little or no work for the utility , all while ComEd hoped to land Madigan \u2019 s support for legislation in Springfield worth more than $ 150 million .\nComEd has now been charged in federal court with bribery and is expected to pay a $ 200 million fine \u2014 believed to be the largest criminal fine ever in Chicago \u2019 s federal court . Several politicians , including Democratic Gov . J.B. Pritzker , said Madigan should resign if the allegations against one of the most powerful Democrats in the state are true .\nWhile the bombshell case implicates several individuals in the alleged scheme , no one else has been criminally charged . And that includes Madigan .\n\u201c Our investigation is ongoing , \u201d U.S. Attorney John Lausch said repeatedly at a Friday news conference outside the Dirksen Federal Courthouse when asked about additional criminal charges .\nIn fact , the feds earlier on Friday hit Madigan with a fresh subpoena that appears to seriously expand the investigation , with inquiries about AT & T Services Inc. , Walgreens and Rush University Medical Center . The document , obtained by the Sun-Times , also seeks records concerning a laundry list of Madigan \u2019 s top supporters , including former Aldermen Mike Zalewski and Frank OIivo , current 13th Ward Ald . Marty Quinn , ComEd and Exelon , McClain , properties in Chinatown , previously written about by the Sun-Times , and former Ald . Danny Solis .\nWalgreens had no comment . AT & T did not respond to a request for comment . Rush said in a statement only that it \u201c has received and is cooperating with a subpoena for records reflecting work by , and communications with , certain government relations consultants for the period 2014 to the present . \u201d\nThe Sun-Times first revealed in January 2019 that Solis has for years cooperated with federal prosecutors . It also reported that the FBI recorded Madigan during a meeting with Solis and a developer hoping to build a hotel also in the Chinatown neighborhood . The Sun-Times report about the feds \u2019 Madigan recording , also in January 2019 , landed nine days before McClain told the ComEd vice president on Feb. 7 , 2019 , not to put things in writing .\nSolis also helped the feds build their case against indicted 14th Ward Ald . Ed Burke . A grand jury number on the subpoena delivered to Madigan on Friday matches the grand jury number in the Burke case , court records show .\nA Madigan spokeswoman said Friday in a statement that he plans to cooperate and \u201c has done nothing criminal or improper . \u201d\n\u201c The speaker has never helped someone find a job with the expectation that the person would not be asked to perform work by their employer , nor did he ever expect to provide anything to a prospective employer if it should choose to hire a person he recommended , \u201d the statement said . \u201c He has never made a legislative decision with improper motives and has engaged in no wrongdoing here . Any claim to the contrary is unfounded . \u201d\nThe court document outlining the bribery details against ComEd largely paints a picture of McClain pressuring ComEd officials to give jobs , contracts and money to Madigan associates .\nIt alleges that Madigan and McClain sought from ComEd jobs , contracts and money for various Madigan associates between 2011 and 2019 , and that McClain acted on Madigan \u2019 s behalf .\nThe court documents in the case do not identify Madigan , or even McClain , by name . Rather , they refer to a \u201c Public Official A \u201d who serves as the speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives . The Sun-Times has separately identified McClain as the person identified in the documents as \u201c Individual A . \u201d\nMadigan \u2019 s quiet but iron-fisted control over his chamber has earned him the nickname \u201c The Velvet Hammer , \u201d and lobbyists and fellow legislators frequently toss around the maxim , \u201c Never bet against the speaker. \u201d The 78-year-old harkens back to the days of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley , whom Madigan considers his mentor .\nThe criminal charge against ComEd follows more than a year of intrigue regarding the feds \u2019 public corruption investigations and whether their work would ever touch Madigan . The new allegations against him became public as part of a deal ComEd struck with the U.S. Attorney \u2019 s office commonly known as a deferred-prosecution agreement . If ComEd abides by the terms of the three-year arrangement , the bribery charge filed Friday is expected to be dismissed .\nThe agreement said ComEd will cooperate in the prosecutors \u2019 investigations . Unlike in other such agreements , though , ComEd is not expected to plead guilty and formally admit to the criminal conduct . A judge still has to approve the deal .\nA statement of facts attached to the agreement lays out the details of the allegations . They include claims that Madigan sought a job for Zalewski upon his retirement from the City Council , that Madigan had for decades ran an \u201c old-fashioned patronage system \u201d including getting people jobs as ComEd meter readers , that Madigan had an associate appointed to ComEd \u2019 s board of directors in 2019 \u2014 former McPier CEO Juan Ochoa \u2014 and even that ComEd hired students from Madigan \u2019 s ward for an internship program .\nThe allegations in the document date back to 2011 , when it said McClain and a lobbyist identified by the Sun-Times as John Hooker developed a plan to help two Madigan associates by funneling money through a consulting company and treating them as subcontractors . ComEd would not pay the unidentified men directly but rather increase its payments to the consulting company to cover the two Madigan associates . Meanwhile , contracts and invoices made it falsely appear that those payments were in return for the consultant \u2019 s advice on \u201c legislative issues \u201d and \u201c legislative risk management activities . \u201d\nRead the documents An information and statement of facts filed in federal court Friday end a federal criminal investigation into a years-long bribery scheme . Read the complete legal documents here .\nIn May 2018 Madigan \u2014 through McClain \u2014 allegedly asked then-ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore to hire Zalewski , the feds allege . Another deal was then struck to pay Zalewski $ 5,000 monthly as a subcontractor for the consultant . Pramaggiore allegedly agreed that Madigan would get to tell Zalewski about the arrangement .\nA spokesman for Pramaggiore , who later became a senior executive for Exelon but retired last year , said in a statement that \u201c Ms . Pramaggiore has done nothing wrong and any inference to the contrary is misguided and false . \u201d\nAlso in May 2018 , McClain allegedly told the ComEd vice president \u2014 identified by the Sun-Times as Fidel Marquez \u2014 why the Madigan associates were being paid . He explained that one of them was \u201c one of the top three precinct captains \u201d who also \u201c trains people how to go door to door . . . so just to give you an idea how important the guy is . \u201d\nMarquez could not be reached for comment Friday , nor could McClain .\nIn February 2019 , McClain allegedly told Hooker how to explain the payments within the company . McClain allegedly said , \u201c We had to hire these guys because ( Madigan ) came to us . It \u2019 s just that simple . \u201d\nTwo days later , the consultant allegedly cautioned Marquez that ComEd should not tamper with the arrangement because \u201c your money comes from Springfield \u201d and the consultant had \u201c every reason to believe \u201d McClain had spoken to Madigan about the deal .\nThe consultant allegedly added that the Madigan associates \u201c keep their mouth shut , and , you know , so . But , do they do anything for me on a day-to-day basis ? No. \u201d He said the payments were made \u201c to keep ( Madigan ) happy , I think it \u2019 s worth it , because you \u2019 d hear otherwise . \u201d\nThe document also alleges Madigan sought the appointment of Ochoa to the ComEd board of directors through McClain in 2017 . However , opposition within the company to that appointment in May 2018 allegedly prompted Pramaggiore to ask McClain if Madigan would be satisfied with a part-time job for Ochoa that paid the same amount as the board position \u2014 $ 78,000 a year .\nMcClain allegedly told Pramaggiore that Madigan would appreciate it if she would \u201c keep pressing \u201d for the appointment . Pramaggiore allegedly agreed to do so , telling McClain later in the year that , \u201c you take good care of me and so does our friend ( Madigan ) and I will do the best that I can to , to take care of you . \u201d\nFinally , the document alleges that ComEd agreed in 2011 to retain a law firm in an attempt to influence Madigan . When that law firm \u2019 s contract came up for renewal in 2016 , it said ComEd sought to reduce the hours of legal work down from 850 hours specified in an earlier agreement . An attorney from the law firm then complained to McClain .\nThat \u2019 s when McClain allegedly wrote to Pramaggiore , reminding her \u201c how valuable \u201d that lawyer was to \u201c our Friend . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c I know the drill , and so do you . If you do not get involve ( sic ) and resolve this issue of 850 hours for his law firm per year then he will go to our Friend. \u201d He allegedly wrote that Madigan \u201c will call me , and then I will call you . \u201d\nHe concluded , \u201c Is this a drill we must go through ? \u201d",
