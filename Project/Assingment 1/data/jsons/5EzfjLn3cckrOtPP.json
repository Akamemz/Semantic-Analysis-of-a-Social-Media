All seven types of aircraft it tracked , from cargo planes to fighters like the F/A-18D , had repeatedly missed goals for being prepared for missions . \u201c Aviation readiness will take many years to recover , \u201d the GAO said .\nIn a report last month , the GAO found that only about 25 % of Navy shipyard repairs were completed on time . \u201c The Navy continues to face persistent and substantial maintenance delays that affect the majority of its maintenance efforts and hinder its attempts to restore readiness , \u201d it said .\nThe services \u2019 problems with readiness burst into public view in the summer of 2017 , when two American destroyers collided with two commercial ships in separate incidents that left 17 sailors dead and scores injured . They were the Navy \u2019 s worst accidents at sea since the 1970s .\nBoth the USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S. McCain were deployed to the 7th Fleet , based in Yokosuka , Japan . What both ships needed , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found , was more time to train and more sailors .\nNeither ship was fully qualified for its battle missions ; neither ship had a full crew ; both ships had patched together navigation systems that failed to work at times .\nSailors on both ships described being shortchanged in training and exhausted by the pace of operations . One-hundred-hour work weeks were not uncommon .\nOn the Fitzgerald , for instance , a sailor had to manually press a button more than 1,000 times to refresh a radar screen tracking nearby traffic . On the evening of the collision on June 17 , the Fitzgerald was under the control of a relatively inexperienced officer who ordered the destroyer to turn directly into the path of a cargo carrier .\nOn the McCain , the Navy had installed a touch-screen navigation system as a cheaper alternative to traditional steering wheels and throttles . The design of the new system was so confusing that the sailors using it accidentally guided the McCain into an oil tanker in the Singapore Strait on Aug. 21 .\nDakota Bordeaux , the young sailor steering the ship , said of the new navigation system , \u201c There was actually a lot of functions on there that I had no clue what on earth they did . \u201d\nIt was not that the Navy was unaware of the problems . Top commanders had simply ignored urgent messages for help . Military leaders wanted missions completed . They cared less about whether the men and women on duty were forced to cut corners to do them .\nIn January 2013 , Vice Adm. Thomas Copeman issued a warning at the Surface Navy Association Symposium , one of the premier gatherings of Navy officers in charge of warships . Readiness , he said , was headed toward a \u201c downward spiral . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s getting harder and harder I think for us to look the troops in the eye , \u201d Copeman told the audience .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re an admiral in the Navy , \u201d he later told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c you may have to make that decision to send people into combat , and you better not have blood on your hands the rest of your life because you didn \u2019 t do everything you could in peacetime to make them ready . \u201d\nThe Navy \u2019 s surface forces needed $ 3.5 billion , he said , just to fix what was wrong with training alone . Copeman raised the specter of a \u201c hollow \u201d Navy without those additional funds .\nThree years later Janine Davidson , the undersecretary of the Navy , sounded the alarm again . The Navy remained short of adequately trained sailors and reliable ships .\n\u201c It \u2019 s sleepwalking into a level of risk you don \u2019 t realize you have , \u201d she said to \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe 7th Fleet , the largest of the Navy \u2019 s forward-deployed fleets , was perhaps most vulnerable .

Certifications , which crews received after proving they were prepared to handle crucial war-fighting duties , had dropped from 93 % completed in 2014 to 62 % in 2016 . That year , only two of the fleet \u2019 s 11 destroyers and cruisers received all recommended maintenance .

But the portrait of crisis got him nothing .\nLow-level officers on the decks of ships and high-ranking leaders up the chain of command said they made similar warnings and were shut down . Scores of sailors reached out to us and testified to some combination of fear , lack of training and an absence of confidence in the Navy \u2019 s leadership .\n\u201c If the Navy paid more attention to the job satisfaction and intrinsic motivation of sailors , then a lot of these other systemic issues will fix themselves , \u201d one sailor wrote .\nWe examined other Navy episodes directly relevant to today \u2019 s situation with Iran . In 2016 , the crew of two American gunboats was seized in the Persian Gulf by Iran \u2019 s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , the military force dominated by Qassim Suleimani , the major general killed by a drone strike outside the Baghdad Airport this month .\nThe sailors on the gunboats undertook a last-minute mission without proper training or equipment and were captured after straying into the waters surrounding an Iranian naval base on Farsi Island . An international incident was avoided only through military pressure and last-minute diplomatic maneuvers .\nWe also examined the state of the Navy \u2019 s minesweepers . The Persian Gulf is one of the few places in the world where such ships may prove indispensable . Nearly a quarter of the world \u2019 s oil supplies pass through the Strait of Hormuz at the gulf \u2019 s entrance . The Iranians have threatened to use mines to block it in case of conflict .\nThe Navy has fewer than a dozen minesweepers , many in disrepair . One sailor told us the sonar meant to detect mines was so imprecise that in training exercises it flagged dishwashers , crab traps and cars on the ocean floor as potential explosives .\n\u201c We are essentially the ships that the Navy forgot , \u201d another sailor said of his own minesweeper , which had not left port in 20 months .\nThe Department of the Navy oversees the Marine Corps . And a Marine Corps aviation accident in December 2018 raised its own questions about readiness . A midair collision between a F/A-18D Hornet and a KC-130J Hercules fuel tanker over the Pacific left six Marines dead .\nThe same patterns showed up again : Local commanders had warned higher-ups of a lack of training , nonfunctioning aircraft and faulty equipment .\nSquadron 242 , whose fighter jets were involved in the accident , was designed to leap quickly into an attack against North Korea in case of conflict .
