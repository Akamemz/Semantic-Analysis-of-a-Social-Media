But Obama \u2019 s move offers relief to more people than any other executive action in recent history \u2014 about 3.9 million people , or roughly 35 % of the estimated total unauthorized-immigrant population \u2014 a point that some opponents have used to differentiate Obama \u2019 s action from those of past presidents .\nObama \u2019 s announcement follows his decision in June 2012 to grant temporary reprieves from deportation for 1.5 million eligible unauthorized immigrants who \u2019 d been brought to the U.S. as children \u2014 the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA . In the memorandum announcing DACA , then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano framed it as part of the executive branch \u2019 s role \u201c to set forth policy for the exercise of discretion within the framework of the existing law. \u201d Obama \u2019 s action expands that program , and protects other groups , using a similar rationale .\nMost previous executive actions on immigration were targeted fairly narrowly , according to a summary compiled by the American Immigration Council . The 39 \u201c executive grants of temporary immigration relief \u201d since 1956 listed by the council covered , among other groups , Ethiopians fleeing that country \u2019 s Marxist military dictatorship in the 1970s , Liberians who escaped their country \u2019 s brutal civil wars , and foreign students whose academic eligibility was interrupted by Hurricane Katrina .\nOther actions taken by prior administrations affected considerably more people . Most of them were eventually formalized or superseded by legislation , though sometimes \u2014 as often happens with complicated subjects such as immigration \u2014 the new laws led to new issues .\nCubans fleeing Castro : In early 1961 , at a time when thousands of Cubans were trying to escape the new Castro government , President Kennedy directed Health , Education and Welfare Secretary Abraham Ribicoff to set up a \u201c Cuban Refugee Program \u201d to provide federal assistance to Cuban refugees , including medical care , financial aid , help with education and resettlement , and child welfare services . That program was formalized the following year by the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act , and by subsequent legislation . By 1971 , 600,000 Cuban refugees had entered the U.S. ; as of 2012 there were more than 1 million Cubans living in the U.S. who had immigrated since 1959 ( representing 97 % of all Cuban immigrants ) , according to the 2012 American Community Survey .\nThe Cuban program , however , sparked a lawsuit from would-be immigrants from elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere , who argued that the immigrant visas given to Cuban refugees unfairly limited spots that otherwise would be available for them . In 1977 , a federal court in Chicago ordered what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service to issue so-called \u201c Silva letters \u201d to about 250,000 people \u2014 nearly all Mexicans living in the Southwest , according to a 1985 Los Angeles Times article \u2014 giving them temporary protection from deportation and letting them work while the complex case worked its way through the courts . Eventually , about 145,000 Silva letter holders received visas ; the rest ( at least those who were still living in the U.S. ) remained in administrative limbo until the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act enabled them to apply for legal permanent residency .\nRefugees from the Indochina wars : In early 1975 , when it became clear South Vietnam was going to fall to the communist North , the Ford administration evacuated around 130,000 Vietnamese from Saigon . Ford and his successor , Jimmy Carter , subsequently allowed more Vietnamese , Cambodian and Laotian refugees to come to the U.S. ; between 1975 and 1979 , about 360,000 people from the countries of Indochina were allowed to remain in the country .\nMariel boatlift : Between April and October 1980 , approximately 125,000 Cubans and 25,000 Haitians ( who were trying to escape that nation \u2019 s grinding poverty and the brutal Duvalier dictatorship ) arrived in south Florida by boat . The Carter administration used its discretionary authority to admit most of them into the country ; those migrants eventually were made legal permanent residents by the 1986 immigration-reform law .\nSpouses and children : The 1986 law , however , created a new dilemma : how to deal with spouses and children of newly-legalized immigrants who didn \u2019 t themselves qualify for legal status . In October 1987 , the Reagan administration said it wouldn \u2019 t seek to deport minor children living with their parents as long as both parents qualified for amnesty under the 1986 law . Reagan \u2019 s successor , George H.W . Bush , expanded that policy in February 1990 : Under the new \u201c family fairness \u201d rules , all spouses and unmarried children of people who gained legal status under the 1986 law could apply for permission to remain in the country and receive work permits . Bush \u2019 s policy was formalized later that year as part of the Immigration Act of 1990 .\nCentral American refugees : The conflicts in El Salvador , Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America in the 1980s and early 1990s led to a new series of executive actions on immigration . In July 1987 , Attorney General Edwin Meese announced that the approximately 200,000 Nicaraguan exiles then living in the U.S. would not be deported so long as they had a \u201c well-founded fear of persecution. \u201d Meese also encouraged them to seek work permits and reapply for asylum if they \u2019 d been denied before .\nA similar number of Salvadoran refugees were allowed to remain in the country in \u201c temporary protected status \u201d under the provisions of the 1990 immigration law . When that status expired two years later , Bush extended it ; his successor , Bill Clinton , extended it again , until the end of 1994 . Eventually , the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 allowed Nicaraguans , Salvadorans , Guatemalans and others to apply to become legal permanent residents . This opportunity was eventually extended to several thousand Haitian migrants ( estimates range from 20,000 to 40,000 ) who \u2019 d been left out of the 1997 law \u2014 first by executive action from President Clinton , and ultimately through passage of the Haitian Refugee Immigrant Fairness Act enacted in October 1998 .\nChinese in U.S. : On at least one occasion , a president actively discouraged Congress from carving out an exception to the immigration laws . In November 1989 , the first President Bush vetoed a bill that would have provided emergency immigration relief for Chinese nationals in the United States following the Tiananmen Square massacre . In his veto message , Bush said that he was already providing greater protections to the Chinese through administrative actions and \u201c opposed congressional micromanagement of foreign policy. \u201d In April 1990 , Bush formalized and extended his policy by Executive Order 12711 .\nCorrection : This posting has been updated with a revised total of 3.9 million unauthorized immigrants affected by the president \u2019 s order .",
