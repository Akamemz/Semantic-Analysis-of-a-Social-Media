''\n`` People say all the time , 'Oh , we got to get the vice president out of the basement , ' '' McAuliffe told the `` monthly breakfast '' of the Norfolk City Democratic Committee . `` He 's fine in the basement .

At the Zoom videoconference , he was introduced by a senior Norfolk Democrat , Charlie Stanton , who compared soldiers who participated in the D-Day landing to modern-day Antifa members .\n`` It 's hard for the vice president to break through , '' McAuliffe told the group . `` You 've got the COVID crisis . He 's not a governor , does n't have the National Guard . He 's not the president , does n't have the briefing room . He needs to come out strategically .
