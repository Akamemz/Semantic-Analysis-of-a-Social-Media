Like all truly great reality casts , the members of Trump \u2019 s inner circle have been busy figuring out each others \u2019 weaknesses and harnessing their strengths , occasionally , it seems , with well-chiseled picks . And whereas reality-TV viewers traditionally expect to read gossip about their favorite characters in the pages of Us or In Touch , fearful members of the republic now expect similarly dishy stories in The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , and The Washington Post , all of which published alarming ( and , at times , scarily amusing ) reports this weekend illuminating the latest pecking order inside the West Wing .\nIn particular , reports focused on the fraught relationship between chief strategist Stephen Bannon and chief of staff Reince Priebus , Trump \u2019 s envoy to his base and party , respectively .

Even though the stakes are far different , it was hard to disabuse oneself of the notion that Trump was planning some version of a West Wing rose ceremony .

Bannon , for example , was credited with the \u201c extreme vetting \u201d order , which temporarily bans individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries and bars refugees from entering the U.S .
