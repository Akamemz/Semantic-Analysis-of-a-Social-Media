    "content": "More than 600 poor Pakistani girls and women were sold as brides to Chinese men over a period of nearly two years , according to investigations by authorities in the South Asian nation of 200 million people .\nA list of 629 girls and women , obtained by The Associated Press , was compiled by Pakistani investigators determined to break up trafficking networks exploiting the country 's poor and vulnerable .\nThe list gives the most concrete figure yet for the number of women caught up in the trafficking schemes since 2018 .\nBut since the time it was put together in June , the investigators ' aggressive drive against the networks has largely ground to a halt .\nOfficials with knowledge of the investigations say this is because of pressure from government officials fearful of hurting Pakistan 's lucrative ties to Beijing .\nThe biggest case against traffickers has fallen apart . In October , a court in Faisalabad acquitted 31 Chinese nationals charged in connection with trafficking .\nSeveral of the women who had initially been interviewed by police refused to testify because they were either threatened or bribed into silence , according to a court official and a police investigator familiar with the case .\nThe two spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution for speaking out .\nAt the same time , the government has sought to curtail investigations , putting `` immense pressure '' on officials from the Federal Investigation Agency pursuing trafficking networks , said Saleem Iqbal , a Christian activist who has helped parents rescue several young girls from China and prevented others from being sent there .\n`` Some ( FIA officials ) were even transferred , '' Iqbal said in an interview . `` When we talk to Pakistani rulers , they do n't pay any attention . ''\nAsked about the complaints , Pakistan 's interior and foreign ministries refused to comment .\nSeveral senior officials familiar with the events said investigations into trafficking have slowed , the investigators are frustrated , and Pakistani media have been pushed to curb their reporting on trafficking .\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals .\n`` No one is doing anything to help these girls , '' one of the officials said . `` The whole racket is continuing , and it is growing .
