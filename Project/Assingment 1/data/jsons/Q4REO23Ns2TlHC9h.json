    "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump fired his hard-charging campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , on Monday in a dramatic shake-up designed to calm panicked Republican leaders and reverse one of the most tumultuous stretches of Trump 's unconventional White House bid .\nLewandowski , in some ways as brash and unconventional as the candidate himself , had been by Trump 's side since the beginning of his unlikely rise to presumptiveGOP nominee . But he clashed with longtime operatives brought in to make the seat-of-the-pants campaign more professional .\nThe former conservative activist played a central role in daily operations , fundraising , and Trump 's search for a running mate , but Lewandowski 's aggressive approach also fueled near-constant campaign infighting that complicated Trump 's shift toward the general election .\nReached by the AP on Monday , Lewandowski deflected criticism of his approach , pointing instead to campaign chairman Paul Manafort .\n`` Paul Manafort has been in operational control of the campaign since April 7 . That 's a fact , '' Lewandowski said , declining to elaborate on his dismissal . Asked by CNN why he was fired , he said : `` I do n't know the answer to that .
