Trump calls Clinton the devil .\nFor 90 minutes Sunday night , Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton called each other liars , untrustworthy and unfit for office as they sparred not so much about their policy differences as their basic characters .\nTrump even threatened to \u201c jail \u201d Clinton if he became president . \u201c Believe me , she has tremendous hate in her heart , \u201d Trump said . Clinton accused Trump of launching distractions and diversions : \u201c Anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it 's exploding . \u201d\nIt was nearly nonstop name-calling and nastiness \u2014 they opened by dispensing with the traditional handshake , and an agitated Trump repeatedly encroached on Clinton \u2019 s physical space as he paced the debate stage . There were only brief reprieves of policy discussion , which soon devolved back into a contentious affair , even as they had to balance their attacks with flashes of geniality before a town-hall audience of undecided voters .\nFrom its earliest moments , the debate was colored by the events of the previous two days , beginning Friday with the appearance of a decade-old tape in which Trump described in graphic and sexually aggressive terms making unwanted advances on women , which he said he was entitled to do because he was a \u201c star. \u201d Legions of Republicans have abandoned his campaign over the lecherous remarks , which co-moderator Anderson Cooper described to Trump on Sunday night as amounting to \u201c sexual assault . \u201d\nTrump tried to downplay the tape \u2014 \u201c it \u2019 s just words folks , it \u2019 s just words \u201d \u2014 as he shifted the topic to former President Bill Clinton , to the Islamic State , to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails , to anything else .\n\u201c This was locker room talk , \u201d Trump said over and over .\nClinton would not let Trump off the hook . \u201c What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women , what he thinks about women , what he does to women , and he has said that the video doesn \u2019 t represent who he is , but I think it \u2019 s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is , '' she said .\nClinton framed this election as different than any other Democrat-vs.-Republican contest .\n\u201c I never questioned their fitness to serve , \u201d she said of past GOP nominees . \u201c Donald Trump is different . \u201d\nTrump said he wasn \u2019 t proud of his comments , but he accused the Democratic nominee 's husband , Bill Clinton , of far worse \u201c actions , \u201d pointing to four women whom Trump had invited into the audience with allegations against the Clintons . Trump had held a brief event with those women before the debate .\nAsked three times by Cooper whether he had physically accosted women the way he described on the tape , Trump eventually said , \u201c No I have not , \u201d though some women have publicly accused him of touching them inappropriately .\nClinton said Trump owed the American people an apology \u2014 not just for the tape but his past attacks on President Barack Obama over his birthplace , the family of a fallen soldier , and others .\n\u201c He owes the president an apology and our country an apology , and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words , \u201d she said .\nThere was no apology . Instead , more attacks , as Trump tried to make the debate about Clinton , hitting her for her private email server and saying that , as president , he would appoint a special prosecutor , and adding that \u201c you would go to jail . \u201d\nTrump cavalierly called Clinton the \u201c devil , \u201d as Trump questioned how Clinton could effect change after decades in politics , as she questioned his fundamental fitness .\n\u201c With her , it \u2019 s all talk and no action , \u201d Trump said .\nTrump arrived in St. Louis a candidate hemorrhaging support , and badly , but he did appear to find his political footing after some early moments speaking about the tape . Still , Trump did so while playing loose with the truth . Trump said again he was opposed to the war in Iraq despite public comments otherwise in 2002 .\nHe also denied that after the first debate he urged people on Twitter to look up a sex tape of a beauty pageant winner he was sparring with . \u201c It was not \u2018 check out a sex tape , \u2019 \u201d Trump said on Sunday . In fact , Trump had tweeted \u201c check out sex tape \u201d in a 5 a.m. tweet .\nIn one remarkable exchange , co-moderator Martha Raddatz pressed Trump on his Syria policy and whether he agreed with a newly aggressive posture that had been outlined by his running mate , Mike Pence , in the vice presidential debate last week .\n\u201c He and I have n't spoken , \u201d Trump said flatly . \u201c And I disagree . \u201d\nAs Trump amped up his attacks , Clinton appeared to lose her patience , accusing the billionaire of desperately trying to throw out distractions because his campaign is \u201c exploding. \u201d \u201c I know you are into big diversion , anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way Republicans are leaving you , \u201d she shot at Trump .\nFormer GOP presidential nominee John McCain led a parade of Republicans who withdrew their endorsements of Trump over the weekend , including governors , congressmen and incumbent senators in nearly every contested race this fall . Even Pence declined to campaign publicly with Trump on Saturday \u2014 an unprecedented rebuke from a running mate .\nView 12 most heated moments in an unprecedented debate Here are the most memorable and heated moments of the night from the second presidential debate in St. Louis on Sunday night .\nIn the hours ahead of the debate , former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski called Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus \u201c weak \u201d and a \u201c failed leader , \u201d and the debate itself seemed to do little to end the GOP circular firing squad .\nTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC after the debate , \u201c Some are on the list of people who wo n't support Donald Trump because they ride around on a high horse . \u201d\n\u201c I would talk to some of the members of Congress out there .
