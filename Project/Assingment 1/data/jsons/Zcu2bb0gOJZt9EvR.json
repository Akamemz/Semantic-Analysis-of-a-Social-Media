    "content": "A federal judge ruled Wednesday that President Donald J. Trump 's Health and Human Services `` conscience rule '' that allows doctors , nurses , physicians assistant and more health care providers to refuse participation in abortion based on moral and religious grounds was unconstitutional . New York attorney General Letitia James led the lawsuit on behalf of 19 states and the District of Columbia , which argued that the policy allows Americans to `` openly discriminate and refuse to provide necessary health care to patients based on providers \u2019 \u2018 religious beliefs or moral objections . ' ''\nAs explained by the Washington Post , `` The rule , proposed by Trump \u2019 s Health and Human Services \u2019 Office of Civil Rights more than a year ago , would have protected 'conscience rights ' of health care providers by boosting enforcement of at least two dozen laws that allow doctors , nurses , technicians and other providers to opt out of procedures such as abortions or gender-change procedures they object to on personal or religious grounds . ''\n`` Health care is a basic right that should never be subject to political games , '' AG James said in the lawsuit .\n`` The refusal of care rule was an unlawful attempt , '' she continued . `` We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to protect access to health care and protect the rights of all individuals . ''\nU.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer agreed with James ' argument and ruled that the HHS policy , which would have stripped organizations ' federal funding if they refused to comply with the `` conscience rule , '' was too coercive .\n`` Wherever the outermost line where persuasion gives way to coercion lies , the threat to pull all HHS funding here crosses it , '' Engelmayer said .\nStephanie Taub , Senior Counsel for First Liberty Institute , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that `` this decision leaves health care professionals across America vulnerable to being forced to perform , facilitate , or refer for procedures that violate their conscience . ''\n`` The Trump Administration \u2019 s HHS protections would ensure that health care professionals are free to work consistent with their religious beliefs while providing the best care to their patients , '' Taub added .",
