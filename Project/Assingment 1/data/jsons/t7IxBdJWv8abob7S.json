    "content": "If you want to know why women don \u2019 t come forward with allegations of sexual assault , Thursday \u2019 s Senate hearings offered a clue .\nIn the morning , an all-male panel of Republican senators hired an outside prosecutor to try to pick apart Christine Blasey Ford \u2019 s credibility live on national television . They refused to subpoena Mark Judge , the key witness , or launch the FBI investigation Ford asked for . And after hearing her testimony , and judging it credible , they simply ignored it .\nIn the afternoon , those same senators feted Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh , the man Ford accused of attacking her . They cut off the prosecutor they hired in order to give speech after speech lamenting the way he and his family have suffered . They said they didn \u2019 t question that Ford \u2019 s assault was real , but perhaps her memory was flawed ; whoever had assaulted her , could she really be trusted to say it was Kavanaugh ?\nBut Kavanaugh \u2019 s memory was beyond reproach . After calling in professional help to cross-examine Ford , they cut her off when she began to question Kavanaugh , and repeatedly apologized for troubling him and his family with all this mess .\nSen. Lindsey Graham , the South Carolina Republican , delivered an unforgettable performance . He was silent during Ford \u2019 s testimony , freely yielding his time to prosecutor Rachel Mitchell . During Kavanaugh \u2019 s testimony , however , Graham buoyed the witness and ripped into the Democrats . \u201c This is hell , \u201d he told Kavanaugh . The hearings were \u201c the most unethical sham \u201d he \u2019 d seen in his decades-long political career .\n\u201c To my Republican colleagues , \u201d Graham spat , \u201c if you vote no , you \u2019 re legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics . \u201d\nBut the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings played out in a larger context . Since the dawn of the # MeToo movement , the question has been when the backlash would come , and what form it would take .\nYou could feel it building earlier in the week . The media was reverberating after Ian Buruma , the editor of the New York Review of Books , was fired for overruling his staff and publishing a Jian Ghomeshi essay about how dozens of allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him had unfairly derailed his career . Harper \u2019 s published a similar essay at around the same time , and was also pounded for it . The terror that women \u2019 s accusations were unjustly ending men \u2019 s careers \u2014 and that there was nothing men could do about it \u2014 was boiling over . But someone needed to take a stand , and be backed up by enough power to survive that stand .\nIn retrospect , it makes perfect sense that President Donald Trump would be the one who would provide the playbook . After all , he \u2019 s been the great scourge of the # MeToo moment , the one whose misdeeds have never hurt him .\nOn Wednesday , Trump gave a press conference where he took direct aim at # MeToo . \u201c When you are guilty until proven innocent , it \u2019 s just not supposed to be that way , \u201d he said . \u201c That \u2019 s a very dangerous standard for the country. \u201d That night , CNN reported that a concerned Trump had told Kavanaugh that the time for calm denials was over ; he needed to go on offense .\nSo he did . It was the moment the # MeToo backlash truly took shape .\nIf Ford and her husband had never remodeled their house , Brett Kavanaugh \u2019 s Supreme Court nomination would have sailed through the Senate .\nAccording to Ford \u2019 s testimony , she had never told anyone of her sexual assault in detail . That changed in 2012 , when she and her husband were redoing their home and she insisted on having a second front door \u2014 a second way out of the house . Her husband couldn \u2019 t understand ; the request seemed ridiculous . Why does a house need two ways out ?\nDuring a session with their couples therapist , Ford explained , it all spilled out . She had been assaulted as a teenager . She was pushed into a room and nearly raped . Her attacker , whom she recalled then and now as Kavanaugh , clapped his hand across her mouth when she screamed , pushing down so tightly she couldn \u2019 t breathe , so tightly she thought he might kill her by accident .\nHe was laughing . His friend Mark Judge was laughing . That \u2019 s what she remembers most of all , she says \u2014 the laughter . At some point , they tumbled off the bed and she fled the room , locking herself in a bathroom until she heard them go back downstairs and their voices receded . Then she ran from the house , terrified she \u2019 d run into them on the way out and the attack would begin again .\nThat \u2019 s why she needed a second door in her house , she explained . Because in a moment of trauma , she had needed another way out , and 30 years later , there was still a part of her that couldn \u2019 t be comfortable , that couldn \u2019 t feel safe , without another way out . That \u2019 s why there \u2019 s a record from 2012 , when her therapist wrote down what Ford said ; when her husband first heard Kavanaugh \u2019 s name . That \u2019 s why her allegation was taken seriously .\nThat \u2019 s the story , through tears , that Ford told the Senate and the country on Thursday .\n\u201c I am here today not because I want to be , \u201d she said . \u201c I am terrified . I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me with Brett . \u201d\nFord \u2019 s testimony was \u2014 by wide acclaim \u2014 powerful , specific , and gutting . She was a friendly witness , trying to answer questions , asking repeatedly for an investigation to help clear the holes in her own memory , thanking the committee for the consideration they gave her . Her expertise as a professor of clinical psychology kept shining through as she offered clear , powerful explanations of how trauma worked on the brain , how it had worked on her brain .\nMitchell , the prosecutor , largely abandoned the task of questioning the core of Ford \u2019 s account . She ended up harassing Ford on points that even Republicans thought minor , like why her fear of flying hadn \u2019 t prevented her from taking past vacations , and who paid for a $ 200 polygraph test .\nFord was such a strong witness , in fact , that the fear was she had set an unreachable standard . \u201c Through no fault of her own , she has also reinforced the incredibly high bar of believability , \u201d wrote BuzzFeed \u2019 s Anne Helen Petersen :\nFord is white , upper-middle class , married , and highly educated . She is calm but demure . She is visibly shaken yet steady . She could afford the therapy that helped document her psychological past . She has a support system and the means to hire a lawyer . Imagine if you lack even one of these qualities . Imagine if your behavior , or your voice , or your face , or the life you \u2019 ve lived doesn \u2019 t perfectly match what is demanded of the ideal victim . Would you be believed ?\n\u201c Were men out there brought to tears or shaking visceral response by that ? \u201d asked New York magazine \u2019 s Rebecca Traister . \u201c Because the messages I have from women , and what \u2019 s happening in my own apartment , suggest that many many women were . \u201d\nEven Fox News was impressed . \u201c This is a disaster for the Republicans , \u201d said Fox News \u2019 s Chris Wallace .\nIf Ford did everything \u2014 and more \u2014 that could be asked of a witness , Kavanaugh did something near the opposite . He entered the hearing with his jaw set and his face flushed . His voice a near shout , he read a long , angry , unflinching , and notably Trumpish statement .\n\u201c This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit , \u201d he raged , \u201c fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election , fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record . Revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups . This is a circus . \u201d\nKavanaugh \u2019 s anger worked . Just as Ford fit society \u2019 s expectations for a victim , Kavanaugh looked like a man falsely accused : furious , fearful , tearing up when he mentioned his parents or his daughters . He laced into his tormentors , determined to clear his name . He gave no ground . He badgered and interrupted the Democrats questioning him .\nAnd in his pain , his outrage , the assembled Republican senators found their voice . Initially , they left their questioning \u2014 as they had with Ford \u2014 to Mitchell , the outside prosecutor . But after Graham refused to yield his time , choosing instead to apologize to Kavanaugh and cut into the Democrats , so too did every Republican after him . And one after the other , they apologized to Kavanaugh .\n\u201c Judge , I can \u2019 t think of a more embarrassing scandal for the United States Senate since the McCarthy hearings , \u201d said Sen. John Cornyn .\nThe Democrats \u201c have brought us to our worst in our politics , \u201d apologized Sen. Orrin Hatch . \u201c It \u2019 s certainly brought us no closer to the truth . \u201d\n\u201c This could have been handled in such a way that didn \u2019 t turn this into a circus , one that has turned your life update down and your family and the life of Dr. Ford upside down , \u201d said Sen. Mike Lee . \u201c I consider this most unfortunate . \u201d\nBut it was Sen. John Kennedy , the final questioner , who truly laid everything bare .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sorry , Judge , for what you and your family have been through , and I \u2019 m sorry for what Dr. Ford and her family have been through , \u201d he said . \u201c It could have been avoided. \u201d And then he asked : \u201c Do you believe in God ? \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to give you a last opportunity right here , right in front of God and country , \u201d Kennedy said . \u201c I want you to look me in the eye . Are Dr. Ford \u2019 s allegations true ? \u201d\nKavanaugh looked him in the eye . \u201c They \u2019 re not accurate as to me . I have not questioned that she might have been sexually assaulted at some point in her life by someone someplace . But as to me , I \u2019 ve never done this . \u201d\n\u201c That \u2019 s all I have , Judge , \u201d Kennedy said . And , with that , the hearing was over .\nThe day played out like a set piece . In the morning , Ford showed how high the bar was to even have a chance of being believed . Her story is specific , credible , serious . She \u2019 s told it to multiple people over the years . She tried to tell it to Congress before Kavanaugh was nominated . She places Kavanaugh in the town he lived , at the house of a person he knew , in a room with one of his best friends . She tried her best to be polite to the senators , to avoid offense , to show gratitude to the committee for listening to her . She took a polygraph , begged for an FBI investigation . She says she \u2019 s 100 percent sure it was Kavanaugh who attacked her .\nIn the afternoon , Kavanaugh simply denied all charges . He denied ever being blackout drunk . He denied ever forgetting anything of importance . He denied the possibility he was wrong , that it might be useful for his alleged accomplice Mark Judge to testify or for the FBI to investigate . He said Ford \u2019 s memory had failed her but was incredulous at the idea that his recall could deliver a similar error .\nAnd he fought back . He slammed his accusers ; he made clear his pain , his rage . If Ford was grateful for the opportunity to be heard , Kavanaugh was incredulous that she was being given that opportunity , that it was taking this long , that it could possibly take longer .\nAsked why the committee couldn \u2019 t take another week to investigate the claims more thoroughly , he shot back , \u201c Every day has been a lifetime. \u201d His suffering was immense , unfair , unforgivable . \u201c I \u2019 m never going to get my reputation back , \u201d he said . \u201c My life is totally and permanently altered . \u201d\nThe suffering of his accusers , women who say they \u2019 ve been living with the trauma of what he did for decades ? They were mistaken , and their claims could be , should be , for the good of the county had to be , dismissed . \u201c This grotesque character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country , \u201d he said .\nThe feminist philosopher Kate Manne coined the term \u201c himpathy \u201d to describe the \u201c tendency to dismiss the female perspective altogether , to empathize with the powerful man over his less powerful alleged female victim. \u201d What Kavanaugh did today was activate the Republican Party \u2019 s powerful sense of himpathy : His suffering was the question , and Ford \u2019 s suffering , to say nothing of any further search for the truth , slipped soundlessly beneath the water .\nWe ended the day in much the same place we started : his word against hers . But even as everyone agreed Ford \u2019 s word was credible , it didn \u2019 t matter . There was still Kavanaugh \u2019 s word . And it appeared , for Republicans on the Judiciary Committee , that that was enough . She was 100 percent sure and he was 100 percent sure , but it was his 100 percent sure that mattered .\nOn this , Trump was right . What Kavanaugh had needed to do was go on the offensive . He needed to remind the all-male Republican panel that he was the victim here , that any of them could be victims , that moving his nomination forward would be a show of strength , a message sent to the Democrats and their allies , a statement that these tactics end here and they end now . This is how you fight # MeToo : by focusing on the pain it \u2019 s causing men , by centering their suffering .\nAll of this was , perhaps , predictable . On Wednesday , a new NPR/Marist poll found that while large majorities of Democrats and independents believed Brett Kavanaugh \u2019 s Supreme Court nomination should be rejected if Christine Blasey Ford \u2019 s allegations are true , a majority of Republicans believed Kavanaugh should be confirmed even if Ford \u2019 s allegations are true . If Thursday \u2019 s hearing didn \u2019 t ultimately seem to be about the truth at all , well , perhaps that \u2019 s why : The truth was never really what Senate Republicans were after .\nBy the end of the day , Trump was thrilled . \u201c Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him , \u201d he tweeted shortly after the hearing ended . \u201c The Senate must vote ! \u201d",
