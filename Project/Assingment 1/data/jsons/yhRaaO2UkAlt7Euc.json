    "content": "In America 2018 , the dominant political tribes despise all things that make America worth a damn . The populist right rejects individualism in favor of a raw cult of personality that demands unthinking loyalty to the Great Leader . The progressive left rejects debate in favor of repressing those who would dare offer opposing views . What 's a decent person to do but spurn both political tribes and work to undermine the governments they dominate ?\n`` My husband and I are watching closely to see who supports our president , '' wrote a voter whose comments were read aloud this week by the moderator of a debate among Michigan 's Republican candidates for governor . `` We will not vote for a candidate who does not . ''\n`` No need to worry , '' noted the Center for Michigan 's Bridge magazine . `` All four candidates support President Trump . Extravagantly . ''\nAnd , in fact , the candidates competed to slip in as many mentions of the president and their connections to him as possible . `` I do n't know why , I love him , '' burbled physician Jim Hines .\nSome candidates in other states\u2014like failed West Virginia Senate hopeful Don Blankenship\u2014seek to portray themselves less as Trump proxies than as his clones . Blankenship 's opponents `` want to say , 'Trump likes me the best , ' where what we are trying to do is say , 'We are the most like Trump , ' ? '' Greg Thomas , Blankenship 's campaign manager , told The Washington Post .\nRepublican primary races across the country feature similar scrambling for the support of voters whose allegiance is to Trumpismo rather than to policies or ideology .
