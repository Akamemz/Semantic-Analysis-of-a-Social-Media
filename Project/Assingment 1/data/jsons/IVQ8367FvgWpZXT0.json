    "content": "Updated at 2:30 p.m . ET on February 10 , 2020 . One day last fall , I sat down to create a new Facebook account . I picked a forgettable name , snapped a profile pic with my face obscured , and clicked \u201c Like \u201d on the official pages of Donald Trump and his reelection campaign . Facebook \u2019 s algorithm prodded me to follow Ann Coulter , Fox Business , and a variety of fan pages with names like \u201c In Trump We Trust. \u201d I complied . I also gave my cellphone number to the Trump campaign , and joined a handful of private Facebook groups for MAGA diehards , one of which required an application that seemed designed to screen out interlopers . To hear more feature stories , get the Audm iPhone app . The president \u2019 s reelection campaign was then in the midst of a multimillion-dollar ad blitz aimed at shaping Americans \u2019 understanding of the recently launched impeachment proceedings . Thousands of micro-targeted ads had flooded the internet , portraying Trump as a heroic reformer cracking down on foreign corruption while Democrats plotted a coup . That this narrative bore little resemblance to reality seemed only to accelerate its spread . Right-wing websites amplified every claim . Pro-Trump forums teemed with conspiracy theories . An alternate information ecosystem was taking shape around the biggest news story in the country , and I wanted to see it from the inside .\nThe story that unfurled in my Facebook feed over the next several weeks was , at times , disorienting . There were days when I would watch , live on TV , an impeachment hearing filled with damning testimony about the president \u2019 s conduct , only to look at my phone later and find a slickly edited video\u2014served up by the Trump campaign\u2014that used out-of-context clips to recast the same testimony as an exoneration . Wait , I caught myself wondering more than once , is that what happened today ? As I swiped at my phone , a stream of pro-Trump propaganda filled the screen : \u201c That \u2019 s right , the whistleblower \u2019 s own lawyer said , \u2018 The coup has started \u2026 \u2019 \u201d Swipe . \u201c Democrats are doing Putin \u2019 s bidding \u2026 \u201d Swipe . \u201c The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing \u2026 \u201d Swipe . \u201c Only one man can stop this chaos \u2026 \u201d Swipe , swipe , swipe . I was surprised by the effect it had on me . I \u2019 d assumed that my skepticism and media literacy would inoculate me against such distortions . But I soon found myself reflexively questioning every headline . It wasn \u2019 t that I believed Trump and his boosters were telling the truth . It was that , in this state of heightened suspicion , truth itself\u2014about Ukraine , impeachment , or anything else\u2014felt more and more difficult to locate . With each swipe , the notion of observable reality drifted further out of reach . What I was seeing was a strategy that has been deployed by illiberal political leaders around the world . Rather than shutting down dissenting voices , these leaders have learned to harness the democratizing power of social media for their own purposes\u2014jamming the signals , sowing confusion . They no longer need to silence the dissident shouting in the streets ; they can use a megaphone to drown him out . Scholars have a name for this : censorship through noise .\nAfter the 2016 election , much was made of the threats posed to American democracy by foreign disinformation . Stories of Russian troll farms and Macedonian fake-news mills loomed in the national imagination . But while these shadowy outside forces preoccupied politicians and journalists , Trump and his domestic allies were beginning to adopt the same tactics of information warfare that have kept the world \u2019 s demagogues and strongmen in power . Read : What , exactly , were Russians trying to do with those Facebook ads ? Every presidential campaign sees its share of spin and misdirection , but this year \u2019 s contest promises to be different . In conversations with political strategists and other experts , a dystopian picture of the general election comes into view\u2014one shaped by coordinated bot attacks , Potemkin local-news sites , micro-targeted fearmongering , and anonymous mass texting . Both parties will have these tools at their disposal . But in the hands of a president who lies constantly , who traffics in conspiracy theories , and who readily manipulates the levers of government for his own gain , their potential to wreak havoc is enormous . The Trump campaign is planning to spend more than $ 1 billion , and it will be aided by a vast coalition of partisan media , outside political groups , and enterprising freelance operatives . These pro-Trump forces are poised to wage what could be the most extensive disinformation campaign in U.S. history . Whether or not it succeeds in reelecting the president , the wreckage it leaves behind could be irreparable . THE DEATH STAR The campaign is run from the 14th floor of a gleaming , modern office tower in Rosslyn , Virginia , just outside Washington , D.C. Glass-walled conference rooms look out on the Potomac River . Rows of sleek monitors line the main office space . Unlike the bootstrap operation that first got Trump elected\u2014with its motley band of B-teamers toiling in an unfinished space in Trump Tower\u2014his 2020 enterprise is heavily funded , technologically sophisticated , and staffed with dozens of experienced operatives . One Republican strategist referred to it , admiringly , as \u201c the Death Star . \u201d\nPresiding over this effort is Brad Parscale , a 6-foot-8 Viking of a man with a shaved head and a triangular beard . As the digital director of Trump \u2019 s 2016 campaign , Parscale didn \u2019 t become a household name like Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway . But he played a crucial role in delivering Trump to the Oval Office\u2014and his efforts will shape this year \u2019 s election . In speeches and interviews , Parscale likes to tell his life story as a tidy rags-to-riches tale , embroidered with Trumpian embellishments . He grew up a simple \u201c farm boy from Kansas \u201d ( read : son of an affluent lawyer from suburban Topeka ) who managed to graduate from an \u201c Ivy League \u201d school ( Trinity University , in San Antonio ) . After college , he went to work for a software company in California , only to watch the business collapse in the economic aftermath of 9/11 ( not to mention allegations in a lawsuit that he and his parents , who owned the business , had illegally transferred company funds\u2014claims that they disputed ) . Broke and desperate , Parscale took his \u201c last $ 500 \u201d ( not counting the value of three rental properties he owned ) and used it to start a one-man web-design business in Texas . Parscale Media was , by most accounts , a scrappy endeavor at the outset . Hustling to drum up clients , Parscale cold-pitched shoppers in the tech aisle of a Borders bookstore . Over time , he built enough websites for plumbers and gun shops that bigger clients took notice\u2014including the Trump Organization . In 2011 , Parscale was invited to bid on designing a website for Trump International Realty . An ardent fan of The Apprentice , he offered to do the job for $ 10,000 , a fraction of the actual cost . \u201c I just made up a price , \u201d he later told The Washington Post . \u201c I recognized that I was a nobody in San Antonio , but working for the Trumps would be everything. \u201d The contract was his , and a lucrative relationship was born .\nOver the next four years , he was hired to design websites for a range of Trump ventures\u2014a winery , a skin-care line , and then a presidential campaign . By late 2015 , Parscale\u2014a man with no discernible politics , let alone campaign experience\u2014was running the Republican front-runner \u2019 s digital operation from his personal laptop . Parscale slid comfortably into Trump \u2019 s orbit . Not only was he cheap and unpretentious\u2014with no hint of the savvier-than-thou smugness that characterized other political operatives\u2014but he seemed to carry a chip on his shoulder that matched the candidate \u2019 s . \u201c Brad was one of those people who wanted to prove the establishment wrong and show the world what he was made of , \u201d says a former colleague from the campaign . Perhaps most important , he seemed to have no reservations about the kind of campaign Trump wanted to run . The race-baiting , the immigrant-bashing , the truth-bending\u2014none of it seemed to bother Parscale . While some Republicans wrung their hands over Trump \u2019 s inflammatory messages , Parscale came up with ideas to more effectively disseminate them . Read : Bots are destroying political discourse as we know it The campaign had little interest at first in cutting-edge ad technology , and for a while , Parscale \u2019 s most valued contribution was the merchandise page he built to sell MAGA hats . But that changed in the general election . Outgunned on the airwaves and lagging badly in fundraising , campaign officials turned to Google and Facebook , where ads were inexpensive and shock value was rewarded . As the campaign poured tens of millions into online advertising\u2014amplifying themes such as Hillary Clinton \u2019 s criminality and the threat of radical Islamic terrorism\u2014Parscale \u2019 s team , which was christened Project Alamo , grew to 100 .\nParscale was generally well liked by his colleagues , who recall him as competent and intensely focused . \u201c He was a get-shit-done type of person , \u201d says A. J. Delgado , who worked with him . Perhaps just as important , he had a talent for ingratiating himself with the Trump family . \u201c He was probably better at managing up , \u201d Kurt Luidhardt , a consultant for the campaign , told me . He made sure to share credit for his work with the candidate \u2019 s son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and he excelled at using Trump \u2019 s digital ignorance to flatter him . \u201c Parscale would come in and tell Trump he didn \u2019 t need to listen to the polls , because he \u2019 d crunched his data and they were going to win by six points , \u201d one former campaign staffer told me . \u201c I was like , \u2018 Come on , man , don \u2019 t bullshit a bullshitter. \u2019 \u201d But Trump seemed to buy it . ( Parscale declined to be interviewed for this story . )\nDavid A. Graham : The real problem with fake news James Barnes , a Facebook employee who was dispatched to work closely with the campaign , told me Parscale \u2019 s political inexperience made him open to experimenting with the platform \u2019 s new tools . \u201c Whereas some grizzled campaign strategist who \u2019 d been around the block a few times might say , \u2018 Oh , that will never work , \u2019 Brad \u2019 s predisposition was to say , \u2018 Yeah , let \u2019 s try it. \u2019 \u201d From June to November , Trump \u2019 s campaign ran 5.9 million ads on Facebook , while Clinton \u2019 s ran just 66,000 . A Facebook executive would later write in a leaked memo that Trump \u201c got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I \u2019 ve ever seen from any advertiser. \u201d Though some strategists questioned how much these ads actually mattered , Parscale was hailed for Trump \u2019 s surprise victory . Stories appeared in the press calling him a \u201c genius \u201d and the campaign \u2019 s \u201c secret weapon , \u201d and in 2018 he was tapped to lead the entire reelection effort . The promotion was widely viewed as a sign that the president \u2019 s 2020 strategy would hinge on the digital tactics that Parscale had mastered . Read : What Facebook did to American democracy Through it all , the strategist has continued to show a preference for narrative over truth . Last May , Parscale regaled a crowd of donors and activists in Miami with the story of his ascent . When a ProPublica reporter confronted him about the many misleading details in his account , he shrugged off the fact-check . \u201c When I give a speech , I tell it like a story , \u201d he said . \u201c My story is my story. \u201d DISINFORMATION ARCHITECTURE In his book This Is Not Propaganda , Peter Pomerantsev , a researcher at the London School of Economics , writes about a young Filipino political consultant he calls \u201c P. \u201d In college , P had studied the \u201c Little Albert experiment , \u201d in which scientists conditioned a young child to fear furry animals by exposing him to loud noises every time he encountered a white lab rat . The experiment gave P an idea . He created a series of Facebook groups for Filipinos to discuss what was going on in their communities . Once the groups got big enough\u2014about 100,000 members\u2014he began posting local crime stories , and instructed his employees to leave comments falsely tying the grisly headlines to drug cartels . The pages lit up with frightened chatter . Rumors swirled ; conspiracy theories metastasized . To many , all crimes became drug crimes .\nUnbeknownst to their members , the Facebook groups were designed to boost Rodrigo Duterte , then a long-shot presidential candidate running on a pledge to brutally crack down on drug criminals . ( Duterte once boasted that , as mayor of Davao City , he rode through the streets on his motorcycle and personally executed drug dealers . ) P \u2019 s experiment was one plank in a larger \u201c disinformation architecture \u201d \u2014which also included social-media influencers paid to mock opposing candidates , and mercenary trolls working out of former call centers\u2014that experts say aided Duterte \u2019 s rise to power . Since assuming office in 2016 , Duterte has reportedly ramped up these efforts while presiding over thousands of extrajudicial killings . The campaign in the Philippines was emblematic of an emerging propaganda playbook , one that uses new tools for the age-old ends of autocracy . The Kremlin has long been an innovator in this area . ( A 2011 manual for Russian civil servants favorably compared their methods of disinformation to \u201c an invisible radiation \u201d that takes effect while \u201c the population doesn \u2019 t even feel it is being acted upon. \u201d ) But with the technological advances of the past decade , and the global proliferation of smartphones , governments around the world have found success deploying Kremlin-honed techniques against their own people . Read : Peter Pomerantsev on Russia and the menace of unreality In the United States , we tend to view such tools of oppression as the faraway problems of more fragile democracies . But the people working to reelect Trump understand the power of these tactics . They may use gentler terminology\u2014muddy the waters ; alternative facts\u2014but they \u2019 re building a machine designed to exploit their own sprawling disinformation architecture .\nCentral to that effort is the campaign \u2019 s use of micro-targeting\u2014the process of slicing up the electorate into distinct niches and then appealing to them with precisely tailored digital messages . The advantages of this approach are obvious : An ad that calls for defunding Planned Parenthood might get a mixed response from a large national audience , but serve it directly via Facebook to 800 Roman Catholic women in Dubuque , Iowa , and its reception will be much more positive . If candidates once had to shout their campaign promises from a soapbox , micro-targeting allows them to sidle up to millions of voters and whisper personalized messages in their ear . Parscale didn \u2019 t invent this practice\u2014Barack Obama \u2019 s campaign famously used it in 2012 , and Clinton \u2019 s followed suit . But Trump \u2019 s effort in 2016 was unprecedented , in both its scale and its brazenness . In the final days of the 2016 race , for example , Trump \u2019 s team tried to suppress turnout among black voters in Florida by slipping ads into their News Feeds that read , \u201c Hillary Thinks African-Americans Are Super Predators. \u201d An unnamed campaign official boasted to Bloomberg Businessweek that it was one of \u201c three major voter suppression operations underway. \u201d ( The other two targeted young women and white liberals . ) The weaponization of micro-targeting was pioneered in large part by the data scientists at Cambridge Analytica . The firm began as part of a nonpartisan military contractor that used digital psyops to target terrorist groups and drug cartels . In Pakistan , it worked to thwart jihadist recruitment efforts ; in South America , it circulated disinformation to turn drug dealers against their bosses .\nThe emphasis shifted once the conservative billionaire Robert Mercer became a major investor and installed Steve Bannon as his point man . Using a massive trove of data it had gathered from Facebook and other sources\u2014without users \u2019 consent\u2014Cambridge Analytica worked to develop detailed \u201c psychographic profiles \u201d for every voter in the U.S. , and began experimenting with ways to stoke paranoia and bigotry by exploiting certain personality traits . In one exercise , the firm asked white men whether they would approve of their daughter marrying a Mexican immigrant ; those who said yes were asked a follow-up question designed to provoke irritation at the constraints of political correctness : \u201c Did you feel like you had to say that ? \u201d Christopher Wylie , who was the director of research at Cambridge Analytica and later testified about the company to Congress , told me that \u201c with the right kind of nudges , \u201d people who exhibited certain psychological characteristics could be pushed into ever more extreme beliefs and conspiratorial thinking . \u201c Rather than using data to interfere with the process of radicalization , Steve Bannon was able to invert that , \u201d Wylie said . \u201c We were essentially seeding an insurgency in the United States. \u201d Cambridge Analytica was dissolved in 2018 , shortly after its CEO was caught on tape bragging about using bribery and sexual \u201c honey traps \u201d on behalf of clients . ( The firm denied that it actually used such tactics . ) Since then , some political scientists have questioned how much effect its \u201c psychographic \u201d targeting really had . But Wylie\u2014who spoke with me from London , where he now works for H & M , as a fashion-trend forecaster\u2014said the firm \u2019 s work in 2016 was a modest test run compared with what could come .\n\u201c What happens if North Korea or Iran picks up where Cambridge Analytica left off ? \u201d he said , noting that plenty of foreign actors will be looking for ways to interfere in this year \u2019 s election . \u201c There are countless hostile states that have more than enough capacity to quickly replicate what we were able to do \u2026 and make it much more sophisticated. \u201d These efforts may not come only from abroad : A group of former Cambridge Analytica employees have formed a new firm that , according to the Associated Press , is working with the Trump campaign . ( The firm has denied this , and a campaign spokesperson declined to comment . ) After the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke , Facebook was excoriated for its mishandling of user data and complicity in the viral spread of fake news . Mark Zuckerberg promised to do better , and rolled out a flurry of reforms . But then , last fall , he handed a major victory to lying politicians : Candidates , he said , would be allowed to continue running false ads on Facebook . ( Commercial advertisers , by contrast , are subject to fact-checking . ) In a speech at Georgetown University , the CEO argued that his company shouldn \u2019 t be responsible for arbitrating political speech , and that because political ads already receive so much scrutiny , candidates who choose to lie will be held accountable by journalists and watchdogs . Shady political actors are discovering how easy it is to wage an untraceable whisper campaign by text message . To bolster his case , Zuckerberg pointed to the recently launched\u2014and publicly accessible\u2014 \u201c library \u201d where Facebook archives every political ad it publishes . The project has a certain democratic appeal : Why censor false or toxic content when a little sunlight can have the same effect ? But spend some time scrolling through the archive of Trump reelection ads , and you quickly see the limits of this transparency .\nRead : The age of reverse censorship The campaign doesn \u2019 t run just one ad at a time on a given theme . It runs hundreds of iterations\u2014adjusting the language , the music , even the colors of the \u201c Donate \u201d buttons . In the 10 weeks after the House of Representatives began its impeachment inquiry , the Trump campaign ran roughly 14,000 different ads containing the word impeachment . Sifting through all of them is virtually impossible . Both parties will rely on micro-targeted ads this year , but the president is likely to have a distinct advantage . The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign have reportedly compiled an average of 3,000 data points on every voter in America . They have spent years experimenting with ways to tweak their messages based not just on gender and geography , but on whether the recipient owns a gun or watches the Golf Channel . While these ads can be used to try to win over undecided voters , they \u2019 re most often deployed for fundraising and for firing up the faithful\u2014and Trump \u2019 s advisers believe this election will be decided by mobilization , not persuasion . To turn out the base , the campaign has signaled that it will return to familiar themes : the threat of \u201c illegal aliens \u201d \u2014a term Parscale has reportedly encouraged Trump to use\u2014and the corruption of the \u201c swamp. \u201d Beyond Facebook , the campaign is also investing in a texting platform that could allow it to send anonymous messages directly to millions of voters \u2019 phones without their permission . Until recently , people had to opt in before a campaign could include them in a mass text . But with new \u201c peer to peer \u201d texting apps\u2014including one developed by Gary Coby , a senior Trump adviser\u2014a single volunteer can send hundreds of messages an hour , skirting federal regulations by clicking \u201c Send \u201d one message at a time . Notably , these messages aren \u2019 t required to disclose who \u2019 s behind them , thanks to a 2002 ruling by the Federal Election Commission that cited the limited number of characters available in a text .\nMost experts assume that these regulations will be overhauled sometime after the 2020 election . For now , campaigns from both parties are hoovering up as many cellphone numbers as possible , and Parscale has said texting will be at the center of Trump \u2019 s reelection strategy . The medium \u2019 s ability to reach voters is unparalleled : While robocalls get sent to voicemail and email blasts get trapped in spam folders , peer-to-peer texting companies say that at least 90 percent of their messages are opened . The Trump campaign \u2019 s texts so far this cycle have focused on shouty fundraising pleas ( \u201c They have NOTHING ! IMPEACHMENT IS OVER ! Now let \u2019 s CRUSH our End of Month Goal \u201d ) . But the potential for misuse by outside groups is clear\u2014and shady political actors are already discovering how easy it is to wage an untraceable whisper campaign by text . In 2018 , as early voting got under way in Tennessee \u2019 s Republican gubernatorial primary , voters began receiving text messages attacking two of the candidates \u2019 conservative credentials . The texts\u2014written in a conversational style , as if they \u2019 d been sent from a friend\u2014were unsigned , and people who tried calling the numbers received a busy signal . The local press covered the smear campaign . Law enforcement was notified . But the source of the texts was never discovered . WAR ON THE PRESS One afternoon last March , I was on the phone with a Republican operative close to the Trump family when he casually mentioned that a reporter at Business Insider was about to have a very bad day . The journalist , John Haltiwanger , had tweeted something that annoyed Donald Trump Jr. , prompting the coterie of friends and allies surrounding the president \u2019 s son to drum up a hit piece . The story they had coming , the operative suggested to me , would demolish the reporter \u2019 s credibility .\nI wasn \u2019 t sure what to make of this gloating\u2014people in Trump \u2019 s circle have a tendency toward bluster . But a few hours later , the operative sent me a link to a Breitbart News article documenting Haltiwanger \u2019 s \u201c history of intense Trump hatred. \u201d The story was based on a series of Instagram posts\u2014all of them from before Haltiwanger started working at Business Insider\u2014in which he made fun of the president and expressed solidarity with liberal protesters . The next morning , Don Jr. tweeted the story to his 3 million followers , denouncing Haltiwanger as a \u201c raging lib. \u201d Other conservatives piled on , and the reporter was bombarded with abusive messages and calls for him to be fired . His employer issued a statement conceding that the Instagram posts were \u201c not appropriate. \u201d Haltiwanger kept his job , but the experience , he told me later , \u201c was bizarre and unsettling. \u201d The Breitbart story was part of a coordinated effort by a coalition of Trump allies to air embarrassing information about reporters who produce critical coverage of the president . ( The New York Times first reported on this project last summer ; since then , it \u2019 s been described to me in greater detail . ) According to people with knowledge of the effort , pro-Trump operatives have scraped social-media accounts belonging to hundreds of political journalists and compiled years \u2019 worth of posts into a dossier . Often when a particular news story is deemed especially unfair\u2014or politically damaging\u2014to the president , Don Jr. will flag it in a text thread that he uses for this purpose . ( Among those who text regularly with the president \u2019 s eldest son , someone close to him told me , are the conservative activist Charlie Kirk ; two GOP strategists , Sergio Gor and Arthur Schwartz ; Matthew Boyle , a Breitbart editor ; and U.S . Ambassador Richard Grenell . ) Once a story has been marked for attack , someone searches the dossier for material on the journalists involved . If something useful turns up\u2014a problematic old joke ; evidence of liberal political views\u2014Boyle turns it into a Breitbart headline , which White House officials and campaign surrogates can then share on social media . ( The White House has denied any involvement in this effort . )\nDescriptions of the dossier vary . One source I spoke with said that a programmer in India had been paid to organize it into a searchable database , making posts that contain offensive keywords easier to find . Another told me the dossier had expanded to at least 2,000 people , including not just journalists but high-profile academics , politicians , celebrities , and other potential Trump foes . Some of this , of course , may be hyperbolic boasting\u2014but the effort has yielded fruit . Parscale has said the campaign intends to train \u201c swarms of surrogates \u201d to undermine coverage from local TV stations and newspapers . In the past year , the operatives involved have gone after journalists at CNN , The Washington Post , and The New York Times . They exposed one reporter for using the word fag in college , and another for posting anti-Semitic and racist jokes a decade ago . These may not have been career-ending revelations , but people close to the project said they \u2019 re planning to unleash much more opposition research as the campaign intensifies . \u201c This is innovative shit , \u201d said Mike Cernovich , a right-wing activist with a history of trolling . \u201c They \u2019 re appropriating call-out culture. \u201d What \u2019 s notable about this effort is not that it aims to expose media bias . Conservatives have been complaining\u2014with some merit\u2014about a liberal slant in the press for decades . But in the Trump era , an important shift has taken place . Instead of trying to reform the press , or critique its coverage , today \u2019 s most influential conservatives want to destroy the mainstream media altogether . \u201c Journalistic integrity is dead , \u201d Boyle declared in a 2017 speech at the Heritage Foundation . \u201c There is no such thing anymore . So everything is about weaponization of information . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a lesson drawn from demagogues around the world : When the press as an institution is weakened , fact-based journalism becomes just one more drop in the daily deluge of content\u2014no more or less credible than partisan propaganda . Relativism is the real goal of Trump \u2019 s assault on the press , and the more \u201c enemies of the people \u201d his allies can take out along the way , the better . \u201c A culture war is a war , \u201d Steve Bannon told the Times last year . \u201c There are casualties in war. \u201d This attitude has permeated the president \u2019 s base . At rallies , people wear T-shirts that read rope . tree . journalist . some assembly required . A CBS News/YouGov poll has found that just 11 percent of strong Trump supporters trust the mainstream media\u2014while 91 percent turn to the president for \u201c accurate information. \u201d This dynamic makes it all but impossible for the press to hold the president accountable , something Trump himself seems to understand . \u201c Remember , \u201d he told a crowd in 2018 , \u201c what you \u2019 re seeing and what you \u2019 re reading is not what \u2019 s happening. \u201d Bryan Lanza , who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016 and remains a White House surrogate , told me flatly that he sees no possibility of Americans establishing a common set of facts from which to conduct the big debates of this year \u2019 s election . Nor is that his goal . \u201c It \u2019 s our job to sell our narrative louder than the media , \u201d Lanza said . \u201c They \u2019 re clearly advocating for a liberal-socialist position , and we \u2019 re never going to be in concert . So the war continues . \u201d\nFrom December 2019 : The dark psychology of social networks Parscale has indicated that he plans to open up a new front in this war : local news . Last year , he said the campaign intends to train \u201c swarms of surrogates \u201d to undermine negative coverage from local TV stations and newspapers . Polls have long found that Americans across the political spectrum trust local news more than national media . If the campaign has its way , that trust will be eroded by November . \u201c We can actually build up and fight with the local newspapers , \u201d Parscale told donors , according to a recording provided by The Palm Beach Post . \u201c So we \u2019 re not just fighting on Fox News , CNN , and MSNBC with the same 700,000 people watching every day. \u201d Running parallel to this effort , some conservatives have been experimenting with a scheme to exploit the credibility of local journalism . Over the past few years , hundreds of websites with innocuous-sounding names like the Arizona Monitor and The Kalamazoo Times have begun popping up . At first glance , they look like regular publications , complete with community notices and coverage of schools . But look closer and you \u2019 ll find that there are often no mastheads , few if any bylines , and no addresses for local offices . Many of them are organs of Republican lobbying groups ; others belong to a mysterious company called Locality Labs , which is run by a conservative activist in Illinois . Readers are given no indication that these sites have political agendas\u2014which is precisely what makes them valuable .\nAccording to one longtime strategist , candidates looking to plant a negative story about an opponent can pay to have their desired headlines posted on some of these Potemkin news sites . By working through a third-party consulting firm\u2014instead of paying the sites directly\u2014candidates are able to obscure their involvement in the scheme when they file expenditures to the Federal Election Commission . Even if the stories don \u2019 t fool savvy readers , the headlines are convincing enough to be flashed across the screen in a campaign commercial or slipped into fundraising emails . DIGITAL DIRTY TRICKS Shortly after polls closed in Kentucky \u2019 s gubernatorial election last November , an anonymous Twitter user named @ Overlordkraken1 announced to his 19 followers that he had \u201c just shredded a box of Republican mail in ballots \u201d in Louisville . There was little reason to take this claim at face value , and plenty of reason to doubt it ( beginning with the fact that he \u2019 d misspelled Louisville ) . But the race was tight , and as incumbent Governor Matt Bevin began to fall behind in the vote total , an army of Twitter bots began spreading the election-rigging claim . The original post was removed by Twitter , but by then thousands of automated accounts were circulating screenshots of it with the hashtag # StoptheSteal . Popular right-wing internet personalities jumped on the narrative , and soon the Bevin campaign was making noise about unspecified voting \u201c irregularities. \u201d When the race was called for his opponent , the governor refused to concede , and asked for a statewide review of the vote . ( No evidence of ballot-shredding was found , and he finally admitted defeat nine days later . )\nThe Election Night disinformation blitz had all the markings of a foreign influence operation . In 2016 , Russian trolls had worked in similar ways to contaminate U.S. political discourse\u2014posing as Black Lives Matter activists in an attempt to inflame racial divisions , and fanning pro-Trump conspiracy theories . ( They even used Facebook to organize rallies , including one for Muslim supporters of Clinton in Washington , D.C. , where they got someone to hold up a sign attributing a fictional quote to the candidate : \u201c I think Sharia law will be a powerful new direction of freedom. \u201d ) But when Twitter employees later reviewed the activity surrounding Kentucky \u2019 s election , they concluded that the bots were largely based in America\u2014a sign that political operatives here were learning to mimic Russian trolling tactics . Of course , dirty tricks aren \u2019 t new to American politics . From Lee Atwater and Roger Stone to the crooked machine Democrats of Chicago , the country has a long history of underhanded operatives smearing opponents and meddling in elections . And , in fact , Samuel Woolley , a scholar who studies digital propaganda , told me that the first documented deployment of politicized Twitter bots was in the U.S . In 2010 , an Iowa-based conservative group set up a small network of automated accounts with names like @ BrianD82 to promote the idea that Martha Coakley , a Democrat running for Senate in Massachusetts , was anti-Catholic .\nSince then , the tactics of Twitter warfare have grown more sophisticated , as regimes around the world experiment with new ways to deploy their cybermilitias . In Mexico , supporters of then-President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto created \u201c sock puppet \u201d accounts to pose as protesters and sabotage the opposition movement . In Azerbaijan , a pro-government youth group waged coordinated harassment campaigns against journalists , flooding their Twitter feeds with graphic threats and insults . When these techniques prove successful , Woolley told me , Americans improve upon them . \u201c It \u2019 s almost as if there \u2019 s a Columbian exchange between developing-world authoritarian regimes and the West , \u201d he said .\nParscale has denied that the campaign uses bots , saying in a 60 Minutes interview , \u201c I don \u2019 t think [ they ] work. \u201d He may be right\u2014it \u2019 s unlikely that these nebulous networks of trolls and bots could swing a national election . But they do have their uses . They can simulate false consensus , derail sincere debate , and hound people out of the public square . According to one study , bots accounted for roughly 20 percent of all the tweets posted about the 2016 election during one five-week period that year . And Twitter is already infested with bots that seem designed to boost Trump \u2019 s reelection prospects . Regardless of where they \u2019 re coming from , they have tremendous potential to divide , radicalize , and stoke hatred that lasts long after the votes are cast . Rob Flaherty , who served as the digital director for Beto O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s presidential campaign , told me that Twitter in 2020 is a \u201c hall of mirrors. \u201d He said one mysterious account started a viral rumor that the gunman who killed seven people in Odessa , Texas , last summer had a beto bumper sticker on his car . Another masqueraded as an O \u2019 Rourke supporter and hurled racist invective at a journalist . Some of these tactics echoed 2016 , when Russian agitators posed as Bernie Sanders supporters and stirred up anger toward Hillary Clinton . Flaherty said he didn \u2019 t know who was behind the efforts targeting O \u2019 Rourke , and the candidate dropped out before they could make a real difference . \u201c But you can \u2019 t watch this landscape and not get the feeling that someone \u2019 s fucking with something , \u201d he told me . Flaherty has since joined Joe Biden \u2019 s campaign , which has had to contend with similar distortions : Last year , a website resembling an official Biden campaign page appeared on the internet . It emphasized elements of the candidate \u2019 s legislative record likely to hurt him in the Democratic primary\u2014opposition to same-sex marriage , support for the Iraq War\u2014and featured video clips of his awkward encounters with women . The site quickly became one of the most-visited Biden-related sites on the web . It was designed by a Trump consultant . FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE As the president \u2019 s reelection machine ramps up , Democratic strategists have found themselves debating an urgent question : Can they defeat the Trump coalition without adopting its tactics ?\nOn one side of this argument is Dmitri Mehlhorn , a consultant notorious for his willingness to experiment with digital subterfuge . During Alabama \u2019 s special election in 2017 , Mehlhorn helped fund at least two \u201c false flag \u201d operations against the Republican Senate candidate , Roy Moore . For one scheme , faux Russian Twitter bots followed the candidate \u2019 s account to make it look like the Kremlin was backing Moore . For another , a fake social-media campaign , dubbed \u201c Dry Alabama , \u201d was designed to link Moore to fictional Baptist teetotalers trying to ban alcohol . ( Mehlhorn has claimed that he unaware of the Russian bot effort and does not support the use of misinformation . ) When The New York Times uncovered the second plot , one of the activists involved , Matt Osborne , contended that Democrats had no choice but to employ such unscrupulous techniques . \u201c If you don \u2019 t do it , you \u2019 re fighting with one hand tied behind your back , \u201d Osborne said . \u201c You have a moral imperative to do this\u2014to do whatever it takes. \u201d Others have argued that this is precisely the wrong moment for Democrats to start abandoning ideals of honesty and fairness . \u201c It \u2019 s just not in my values to go out there making shit up and tricking voters , \u201d Flaherty told me . \u201c I know there \u2019 s this whole fight-fire-with-fire contingent , but generally when you ask them what they mean , they \u2019 re like , \u2018 Lie ! \u2019 \u201d Some also note that the president has already handed them plenty of ammunition . \u201c I don \u2019 t think the Democratic campaign is going to need to make stuff up about Trump , \u201d Judd Legum , the author of a progressive newsletter about digital politics , told me . \u201c They can stick to things that are true. \u201d Eventually , the fear of covert propaganda inflicts as much damage as the propaganda itself . One Democrat straddling these two camps is a young , tech-savvy strategist named Tara McGowan . Last fall , she and the former Obama adviser David Plouffe launched a political-action committee with a pledge to spend $ 75 million attacking Trump online . At the time , the president \u2019 s campaign was running more ads on Facebook and Google than the top four Democratic candidates combined . McGowan \u2019 s plans to return fire included such ads , but she also had more creative\u2014and controversial\u2014measures in mind .\nFor example , she established a media organization with a staff of writers to produce left-leaning \u201c hometown news \u201d stories that can be micro-targeted to persuadable voters on Facebook without any indication that they \u2019 re paid for by a political group . Though she insists that the reporting is strictly factual , some see the enterprise as a too-close-for-comfort co-opting of right-wing tactics . When I spoke with McGowan , she was open about her willingness to push boundaries that might make some Democrats queasy . As far as she was concerned , the \u201c super-predator \u201d ads Trump ran to depress black turnout in 2016 were \u201c fair game \u201d because they had some basis in fact . ( Clinton did use the term in 1996 , to refer to gang members . ) McGowan suggested that a similar approach could be taken with conservatives . She ruled out attempts to misinform Republicans about when and where to vote\u2014a tactic Mehlhorn reportedly considered , though he later said he was joking\u2014but said she would pursue any strategy that was \u201c in the bounds of the law. \u201d \u201c We are in a radically disruptive moment right now , \u201d McGowan told me . \u201c We have a president that lies every day , unabashedly \u2026 I think Trump is so desperate to win this election that he will do anything . There will be no bar too low for him. \u201d This intraparty split was highlighted last year when state officials urged the Democratic National Committee to formally disavow the use of bots , troll farms , and \u201c deepfakes \u201d ( digitally manipulated videos that can , with alarming precision , make a person appear to do or say anything ) . Supporters saw the proposed pledge as a way of contrasting their party \u2019 s values with those of the GOP . But after months of lobbying , the committee refused to adopt the pledge . From May 2018 : The era of fake video begins Meanwhile , experts worried about domestic disinformation are looking to other countries for lessons . The most successful recent example may be Indonesia , which cracked down on the problem after a wave of viral lies and conspiracy theories pushed by hard-line Islamists led to the defeat of a popular Christian Chinese candidate for governor in 2016 . To prevent a similar disruption in last year \u2019 s presidential election , a coalition of journalists from more than two dozen top Indonesian news outlets worked together to identify and debunk hoaxes before they gained traction online . But while that may sound like a promising model , it was paired with aggressive efforts by the state to monitor and arrest purveyors of fake news\u2014an approach that would run afoul of the First Amendment if attempted in the U.S. Richard Stengel , who served as the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy under President Obama , spent almost three years trying to counter digital propaganda from the Islamic State and Russia . By the time he left office , he told me , he was convinced that disinformation would continue to thrive until big tech companies were forced to take responsibility for it . Stengel has proposed amending the 1996 Communications Decency Act , which shields online platforms from liability for messages posted by third parties . Companies such as Facebook and Twitter , he believes , should be required by law to police their platforms for disinformation and abusive trolling . \u201c It \u2019 s not going to solve the whole problem , \u201d he told me , \u201c but it \u2019 s going to help with volume. \u201d There is one other case study to consider . During the Ukrainian revolution in 2014 , pro-democracy activists found that they could defang much of the false information about their movement by repeatedly exposing its Russian origins . But this kind of transparency comes with a cost , Stengel observed . Over time , alertness to the prevalence of propaganda can curdle into paranoia . Russian operatives have been known to encourage such anxiety by spreading rumors that exaggerate their own influence . Eventually , the fear of covert propaganda inflicts as much damage as the propaganda itself . Once you internalize the possibility that you \u2019 re being manipulated by some hidden hand , nothing can be trusted . Every dissenting voice on Twitter becomes a Russian bot , every uncomfortable headline a false flag , every political development part of an ever-deepening conspiracy . By the time the information ecosystem collapses under the weight of all this cynicism , you \u2019 re too vigilant to notice that the disinformationists have won . POWERS OF INCUMBENCY If there \u2019 s one thing that can be said for Brad Parscale , it \u2019 s that he runs a tight ship . Unauthorized leaks from inside the campaign are rare ; press stories on palace intrigue are virtually nonexistent . When the staff first moved into its new offices last year , journalists were periodically invited to tour the facility\u2014but Parscale put an end to the practice : He didn \u2019 t want them glimpsing a scrap of paper or a whiteboard scribble that they weren \u2019 t supposed to see . Notably , while the Trump White House has endured a seemingly endless procession of shake-ups , the Trump reelection campaign has seen very little turnover since Parscale took charge . His staying power is one reason many Republicans\u2014inside the organization or out\u2014hesitate to talk about him on the record . But among allies of the president , there appears to be a growing skepticism . Former colleagues began noticing a change in Parscale after his promotion . Suddenly , the quiet guy with his face buried in a laptop was wearing designer suits , tossing out MAGA hats at campaign rallies , and traveling to Europe to speak at a political-marketing conference . In the past few years , Parscale has bought a BMW , a Range Rover , a condo , and a $ 2.4 million waterfront house in Fort Lauderdale , Florida . \u201c He knows he has the confidence of the family , \u201d one former colleague told me , \u201c which gives him more swagger. \u201d When the U.K. \u2019 s Daily Mail ran a story spotlighting Parscale \u2019 s spending spree , he attempted deflection through flattery . \u201c The president is an excellent businessman , \u201d he told the tabloid , \u201c and being associated with him for years has been extremely beneficial to my family. \u201d But according to a former White House official with knowledge of the incident , Trump was irritated by the coverage , and the impression it created that his campaign manager was getting rich off him . For a moment , Parscale \u2019 s standing appeared to be in peril , but then Trump \u2019 s attention was diverted by the G7 summit in France , and he never returned to the issue . ( A spokesperson for the campaign disputed this account . ) Some Republicans worry that for all Parscale \u2019 s digital expertise , he doesn \u2019 t have the vision to guide Trump to reelection . The president is historically unpopular , and even in red states , he has struggled to mobilize his base for special elections . If Trump \u2019 s message is growing stale with voters , is Parscale the man to help overhaul it ? \u201c People start to ask the question\u2014you \u2019 re building this apparatus , and that \u2019 s great , but what \u2019 s the overarching narrative ? \u201d said a former campaign staffer . But whether Trump finds a new narrative or not , he has something this time around that he didn \u2019 t have in 2016\u2014the powers of the presidency . While every commander in chief looks for ways to leverage his incumbency for reelection , Trump has shown that he \u2019 s willing to go much further than most . In the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections , he seized on reports of a migrant caravan traveling to the U.S. from Central America to claim that the southern border was facing a national-security crisis . Trump warned of a coming \u201c invasion \u201d and claimed , without evidence , that the caravan had been infiltrated by gang members . Parscale aided this effort by creating a 30-second commercial that interspersed footage of Hispanic migrants with clips of a convicted cop-killer . The ad ended with an urgent call to action : stop the caravan . vote republican . In a final maneuver before the election , Trump dispatched U.S. troops to the border . The president insisted that the operation was necessary to keep America safe\u2014but within weeks the troops were quietly called back , the \u201c crisis \u201d having apparently ended once votes were cast . Skeptics were left to wonder : If Trump is willing to militarize the border to pick up a few extra seats in the midterms , what will he and his supporters do when his reelection is on the line ? Read : McKay Coppins on the conservatives trying to ditch fake news It doesn \u2019 t require an overactive imagination to envision a worst-case scenario : On Election Day , anonymous text messages direct voters to the wrong polling locations , or maybe even circulate rumors of security threats . Deepfakes of the Democratic nominee using racial slurs crop up faster than social-media platforms can remove them . As news outlets scramble to correct the inaccuracies , hordes of Twitter bots respond by smearing and threatening reporters . Meanwhile , the Trump campaign has spent the final days of the race pumping out Facebook ads at such a high rate that no one can keep track of what they \u2019 re injecting into the bloodstream . After the first round of exit polls is released , a mysteriously sourced video surfaces purporting to show undocumented immigrants at the ballot box . Trump begins retweeting rumors of voter fraud and suggests that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers should be dispatched to polling stations . are illegals stealing the election ? reads the Fox News chyron . are russians behind false videos ? demands MSNBC . The votes haven \u2019 t even been counted yet , and much of the country is ready to throw out the result . NOTHING IS TRUE There is perhaps no better place to witness what the culture of disinformation has already wrought in America than a Trump campaign rally . One night in November , I navigated through a parking-lot maze of folding tables covered in MAGA merch and entered the BancorpSouth Arena in Tupelo , Mississippi . The election was still a year away , but thousands of sign-waving supporters had crowded into the venue to cheer on the president in person . Once Trump took the stage , he let loose a familiar flurry of lies , half-lies , hyperbole , and nonsense . He spun his revisionist history of the Ukraine scandal\u2014the one in which Joe Biden is the villain\u2014and claimed , falsely , that the Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams wanted to \u201c give illegal aliens the right to vote. \u201d At one point , during a riff on abortion , Trump casually asserted that \u201c the governor of Virginia executed a baby \u201d \u2014prompting a woman in the crowd to scream , \u201c Murderer ! \u201d This incendiary fabrication didn \u2019 t seem to register with my companions in the press pen , who were busy writing stories and shooting B-roll . I opened Twitter , expecting to see a torrent of fact-checks laying out the truth of the case\u2014that the governor had been answering a hypothetical question about late-term abortion ; that a national firestorm had ensued ; that there were certainly different ways to interpret his comments but that not even the most ardent anti-abortion activist thought the governor of Virginia had personally \u201c executed a baby. \u201d But Twitter was uncharacteristically quiet ( apparently the president had said this before ) , and the most widely shared tweet I found on the subject was from his own campaign , which had blasted out a context-free clip of the governor \u2019 s abortion comments to back up Trump \u2019 s smear . Related Stories The Man Who Broke Politics\nTruth Lies Here After the rally , I loitered near one of the exits , chatting with people as they filed out of the arena . Among liberals , there is a comforting caricature of Trump supporters as gullible personality cultists who have been hypnotized into believing whatever their leader says . The appeal of this theory is the implication that the spell can be broken , that truth can still triumph over lies , that someday everything could go back to normal\u2014if only these voters were exposed to the facts . But the people I spoke with in Tupelo seemed to treat matters of fact as beside the point . One woman told me that , given the president \u2019 s accomplishments , she didn \u2019 t care if he \u201c fabricates a little bit. \u201d A man responded to my questions about Trump \u2019 s dishonest attacks on the press with a shrug and a suggestion that the media \u201c ought to try telling the truth once in a while. \u201d Tony Willnow , a 34-year-old maintenance worker who had an American flag wrapped around his head , observed that Trump had won because he said things no other politician would say . When I asked him if it mattered whether those things were true , he thought for a moment before answering . \u201c He tells you what you want to hear , \u201d Willnow said . \u201c And I don \u2019 t know if it \u2019 s true or not\u2014but it sounds good , so fuck it. \u201d The political theorist Hannah Arendt once wrote that the most successful totalitarian leaders of the 20th century instilled in their followers \u201c a mixture of gullibility and cynicism. \u201d When they were lied to , they chose to believe it . When a lie was debunked , they claimed they \u2019 d known all along\u2014and would then \u201c admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness. \u201d Over time , Arendt wrote , the onslaught of propaganda conditioned people to \u201c believe everything and nothing , think that everything was possible and that nothing was true. \u201d Leaving the rally , I thought about Arendt , and the swaths of the country that are already gripped by the ethos she described . Should it prevail in 2020 , the election \u2019 s legacy will be clear\u2014not a choice between parties or candidates or policy platforms , but a referendum on reality itself .

    "content_original": "\n\n\n\nLink Copied\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2:30 p.m. ET on February 10, 2020. One day last fall, I sat down to create a new Facebook account. I picked a forgettable name, snapped a profile pic with my face obscured, and clicked \u201cLike\u201d on the official pages of Donald Trump and his reelection campaign. Facebook\u2019s algorithm prodded me to follow Ann Coulter, Fox Business, and a variety of fan pages with names like \u201cIn Trump We Trust.\u201d I complied. I also gave my cellphone number to the Trump campaign, and joined a handful of private Facebook groups for MAGA diehards, one of which required an application that seemed designed to screen out interlopers. To hear more feature stories, get the Audm iPhone app. The president\u2019s reelection campaign was then in the midst of a multimillion-dollar ad blitz aimed at shaping Americans\u2019 understanding of the recently launched impeachment proceedings. Thousands of micro-targeted ads had flooded the internet, portraying Trump as a heroic reformer cracking down on foreign corruption while Democrats plotted a coup. That this narrative bore little resemblance to reality seemed only to accelerate its spread. Right-wing websites amplified every claim. Pro-Trump forums teemed with conspiracy theories. An alternate information ecosystem was taking shape around the biggest news story in the country, and I wanted to see it from the inside.\n\nThe story that unfurled in my Facebook feed over the next several weeks was, at times, disorienting. There were days when I would watch, live on TV, an impeachment hearing filled with damning testimony about the president\u2019s conduct, only to look at my phone later and find a slickly edited video\u2014served up by the Trump campaign\u2014that used out-of-context clips to recast the same testimony as an exoneration. Wait, I caught myself wondering more than once, is that what happened today? As I swiped at my phone, a stream of pro-Trump propaganda filled the screen: \u201cThat\u2019s right, the whistleblower\u2019s own lawyer said, \u2018The coup has started \u2026\u2019 \u201d Swipe. \u201cDemocrats are doing Putin\u2019s bidding \u2026\u201d Swipe. \u201cThe only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing \u2026\u201d Swipe. \u201cOnly one man can stop this chaos \u2026\u201d Swipe, swipe, swipe. I was surprised by the effect it had on me. I\u2019d assumed that my skepticism and media literacy would inoculate me against such distortions. But I soon found myself reflexively questioning every headline. It wasn\u2019t that I believed Trump and his boosters were telling the truth. It was that, in this state of heightened suspicion, truth itself\u2014about Ukraine, impeachment, or anything else\u2014felt more and more difficult to locate. With each swipe, the notion of observable reality drifted further out of reach. What I was seeing was a strategy that has been deployed by illiberal political leaders around the world. Rather than shutting down dissenting voices, these leaders have learned to harness the democratizing power of social media for their own purposes\u2014jamming the signals, sowing confusion. They no longer need to silence the dissident shouting in the streets; they can use a megaphone to drown him out. Scholars have a name for this: censorship through noise.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, much was made of the threats posed to American democracy by foreign disinformation. Stories of Russian troll farms and Macedonian fake-news mills loomed in the national imagination. But while these shadowy outside forces preoccupied politicians and journalists, Trump and his domestic allies were beginning to adopt the same tactics of information warfare that have kept the world\u2019s demagogues and strongmen in power. Read: What, exactly, were Russians trying to do with those Facebook ads? Every presidential campaign sees its share of spin and misdirection, but this year\u2019s contest promises to be different. In conversations with political strategists and other experts, a dystopian picture of the general election comes into view\u2014one shaped by coordinated bot attacks, Potemkin local-news sites, micro-targeted fearmongering, and anonymous mass texting. Both parties will have these tools at their disposal. But in the hands of a president who lies constantly, who traffics in conspiracy theories, and who readily manipulates the levers of government for his own gain, their potential to wreak havoc is enormous. The Trump campaign is planning to spend more than $1 billion, and it will be aided by a vast coalition of partisan media, outside political groups, and enterprising freelance operatives. These pro-Trump forces are poised to wage what could be the most extensive disinformation campaign in U.S. history. Whether or not it succeeds in reelecting the president, the wreckage it leaves behind could be irreparable. THE DEATH STAR The campaign is run from the 14th floor of a gleaming, modern office tower in Rosslyn, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. Glass-walled conference rooms look out on the Potomac River. Rows of sleek monitors line the main office space. Unlike the bootstrap operation that first got Trump elected\u2014with its motley band of B-teamers toiling in an unfinished space in Trump Tower\u2014his 2020 enterprise is heavily funded, technologically sophisticated, and staffed with dozens of experienced operatives. One Republican strategist referred to it, admiringly, as \u201cthe Death Star.\u201d\n\nPresiding over this effort is Brad Parscale, a 6-foot-8 Viking of a man with a shaved head and a triangular beard. As the digital director of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, Parscale didn\u2019t become a household name like Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway. But he played a crucial role in delivering Trump to the Oval Office\u2014and his efforts will shape this year\u2019s election. In speeches and interviews, Parscale likes to tell his life story as a tidy rags-to-riches tale, embroidered with Trumpian embellishments. He grew up a simple \u201cfarm boy from Kansas\u201d (read: son of an affluent lawyer from suburban Topeka) who managed to graduate from an \u201cIvy League\u201d school (Trinity University, in San Antonio). After college, he went to work for a software company in California, only to watch the business collapse in the economic aftermath of 9/11 (not to mention allegations in a lawsuit that he and his parents, who owned the business, had illegally transferred company funds\u2014claims that they disputed). Broke and desperate, Parscale took his \u201clast $500\u201d (not counting the value of three rental properties he owned) and used it to start a one-man web-design business in Texas. Parscale Media was, by most accounts, a scrappy endeavor at the outset. Hustling to drum up clients, Parscale cold-pitched shoppers in the tech aisle of a Borders bookstore. Over time, he built enough websites for plumbers and gun shops that bigger clients took notice\u2014including the Trump Organization. In 2011, Parscale was invited to bid on designing a website for Trump International Realty. An ardent fan of The Apprentice, he offered to do the job for $10,000, a fraction of the actual cost. \u201cI just made up a price,\u201d he later told The Washington Post. \u201cI recognized that I was a nobody in San Antonio, but working for the Trumps would be everything.\u201d The contract was his, and a lucrative relationship was born.\n\nOver the next four years, he was hired to design websites for a range of Trump ventures\u2014a winery, a skin-care line, and then a presidential campaign. By late 2015, Parscale\u2014a man with no discernible politics, let alone campaign experience\u2014was running the Republican front-runner\u2019s digital operation from his personal laptop. Parscale slid comfortably into Trump\u2019s orbit. Not only was he cheap and unpretentious\u2014with no hint of the savvier-than-thou smugness that characterized other political operatives\u2014but he seemed to carry a chip on his shoulder that matched the candidate\u2019s. \u201cBrad was one of those people who wanted to prove the establishment wrong and show the world what he was made of,\u201d says a former colleague from the campaign. Perhaps most important, he seemed to have no reservations about the kind of campaign Trump wanted to run. The race-baiting, the immigrant-bashing, the truth-bending\u2014none of it seemed to bother Parscale. While some Republicans wrung their hands over Trump\u2019s inflammatory messages, Parscale came up with ideas to more effectively disseminate them. Read: Bots are destroying political discourse as we know it The campaign had little interest at first in cutting-edge ad technology, and for a while, Parscale\u2019s most valued contribution was the merchandise page he built to sell MAGA hats. But that changed in the general election. Outgunned on the airwaves and lagging badly in fundraising, campaign officials turned to Google and Facebook, where ads were inexpensive and shock value was rewarded. As the campaign poured tens of millions into online advertising\u2014amplifying themes such as Hillary Clinton\u2019s criminality and the threat of radical Islamic terrorism\u2014Parscale\u2019s team, which was christened Project Alamo, grew to 100.\n\nParscale was generally well liked by his colleagues, who recall him as competent and intensely focused. \u201cHe was a get-shit-done type of person,\u201d says A. J. Delgado, who worked with him. Perhaps just as important, he had a talent for ingratiating himself with the Trump family. \u201cHe was probably better at managing up,\u201d Kurt Luidhardt, a consultant for the campaign, told me. He made sure to share credit for his work with the candidate\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and he excelled at using Trump\u2019s digital ignorance to flatter him. \u201cParscale would come in and tell Trump he didn\u2019t need to listen to the polls, because he\u2019d crunched his data and they were going to win by six points,\u201d one former campaign staffer told me. \u201cI was like, \u2018Come on, man, don\u2019t bullshit a bullshitter.\u2019 \u201d But Trump seemed to buy it. (Parscale declined to be interviewed for this story.)\n\nDavid A. Graham: The real problem with fake news James Barnes, a Facebook employee who was dispatched to work closely with the campaign, told me Parscale\u2019s political inexperience made him open to experimenting with the platform\u2019s new tools. \u201cWhereas some grizzled campaign strategist who\u2019d been around the block a few times might say, \u2018Oh, that will never work,\u2019 Brad\u2019s predisposition was to say, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s try it.\u2019 \u201d From June to November, Trump\u2019s campaign ran 5.9 million ads on Facebook, while Clinton\u2019s ran just 66,000. A Facebook executive would later write in a leaked memo that Trump \u201cgot elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I\u2019ve ever seen from any advertiser.\u201d Though some strategists questioned how much these ads actually mattered, Parscale was hailed for Trump\u2019s surprise victory. Stories appeared in the press calling him a \u201cgenius\u201d and the campaign\u2019s \u201csecret weapon,\u201d and in 2018 he was tapped to lead the entire reelection effort. The promotion was widely viewed as a sign that the president\u2019s 2020 strategy would hinge on the digital tactics that Parscale had mastered. Read: What Facebook did to American democracy Through it all, the strategist has continued to show a preference for narrative over truth. Last May, Parscale regaled a crowd of donors and activists in Miami with the story of his ascent. When a ProPublica reporter confronted him about the many misleading details in his account, he shrugged off the fact-check. \u201cWhen I give a speech, I tell it like a story,\u201d he said. \u201cMy story is my story.\u201d DISINFORMATION ARCHITECTURE In his book This Is Not Propaganda, Peter Pomerantsev, a researcher at the London School of Economics, writes about a young Filipino political consultant he calls \u201cP.\u201d In college, P had studied the \u201cLittle Albert experiment,\u201d in which scientists conditioned a young child to fear furry animals by exposing him to loud noises every time he encountered a white lab rat. The experiment gave P an idea. He created a series of Facebook groups for Filipinos to discuss what was going on in their communities. Once the groups got big enough\u2014about 100,000 members\u2014he began posting local crime stories, and instructed his employees to leave comments falsely tying the grisly headlines to drug cartels. The pages lit up with frightened chatter. Rumors swirled; conspiracy theories metastasized. To many, all crimes became drug crimes.\n\nUnbeknownst to their members, the Facebook groups were designed to boost Rodrigo Duterte, then a long-shot presidential candidate running on a pledge to brutally crack down on drug criminals. (Duterte once boasted that, as mayor of Davao City, he rode through the streets on his motorcycle and personally executed drug dealers.) P\u2019s experiment was one plank in a larger \u201cdisinformation architecture\u201d\u2014which also included social-media influencers paid to mock opposing candidates, and mercenary trolls working out of former call centers\u2014that experts say aided Duterte\u2019s rise to power. Since assuming office in 2016, Duterte has reportedly ramped up these efforts while presiding over thousands of extrajudicial killings. The campaign in the Philippines was emblematic of an emerging propaganda playbook, one that uses new tools for the age-old ends of autocracy. The Kremlin has long been an innovator in this area. (A 2011 manual for Russian civil servants favorably compared their methods of disinformation to \u201can invisible radiation\u201d that takes effect while \u201cthe population doesn\u2019t even feel it is being acted upon.\u201d) But with the technological advances of the past decade, and the global proliferation of smartphones, governments around the world have found success deploying Kremlin-honed techniques against their own people. Read: Peter Pomerantsev on Russia and the menace of unreality In the United States, we tend to view such tools of oppression as the faraway problems of more fragile democracies. But the people working to reelect Trump understand the power of these tactics. They may use gentler terminology\u2014muddy the waters; alternative facts\u2014but they\u2019re building a machine designed to exploit their own sprawling disinformation architecture.\n\nCentral to that effort is the campaign\u2019s use of micro-targeting\u2014the process of slicing up the electorate into distinct niches and then appealing to them with precisely tailored digital messages. The advantages of this approach are obvious: An ad that calls for defunding Planned Parenthood might get a mixed response from a large national audience, but serve it directly via Facebook to 800 Roman Catholic women in Dubuque, Iowa, and its reception will be much more positive. If candidates once had to shout their campaign promises from a soapbox, micro-targeting allows them to sidle up to millions of voters and whisper personalized messages in their ear. Parscale didn\u2019t invent this practice\u2014Barack Obama\u2019s campaign famously used it in 2012, and Clinton\u2019s followed suit. But Trump\u2019s effort in 2016 was unprecedented, in both its scale and its brazenness. In the final days of the 2016 race, for example, Trump\u2019s team tried to suppress turnout among black voters in Florida by slipping ads into their News Feeds that read, \u201cHillary Thinks African-Americans Are Super Predators.\u201d An unnamed campaign official boasted to Bloomberg Businessweek that it was one of \u201cthree major voter suppression operations underway.\u201d (The other two targeted young women and white liberals.) The weaponization of micro-targeting was pioneered in large part by the data scientists at Cambridge Analytica. The firm began as part of a nonpartisan military contractor that used digital psyops to target terrorist groups and drug cartels. In Pakistan, it worked to thwart jihadist recruitment efforts; in South America, it circulated disinformation to turn drug dealers against their bosses.\n\nThe emphasis shifted once the conservative billionaire Robert Mercer became a major investor and installed Steve Bannon as his point man. Using a massive trove of data it had gathered from Facebook and other sources\u2014without users\u2019 consent\u2014Cambridge Analytica worked to develop detailed \u201cpsychographic profiles\u201d for every voter in the U.S., and began experimenting with ways to stoke paranoia and bigotry by exploiting certain personality traits. In one exercise, the firm asked white men whether they would approve of their daughter marrying a Mexican immigrant; those who said yes were asked a follow-up question designed to provoke irritation at the constraints of political correctness: \u201cDid you feel like you had to say that?\u201d Christopher Wylie, who was the director of research at Cambridge Analytica and later testified about the company to Congress, told me that \u201cwith the right kind of nudges,\u201d people who exhibited certain psychological characteristics could be pushed into ever more extreme beliefs and conspiratorial thinking. \u201cRather than using data to interfere with the process of radicalization, Steve Bannon was able to invert that,\u201d Wylie said. \u201cWe were essentially seeding an insurgency in the United States.\u201d Cambridge Analytica was dissolved in 2018, shortly after its CEO was caught on tape bragging about using bribery and sexual \u201choney traps\u201d on behalf of clients. (The firm denied that it actually used such tactics.) Since then, some political scientists have questioned how much effect its \u201cpsychographic\u201d targeting really had. But Wylie\u2014who spoke with me from London, where he now works for H&M, as a fashion-trend forecaster\u2014said the firm\u2019s work in 2016 was a modest test run compared with what could come.\n\n\u201cWhat happens if North Korea or Iran picks up where Cambridge Analytica left off?\u201d he said, noting that plenty of foreign actors will be looking for ways to interfere in this year\u2019s election. \u201cThere are countless hostile states that have more than enough capacity to quickly replicate what we were able to do \u2026 and make it much more sophisticated.\u201d These efforts may not come only from abroad: A group of former Cambridge Analytica employees have formed a new firm that, according to the Associated Press, is working with the Trump campaign. (The firm has denied this, and a campaign spokesperson declined to comment.) After the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Facebook was excoriated for its mishandling of user data and complicity in the viral spread of fake news. Mark Zuckerberg promised to do better, and rolled out a flurry of reforms. But then, last fall, he handed a major victory to lying politicians: Candidates, he said, would be allowed to continue running false ads on Facebook. (Commercial advertisers, by contrast, are subject to fact-checking.) In a speech at Georgetown University, the CEO argued that his company shouldn\u2019t be responsible for arbitrating political speech, and that because political ads already receive so much scrutiny, candidates who choose to lie will be held accountable by journalists and watchdogs. Shady political actors are discovering how easy it is to wage an untraceable whisper campaign by text message. To bolster his case, Zuckerberg pointed to the recently launched\u2014and publicly accessible\u2014\u201clibrary\u201d where Facebook archives every political ad it publishes. The project has a certain democratic appeal: Why censor false or toxic content when a little sunlight can have the same effect? But spend some time scrolling through the archive of Trump reelection ads, and you quickly see the limits of this transparency.\n\nRead: The age of reverse censorship The campaign doesn\u2019t run just one ad at a time on a given theme. It runs hundreds of iterations\u2014adjusting the language, the music, even the colors of the \u201cDonate\u201d buttons. In the 10 weeks after the House of Representatives began its impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign ran roughly 14,000 different ads containing the word impeachment. Sifting through all of them is virtually impossible. Both parties will rely on micro-targeted ads this year, but the president is likely to have a distinct advantage. The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign have reportedly compiled an average of 3,000 data points on every voter in America. They have spent years experimenting with ways to tweak their messages based not just on gender and geography, but on whether the recipient owns a gun or watches the Golf Channel. While these ads can be used to try to win over undecided voters, they\u2019re most often deployed for fundraising and for firing up the faithful\u2014and Trump\u2019s advisers believe this election will be decided by mobilization, not persuasion. To turn out the base, the campaign has signaled that it will return to familiar themes: the threat of \u201cillegal aliens\u201d\u2014a term Parscale has reportedly encouraged Trump to use\u2014and the corruption of the \u201cswamp.\u201d Beyond Facebook, the campaign is also investing in a texting platform that could allow it to send anonymous messages directly to millions of voters\u2019 phones without their permission. Until recently, people had to opt in before a campaign could include them in a mass text. But with new \u201cpeer to peer\u201d texting apps\u2014including one developed by Gary Coby, a senior Trump adviser\u2014a single volunteer can send hundreds of messages an hour, skirting federal regulations by clicking \u201cSend\u201d one message at a time. Notably, these messages aren\u2019t required to disclose who\u2019s behind them, thanks to a 2002 ruling by the Federal Election Commission that cited the limited number of characters available in a text.\n\nMost experts assume that these regulations will be overhauled sometime after the 2020 election. For now, campaigns from both parties are hoovering up as many cellphone numbers as possible, and Parscale has said texting will be at the center of Trump\u2019s reelection strategy. The medium\u2019s ability to reach voters is unparalleled: While robocalls get sent to voicemail and email blasts get trapped in spam folders, peer-to-peer texting companies say that at least 90 percent of their messages are opened. The Trump campaign\u2019s texts so far this cycle have focused on shouty fundraising pleas (\u201cThey have NOTHING! IMPEACHMENT IS OVER! Now let\u2019s CRUSH our End of Month Goal\u201d). But the potential for misuse by outside groups is clear\u2014and shady political actors are already discovering how easy it is to wage an untraceable whisper campaign by text. In 2018, as early voting got under way in Tennessee\u2019s Republican gubernatorial primary, voters began receiving text messages attacking two of the candidates\u2019 conservative credentials. The texts\u2014written in a conversational style, as if they\u2019d been sent from a friend\u2014were unsigned, and people who tried calling the numbers received a busy signal. The local press covered the smear campaign. Law enforcement was notified. But the source of the texts was never discovered. WAR ON THE PRESS One afternoon last March, I was on the phone with a Republican operative close to the Trump family when he casually mentioned that a reporter at Business Insider was about to have a very bad day. The journalist, John Haltiwanger, had tweeted something that annoyed Donald Trump Jr., prompting the coterie of friends and allies surrounding the president\u2019s son to drum up a hit piece. The story they had coming, the operative suggested to me, would demolish the reporter\u2019s credibility.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to make of this gloating\u2014people in Trump\u2019s circle have a tendency toward bluster. But a few hours later, the operative sent me a link to a Breitbart News article documenting Haltiwanger\u2019s \u201chistory of intense Trump hatred.\u201d The story was based on a series of Instagram posts\u2014all of them from before Haltiwanger started working at Business Insider\u2014in which he made fun of the president and expressed solidarity with liberal protesters. The next morning, Don Jr. tweeted the story to his 3 million followers, denouncing Haltiwanger as a \u201craging lib.\u201d Other conservatives piled on, and the reporter was bombarded with abusive messages and calls for him to be fired. His employer issued a statement conceding that the Instagram posts were \u201cnot appropriate.\u201d Haltiwanger kept his job, but the experience, he told me later, \u201cwas bizarre and unsettling.\u201d The Breitbart story was part of a coordinated effort by a coalition of Trump allies to air embarrassing information about reporters who produce critical coverage of the president. (The New York Times first reported on this project last summer; since then, it\u2019s been described to me in greater detail.) According to people with knowledge of the effort, pro-Trump operatives have scraped social-media accounts belonging to hundreds of political journalists and compiled years\u2019 worth of posts into a dossier. Often when a particular news story is deemed especially unfair\u2014or politically damaging\u2014to the president, Don Jr. will flag it in a text thread that he uses for this purpose. (Among those who text regularly with the president\u2019s eldest son, someone close to him told me, are the conservative activist Charlie Kirk; two GOP strategists, Sergio Gor and Arthur Schwartz; Matthew Boyle, a Breitbart editor; and U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell.) Once a story has been marked for attack, someone searches the dossier for material on the journalists involved. If something useful turns up\u2014a problematic old joke; evidence of liberal political views\u2014Boyle turns it into a Breitbart headline, which White House officials and campaign surrogates can then share on social media. (The White House has denied any involvement in this effort.)\n\nDescriptions of the dossier vary. One source I spoke with said that a programmer in India had been paid to organize it into a searchable database, making posts that contain offensive keywords easier to find. Another told me the dossier had expanded to at least 2,000 people, including not just journalists but high-profile academics, politicians, celebrities, and other potential Trump foes. Some of this, of course, may be hyperbolic boasting\u2014but the effort has yielded fruit. Parscale has said the campaign intends to train \u201cswarms of surrogates\u201d to undermine coverage from local TV stations and newspapers. In the past year, the operatives involved have gone after journalists at CNN, The Washington Post, and The New York Times. They exposed one reporter for using the word fag in college, and another for posting anti-Semitic and racist jokes a decade ago. These may not have been career-ending revelations, but people close to the project said they\u2019re planning to unleash much more opposition research as the campaign intensifies. \u201cThis is innovative shit,\u201d said Mike Cernovich, a right-wing activist with a history of trolling. \u201cThey\u2019re appropriating call-out culture.\u201d What\u2019s notable about this effort is not that it aims to expose media bias. Conservatives have been complaining\u2014with some merit\u2014about a liberal slant in the press for decades. But in the Trump era, an important shift has taken place. Instead of trying to reform the press, or critique its coverage, today\u2019s most influential conservatives want to destroy the mainstream media altogether. \u201cJournalistic integrity is dead,\u201d Boyle declared in a 2017 speech at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cThere is no such thing anymore. So everything is about weaponization of information.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson drawn from demagogues around the world: When the press as an institution is weakened, fact-based journalism becomes just one more drop in the daily deluge of content\u2014no more or less credible than partisan propaganda. Relativism is the real goal of Trump\u2019s assault on the press, and the more \u201cenemies of the people\u201d his allies can take out along the way, the better. \u201cA culture war is a war,\u201d Steve Bannon told the Times last year. \u201cThere are casualties in war.\u201d This attitude has permeated the president\u2019s base. At rallies, people wear T-shirts that read rope. tree. journalist. some assembly required. A CBS News/YouGov poll has found that just 11 percent of strong Trump supporters trust the mainstream media\u2014while 91 percent turn to the president for \u201caccurate information.\u201d This dynamic makes it all but impossible for the press to hold the president accountable, something Trump himself seems to understand. \u201cRemember,\u201d he told a crowd in 2018, \u201cwhat you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re reading is not what\u2019s happening.\u201d Bryan Lanza, who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016 and remains a White House surrogate, told me flatly that he sees no possibility of Americans establishing a common set of facts from which to conduct the big debates of this year\u2019s election. Nor is that his goal. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to sell our narrative louder than the media,\u201d Lanza said. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly advocating for a liberal-socialist position, and we\u2019re never going to be in concert. So the war continues.\u201d\n\nFrom December 2019: The dark psychology of social networks Parscale has indicated that he plans to open up a new front in this war: local news. Last year, he said the campaign intends to train \u201cswarms of surrogates\u201d to undermine negative coverage from local TV stations and newspapers. Polls have long found that Americans across the political spectrum trust local news more than national media. If the campaign has its way, that trust will be eroded by November. \u201cWe can actually build up and fight with the local newspapers,\u201d Parscale told donors, according to a recording provided by The Palm Beach Post. \u201cSo we\u2019re not just fighting on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC with the same 700,000 people watching every day.\u201d Running parallel to this effort, some conservatives have been experimenting with a scheme to exploit the credibility of local journalism. Over the past few years, hundreds of websites with innocuous-sounding names like the Arizona Monitor and The Kalamazoo Times have begun popping up. At first glance, they look like regular publications, complete with community notices and coverage of schools. But look closer and you\u2019ll find that there are often no mastheads, few if any bylines, and no addresses for local offices. Many of them are organs of Republican lobbying groups; others belong to a mysterious company called Locality Labs, which is run by a conservative activist in Illinois. Readers are given no indication that these sites have political agendas\u2014which is precisely what makes them valuable.\n\nAccording to one longtime strategist, candidates looking to plant a negative story about an opponent can pay to have their desired headlines posted on some of these Potemkin news sites. By working through a third-party consulting firm\u2014instead of paying the sites directly\u2014candidates are able to obscure their involvement in the scheme when they file expenditures to the Federal Election Commission. Even if the stories don\u2019t fool savvy readers, the headlines are convincing enough to be flashed across the screen in a campaign commercial or slipped into fundraising emails. DIGITAL DIRTY TRICKS Shortly after polls closed in Kentucky\u2019s gubernatorial election last November, an anonymous Twitter user named @Overlordkraken1 announced to his 19 followers that he had \u201cjust shredded a box of Republican mail in ballots\u201d in Louisville. There was little reason to take this claim at face value, and plenty of reason to doubt it (beginning with the fact that he\u2019d misspelled Louisville). But the race was tight, and as incumbent Governor Matt Bevin began to fall behind in the vote total, an army of Twitter bots began spreading the election-rigging claim. The original post was removed by Twitter, but by then thousands of automated accounts were circulating screenshots of it with the hashtag #StoptheSteal. Popular right-wing internet personalities jumped on the narrative, and soon the Bevin campaign was making noise about unspecified voting \u201cirregularities.\u201d When the race was called for his opponent, the governor refused to concede, and asked for a statewide review of the vote. (No evidence of ballot-shredding was found, and he finally admitted defeat nine days later.)\n\nThe Election Night disinformation blitz had all the markings of a foreign influence operation. In 2016, Russian trolls had worked in similar ways to contaminate U.S. political discourse\u2014posing as Black Lives Matter activists in an attempt to inflame racial divisions, and fanning pro-Trump conspiracy theories. (They even used Facebook to organize rallies, including one for Muslim supporters of Clinton in Washington, D.C., where they got someone to hold up a sign attributing a fictional quote to the candidate: \u201cI think Sharia law will be a powerful new direction of freedom.\u201d) But when Twitter employees later reviewed the activity surrounding Kentucky\u2019s election, they concluded that the bots were largely based in America\u2014a sign that political operatives here were learning to mimic Russian trolling tactics. Of course, dirty tricks aren\u2019t new to American politics. From Lee Atwater and Roger Stone to the crooked machine Democrats of Chicago, the country has a long history of underhanded operatives smearing opponents and meddling in elections. And, in fact, Samuel Woolley, a scholar who studies digital propaganda, told me that the first documented deployment of politicized Twitter bots was in the U.S. In 2010, an Iowa-based conservative group set up a small network of automated accounts with names like @BrianD82 to promote the idea that Martha Coakley, a Democrat running for Senate in Massachusetts, was anti-Catholic.\n\nMishko\n\nSince then, the tactics of Twitter warfare have grown more sophisticated, as regimes around the world experiment with new ways to deploy their cybermilitias. In Mexico, supporters of then-President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto created \u201csock puppet\u201d accounts to pose as protesters and sabotage the opposition movement. In Azerbaijan, a pro-government youth group waged coordinated harassment campaigns against journalists, flooding their Twitter feeds with graphic threats and insults. When these techniques prove successful, Woolley told me, Americans improve upon them. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if there\u2019s a Columbian exchange between developing-world authoritarian regimes and the West,\u201d he said.\n\nParscale has denied that the campaign uses bots, saying in a 60 Minutes interview, \u201cI don\u2019t think [they] work.\u201d He may be right\u2014it\u2019s unlikely that these nebulous networks of trolls and bots could swing a national election. But they do have their uses. They can simulate false consensus, derail sincere debate, and hound people out of the public square. According to one study, bots accounted for roughly 20 percent of all the tweets posted about the 2016 election during one five-week period that year. And Twitter is already infested with bots that seem designed to boost Trump\u2019s reelection prospects. Regardless of where they\u2019re coming from, they have tremendous potential to divide, radicalize, and stoke hatred that lasts long after the votes are cast. Rob Flaherty, who served as the digital director for Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s presidential campaign, told me that Twitter in 2020 is a \u201chall of mirrors.\u201d He said one mysterious account started a viral rumor that the gunman who killed seven people in Odessa, Texas, last summer had a beto bumper sticker on his car. Another masqueraded as an O\u2019Rourke supporter and hurled racist invective at a journalist. Some of these tactics echoed 2016, when Russian agitators posed as Bernie Sanders supporters and stirred up anger toward Hillary Clinton. Flaherty said he didn\u2019t know who was behind the efforts targeting O\u2019Rourke, and the candidate dropped out before they could make a real difference. \u201cBut you can\u2019t watch this landscape and not get the feeling that someone\u2019s fucking with something,\u201d he told me. Flaherty has since joined Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, which has had to contend with similar distortions: Last year, a website resembling an official Biden campaign page appeared on the internet. It emphasized elements of the candidate\u2019s legislative record likely to hurt him in the Democratic primary\u2014opposition to same-sex marriage, support for the Iraq War\u2014and featured video clips of his awkward encounters with women. The site quickly became one of the most-visited Biden-related sites on the web. It was designed by a Trump consultant. FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE As the president\u2019s reelection machine ramps up, Democratic strategists have found themselves debating an urgent question: Can they defeat the Trump coalition without adopting its tactics?\n\nOn one side of this argument is Dmitri Mehlhorn, a consultant notorious for his willingness to experiment with digital subterfuge. During Alabama\u2019s special election in 2017, Mehlhorn helped fund at least two \u201cfalse flag\u201d operations against the Republican Senate candidate, Roy Moore. For one scheme, faux Russian Twitter bots followed the candidate\u2019s account to make it look like the Kremlin was backing Moore. For another, a fake social-media campaign, dubbed \u201cDry Alabama,\u201d was designed to link Moore to fictional Baptist teetotalers trying to ban alcohol. (Mehlhorn has claimed that he unaware of the Russian bot effort and does not support the use of misinformation.) When The New York Times uncovered the second plot, one of the activists involved, Matt Osborne, contended that Democrats had no choice but to employ such unscrupulous techniques. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re fighting with one hand tied behind your back,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cYou have a moral imperative to do this\u2014to do whatever it takes.\u201d Others have argued that this is precisely the wrong moment for Democrats to start abandoning ideals of honesty and fairness. \u201cIt\u2019s just not in my values to go out there making shit up and tricking voters,\u201d Flaherty told me. \u201cI know there\u2019s this whole fight-fire-with-fire contingent, but generally when you ask them what they mean, they\u2019re like, \u2018Lie!\u2019 \u201d Some also note that the president has already handed them plenty of ammunition. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Democratic campaign is going to need to make stuff up about Trump,\u201d Judd Legum, the author of a progressive newsletter about digital politics, told me. \u201cThey can stick to things that are true.\u201d Eventually, the fear of covert propaganda inflicts as much damage as the propaganda itself. One Democrat straddling these two camps is a young, tech-savvy strategist named Tara McGowan. Last fall, she and the former Obama adviser David Plouffe launched a political-action committee with a pledge to spend $75 million attacking Trump online. At the time, the president\u2019s campaign was running more ads on Facebook and Google than the top four Democratic candidates combined. McGowan\u2019s plans to return fire included such ads, but she also had more creative\u2014and controversial\u2014measures in mind.\n\nFor example, she established a media organization with a staff of writers to produce left-leaning \u201chometown news\u201d stories that can be micro-targeted to persuadable voters on Facebook without any indication that they\u2019re paid for by a political group. Though she insists that the reporting is strictly factual, some see the enterprise as a too-close-for-comfort co-opting of right-wing tactics. When I spoke with McGowan, she was open about her willingness to push boundaries that might make some Democrats queasy. As far as she was concerned, the \u201csuper-predator\u201d ads Trump ran to depress black turnout in 2016 were \u201cfair game\u201d because they had some basis in fact. (Clinton did use the term in 1996, to refer to gang members.) McGowan suggested that a similar approach could be taken with conservatives. She ruled out attempts to misinform Republicans about when and where to vote\u2014a tactic Mehlhorn reportedly considered, though he later said he was joking\u2014but said she would pursue any strategy that was \u201cin the bounds of the law.\u201d \u201cWe are in a radically disruptive moment right now,\u201d McGowan told me. \u201cWe have a president that lies every day, unabashedly \u2026 I think Trump is so desperate to win this election that he will do anything. There will be no bar too low for him.\u201d This intraparty split was highlighted last year when state officials urged the Democratic National Committee to formally disavow the use of bots, troll farms, and \u201cdeepfakes\u201d (digitally manipulated videos that can, with alarming precision, make a person appear to do or say anything). Supporters saw the proposed pledge as a way of contrasting their party\u2019s values with those of the GOP. But after months of lobbying, the committee refused to adopt the pledge. From May 2018: The era of fake video begins Meanwhile, experts worried about domestic disinformation are looking to other countries for lessons. The most successful recent example may be Indonesia, which cracked down on the problem after a wave of viral lies and conspiracy theories pushed by hard-line Islamists led to the defeat of a popular Christian Chinese candidate for governor in 2016. To prevent a similar disruption in last year\u2019s presidential election, a coalition of journalists from more than two dozen top Indonesian news outlets worked together to identify and debunk hoaxes before they gained traction online. But while that may sound like a promising model, it was paired with aggressive efforts by the state to monitor and arrest purveyors of fake news\u2014an approach that would run afoul of the First Amendment if attempted in the U.S. Richard Stengel, who served as the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy under President Obama, spent almost three years trying to counter digital propaganda from the Islamic State and Russia. By the time he left office, he told me, he was convinced that disinformation would continue to thrive until big tech companies were forced to take responsibility for it. Stengel has proposed amending the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability for messages posted by third parties. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter, he believes, should be required by law to police their platforms for disinformation and abusive trolling. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to solve the whole problem,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut it\u2019s going to help with volume.\u201d There is one other case study to consider. During the Ukrainian revolution in 2014, pro-democracy activists found that they could defang much of the false information about their movement by repeatedly exposing its Russian origins. But this kind of transparency comes with a cost, Stengel observed. Over time, alertness to the prevalence of propaganda can curdle into paranoia. Russian operatives have been known to encourage such anxiety by spreading rumors that exaggerate their own influence. Eventually, the fear of covert propaganda inflicts as much damage as the propaganda itself. Once you internalize the possibility that you\u2019re being manipulated by some hidden hand, nothing can be trusted. Every dissenting voice on Twitter becomes a Russian bot, every uncomfortable headline a false flag, every political development part of an ever-deepening conspiracy. By the time the information ecosystem collapses under the weight of all this cynicism, you\u2019re too vigilant to notice that the disinformationists have won. POWERS OF INCUMBENCY If there\u2019s one thing that can be said for Brad Parscale, it\u2019s that he runs a tight ship. Unauthorized leaks from inside the campaign are rare; press stories on palace intrigue are virtually nonexistent. When the staff first moved into its new offices last year, journalists were periodically invited to tour the facility\u2014but Parscale put an end to the practice: He didn\u2019t want them glimpsing a scrap of paper or a whiteboard scribble that they weren\u2019t supposed to see. Notably, while the Trump White House has endured a seemingly endless procession of shake-ups, the Trump reelection campaign has seen very little turnover since Parscale took charge. His staying power is one reason many Republicans\u2014inside the organization or out\u2014hesitate to talk about him on the record. But among allies of the president, there appears to be a growing skepticism. Former colleagues began noticing a change in Parscale after his promotion. Suddenly, the quiet guy with his face buried in a laptop was wearing designer suits, tossing out MAGA hats at campaign rallies, and traveling to Europe to speak at a political-marketing conference. In the past few years, Parscale has bought a BMW, a Range Rover, a condo, and a $2.4 million waterfront house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \u201cHe knows he has the confidence of the family,\u201d one former colleague told me, \u201cwhich gives him more swagger.\u201d When the U.K.\u2019s Daily Mail ran a story spotlighting Parscale\u2019s spending spree, he attempted deflection through flattery. \u201cThe president is an excellent businessman,\u201d he told the tabloid, \u201cand being associated with him for years has been extremely beneficial to my family.\u201d But according to a former White House official with knowledge of the incident, Trump was irritated by the coverage, and the impression it created that his campaign manager was getting rich off him. For a moment, Parscale\u2019s standing appeared to be in peril, but then Trump\u2019s attention was diverted by the G7 summit in France, and he never returned to the issue. (A spokesperson for the campaign disputed this account.) Some Republicans worry that for all Parscale\u2019s digital expertise, he doesn\u2019t have the vision to guide Trump to reelection. The president is historically unpopular, and even in red states, he has struggled to mobilize his base for special elections. If Trump\u2019s message is growing stale with voters, is Parscale the man to help overhaul it? \u201cPeople start to ask the question\u2014you\u2019re building this apparatus, and that\u2019s great, but what\u2019s the overarching narrative?\u201d said a former campaign staffer. But whether Trump finds a new narrative or not, he has something this time around that he didn\u2019t have in 2016\u2014the powers of the presidency. While every commander in chief looks for ways to leverage his incumbency for reelection, Trump has shown that he\u2019s willing to go much further than most. In the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, he seized on reports of a migrant caravan traveling to the U.S. from Central America to claim that the southern border was facing a national-security crisis. Trump warned of a coming \u201cinvasion\u201d and claimed, without evidence, that the caravan had been infiltrated by gang members. Parscale aided this effort by creating a 30-second commercial that interspersed footage of Hispanic migrants with clips of a convicted cop-killer. The ad ended with an urgent call to action: stop the caravan. vote republican. In a final maneuver before the election, Trump dispatched U.S. troops to the border. The president insisted that the operation was necessary to keep America safe\u2014but within weeks the troops were quietly called back, the \u201ccrisis\u201d having apparently ended once votes were cast. Skeptics were left to wonder: If Trump is willing to militarize the border to pick up a few extra seats in the midterms, what will he and his supporters do when his reelection is on the line? Read: McKay Coppins on the conservatives trying to ditch fake news It doesn\u2019t require an overactive imagination to envision a worst-case scenario: On Election Day, anonymous text messages direct voters to the wrong polling locations, or maybe even circulate rumors of security threats. Deepfakes of the Democratic nominee using racial slurs crop up faster than social-media platforms can remove them. As news outlets scramble to correct the inaccuracies, hordes of Twitter bots respond by smearing and threatening reporters. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has spent the final days of the race pumping out Facebook ads at such a high rate that no one can keep track of what they\u2019re injecting into the bloodstream. After the first round of exit polls is released, a mysteriously sourced video surfaces purporting to show undocumented immigrants at the ballot box. Trump begins retweeting rumors of voter fraud and suggests that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers should be dispatched to polling stations. are illegals stealing the election? reads the Fox News chyron. are russians behind false videos? demands MSNBC. The votes haven\u2019t even been counted yet, and much of the country is ready to throw out the result. NOTHING IS TRUE There is perhaps no better place to witness what the culture of disinformation has already wrought in America than a Trump campaign rally. One night in November, I navigated through a parking-lot maze of folding tables covered in MAGA merch and entered the BancorpSouth Arena in Tupelo, Mississippi. The election was still a year away, but thousands of sign-waving supporters had crowded into the venue to cheer on the president in person. Once Trump took the stage, he let loose a familiar flurry of lies, half-lies, hyperbole, and nonsense. He spun his revisionist history of the Ukraine scandal\u2014the one in which Joe Biden is the villain\u2014and claimed, falsely, that the Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams wanted to \u201cgive illegal aliens the right to vote.\u201d At one point, during a riff on abortion, Trump casually asserted that \u201cthe governor of Virginia executed a baby\u201d\u2014prompting a woman in the crowd to scream, \u201cMurderer!\u201d This incendiary fabrication didn\u2019t seem to register with my companions in the press pen, who were busy writing stories and shooting B-roll. I opened Twitter, expecting to see a torrent of fact-checks laying out the truth of the case\u2014that the governor had been answering a hypothetical question about late-term abortion; that a national firestorm had ensued; that there were certainly different ways to interpret his comments but that not even the most ardent anti-abortion activist thought the governor of Virginia had personally \u201cexecuted a baby.\u201d But Twitter was uncharacteristically quiet (apparently the president had said this before), and the most widely shared tweet I found on the subject was from his own campaign, which had blasted out a context-free clip of the governor\u2019s abortion comments to back up Trump\u2019s smear.

Among liberals, there is a comforting caricature of Trump supporters as gullible personality cultists who have been hypnotized into believing whatever their leader says. The appeal of this theory is the implication that the spell can be broken, that truth can still triumph over lies, that someday everything could go back to normal\u2014if only these voters were exposed to the facts. But the people I spoke with in Tupelo seemed to treat matters of fact as beside the point. One woman told me that, given the president\u2019s accomplishments, she didn\u2019t care if he \u201cfabricates a little bit.\u201d A man responded to my questions about Trump\u2019s dishonest attacks on the press with a shrug and a suggestion that the media \u201cought to try telling the truth once in a while.\u201d Tony Willnow, a 34-year-old maintenance worker who had an American flag wrapped around his head, observed that Trump had won because he said things no other politician would say. When I asked him if it mattered whether those things were true, he thought for a moment before answering. \u201cHe tells you what you want to hear,\u201d Willnow said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not\u2014but it sounds good, so fuck it.\u201d The political theorist Hannah Arendt once wrote that the most successful totalitarian leaders of the 20th century instilled in their followers \u201ca mixture of gullibility and cynicism.\u201d When they were lied to, they chose to believe it. When a lie was debunked, they claimed they\u2019d known all along\u2014and would then \u201cadmire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.\u201d Over time, Arendt wrote, the onslaught of propaganda conditioned people to \u201cbelieve everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true.\u201d Leaving the rally, I thought about Arendt, and the swaths of the country that are already gripped by the ethos she described. Should it prevail in 2020, the election\u2019s legacy will be clear\u2014not a choice between parties or candidates or policy platforms, but a referendum on reality itself.
