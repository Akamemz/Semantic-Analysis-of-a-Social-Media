    "content": "In this topsy-turvy political landscape , it \u2019 s perhaps unsurprising that a pair of Ivy Leaguers are fighting it out for a Texas Senate seat , but it certainly is surprising that the liberal Democrat is being given a fighting chance .\nRep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke , the fresh-faced , onetime punk rocker and Columbia grad , is crisscrossing the Lone Star State selling a message that hasn \u2019 t resonated there for years : a future with free health care , more immigrants and fewer guns . The congressman from El Paso spreads his platform in a pickup truck and has plenty of cash .\nIndeed , his fundraising is a match for incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz , a former Princeton debating champ and presidential candidate who acknowledges he \u2019 s in his toughest political battle .\nMr. Cruz is starting to pop up in Texas towns as often as Mr. O \u2019 Rourke , looking to head off the Democrat \u2019 s surge .\nWhile the Real Clear Politics polling average gives Mr. Cruz a 4-percentage-point advantage , it has moved the race into the toss-up category . Mr. Cruz no longer enjoys the double-digit lead he held in some polls when summer began . The tight race is even drawing President Trump , who says he will hold a rally for Mr. Cruz in October .\nMr. O \u2019 Rourke has benefited from an almost adulatory press , and there \u2019 s no question he is tapping into widespread Democratic animus toward Mr. Trump . While he doesn \u2019 t use the word \u201c impeachment , \u201d the notion that the president is guilty of \u201c high crimes and misdemeanors \u201d is something Mr. O \u2019 Rourke makes clear he takes as proven .\nThe Cruz camp has gleefully plastered Mr. O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s mug shot in social media posts , an unflattering portrait taken by Texas authorities after his driving while intoxicated arrest in 1998 . Mr. O \u2019 Rourke , then 26 , was traveling at \u201c a high rate of speed \u201d in a 75 mph zone when he hit another car and , according to a witness , tried to flee the scene .\nThat was one of two brushes with the law for the younger Mr. O \u2019 Rourke , who was also arrested in 1995 on an attempted burglary charge . Neither arrest resulted in a felony conviction , and the DWI was vacated after Mr. O \u2019 Rourke completed a court-ordered program .\nStill , a young man with beer and a pickup truck is hardly a disqualifying image in Texas , and to anyone reading the coverage of Mr. O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s bid , it would seem an enhancement . In state and local accounts , he is invariably portrayed as a charismatic , 45-year-old idealist who galvanizes enthusiastic crowds .\nMr. Cruz , on the other hand , is presented as a more dour figure , although at 47 he is essentially the same age as Mr. O \u2019 Rourke .\n\u201c I think the dynamic in Texas is that you have an energetic new face against a person in Cruz whom Texans know well and conservatives support , but that warmth is not there , \u201d said Cal Jillson , a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University .\nBoth men serve in Congress , but Mr. Cruz has the higher profile that comes with the Senate \u2014 and he is using that to his advantage this week with his defense of Mr. Trump \u2019 s Supreme Court nominee , Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh .\nMr. Cruz picked apart Democratic objections , arguing that they were rooted in a desire to fuel their party \u2019 s \u201c most angry activists . \u201d\nIn a radio appearance Tuesday , Mr. Cruz did not cite Mr. O \u2019 Rourke by name , but he drew clear lines between his position on Judge Kavanaugh and that of liberal Democrats , who \u201c all want to vote \u2018 no . \u2019 \u201d\nDoing so , Mr. Cruz said , would put them \u201c wildly out of step with the state they represent , \u201d alluding to polls that show clear majorities in most states favoring Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to vote \u2018 yes \u2019 because the people of Texas want a strong , principled constitutionalist on the court who will defend our fundamental liberties , \u201d Mr. Cruz said . \u201c Who will defend free speech , who will defend religious liberty \u2014 and who will defend the Second Amendment . \u201d\nMr. Cruz is hitting traditional conservative favorites , running ads urging Texans to stand when the national anthem is played and pointing to Mr. O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s defense of pro football players who choose to kneel .\nConservative groups are rushing to his defense , with the Club for Growth vowing to spend liberally to back Mr. Cruz .\nMr. O \u2019 Rourke , meanwhile , has energized liberal activists who have gone years without having reason to be enthusiastic about their chances in a Texas senatorial race .\nThe last Democrat to win a Senate race in Texas was Lloyd Bentsen , in 1988 . The last Democratic victory in any statewide race in the state was in 1994 .\nBoosting Mr. O \u2019 Rourke is an unorthodox yet folksy approach that appears to be tapping into voters well beyond the liberal base .\nHe swears profusely , so much so that the Cruz campaign used it in an ad and The Texas Tribune declared \u201c f-bombs are part of his brand . \u201d\nIn a widely watched YouTube video , Mr. O \u2019 Rourke speaks at a backyard barbecue in March .\n\u201c We \u2019 re putting party over country , ideology over results , presidential ambition over the needs of the people that we should be serving and representing , \u201d Mr. O \u2019 Rourke says . \u201c And I was stuck in this limo in D.C. wondering , what the f\u2013 are these guys doing in Washington , D.C. ? \u201d\nLast month , after a San Antonio supporter sent him a skateboard , Mr. O \u2019 Rourke tweeted a photo of himself smiling as he clutched it .\n\u201c You need a little , like , moment , \u201d he tweeted . \u201c So this is going to be our Zen . Right here . This skateboard . \u201d\nThat evening , the campaign put out a video that went viral of Mr. O \u2019 Rourke skateboarding in a Whataburger parking lot . His hometown paper , the El Paso Times , quoted approving responses from what it called supporters , with one saying it \u201c conveys an athletic free spirit and a youthful energy . \u201d\nHe had almost $ 14 million on hand at the end of June , according to campaign finance records . That left him with more money than the Cruz campaign , which reported $ 9.3 million in the till on the same date .\nThe O \u2019 Rourke campaign boasts of an army of small givers , suggesting a true grassroots network of financial support . One liberal activist raised enough money on GoFundMe to place a mobile billboard displaying a nasty Trump tweet about Mr. Cruz \u2014 or \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted \u201d \u2014 outside the president \u2019 s rally for the senator .\nYet Mr. O \u2019 Rourke has received nearly 60 percent of his money from large , individual contributions , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . Mr. Cruz has taken in one-third of his money from similar contributions .\nMr. Cruz \u2019 s struggles to put distance in the race compare unfavorably with Gov . Greg Abbott , a Republican seeking re-election , who holds a near 20-point lead in most polls .\nBut Mr. Abbott , with $ 40 million in his campaign account , could help Mr. Cruz . Mr. Jillson said that consequently , \u201c the messaging down the stretch is going to be overwhelmingly Republican . \u201d\nThe reason Mr. Cruz does not enjoy the same polling margins as Mr. Abbott is simple , according to Mr. Jillson : \u201c He \u2019 s lovable and Cruz is not . \u201d\nBut Texas is still Texas , Mr. Jillison said , and Mr. Cruz \u2019 s reputation as a fighter and his conservative bona fides will prove decisive .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t expect [ Mr. O \u2019 Rourke ] to win at the end of the day , and I suspect the polls right now show him as a little closer than he really is , \u201d Mr. Jillson said .",
