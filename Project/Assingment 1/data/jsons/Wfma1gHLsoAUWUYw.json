A BuzzFeed data analysis found that viral stories falsely claiming that the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump , that Hillary Clinton was implicated in the murder of an FBI agent , that Clinton had sold weapons to ISIS , all received more Facebook engagement than the most popular news stories from established outlets such as the New York Times and CNN . Made-up stories with a liberal slant made the rounds as well , although the evidence suggests they propagated less widely . And the fakery didn \u2019 t stop with the election : The \u201c Pizzagate \u201d meme , which inspired an armed man to open fire inside a Washington , D.C. , pizzeria earlier this month , began as a conspiracy theory but has been widely circulated by fake news sites .\nAt a time when trust in the media is at an all-time low and political polarization is intensifying , fake news is hardly the only pox afflicting our democracy . But it is one against which we can try to inoculate ourselves , and perhaps one another .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 has created a new tool for internet users to identify , debunk , and\u2014most importantly\u2014combat the proliferation of bogus stories . Conceived and built by \u2588\u2588\u2588 developers , with input and oversight from \u2588\u2588\u2588 editors , it \u2019 s a Chrome browser extension called This Is Fake , and you can download and install it for free either on its home page or in the Chrome web store . The point isn \u2019 t just to flag fake news ; you probably already know it when you see it . It \u2019 s to remind you that , anytime you see fake news in your feed , you have an opportunity to interrupt its viral transmission , both within your network and beyond .\nOnce you install the extension , as you scroll through your Facebook feed , stories that \u2588\u2588\u2588 has identified as fake news will be flagged with a red banner over the preview image , informing you that they \u2019 ve been debunked . What differentiates This Is Fake from some other , earlier experiments in fake-news prevention is that the banner links directly to an article from a reputable source that debunks the story in question , and it prompts the user to share the debunking as a comment on the offending post . This is the antiviral functionality , one whose success depends on your participation . When the tool sees a fake story in your feed , it will look like this :\nSimilarly , stories from websites we \u2019 ve identified as serial fabricators will be flagged with a banner noting that their source is known for spreading fake news . Users who have installed This Is Fake and connected it to their Facebook accounts can also help us build our running list of fake stories and repeat offenders by flagging them for our moderators .\nSo how do we decide which stories count as fake ? It \u2019 s a crucial question , and a surprisingly tricky one . The short answer is that we rely on crowdsourcing and human moderation by \u2588\u2588\u2588 staffers and contributors , who will manage a database of flagged sites and links .\nHere \u2019 s the longer answer : Until recently , fake news often referred to the news satire of publications like the Onion and shows like The Daily Show . But the term was given new meaning by the recent flood of false news stories concocted primarily to deceive rather than to lampoon or poke fun . And in the wake of the election , fake news has become a political football , with some Trump critics blaming it for his victory while some Trump supporters throw the label back at the mainstream media . In the process , the phrase fake news has threatened to become a catchall for a motley array of perceived problems in public discourse , from partisan propaganda to misleading tweets or headlines , to biased or flawed news coverage by major media organizations . Even works of commentary and opinion journalism now risk being labeled \u201c fake news \u201d by readers who disagree with their premises or conclusions .\nPropaganda , bias , and misleading headlines are all issues worthy of attention in a broader examination of the media . So are the factual errors that established media organizations routinely make in the course of their work , whether through honest error or negligence .
