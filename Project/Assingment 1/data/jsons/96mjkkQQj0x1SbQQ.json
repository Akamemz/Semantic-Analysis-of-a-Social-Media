    "content": "When retiring Sen. Harry Reid was first elected to the House in 1982 , Ronald Reagan was president and Tip O \u2019 Neill was the speaker . It was the much-vaunted era of bipartisan deal-making between the Republican president and Democratic speaker \u2013 political opposites , but also friends .\nBack then , the newbie from Nevada was a conservative Democrat who swelled with pride over meeting Reagan . \u201c Independent Like Nevada \u201d was an early campaign slogan .\nHow politics have changed . On Thursday , Senator Reid delivered a farewell speech of nearly 90 minutes after three decades in the Senate \u2013 a dozen of them as the Senate 's pugilistic majority and minority leader . Like his party , he \u2019 s turned left and more partisan , and has been vilified by Republicans for his fighting leadership style .\nHis sparring partner , majority leader Mitch McConnell ( R ) of Kentucky , paid tribute to Reid by dwelling on his hard-scrabble years growing up in Nevada ; on Reid 's long marriage , and on the two leaders ' joint love of baseball \u2013 a graceful way around their turbulent time at political loggerheads . Indeed , Republicans , who have veered hard right , ca n't wait to see him go .\n\u201c For me , his time here has been one of failure , obstruction , and gridlock , \u201d pronounced Sen. John Barrasso ( R ) of Wyoming on Tuesday , as GOP leaders held their weekly session with reporters . The Republican may have couched this view as his own , but its purpose as a public parting shot was unmistakable .\nAnd how did Reid react , when , moments later he stepped to the same microphones , presumably for his last press conference ?\n\u201c I was never running to be popular with Republicans , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 ve had a job to do with President Obama . I \u2019 ve done the best that I can . And I don \u2019 t have any regrets whatsoever about my efforts to push forward a Democratic agenda . \u201d\nThe arc of Harry Reid \u2019 s career in Washington is the arc of politics in America .\nIt started in the 1980s when reaching across the aisle was more common than today , despite sharp ideological differences . It rose through a period of general cohesiveness at the turn of the decade , when the Berlin Wall fell and Operation Desert Storm repelled Iraq \u2019 s invasion of Kuwait .\nBut the curve of political workability plunged with the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998 , followed by the furor over George W. Bush \u2019 s Iraq War and the descent into hyper-partisanship and gridlock that characterized the Obama years .\nIn November , voters attempted to dynamite the political establishment in Washington with the surprise presidential election of celebrity billionaire Donald Trump , a Republican without a predictable ideology .\nWhere the political trajectory will go next is anybody \u2019 s guess , but Reid reflected fondly on his early years in Washington when asked about it at his Tuesday press conference .\n\u201c We can look back with pleasure at those days when Tip O \u2019 Neill and Ronald Reagan would have a drink after work and sing songs and reflect upon even better times as they saw them , \u201d he said .\nHistorians warn about interpreting those years as a golden era of political altruism .\nTrue , lawmakers actually still lived in Washington and regularly socialized , which made it easier to work together . It helped enormously that O \u2019 Neill and Reagan developed a friendship . But the speaker cut deals with the president because he didn \u2019 t have enough Democratic votes to fight him .\nMidway through Reagan \u2019 s second term , in 1986 , Reid ran for the Senate and won . At that time , the chamber was \u201c filled with master legislators , \u201d recalls Jim Manley , Reid \u2019 s former spokesman , who previously worked for the liberal lion from Massachusetts , Ted Kennedy . \u201c If you worked at it , you could form compromises with Republicans . \u201d\nIn Reid \u2019 s view , the turning point came in the era of Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich , whose \u201c Republican Revolution \u201d in 1994 swept the GOP to control of both houses midway through Bill Clinton \u2019 s first term .\n\u201c The Gingrich era \u2026 poisoned the Congress very , very much , \u201d said Reid at his press conference . Exhibit A : The first impeachment of a president since 1868 .\nAnd yet , in 1999 , when Reid became the No . 2 Democrat to leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota \u2013 a position called the \u201c whip , \u201d who is responsible for corralling votes \u2013 the Nevadan was still on Republicans \u2019 good side .\nDespite the fact that Democrats were the opposition party , Republicans trusted Reid so much that they allowed him to make the procedural moves necessary to wrap up the Senate at night , knowing that he would not abuse that trust , according to Mr. Manley .\nIt was as whip that Reid mastered the parliamentary skill and maneuvering that prepared him to take over as minority leader after Senator Daschle \u2019 s stunning defeat in 2004 .\n\u201c He learned that tactics is everything , \u201d says Ross Baker , an expert on Congress at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , N.J . Unusually , Mr. Baker has three times perched himself as a \u201c scholar in residence \u201d observing Reid 's office \u2013 the latest this past spring .\nThe tactics and horse-trading that Reid learned on the floor enabled him to deliver for his state \u2013 fighting off for years the proposed nuclear waste repository site at Yucca Mountain , for instance .\nAnd they helped him as majority leader in 2009 , when the country was on the verge of economic collapse in the Great Recession , to push through a $ 787 billion economic stimulus and the Affordable Care Act , which got not a single Republican vote .\nFor Reid , those are proud legislative achievements , as well as his standing shoulder-to-shoulder with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D ) of California to stop the privatization of Social Security as proposed by President Bush in 2005 .\nBut his political legacy is without question his highly controversial decision as majority leader to blow up Senate rulemaking . In 2013 , Democrats unilaterally decided to strip the minority \u2019 s right to filibuster a president \u2019 s appointees to federal courts and executive positions . Only Supreme Court nominees \u2013 and also legislation \u2013 are still subject to a 60-vote blocking threshold .\nDeployment of this \u201c nuclear option \u201d has wounded the chamber \u2019 s ability to function as a deliberative body , sometimes explained as the saucer to the tea cup that is the House , where majority rules and passions run over . Reid 's decision to drop that bomb is perhaps the best illustration of his overriding character as a \u201c fighter , \u201d as his No . 2 , Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois describes it .\nReid \u2019 s battles go back to his tough childhood in Searchlight , Nev. , south of Las Vegas . His father was a hard-rock miner and alcoholic who committed suicide . To make ends meet , his mother did the laundry for nearby brothels .\nIn his farewell speech , he mentioned his pride in saving up to buy false teeth for his mother , who had lost hers due to an accident . This , and other health needs for his impoverished family , help explain why he 's been such `` an avid supporter '' of Obamacare , he said .\nAs a teenager , Reid hitchhiked 40 miles to high school in Henderson . There his civics teacher and boxing coach \u2013 Reid became locally known as a middleweight boxer \u2013 became his political mentor .\nAfter law school , he was elected to the Nevada Assembly , and later was elected lieutenant governor . He was appointed Nevada \u2019 s gaming commissioner , and then it was on to Washington . Few of his elections have been cakewalks .\nAs Reid acknowledges , he 's no great orator ( journalists have to lean in close at press conferences to hear his whispery voice ) , nor is he a policy visionary .\nBut he can block a punch , protecting his caucus from dangerous Republican \u201c messaging \u201d or \u201c gotcha \u201d votes , as well as deliver one . The senator is known for his indelicate comments , calling the second President Bush \u201c a loser \u201d and \u201c a liar . \u201d\nReid has often defended his decision to \u201c go nuclear , \u201d justifying it as the only way to break through heavy use of the filibuster by obstructionist Republicans \u2013 the same criticism Republicans level at Democrats .\nHe was particularly frustrated by his inability to get Obama \u2019 s federal judges confirmed , particularly to the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals \u2013 the second most powerful court in the country . Reid was able to confirm three judges to the court after he swept away the filibuster .
