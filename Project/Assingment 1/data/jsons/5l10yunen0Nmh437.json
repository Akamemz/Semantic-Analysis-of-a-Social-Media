Privately , it \u2019 s killing many of them to do it .\nA substantial slice of Wisconsin Republican Party veterans and business leaders can \u2019 t stand Cruz 's combative style in the Senate , abhor his hard line on immigration , could do without his heavy religious rhetoric and have misgivings about his general election prospects . But they \u2019 re willing to swallow all of that to back their best hope of beating Donald Trump , though some can \u2019 t help but pine for Paul Ryan \u2014 or someone like him \u2014 coming out of a contested convention .\nCruz \u201c may not be their first choice , but he may be their only choice , \u201d said Brandon Scholz , a longtime GOP operative who runs a governmental and public affairs shop in Madison . \u201c Others who have not been on the Cruz ship are , at least at this point , buying into , Wisconsin is the firewall to stop Trump . \u201d\nA prominent Wisconsin Republican business leader , who required anonymity in order to speak freely , added that he expects that the business community will turn out next Tuesday , and \u201c a narrow hold-your-nose vote for Cruz \u201d majority will prevail among those Republicans .\n\u201c There will be a stop-Trump vote , but I do not think it reflects enthusiasm for Cruz , \u201d this person said . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be an unenthusiastic vote . It \u2019 s a pick-your-poison vote that does not have the business community fired up . They \u2019 re basically [ asking ] , \u2018 What color suicide vest do you wear ? \u2019 \u201d\nIt 's a far cry for the enthusiasm many in the state show for Ryan , who , as well as being a native son , matches Cruz 's fiscal conservatism with a less combative approach to governing , a deep focus on `` empowerment '' for impoverished communities and an emphasis on expanding the party . It 's a vision , and certainly a tone , more in keeping with Marco Rubio than with Cruz , and it 's one that many in the party seem to be struggling to fully let go of .\n\u201c With our style here , the sort of inclusive , aspirational style of conservatism Paul Ryan would represent , the big question in my mind was , what would happen when Rubio dropped out , would Rubio backers be willing to make the switch to Cruz , who , quite frankly , is not a natural fit here ? \u201d said Charlie Sykes , a prominent conservative radio host and a leader in the stop-Trump movement in Wisconsin .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think people know [ Cruz ] very well here , I think the evangelical style might have been a little harder-edged than we \u2019 re used to , \u201d Sykes said .\nDespite that awkward fit between the hard-line conservative Texas senator and a Wisconsin GOP that has prioritized unity , the establishment has united for him and against Trump in a way that it has n't in other states .\nLeading Wisconsin Republican voices from Sykes himself to Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker are backing Cruz , with varying degrees of enthusiasm . Walker said Tuesday that he is \u201c proud \u201d to back the Texas senator . Both Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos , who like many others in the state establishment were backing Rubio after Walker dropped out of the race , are now supporting Cruz .\nIt appears to be yielding results : Cruz surged to a 10-point lead over a stagnant Trump ahead of next week \u2019 s primary , according to the Marquette Law School poll \u2014 the state \u2019 s most reliable pollster .\nFor some of Cruz \u2019 s newfound supporters , however , it remains a marriage of expediency , and it hasn \u2019 t stopped establishment eyes from wandering .\nSome are gaming out a scenario in which Cruz wins Wisconsin and goes on to keep Trump under the needed number of delegates to become the nominee \u2014 paving the way , potentially , for someone else to emerge from a brokered convention .\nIn the weeks before he made his endorsement , even Walker floated the possibility of another candidate emerging as the nominee from an open convention , saying , \u201c if it \u2019 s an open convention , it \u2019 s very likely it would be someone who \u2019 s not currently running . \u201d\nFormer Congressman Scott Klug , a Cruz critic who is supporting Ohio Gov . John Kasich , says that pining for Ryan , the home-state congressman and House speaker , is widespread .\n\u201c Very consciously , a lot of people are hoping it \u2019 s Paul , \u201d Klug said , adding that he personally thinks a brokered convention \u2014 respect for Ryan aside \u2014 would be \u201c absolute chaos . \u201d\nRyan himself has said repeatedly that he does not want the nomination and wants someone who ran for president this year to be the nominee . He has also said that this `` no '' is different from the ones he initially offered about becoming House speaker , calling it `` a totally different situation . ''\nStill , Ryan 's fans are hoping they can coax him to the top of the party ticket the way they once did to the top of the House . Ryan also , as Mitt Romney 's 2012 running mate , has experience on the presidential campaign trial , and many in Wisconsin and beyond see him as a future president .\nBut barring a stunning last-minute change from Ryan , for center-right Wisconsin Republicans , for now , the choice is Cruz .\nMany lining up behind Cruz buy his campaign \u2019 s principal line about why he should get their support : Trump must be stopped , and Cruz \u2014 with his deep organization in Wisconsin and nationally , his well-funded campaign and his reliably conservative record \u2014 is the only one with a shot at doing it .\nThe endorsement from Right Wisconsin , the website associated with Sykes , acknowledged that Cruz was not a first or even second choice , but it called him the candidate best-positioned to take on Trump .\n\u201c If you look at the political establishment in southeastern Wisconsin , it very heavily leans Cruz , from the talk show hosts all the way to a lot of state leadership , \u201d Klug said . \u201c The whole southeast Wisconsin infrastructure is tilting Cruz to freeze out Trump . \u201d\nSykes said that when Vos , the assembly speaker , \u201c who I really did not expect to come around , '' came on board , `` it indicated this is a binary choice , '' suggesting that `` if Wisconsin is going to be a firewall , you had to support Cruz , you had to at least tactically decide for Cruz . You can feel the dominoes falling in that respect in the last four days . \u201d\nThat Cruz is now the choice of Wisconsin \u2019 s establishment is a remarkable development , given that the Texas senator made his name running as a fiercely anti-establishment insurgent who routinely clashes with party leadership in Washington , and whose views , particularly on immigration , have only grown more conservative throughout the primary campaign , to the dismay of Chamber of Commerce types who want a more big-tent approach .\nBut in Wisconsin , home to Walker and to Ryan , who are both considered quite conservative , the entire GOP has moved right over the past 10 years . Walker , who during his failed presidential bid was considered too conservative by more centrist donors and party leaders aligned with other candidates elsewhere in the country , is the establishment here .\nWalker \u2019 s statewide approval rating has plummeted since his presidential bid , but Scholz said he still holds significant sway over Republicans in the state \u2014 it is very much his party \u2014 and his endorsement is likely to sway some fence-sitters .\n\u201c If they \u2019 re in the establishment , they are sitting there going , \u2018 I \u2019 m not certain what I \u2019 m going to do , \u2019 I think the governor \u2019 s endorsement speaks a lot , means a lot , \u201d he said .\nAnd while Trump \u2019 s policy positions have been all over the ideological map , Cruz \u2019 s policy views also square fairly well with party leadership , said Mark Graul , another longtime GOP operative in the state .\nCruz \u201c has got a lot to offer center-right conservatives , \u201d he said . \u201c Probably on eight out of 10 issues , center-right voters agree with Ted Cruz . That \u2019 s not the case with Donald Trump . \u201d\nNationally , those reservations \u2014 along with concerns over Cruz \u2019 s hard-line views \u2014 have caused some moderate donors and party leaders to decide to stay out of the primary altogether and focus on House and Senate races instead .
