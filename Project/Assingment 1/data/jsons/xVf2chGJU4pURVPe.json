    "content": "Akhil Reed Amar is a professor of constitutional law at Yale University and the author of `` The Law of the Land : A Grand Tour of Our Constitutional Republic . '' The opinions expressed in this commentary are his .\n( CNN ) I do not embrace Ted Cruz politically , but I do embrace his right to run for president , and so should you .\nHere is our first question : Who decides whether Cruz is eligible ? My answer : At first , you do . We , the people , do . We do this on Election Day when we cast our ballots with the Constitution in our hearts and minds if not in our hands . If you think Cruz is ineligible \u2014 if what I say here does not persuade you \u2014 you can vote against him .\nIf Cruz gets enough electoral votes this fall , then Congress and not the Supreme Court should be the final legal judge of Cruz 's eligibility . The Constitution 's 12th Amendment clearly says that Congress counts the electoral votes at a special session ; and thus Congress is constitutionally authorized to refuse to count any electoral votes that Congress considers invalid .\nElsewhere , Article I , section 5 of the Constitution makes clear that each house of Congress may `` judge '' whether a would-be member of that house meets the constitutional eligibility rules for that house . Suppose Mr. Smith wants to go to Washington as a senator . He wins election in his home state . But the Constitution says a senator must be 30 years old .\nIf a dispute arises about Smith 's age , about whether there a proper birth certificate and what it says , the Constitution clearly says the Senate is `` the judge '' of Smith 's birth certificate dispute .\nSimilarly , for presidential elections the Constitution 's structure makes Congress the judge of any birth certificate dispute or any other issue of presidential eligibility . Congress can not fabricate new presidential eligibility rules but it is the judge of the eligibility rules prescribed in the Constitution .\nThus , ordinary courts should butt out , now and forever . They have no proper role here , because the Constitution itself makes Congress the special judge . In legal jargon , the issue is a `` nonjusticiable political question . ''\nOrdinary courts should butt out , now and forever . Akhil Reed Amar\nPresidents should pick judges , not vice versa . This is one reason why the Supreme Court 's 2000 ruling in Bush v. Gore was a disgrace and is now widely viewed by experts as such .\nOK , so voters and Congress decide , but what is the right answer to the Cruz question and how can ordinary citizens deduce this right answer ?\nSimple : We can read the Constitution , which was written for ordinary citizens . And then we can fold in a few simple points about constitutional history , tradition and common sense .\nArticle II requires that a president must be either a U.S. citizen `` at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution '' \u2014 that is , 1788 \u2014 or else `` a natural born Citizen . '' Though old-fashioned , Cruz was not around in 1788 . So he needs to be \u2014 just like everyone else running for president today \u2014 a `` natural born Citizen . ''\nFor starters , put aside the word `` natural . '' Ask yourself whether Cruz is a `` born Citizen . '' In other words , was he a citizen on the day he was born ? Was he a citizen because of his birth , because of where and how and to whom he was born ? Note what the text does NOT say . It does not say , Springsteen-like , that a president must be `` born in the United States . '' Yet it would have been so easy to say that , had that been the founders ' legal meaning and the legal purpose !\nSo the question is , was Ted Cruz born a citizen ? The Constitution says , in the 14th Amendment , that anyone born in the United States and subject to our laws is a U.S. citizen . Today , that means everyone born on American soil except children of foreign diplomats \u2014 even children whose parents are not themselves U.S citizens . Donald Trump , are you listening ?\nUnlike Barack Obama , who was born in Hawaii \u2014 again , please pay attention , Donald ! \u2014 Cruz is not a citizen at birth because of where he was born . Cruz was born in Canada . But neither Article II nor the 14th Amendment says that only those born in the United States are birth citizens . The 14th Amendment says that birth on American soil is sufficient to be a birth citizen . But it is not necessary .\nHow else can a person be a citizen at birth ? Simple . From the founding to the present , Congress has enacted laws specifying that certain categories of foreign-born persons are citizens at birth . The earliest statute , passed in 1790 , explicitly called certain foreign-born children of U.S. citizens `` natural born citizens . '' It did not say they should be treated `` as if '' they were `` natural born citizens . '' It said they were in law deemed and declared to be `` natural born citizens . '' Congressional laws have changed over the years , but this 1790 law makes clear that from the beginning , Congress by law has the power to define the outer boundaries of birth-citizenship by conferring citizenship at birth to various persons born outside the United States .\nAnd here is the key point : The statute on the books on the day Cruz was born made him a citizen on that day .\nThe statute on the books on the day Cruz was born made him a citizen on that day . Akhil Reed Amar\nThe statute conferred birth-based American citizenship on any foreign-born baby who had at least one parent who was a U.S. citizen , so long as that parent had met certain conditions of extensive prior physical presence in the United States .\nOn the day of his birth , Cruz 's mother was a U.S. citizen , even though his father was not ; and his mother also apparently met the relevant rules of extensive prior physical presence .\nA critical aside : Why would Barack Obama have been any different even if he had been born in Kenya , as has been preposterously but repeatedly claimed by Trump ? Like Cruz , Obama 's mother was a U.S. citizen on the day of his birth , even though , like Cruz , his father was not . And nothing in the relevant congressional statute treats a Kenyan birth as any different from a Canadian birth .\nThe answer to this puzzle is that the congressional law on the books when Obama was born required a foreign-born child to have at least one citizen parent who had been physically present in the United States at least five years after age 14 . Obama 's mother did not clear this bar , because she was only 18 when she gave birth . So this birth had to happen in the United States to make her son a citizen at birth . Of course this birth did in actual fact happen in the United States , in the state of Hawaii , despite all Trump 's malevolent mischief .\nOK , back to Cruz who was a citizen at birth . He was born a citizen . He is a citizen because of the way he was born . And all this is clear if we look at the relevant citizenship law that was on the books on the day of his birth . Read it for yourself : Act of June 27 , 1952 , 66 Stat . 235-36 ; Title III , ch . 1 , section 301 ( a ) ( 7 ) . ( Note that Cruz 's mother apparently met the requirement of the law to have lived in the United States at least five years after age 14 ; she was in her 30s when Cruz was born . )\nBut what about that word I asked you to put aside for a moment \u2014 the word , `` natural '' ? Does that word change the analysis ?\nNo . That word confirms the analysis . First , the word itself derives from Latin and French roots that are about birth . The word is arguably redundant ( in the way that much of language is ) . In effect , the Constitution says that a president must be a `` birth-born citizen . '' But the word `` natural '' does add a key clarification : Congress is empowered by statute to define birthright citizenship under its Article I , section 8 power to pass a `` Rule of Naturalization . ''\nNote the obvious linguistic link between `` natural '' ( Article II ) and `` Naturalization '' ( Article I ) . Under this Article I Naturalization power ( in tandem with Article II and with another sweeping clause at the end of Article I , section 8 ) , Congress can define who is a citizen at birth , and can also allow persons who are not birth citizens \u2014 and thus not eligible to be president \u2014 to become citizens at some post-birth moment . Henry Kissinger , Madeleine Albright , Arnold Schwarzenegger : None of these persons was born a citizen ; none is eligible to be president ; but all have become nonbirth citizens \u2014 naturalized as opposed to natural-born citizens \u2014 thanks to congressional naturalization statutes .\nSo Congress has two powers under the Naturalization power : to define birth citizens , eligible for the presidency , and to allow other nonbirth citizens to become naturalized citizens , to treat them for most other ( nonpresidential ) purposes as if they had been born citizens .\nWhen the framers were drafting the Constitution , they were aware that the British Parliament had a long tradition of passing both types of naturalization laws , and the founders were specifically aware of laws that Parliament had passed conferring birthright status upon certain babies born to English parents outside England , babies referred to by these landmark statutes as `` natural born . ''\nNote that the right question to ask is not : What were the natural-born statutory rules in 1788 or 1790 ? The right question is : What are the natural-born statutory rules on the day a given presidential candidate was born ? These statutory rules have changed over the years , and Article II builds these future changes into its elegant language .\nAnd a good thing , too , given that the rules of 1790 were rather sexist . In both England and America , the law in that era typically focused on the status of a foreign-born baby 's father , not mother . In other sections of the 1790 law , race tests were in place , treating `` white '' persons better than all others .\nIronies abound . Cruz is eligible , but thanks to modern \u2014 newfangled , nonsexist , nonracist \u2014 naturalization laws . Had Cruz been born in 1790 to a noncitizen father it is not at all clear that he would have been eligible .\nCruz is eligible , but thanks to modern\u2014newfangled , nonsexist , nonracist\u2014naturalization laws . Akhil Reed Amar\nAnd although he has managed to make this all about Cruz , the real person whose fundamental fitness for office is called into question by a careful constitutional examination of the natural born clause is none other than Donald Trump .\nHere 's why . Beyond the rules of formal eligibility , our next president surely needs to understand the Constitution \u2014 and Donald Trump does not . He has repeatedly suggested that courts should decide this . Wrong ; the Constitution itself make voters and Congress the judges . Trump has repeatedly suggested the issue is where someone is born . Wrong again . Many born outside the United States have been eligible from the beginning .\nTrump also denies the full citizenship of those who have in fact been born in the United States . Wrong yet again . Anyone born in the United States ( except for the child of a foreign diplomat ) is a full citizen under the clear words of the Constitution and very well settled Supreme Court case law . Trump has also repeatedly and outrageously challenged the natural-born citizenship of President Obama in racially coded/dog-whistle ways that strongly suggest Trump scorns basic constitutional principles of racial equality .\nIf you take the Constitution seriously , especially its rules about citizenship , you are welcome to vote for Cruz , but you should never vote for Trump .",
