    "content": "There was a predictable conventional wisdom heading into Wednesday 's post-election press conference that President Obama would need to announce some sort of vaguely defined course correction , or at least show contrition . That he would need to develop a list of center-right policy proposals to discuss with Mitch McConnell over some sort of ice-breaking lunch . That he would have to abandon the partisan posture that allegedly hung his party out to dry on Tuesday night .\nWhat a shocking development it must have been , then , to see the president not completely change his set of beliefs and priorities overnight after his party fared poorly in a midterm election .\nHe reiterated his intention to take whatever executive action on immigration he legally can by the end of the year while also encouraging Congress to deliver a comprehensive immigration reform bill that he knows will never come . He said he will veto the bills he believes are bad ideas , such as a repeal of the Affordable Care Act or of its most crucial components . He will be open to working on the right-of-center policy positions that he 's always been annoyingly open to : trade deals and corporate tax reform . He still wants to fix bridges and roads and increase the minimum wage . The only major policy that he seemed to introduce -- and it 's an important one -- was in welcoming an Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) to define the war against ISIS .\nHe 's basically the same guy he was the day before the election , and that 's going to send many in Washington to their fainting couches . Why ca n't he abandon his plans for executive action on immigration ? Why wo n't he fire someone ? Why wo n't he agree to sign everything the Republicans send him ? Does n't he realize he has to change if he wants to accomplish things with Republicans ?\nLest we forget , though , he 's been through this once before , after the 2010 elections . And he appears to have learned the right lessons from that : No changes in his behavior are going to cause a rapprochement with Republicans .\nRemember the big , sad show he put on after 2010 , the last time he was pressured into changing his ways overnight ? It makes you wince . Hiring Bill Daley , a person who had no idea what he was doing , to serve as chief of staff in order to curry favor with the `` business community . '' Signing a two-year extension of the top-bracket Bush tax cuts . Allowing Republicans to trick him into negotiating over a raise in the debt ceiling . Trying countless times to pursue a `` grand bargain '' deficit deal on taxes and social insurance programs .\nWhat he got in return for these efforts was nothing . ( And thank God , by the way , that he did n't get a grand bargain . ) The Republican Party refused to negotiate with him , because the current Republican Party 's identity is forged on being oppositional to Barack Obama . If it were to agree with him on some significant piece of legislation , then that would make Barack Obama something less-than-Satan , which would make the Republican Party ... what ?\nLet 's do a thought experiment . Say Barack Obama dropped his plan to take executive action on immigration in order to foster cooperation with Republicans on passing comprehensive immigration reform . What would happen ? He 'd be denounced by a significant portion of the Democratic base , perhaps irreparably . And then the Republican leaders in the House and Senate would proceed to do exactly nothing on immigration , because it 's not in their members ' interests to cut a comprehensive immigration reform deal with Barack Obama . And then Obama , because he is the president , would get the blame for nothing `` getting done '' in Washington . What possible reason is there for him to delay executive action on immigration ? He can either improve the lives of millions of people , excite the members of his party , and have Republicans hate him or improve the lives of no one , depress the members of his party , and have Republicans hate him .\nOtherwise , it 's not exactly clear what he could do for a `` fresh start .
