    "content": "President Obama launched into his second term with a sharply worded inaugural address Monday -- using the platform to `` reject '' steep cuts to entitlements , press for an immigration reform package and wag the finger at Washington 's penchant for `` name-calling '' and `` spectacle . ''\nHours later , the president took the traditional ride down Pennsylvania Avenue back to the White House . As he did four years ago , he and first lady Michelle Obama exited the limo and walked the final stretch , waving to the crowd as they went .\nObama 's 20-minute inaugural address , delivered to a packed crowd on the National Mall right after he took the oath of office , effectively set the tone for the next four years . After a rocky four years marked by bitter battles between the White House and Republicans in Congress , Obama made clear he would continue to press those lawmakers to move toward him on some of the toughest policy questions ahead .\nThe president quickly toggled through a host of agenda items , but used some of his most forceful language to defend costly entitlement programs like Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security that could be the target of cuts in upcoming fiscal talks .\nDeclaring that the country can not succeed `` when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it , '' he described those programs as a vital safety net -- though , without some intervention , budget forecasters warn they will not be sustainable in the long term .\n`` We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit . But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future , '' Obama said . `` The commitments we make to each other -- through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security -- these things do not sap our initiative ; they strengthen us . They do not make us a nation of takers ; they free us to take the risks that make this country great . ''\nWhile setting his terms for looming budget fights , the president also worked in a call for immigration reform .\n`` Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving , hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity ; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country , '' he said .\nFurther outlining his goals for a second term , he said the administration would `` respond to the threat of climate change . ''\nThe president , in closing , appeared to chide the minority party , saying : `` We can not mistake absolutism for principle , or substitute spectacle for politics , or treat name-calling as reasoned debate . ''\nAt the same time , he urged the country to set aside differences and work together toward addressing challenges ranging from the country 's tax code to its education system .\n`` Now , more than ever , we must do these things together , as one nation , and one people , '' Obama said , on the west front of the Capitol . `` My fellow Americans , we are made for this moment , and we will seize it -- so long as we seize it together . ''\nObama , over the course of the speech , appeared to offer a series of assurances to his supporters that he would continue to fight for the issues he campaigned on . However , while Obama was buoyed by his decisive win over Mitt Romney in November , he nevertheless enters the second term facing a packed agenda and a divided Congress he 'll have to win over if he wants to get it passed .\nFor the president , the second term essentially began after Election Day , when he started negotiating with congressional Republicans on the fiscal crisis .

Partisan lines , as a result of the November elections , appeared only to harden , with Democrats locking down control of the Senate and Republicans doing likewise in the House .
