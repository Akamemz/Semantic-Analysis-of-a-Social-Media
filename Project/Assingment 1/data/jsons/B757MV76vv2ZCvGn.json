    "content": "Now that we \u2019 re nearly at the end of the Summer of Trump , you could be forgiven for feeling like you and \u201c The Donald \u201d need a break .\nBut before you really devote yourself to purging this cherisher of women from your mind , do yourself a favor and read Evan Osnos \u2019 s recent New Yorker piece on the \u201c loose alliance \u201d of scared and angry Americans who are driving the Trump phenomenon . As Osnos understands , Trump \u2019 s supporters , who are part of a nativist resurgence throughout Western politics , are more important than the man himself . And regardless of Trump 2016 \u2019 s ultimate fate , these people aren \u2019 t going anywhere .\nI \u2019 ve written previously about the Trumpites ( or Trumpeteers , if you prefer ) and how they \u2019 re defined as much by their authoritarianism as their ethno-nationalism . But while those characteristics are certainly present among the people Osnos spoke to for his report , another trait jumps out , too . And it \u2019 s one that helps explain why the Republican Party establishment is so out of touch , and so incapable of defeating Trump in a zero-sum battle for influence .\nThe trait is a lack of belief . Not in God or country , both of which Trump supporters rather enjoy , but rather in the fundamental legitimacy of American society \u2019 s most powerful and entrenched institutions ; the government , the banks , the media , the academy , etc . Because aside from one extremely notable exception ( which we \u2019 ll talk about in a bit ) , there \u2019 s not a single major institution of American political life that these folks wouldn \u2019 t like to see Trump conquer \u2014 the Republican Party itself very much included .\nFor a sense of how this plays out in the real world , think of the now-infamous opening question of the GOP \u2019 s first top-tier presidential debate . In truth , the question was more of an order : Any candidate who would not promise to support the GOP in 2016 , regardless of the candidate , was asked to raise their hand . The request was ostensibly directed toward all of the debate participants , but everyone knew its real target was the only candidate who hadn \u2019 t ruled out a third-party run : Trump .\nThe question was an attempt to bring Trump to heel by leveraging the Republican Party \u2019 s institutional prestige against him . The goal was simple : expose Trump as a bad team-player . And if we lived in a time when party loyalty mattered , it probably would \u2019 ve worked . But the devoted reactionaries who now comprise the GOP base don \u2019 t trust \u2014 much less like \u2014 the \u201c RINOs \u201d among them . The patent anti-Trump bias of the Fox News/Republican Party borg only made them love him more .\nThat \u2019 s certainly the impression you get reading Osnos \u2019 s piece , or this Time report on a recent focus group run by Frank Luntz . One woman tells Luntz that she is \u201c frustrated beyond belief. \u201d She says she feels like she \u2019 s been \u201c lied to , \u201d because despite Republican gains in the 2014 midterms , \u201c [ n ] othing \u2019 s getting better. \u201d Her sentiment was widely and deeply shared . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to show the Republicans that we \u2019 ve had it with them , \u201d another woman said . \u201c They treat us like crap , \u201d she added . \u201c That \u2019 s why we want Trump . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s hard to imagine there \u2019 s anything the Republican Party can do in this climate to win the favor of Trump \u2019 s supporters . But state Republican Party efforts in North Carolina , South Carolina , and Virginia to \u201c compel \u201d Trump to swear loyalty to the GOP are especially doomed . Such an ultimatum is not only \u201c [ t ] he kind of thing that could make [ Trump ] bolt the GOP , \u201d as ex-Trump advisor Roger Stone tweeted . It \u2019 s the kind of thing that could make Trump supporters in those states vote for a third-party . Or simply not vote .\nSo the GOP is in quite a bind . If it goes after Trump , it will only bring him and his supporters closer together . But if the Republican Party tries to ignore him , or allow him to transform it into an American version of UKIP , then it will no longer be able to serve its fundamental purpose of winning elective office for Republican candidates \u2014 especially the ones aiming for the White House . And if you \u2019 re looking at this from the perspective of the GOP as an institution , that \u2019 s unacceptable .\nFor conservatives trying to win the Trumpites back to the GOP , it seems , the Holy Grail would align the party with an institution that has even more gravitas and authority than Donald Trump . And as I said earlier , polling suggests there is at least one institution that fits the bill . Using it as a wedge to separate Trump from his admirers , however , would raise some major ethical questions . For example , what if the cure for Trumpism is somehow even worse ?\nBecause the institution in question is the military \u2014 which Americans trust far more than the media , organized religion , and the rest of the government \u2014 that \u2019 s a real concern . It was when he spoke of the armed forces that Luntz \u2019 s focus group adored Trump the most . \u201c [ T ] he military is going to be so strong , \u201d he promised , \u201c nobody is going to mess around with the United States. \u201d He got nearly unanimous 100s for that boast , apparently ; \u201c a seldom occurrence among focus groups , \u201d according to Time .\nPerhaps the world should be thankful , then , that there is no war hero or celebrity general for the GOP to task with destroying Trump . ( Thanks , Paula ! ) But if we assume that Trump is succeeding mainly because he reaches voters who felt otherwise ignored , and not because of any extraordinary political talents , then there \u2019 s no reason to think the problem Trump represents will go away once he does . It could just as easily come back again and again and again , each time in a slightly different form .\nAnd if the GOP eventually does find a military figure who is acceptable to the establishment while simultaneously bringing the Trumpites back into the party tent ? Well , then there may be a time in the not-so-distant future when we \u2019 ll pine for the relatively benign and innocent days of the Summer of Trump .",
