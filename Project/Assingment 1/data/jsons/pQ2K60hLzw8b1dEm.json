Former acting CIA Director Michael J. Morell resigned his fellowship at the Kennedy School 's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in protest . Pompeo followed by dropping out of a Harvard forum .\nIn response , Kennedy School Dean Douglas Elmendorf rescinded Manning 's fellowship in an open letter , insisting he had failed to strike the right balance between `` what members of the Kennedy School community could learn from that person 's visit against the extent to which that person 's conduct fulfills the values of public service to which we aspire . '' If studying the hair-splitting of academic bureaucrats is your thing , you can read Elmendorf 's entire retreat here .\nMy only thought on the matter is this : I ca n't take seriously any academic institution that believes Corey Lewandowski ( whose neighbors allege in legal filings that he cut off their electricity and threatened them while wielding a baseball bat ) and Sean Spicer ( a throne-sniffing yes-man ) `` fulfill the values of public service to which we aspire . '' Manning and the Trumpkins are apples and oranges , but if she 's rotten fruit , they are , too .\nI 'd rather discuss the student who recently had her Harvard acceptance revoked , Michelle Jones , an Indiana woman who served 20 years of a 50-year sentence for murdering her four-year-old son .\nWhen Jones became pregnant at 14 as the result of a rape , her mother beat her in the abdomen . Jones gave birth to a son she named Brandon . She spent most of her teen years in foster care , suffered domestic violence , and became an abuser herself . At 18 , she severely beat Brandon and left him alone in an apartment for several days . When she returned , finding him dead , she buried the body and told no one until several years later , when seeking help at a mental health crisis center .\nIf that 's all Harvard knew about Jones you might understand why she wo n't be pursuing her PhD in history there . But thanks to some gut-wrenching reporting by Eli Hager with The Marshall Project , we know much more .\nJones became what 's known as a `` model prisoner , '' a term d'art in the criminal justice world for prisoners who do on the inside what they often could n't on the outside : learn useful skills , seek treatment for their mental health issues , abide by the rules , and engage in pro-social behavior .\nDespite having little access to the outside world , Jones became a scholar of women 's incarceration , doggedly investigating the crimes for which women were incarcerated in the 19th century and what happened to them behind bars . She was able to obtain a bachelor 's degree , and led a team of prisoners on an award-winning research project .\nAll that , combined with otherwise sterling behavior , led the prosecutor who convicted her to recommend an early release from prison to pursue a PhD in history . Her first choice was Harvard .\nAnd , initially , Harvard chose her , too . Jones `` was one of the strongest candidates in the country last year , period , '' Harvard historian Elizabeth Hinton told Hager . But after she was accepted , a group of professors banded together with university administrators to reverse the decision . They feared , according to Hager , Jones acceptance `` would cause a backlash among rejected applicants , conservative news outlets or parents of students . ''\nMeanwhile , criminal justice advocates , historians , and Jones 's prosecutor went on the record praising her credentials as a PhD candidate and decrying Harvard 's decision to punish her for a second time . `` I 'm the prosecutor , not them , '' former prosecutor Marger Moore said of Harvard 's decision . `` Michelle Jones served her time , and she served a long time , exactly what she deserved . A sentence is a sentence . ''\nNow Jones will do her scholarship at New York University .\n`` One of our considerations , '' Harvard Prof. John Stauffer told Hager , `` was if this candidate is admitted to Harvard , where everyone is an elite among elites , that adjustment could be too much . ''\nAt another point in the interview , Stauffer gives Hager a very different answer : `` Frankly , we knew that anyone could just punch her crime into Google , and Fox News would probably say that P.C . liberal Harvard gave 200 grand of funding to a child murderer , who also happened to be a minority . I mean , c'mon . ''\nIt is difficult to overstate the magnitude of Jones ' accomplishment . We make prisoners sleep in cages , do menial work for nickels and dimes , and stand up and sit down on command .

In many facilities , we provide inadequate health care and menial education and job training opportunities , and turn a blind eye to the physical and emotional abuse they endure at the hands of correctional officers and other prisoners . Yet we expect that upon their release these prisoners will not just behave better , but be better than they were when they committed their crimes .\nJones could be forgiven for failing under all those circumstances , yet she exceeded the wildest expectations of the biggest bleeding heart you 'll ever meet .
