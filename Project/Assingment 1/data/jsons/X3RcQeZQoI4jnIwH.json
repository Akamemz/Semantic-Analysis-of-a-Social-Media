Margin for error on decisive trade vote : 2 But backers believe they still have the upper hand ahead of Tuesday morning vote .\nTrade proponents appear to have the momentum heading into Tuesday \u2019 s decisive Senate vote on President Barack Obama \u2019 s bid for expanded powers to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact . But the suspense rose Tuesday morning when Sen. Ted Cruz announced he is switching his vote against the trade legislation , giving backers an even smaller margin for error on what \u2019 s already expected to be a very close vote .\nAs of Monday evening , pro-trade Democrats were keeping their positions tightly held , but sources in both parties said the trade measure is likely to win the 60 votes needed to clear a filibuster by liberals . That would put the bill on course for Obama \u2019 s desk , after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner devised a complex procedural scheme to sidestep Democratic opposition in the House .\nThe Cruz switch means McConnell ( R-Ky. ) can now afford to lose only two of the 14 pro-trade Democrats who last month backed a package granting Obama \u201c fast-track \u201d trade authority and a companion measure to help workers who lose their jobs to free trade .\n\u201c TPA has become enmeshed in corrupt Washington backroom deal-making , along with serious concerns that it would open up the potential for sweeping changes in our laws that trade agreements typically do not include , \u201d Cruz wrote in a column posted Tuesday on the conservative site Breitbart .\nThe Senate on Tuesday is voting only on so-called Trade Promotion Authority , not the workers aid program known as Trade Adjustment Assistance . That has some Democrats nervous about whether a separate effort to approve worker assistance will succeed , given that Republicans strongly oppose the program .\nOrganized by Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D-Wash. ) , who is threatening to vote no , a group of pro-trade Democrats huddled for a strategy session in the Capitol on Monday evening . Most emerged tight-lipped , but several Democrats said that the vote is likely to succeed on Tuesday morning .\n\u201c It \u2019 s probably going to get over the hump , \u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine ( D-Va. ) .\nStill , inside the private session , several senators raised the possibility that they might want something in return for their support . Some said they would press for a vote on the Export-Import Bank , which will expire at the end of the month unless Congress takes action .\nA key Democratic architect of the trade legislation said he has work to do overnight to convince his colleagues to stay on board .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve got a lot to do tonight . I \u2019 ve been listening to my colleagues and I always get a lot out of it , \u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) , who plans to vote yes on Tuesday . \u201c There are number of areas that struck me as reasonable that they want to have pursued . \u201d\nMcConnell is seeking to placate Democrats by locking in a vote on the worker-assistance bill to immediately follow the fast-track bill , tying TAA to a proposal intended to boost the economies of African nations . That goes beyond a verbal commitment that many Democrats said is not enough for them and assures that both pieces of legislation can clear the Senate if Democrats stand behind them .\nSo far , only a handful of Democrats have said explicitly that they will back the fast-track bill without the worker protections being directly attached : Sens . Bill Nelson of Florida , Dianne Feinstein of California , Wyden and Tom Carper of Delaware . Kaine is also leaning in favor . That \u2019 s an uptick from last week , when only Carper and Nelson were publicly committed to voting \u201c yes . \u201d\nA spokeswoman for another pro-trade Democrat , Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland , would say only that Cardin preferred that the fast-track legislation and worker aid be tied together . Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo . ) said four times on Monday evening : \u201c I \u2019 m not going to talk about it. \u201d And pro-trade Sen. Jeanne Shaheen ( D-N.H. ) said until she is satisfied that all pieces of the trade package will pass , \u201c I \u2019 m a \u2018 no \u2019 vote . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s the same issue . We want reassurance that TAA \u2026 as well as the enforcement packages are gon na go as they were passed out of the Senate originally , \u201d Shaheen said .\nAnd then there \u2019 s Cantwell , who said in an interview last week that she would vote no on the package as currently constructed without stronger commitments from GOP leaders on TAA \u2019 s future . She declined to say what her position on was on Monday night , but a colleague described her as \u201c very upset \u201d with McConnell for not holding a binding vote on the Export-Import Bank before it expires at the end of the month . McConnell held a mostly symbolic vote on renewing the bank after he pledged to give it a vote during the Senate \u2019 s last go-round on trade .\n\u201c McConnell made a commitment also on another issue , Export-Import Bank , to Maria Cantwell , and did not keep it . But I can not imagine McConnell would go back on a commitment on TAA that he made to the president , \u201d Nelson said . \u201c She is very upset , still . And I don \u2019 t blame her . \u201d\nOn Monday afternoon , McConnell made a personal pledge to shepherd the worker aid bill through the Senate . And despite the uncertainty , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) vowed Monday that he was \u201c absolutely confident \u201d that Republicans will help pass the worker-assistance program and follow through on their promise .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no question in my mind we \u2019 ll pass TAA , \u201d Hatch said . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to do that . We know that , even though we don \u2019 t like TAA . We know that \u2019 s the price of getting TPA through . \u201d\nMcConnell \u2019 s chief vote counter , Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas , said he is \u201c optimistic \u201d that Congress can finish work on fast track this week .\n\u201c We did it before and as long as everybody votes the way they did last time , we \u2019 ll do it again , \u201d Cornyn said in an interview Monday .\nPro-trade Democrats , clearly in the minority of their party on trade , have mostly dodged the issue publicly , seeking to avoid the tension between the business and liberal wings of the Democratic coalition . Labor and liberal groups are pressing the undeclared Democrats to rebuff the latest deal , arguing it \u2019 s worse than the package they voted for earlier .

I think the evidence is quite overwhelming that our past trade agreements have been a disaster for the American worker , \u201d said Sanders , who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president .\nAsked whether his side can win , Sanders was noncommittal : \u201c We \u2019 re doing our best .
