Climate change is his No . 1 issue , he says , as he holds a \u201c Mother Earth \u201d poster . He \u2019 s also been drawn to Bernie Sanders 's proposals for education reform and free tuition for all .\n\u201c Bernie is an honest man , \u201d Mr. Biron says . \u201c He speaks his mind \u2013 a lot like Trump \u2013 but with a lot more love . \u201d\nReferences to the controversial real estate mogul , however , were very few at the rally , in fact . And surprisingly , when there were , there was little vitriol toward the leading GOP candidate , who has also drawn out millions of first-time voters on the Republican side . Sanders supporters here say they see common ground with Trump supporters in their desire to shake up the Washington establishment and their candidates ' populist messages .\nThe actress and Coney Island native Rosario Dawson , who opened the evening rally on Thursday , even described Donald Trump as , in many ways , a fellow revolutionary at this moment in American political history .\n\u201c We need to be reaching out and talking to those folks who are supporting Trump , \u201d Ms. Dawson told the Bronx crowd . \u201c Why ? Because they are supporting him for a reason . They are standing up behind him because he \u2019 s opposed to the establishment as well . And they \u2019 re literally standing behind a guy who they know will go into the Oval Office and say , \u2018 You \u2019 re fired ! \u2019 \u2019 \u2019\n\u201c I can understand that , \u201d Ms. Dawson continued . \u201c But I \u2019 m supporting the guy who \u2019 s looking at all of us and saying , \u2018 You \u2019 re hired . \u2019 \u201d\nTrump 's inflammatory comments about Muslims , Latino immigrants , and women seemed less top of mind in Saint Mary 's Park than his supporters \u2019 demand for economic change . While supporters of the two insurgent candidates share a belief they 've been left behind by the globalized , digital economy , a new Pew Research Center survey shows that supporters of the two insurgent candidates are far apart on the issues . For example , 69 percent of Trump supporters think that immigrants are a burden on the US , while 14 percent of Sanders voters share that belief . Some 64 percent of Trump voters believe that Muslims should be subject to greater scrutiny , while just 12 percent of Sanders supporters do . Some 77 percent of Sanders voters believe that the government should be responsible for providing health care for all ; just 14 percent of Trump voters do .\nReferences to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton , on the other hand , drew boos , hisses , and even shouts of anger . And while the Democratic race has not been nearly as much of a bitter intra-party battle as the Republican side , there are continuing signs of deep divisions among the Bernie and Hillary factions .\nDawson excoriated \u201c the other Democratic candidate \u201d for referring to undocumented workers as \u201c illegals \u201d and for using the terms \u201c superpredators \u201d and \u201c deadbeats \u201d when talking about crime and welfare reform in the past . \u201c Shame on you , Hillary , \u201d she said , also referencing the FBI investigation into her use of a non-government email server .\nMuch of this , of course , can be attributed to the heat of the presidential race , and former Secretary of State Clinton \u2019 s commanding , if not nearly insurmountable , lead in the race for the Democratic nomination . But person after person at the rally expressed a deep distaste for \u201c the other candidate . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t trust her , and I don \u2019 t think I would support her even if the Democratic party chooses her , \u201d says Stephanie Edwards , a public relations specialist from Washington Heights in Manhattan , and an eight-year veteran who served as a combat medic with the US Army . \u201c I feel like it \u2019 s time to break the mold , it \u2019 s time to do something different . \u201d\nShe notes , too , that \u201c this is the first time I \u2019 ve ever gotten involved in a campaign to this magnitude , \u201d volunteering for Sanders \u2019 s phone banks and canvassing operations after hearing something she \u2019 s never heard before from a politician . Now 40 , this was her first political rally .\nClinton \u2019 s support for the crime bill signed into law by her husband , former President Bill Clinton , directly affected her family , say Ms. Edwards . Her uncle was deported to the Dominican Republic after being convicted of two misdemeanor crimes in New York , she says .\nKevin Rose , a bartender in Greenwich Village in Manhattan , who immigrated from Canada 20 years ago , recently became a citizen just to vote for Sanders , he says . But he would \u201c absolutely not \u201d vote for Clinton . \u201c I don \u2019 t trust her ; never have , never will , \u201d he says . \u201c I will likely still vote for Bernie as a write-in campaign , if she wins . \u201d\nAnother speaker at the rally , the Puerto Rican rapper and multiple Grammy winner Residente , told the diverse crowd that \u201c It will represent an insult to consider yourself Latin American and vote for her , \u201d since she praised former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , \u201c the author of the most despicable Latin American genocide and the architect of Latin American dictatorship , responsible for all of those who disappeared in the '60s , '70s and '80s , \u201d he said .\nStill , a path to a Sanders victory seems remote , and the delegate math is more than daunting . Sanders must win about 57 percent of the remaining delegates \u2013 or win most of the remaining races by landslides \u2013 just to barely surpass Clinton with a majority of pledged delegates . Then , he must convince enough superdelegates , those unbound party leaders and elected officials who overwhelmingly support Clinton at the moment , to shift their allegiance to his campaign .\nBut most of the pledged delegates will be allocated in five big states \u2013 New York , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Maryland , and California \u2013 where Clinton currently leads Sanders in polls . In New York , the former senator here leads her former colleague from Vermont 54 percent to 42 percent , according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday .\nSanders supporters , however , remain undaunted .
