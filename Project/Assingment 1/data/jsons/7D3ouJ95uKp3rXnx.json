Which is exactly why Donald Trump can claim that he is backing out of the Thursday 's debate due to the fact that Fox News does n't treat him well , despite the fact that Trump has appeared on Fox News at least two and a half times more than any of his GOP primary opponents .

Trump has openly attacked Kelly since the first Fox News debate in August . But make no mistake , Donald Trump does not have a problem with Megyn Kelly because she 's a serious journalist who asks really tough questions ( she is n't ) .
