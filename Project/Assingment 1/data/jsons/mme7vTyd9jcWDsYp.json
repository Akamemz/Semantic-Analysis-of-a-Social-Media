But he added , `` What we 're not going to do is extend those tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans . ''\n`` Those cost $ 1 trillion over 10 years , '' Geithner told CNN . `` And there 's no possibility that we 're going to find a way to get our fiscal house in order without those tax rates going back up . ''\nRepublican congressional leaders have flatly rejected the proposal Geithner offered last week , with House Speaker John Boehner saying Sunday he was `` flabbergasted '' by the plan . Geither said Sunday that the administration `` would be happy to look at an alternative plan , but they have to lay that out for us .

In addition , spending cuts Congress approved during the Republican-led standoff over raising the federal debt ceiling in 2011 will start kicking in at the same time , cutting $ 1 trillion over 10 years .

The the top 1 % of taxpayers would see their tax bills go up around 7 % , or about $ 120,000 . Those increases , along with spending cuts , would cut the projected federal budget deficit nearly in half -- but it would also threaten millions of jobs , especially those dependent on government contracting , and risk a return to recession , the CBO found .\nThe plan administration officials presented to Republicans on Thursday called for $ 1.6 trillion in new taxes , including letting income tax rates go back up for families making more than $ 250,000 -- a big element of President Barack Obama 's successful re-election campaign . Obama also wants to close loopholes , limit deductions , raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increase taxes on capital gains and dividend taxes .\nThe proposal also calls for additional spending , including a new $ 50 billion stimulus package , a home mortgage refinancing plan , and an extension of unemployment insurance benefits . It would also extend the payroll tax cut , passed early in Obama 's administration . In return , multiple sources told CNN that Obama is offering $ 400 billion in new cuts to Medicare and other entitlement programs -- with specifics decided next year .\nSpeaking on `` Fox News Sunday , '' Boehner said the talks are `` going nowhere , '' and blamed the administration for not taking the Republicans seriously .\n`` They won the election , ( but ) they must have forgotten that Republicans continue to hold the majority in the House .

''\n`` We 've put a serious offer on the table by putting revenues up there to try to get this question resolved , but the White House has responded with virtually nothing , '' Boehner told Fox .\nRepublicans have said they are willing to raise revenue by closing tax loopholes and ending deductions , but have resisted raising rates . More than 230 GOP representatives and 40 senators have pledged to oppose tax increases , and the man behind that pledge -- conservative activist Grover Norquist -- told reporters he hoped Congress and the administration would extend the Bush tax cuts a second time .\nNorquist said the expiration of those tax cuts would be bad , but the automatic spending cuts would be `` a good thing . '' And the anti-tax pledge , which several leading Republicans have edged away from in recent weeks , `` has helped the debate , '' he said .\n`` Obviously people who want bigger government are very unhappy with the popularity and the strength and the credibility of the pledge , so they attack it because they want to raise taxes so they can spend more money , '' he said .\nGeithner said Republicans `` are in a hard place , and they 're having a tough time trying to figure out what they can do , what they can get support from their members for . ''\n`` That 's understandable , '' Geithner said . `` This is very difficult for them , and we might need to give them a little more time to figure out where they go next . ''\nBut Sen.
