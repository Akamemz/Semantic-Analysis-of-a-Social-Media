Within weeks , Democrats were panicking that their support of Obamacare could cost them their Senate majority and risk losing more House seats .\nHouse Democratic campaign chief Rep. Steve Israel of New York shrugged off GOP declarations that the new health care law 's failures spelled doom for Democrats in the midterms , telling CNN in an interview , `` if Republicans are going to run on rooting for failure , then so be it .
