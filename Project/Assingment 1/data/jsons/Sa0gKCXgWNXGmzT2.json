    "content": "Gallup 's daily presidential tracker has settled back into a dead heat -- with a single , statistically insignificant point separating Barack Obama and Mitt Romney . Rasmussen 's tracker wiped the post-DNC bounce away late last week . ( Rasmussen tracks likely voters and refreshes its numbers on a three-day cycle ; Gallup measures registered voters across seven-day cycles ) . So where do things stand today ? Almost precisely where they did before the conventions shook things up . Obama led by as many as five points in Rasmussen and seven points in Gallup in the wake of his convention , thanks largely to an effective speech from former President Clinton . Today , Romney leads Obama by two points in the former poll , while Obama holds a single-point edge in the latter . For what it 's worth , this is the exact dynamic predicted by the Weekly Standard 's Jay Cost more than a week ago . I 'll leave you with a few pieces of new battleground state data :\n( 1 ) Romney pulls into a virtual tie among registered New Hampshire voters . The good news for Republicans is that a likely voter screen would probably boost Mitt a little bit . The bad news is that the sample looks slightly too favorable to the GOP , although undeclared voters dominate the pool of respondents .\n( 2 ) Romney edges into the lead in Colorado . Other recent polls have shown Obama up by one , two and five points there . The last survey on that list was conducted by a Democrat firm . As I reported earlier , the Romney campaign believes this state is a pure toss-up right now .\n( 3 ) A Washington Post poll says Obama is leading Romney by eight points in Virginia . The survey relies on a D+9 sample , three points higher than than 2008 's partisan split . Politico 's Jonathan Martin is rather skeptical . Rasmussen recently pegged the Virginia race at 49-48 in Obama 's favor . Other polls have it somewhere in between .",
