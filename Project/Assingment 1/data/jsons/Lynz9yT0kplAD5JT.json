    "content": "It \u2019 s striking to read objectivity defined that way \u2014 not because it \u2019 s objectionable , but rather because it barely resembles the way the concept is commonly discussed in newsrooms today . Conversations about objectivity , rather than happening in a virtuous vacuum , habitually focus on predicting whether a given sentence , opening paragraph or entire article will appear objective to a theoretical reader , who is invariably assumed to be white . This creates the very illusion of fairness that Mr. Jones , and others , specifically warn against .\nInstead of telling hard truths in this polarized environment , America \u2019 s newsrooms too often deprive their readers of plainly stated facts that could expose reporters to accusations of partiality or imbalance .\nFor years , I \u2019 ve been among a chorus of mainstream journalists who have called for our industry to abandon the appearance of objectivity as the aspirational journalistic standard , and for reporters instead to focus on being fair and telling the truth , as best as one can , based on the given context and available facts .\nIt \u2019 s not a novel argument . Scores of journalists across generations , from gonzo reporters like Hunter S. Thompson to more traditional voices like Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel , have advocated this very approach . Mr. Kovach and Mr. Rosenstiel lay it out in detail in their classic text \u201c The Elements of Journalism . \u201d\nThose of us advancing this argument know that a fairness-and-truth focus will have different , healthy interpretations . We also know that neutral \u201c objective journalism \u201d is constructed atop a pyramid of subjective decision-making : which stories to cover , how intensely to cover those stories , which sources to seek out and include , which pieces of information are highlighted and which are downplayed . No journalistic process is objective . And no individual journalist is objective , because no human being is .\nAnd so , instead of promising our readers that we will never , on any platform , betray a single personal bias \u2014 submitting ourselves to a life sentence of public thoughtlessness \u2014 a better pledge would be an assurance that we will devote ourselves to accuracy , that we will diligently seek out the perspectives of those with whom we personally may be inclined to disagree and that we will be just as sure to ask hard questions of those with whom we \u2019 re inclined to agree .\nThe best of our profession already does this .
