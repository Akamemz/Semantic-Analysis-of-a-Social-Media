    "content": "In my review of the \u201c Republican \u201d ( Trump ) convention I wrote that I was surprised that most of the news media had been more respectful to Donald Trump than I had expected . I had anticipated the convention being the moment when they finally gave Trump the \u201c Full Palin \u201d treatment and demolished his chances of winning by disqualifying him from the office in the minds of a strong majority of voters . I even thought that , while Hillary would still win , the media allowing Trump to be perceived as a plausible president might allow him to keep the race close to the very end .\nWhile the coverage of Trump \u2019 s convention may have been deferential ( \u201c his kids are so great ! \u201d ) , the news media , at least once prime-time began , was over-the-top reverential in their treatment of the Democratic gathering in Philadelphia . This phenomenon then got turbo-charged when Trump was baited into responding disrespectfully to the Khans , the Muslim \u201c Gold Star \u201d family who have dominated the news cycle ever since .\nThere have been few conservatives who have been more critical of Trump since the start of this insane campaign than me , and he deserves every bit of condemnation he has gotten for needlessly mishandling the Khan situation . However , there is also no doubt that the media became obsessed with the story because they want Trump to lose , got a bit freaked out about his very temporary convention bounce , and smelled blood .\nHillary , while she is less likely to be stupid enough to so publicly take on the parents of a fallen war hero , would also never have been lured by the media into the conflict to the extent Trump was . If she had somehow stepped in it , the news media would have let it go far sooner than they did for Trump ( for instance , how many voters are even aware of the controversy over her basically calling some family members of Benghazi victims liars ? ) .\nThis story has seemed to open the floodgates now on Trump in much the same way that the infamous Katie Couric interview did with regards to Sarah Palin in 2008 . Now , everything Trump says seems to be instant fodder for the media \u2019 s intensified \u201c gaffe watch . \u201d\nThis has even led to some clear overreaching by the media . For instance , Trump got grilled yesterday ( this story was the lede at Yahoo for a while ) for supposedly kicking a crying baby out of a speech . This was absurd . Any reasonable person who actually saw the tape of the episode could plainly see that he was obviously joking and that the whole thing was actually rather endearing .\nHowever , when the Khan story has created the narrative that you are a royal jackass , then the media will see every other story about you through the prism of you being a royal jackass . Similarly , once Couric supposedly \u201c proved \u201d Palin was stupid , then everything that Palin said was automatically presumed to be dumb , even when it wasn \u2019 t ( for instance the media later universally ripped Palin for tactfully telling a school kid that the vice president was \u201c in charge \u201d of the Senate , when , in fact , they are indeed the \u201c president \u201d of that body ) .\nThis is the kind of news media treatment I always expected/feared that Trump would get once the general election came around and why I have always been so sure that he would lose , even to an awful candidate like Hillary . The storm just came about a week later than I had guessed it would have .\nThis whole situation , while highly predictable given the media \u2019 s role in the last several presidential elections , is likely quite shocking to Trump himself . I have written extensively here about how the news media , especially the conservative variety , was largely in the tank for him during the primary season . This allowed him to control his own narrative and put out fires whenever needed , usually by simply making some sort of a scene in order to change the subject .\nIt is now very clear that the same media weapons which made him a wrecking machine in the primaries are either no longer available to him or are completely outgunned by much heavier artillery .\nDuring the primaries Trump had his YUGE twitter account , the Drudge Report , Breitbart.com , The New York Post , most of Fox News Channel , and almost all of talk radio as effectively the mouthpiece of his campaign . In a race fought among a relatively small percentage of the population , this gave Trump the ability to effectively communicate , largely unfiltered , to a huge percentage of GOP primary voters who consume \u201c conservative \u201d media almost exclusively ( all while his bloated field of opponents had almost no such access ) .\nIn the general election , now that he is fighting a Democrat rather beating up on Republican primary foes , Trump has totally lost CNN and MSNBC ( as if even Stevie Wonder couldn \u2019 t see that happening ! ) .
