Turns out a whole lot has happened since St. Louis .\nThe final encounter comes as Trump is denying allegations of sexual misconduct by nine women , and whether they are telling the truth or not , this changes the environment more drastically than Trump merely boasting about groping women on a tape he has dismissed as locker-room talk . And Trump has been increasingly at war with Paul Ryan , talking and tweeting about voter fraud , and accusing the media of rigging the election .\nThe debate also comes as a near-daily drip of disclosures from Wikileaks \u2013 and newly released FBI files from her email investigation -- causes more damage to the Clinton campaign .
