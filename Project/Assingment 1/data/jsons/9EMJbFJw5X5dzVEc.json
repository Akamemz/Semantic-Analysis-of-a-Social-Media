    "content": "Presidents typically avoid facts and figures when delivering inaugural addresses , serving up a blend of broad platitudes and generalities to lay out a vision . President Donald Trump was no different in that regard .\nBut in his inaugural address , Trump portrayed the United States as a nation in decline , using rhetoric that did not always match reality :\n\u2022 Trump portrayed the U.S. as crime-ridden and promised to stop the \u201c American carnage. \u201d But the U.S. violent crime rate in 2015 was less than half what it was at its peak in 1991 .\n\u2022 Trump promised to \u201c bring back our jobs. \u201d Manufacturing jobs have been on the decline for decades , but Trump inherits an overall economy that has gained jobs for a record 75 straight months and has an unemployment rate well below the historical norm .\n\u2022 He said he would \u201c get our people off of welfare and back to work. \u201d But the welfare rolls have declined under President Obama , and they have dropped precipitously since President Clinton signed legislation in 1996 instituting work requirements and time limits .\n\u2022 Trump promised to \u201c bring back our borders , \u201d blaming past politicians for \u201c refusing to defend our \u201d border . But the U.S. Border Patrol budget has tripled since 2001 , and the number of border patrol agents has doubled . Southwest border apprehensions have dropped 75 % from the peak in fiscal 2000 .\nAs he did so often on the campaign trail , Trump again painted a picture of a crime-ridden nation .\nWhile Americans want \u201c safe neighborhoods for their families , \u201d Trump said , \u201c for too many of our citizens , a different reality exists , \u201d one in which \u201c the crime and the gangs and the drugs \u2026 have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential . \u201d\n\u201c This American carnage stops right here and stops right now , \u201d Trump said .\nAlthough he spoke in general terms this time , Trump has often framed the issue by citing rising violent crime and murder rates \u2014 which focuses on a one-year uptick but ignores the long-term trend .\nFBI data show the number of overall violent crimes in the U.S. increased by 3.9 % from 2014 to 2015 , and murder and nonnegligent manslaughter went up by 10.8 % . While authorities are concerned about the one-year violent crime increase , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported , the 2015 figure is still lower than in 2011 , and 16.5 % below the level nine years earlier .\nAs we have noted , the long-term trend nationwide is a decline , not only in murder rates , but for violent crime in general .\nThe violent crime rate has been on a decline since it peaked at 758.2 in 1991 . It was less than half that , 372.6 in 2015 . ( The FBI describes its data as \u201c estimated , \u201d and it comes from the voluntary reports of local law enforcement agencies . )\nThe murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate nationwide , at 4.9 in 2015 , is less than half the peak of 10.2 in 1980 .\nOn the campaign trail , Trump repeatedly referenced a spike in murders in cities like Chicago . And indeed , several U.S. cities have seen an alarming spike . A New York Timesstory in May 2016 cited \u201c notable increases in murders in about two dozen cities in the first three months of the year compared to last year and a 9 percent increase nationwide. \u201d Criminology and statistics experts told us they can \u2019 t discern a trend from such a small snapshot in time .\nAn analysis from the Brennan Center for Justice released on Sept. 19 , concluded : \u201c Overall crime rates in 2016 are projected to be nearly the same as last year , with crime remaining at an all-time low. \u201d The analysis found that murder increased by 14 % \u201c with just three cities \u2014 Baltimore , Chicago , and Washington , D.C. \u2014 responsible for half that increase . All told , 2015 \u2019 s murder rate was still near historic lows. \u201d The analysis said that \u201c the average person in a large urban area is safer walking on the street today than he or she would have been at almost any time in the past 30 years . \u201d\nTrump blamed \u201c other countries \u201d for \u201c destroying our jobs , \u201d and he promised that he would \u201c bring back our jobs. \u201d He did not name the countries or how the jobs were destroyed . But Trump regularly blamed Mexico and China during the campaign , citing the North American Free Trade Agreement and China \u2019 s entry into the World Trade Organization . NAFTA took effect Jan. 1 , 1994 , and China entered the WTO Dec. 11 , 2001 .\nIt is true that U.S. manufacturing jobs have declined . The Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2019 website provides data on manufacturing jobs dating to 1939 . As of December , there were not quite 12.3 million manufacturing jobs \u2014 which is nearly 7.3 million jobs , or about 37 % , fewer than the peak of more than 19.5 million jobs in June 1979 .\nHowever , not all the job losses can be attributed to trade deals , and some of those job losses were offset by job gains elsewhere in the U.S. economy .\nFor example , a 2015 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service called NAFTA \u2019 s impact \u201c relatively modest. \u201d CRS said , \u201c In reality , NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters . \u201d\nOne factor in the job losses is automation , which improved U.S. productivity but reduced jobs . A Jan. 18 CRS report , \u201c U.S . Manufacturing in International Perspective , \u201d noted that \u201c U.S . manufacturers \u2019 large investments in automation \u2026 have eliminated many routine assembly jobs ; only two in five workers in U.S. manufacturing establishments are now directly engaged in production . \u201d\nOverall , Trump inherits a job market that has steadily improved since hitting a post-recession low in 2010 . As we wrote in \u201c What President Trump Inherits , \u201d the U.S. economy has gained jobs for 75 straight months ( the longest streak on record ) , and the unemployment rate is 4.7 % ( far below the historical norm since 1948 ) .\nThere were also more than 5.5 million job openings as of the last business day in November \u2014 double the number when Barack Obama took over as president in January 2009 . BLS has been keeping track of job openings only since December 2000 , but since that time the record high was in April 2016 , when job openings topped 5.8 million .\nTrump spoke of \u201c mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities , \u201d and he promised , \u201c We will get our people off of welfare and back to work , rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor . \u201d\nOn poverty , as we pointed out in \u201c What President Trump Inherits , \u201d there were 43.1 million Americans with incomes below the poverty line in 2015 . That \u2019 s 3.1 million more living in poverty than in 2008 , the year before Obama took office . The 13.5 % poverty rate , which experienced its biggest one-year drop since 1968 last year , was still three-tenths of a percentage point above where it was in 2008 . Poverty figures for 2016 won \u2019 t be available until September .\nDespite a rise in the number and rate of those living in poverty under Obama , the number on welfare declined , reflecting a long-term trend since then-President Bill Clinton signed welfare overhaul legislation in 1996 . That legislation , which created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program , or TANF , to replace the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program , imposed time limits for cash assistance and work or work-related requirements for recipients to continue to receive welfare .\nThe average monthly number of individuals and families on TANF since fiscal year 1997 has declined by 75 % and 69 % , respectively . And the AFDC program provided cash assistance to even greater numbers in the years prior . The average monthly number of individuals receiving assistance in fiscal 1970 was 7.9 million . The figure for 2016 was 2.8 million .\nUnder Obama , the welfare rolls have declined as well . The average monthly number of individuals and families on TANF declined 27 % and 26 % , respectively , from fiscal year 2008 to 2016 .\nThe number of people receiving food stamps , the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , has been declining in recent years but is still up overall under Obama \u2019 s tenure . As of October 2016 , the most recent month on record , 43.2 million people were receiving SNAP benefits .\nThat \u2019 s up 35 % from January 2009 , when Obama was inaugurated , but down 9.6 % from the record level in December 2012 .\nDuring the campaign , Trump made immigration a central issue , and it was a topic he returned to in his inaugural address . The newly installed president blamed past politicians for \u201c refusing to defend our \u201d borders , promising to \u201c bring back our borders . \u201d\nBeginning with President George W. Bush and continuing under President Barack Obama , the U.S. Border Patrol budget went up 218 % , from nearly $ 1.2 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $ 3.6 billion in FY2016 .\nUnder Bush , the total number of Border Patrol agents more than doubled \u2014 increasing from 9,821 in fiscal year 2001 ( which was the last budget signed by President Clinton ) to 20,119 in fiscal year 2009 , under funding levels signed by Bush . Under Obama , the number of agents peaked at 21,444 , but declined to 19,828 by fiscal 2016 . Even so , the number of border patrol agents have doubled since 2001 .\nWhile spending has gone up , apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border have gone down . In fact , the number of people apprehended while trying to enter the U.S. illegally from Mexico is one-quarter of what it was at its peak over a decade ago .\nThere were 408,870 apprehensions at the southwest border in fiscal year 2016 , which was 75 % below the peak number of 1,643,679 apprehended in FY2000 .\nTrump is now president : 'The forgotten ... will be forgotten no longer '",
