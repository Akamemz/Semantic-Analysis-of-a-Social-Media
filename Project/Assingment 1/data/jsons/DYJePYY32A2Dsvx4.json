And we \u2019 re moving up . \u201d\nI have a few problems with this line of argument , which seems to imply that Democratic voters in the Deep South don \u2019 t reflect the larger Democratic electorate . ( The remarks Thursday night echo previous comments made by Sanders and his campaign . ) Consider Sanders \u2019 s reference to the term \u201c Deep South , \u201d which traditionally describes Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi and South Carolina : These are five of the only six states , along with Maryland , where at least a quarter of the population is black . Given the United States \u2019 history of disenfranchising black voters \u2014 not to mention the importance of black voters to Democrats in November \u2014 it \u2019 s dicey for Sanders to diminish Clinton \u2019 s wins there .\nBut the Deep South isn \u2019 t Sanders \u2019 s only issue . His problems in the rest of the South are what really dooms him . Clinton \u2019 s largest net delegate gains over Sanders came from Texas ( +72 ) and Florida ( +68 ) , two states that are within the South as the Census Bureau ( and most other people ) define it . Clinton also cleaned Sanders \u2019 s clock in Virginia and North Carolina . Overall , Clinton gained a net of 155 delegates on Sanders in the five Deep South states , but she also added 211 delegates to her margin in the rest of the region .\nDELEGATE COUNT REGION CLINTON SANDERS NET Deep South * 225 70 Clinton +155 Other Southern states 493 282 Clinton +211 Rest of country 589 745 Sanders +156 Overall 1,307 1,097 Clinton +210 Clinton has dominated Sanders in the South * Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi and South Carolina Source : \u2588\u2588\u2588 Delegate Tracker , The Green Papers\nIn addition to being important to the Democratic Party \u2019 s electoral present and future , Florida , Virginia , North Carolina and Texas are quite diverse . They \u2019 re diverse ideologically \u2014 Miami and Austin aren \u2019 t exactly \u201c the most conservative part \u201d of the country \u2014 and they \u2019 re diverse racially . They contain not only a substantial number of African-Americans but also Hispanics and , increasingly , Asian-American voters .\nIn fact , these states are among the most demographically representative of the diverse Obama coalition that Clinton or Sanders will have to rely on in November .\nAlthough it will be a couple of decades before the electorate as a whole is majority-minority , the Democratic vote is already getting there . In 2012 , only 55 percent of President Obama \u2019 s voters were white , according to the national exit poll . Our demographic projections of this November \u2019 s electorate , which account for population growth since 2012 , calculate that the white share of the Democratic vote will tick down another percentage point , to 54 percent . The rest of the Democratic vote will be black ( 24 percent ) , Hispanic ( 15 percent ) , or belong to Asian or other races ( 7 percent ) , according to our projections .\nSo let \u2019 s take those projections as being maximally representative of the broader Democratic electorate as it stands today . In which primary or caucus states has turnout come closest to those ratios ?\nIn 21 states to have voted so far , we have data on this from exit polls . See here for Virginia , for example , where Democratic turnout was 63 percent white , 26 percent black , 7 percent Hispanic and 5 percent Asian or other when it voted on Super Tuesday . That \u2019 s pretty close to the Democratic electorate overall , although with too few Hispanic voters . In the other 29 states \u2014 those that haven \u2019 t voted yet or where no exit poll was conducted \u2014 I \u2019 ll estimate the Democratic electorate based on our demographic projections , with an adjustment for the fact that the Democrats who vote in primaries are somewhat whiter than those who vote in November .\nThen I \u2019 ll calculate the root-mean-square error ( RMSE ) for each state \u2014 a measure of the difference between the demographics of its primary or caucus turnout and the projected Democratic electorate in November . A lower RMSE is better for our purposes , because it means the state \u2019 s demographics are more representative of the national Democratic coalition .\nDEMOCRATIC PRIMARY/CAUCUS ELECTORATE STATE WHITE BLACK HISP./ LATINO ASIAN/ OTHER RMSE * OUTCOME New Jersey 57 % 26 % 11 % 6 % 5 % Illinois 58 28 9 5 8 Clinton +2 Florida 48 28 20 5 9 Clinton +31 New York 61 20 16 3 9 Virginia 63 26 7 5 12 Clinton +29 Nevada 59 13 19 8 13 Clinton +5 North Carolina 62 31 3 4 16 Clinton +14 Maryland 47 39 8 6 18 Tennessee 63 32 2 3 18 Clinton +34 Arkansas 67 27 3 3 18 Clinton +37 Michigan 68 23 3 6 18 Sanders +2 Pennsylvania 70 19 8 3 19 California 49 11 23 17 19 Delaware 69 24 3 3 20 Texas 43 19 32 7 21 Clinton +32 Arizona 62 7 25 6 21 Clinton +15 Kentucky 72 21 4 4 22 Missouri 72 21 3 4 22 Clinton +0 Connecticut 74 15 7 3 24 Ohio 74 21 2 3 24 Clinton +14 Alaska 66 5 11 17 25 Sanders +59 Oklahoma 74 14 4 9 25 Sanders +10 Indiana 76 13 8 3 26 Colorado 72 4 16 8 27 Sanders +17 Kansas 78 10 7 5 29 Sanders +36 Washington 74 4 10 12 29 Sanders +46 District of Columbia 45 49 4 2 29 Utah 76 4 11 9 30 Sanders +57 Rhode Island 79 9 8 4 30 Georgia 38 51 7 3 33 Clinton +43 Wyoming 80 4 10 6 33 Sanders +11 New Mexico 45 3 39 13 34 Idaho 80 3 11 5 34 Sanders +57 Minnesota 82 9 3 6 34 Sanders +23 Wisconsin 83 10 3 4 34 Sanders +14 Montana 82 4 6 9 36 Alabama 40 54 1 5 36 Clinton +59 South Dakota 82 3 6 10 36 Nebraska 85 8 3 3 37 Sanders +14 Massachusetts 85 4 6 5 38 Clinton +1 North Dakota 86 4 4 6 39 West Virginia 88 5 5 3 40 Oregon 87 1 4 7 42 South Carolina 35 61 2 2 44 Clinton +47 Iowa 91 3 4 2 44 Clinton +0 Hawaii 45 2 8 46 46 Sanders +43 New Hampshire 93 2 1 4 47 Sanders +22 Louisiana 26 63 8 2 49 Clinton +48 Maine 95 2 1 2 49 Sanders +29 Vermont 95 1 0 3 50 Sanders +72 Mississippi 24 71 1 4 58 Clinton +66 Projected Democratic electorate in November 54 24 15 7 \u2014 * Root-mean-square error of turnout as compared with projected Democratic electorate in November Source : Exit polls , \u2588\u2588\u2588 demographic projections\nThe most representative state by this measure is New Jersey . We expect its primary electorate to be about 57 percent white , 26 percent black , 11 percent Hispanic and 6 percent Asian or other , quite close to the national Democratic electorate . New Jersey won \u2019 t vote until June 7 , although Clinton was well ahead when the last poll was released there in February .\nAfter New Jersey comes Illinois , which Clinton won narrowly \u2014 and then Florida , where Clinton won going away . Then there \u2019 s New York , which votes Tuesday , and where Clinton is 15 percentage points ahead in our polling average . Virginia , another Southern state , ranks as the next most representative ; Clinton won it easily . Then there \u2019 s Nevada , another Clinton state , before we go back to the South to North Carolina , also won by Clinton . The next group of four states ( Maryland , Tennessee , Arkansas and Michigan ) are roughly tied and include some further representation for the South , along with , finally , one state ( Michigan ) that Sanders won .\nIn other words , Clinton has won or is favored to win almost every state where the turnout demographics strongly resemble those of Democrats as a whole . This shouldn \u2019 t be surprising \u2014 Clinton is winning nationally by about 14 percentage points in the popular vote . So if you \u2019 re in a state that \u2019 s well-representative of Democrats \u2019 national demographics , you might expect her to win it by a solid margin too .\nListen to the latest episode of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 politics podcast .\nIt \u2019 s true that a couple of states in the Deep South , such as Mississippi and Louisiana , rate as being not well-representative by our definition . But overall , that \u2019 s more likely to be true of places where Sanders has won . New Hampshire ranks as the 46th most representative out of 50 states ( and Iowa ranks 44th \u2014 maybe those states shouldn \u2019 t hold the first two contests ? ) . Wisconsin , which Sanders won last week , is below average .\nAnd the sort of wishful thinking Sanders is engaged in can cut both ways . Yes , Clinton \u2019 s lead would be considerably narrower ( although she \u2019 d still be winning ) without delegates from the Deep South . But what if you excluded delegates from caucuses , where Sanders has gained a net of 150 delegates on Clinton ? Without those delegates , Sanders couldn \u2019 t even maintain the pretense of a competitive race . Not only are most of those caucus states extremely white and therefore poorly representative of Democrats \u2019 national demographics \u2014 many of them ( such as Idaho and Nebraska ) are also quite red . Furthermore , caucuses tend to disenfranchise voters by making it harder to vote . Our demographic modeling suggests that this has hurt Clinton and that Sanders wouldn \u2019 t have won by the same enormous margins if those caucus states had held primaries instead .\nBut overall , the math is pretty simple . Sanders is winning states that are much whiter than the Democratic electorate as a whole , Clinton is winning states that are much blacker than the Democratic electorate as a whole , and Clinton is winning most of those states that are somewhere in the middle , whether they \u2019 re in the South ( like Virginia ) or elsewhere ( like Ohio or Nevada ) . That \u2019 s why she \u2019 ll probably be the Democratic nominee .",
