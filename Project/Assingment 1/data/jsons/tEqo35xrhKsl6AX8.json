    "content": "Why Americans Don \u2019 t Fully Trust Many Who Hold Positions of Power and Responsibility\nMembers of Congress and technology leaders are rated lower in empathy , transparency and ethics ; public gives higher scores to military leaders , public school principals and police officers\nPeople invest their trust in institutions and those who have power for a variety of reasons . Researchers have found that people \u2019 s confidence in others and organizations can include their judgments about the competence , honesty and benevolence of the organizations or individuals they are assessing , as well as factors such as empathy , openness , integrity and accountability . These perceptions can be seen as building blocks of trust .\nTaking account of those insights , a new \u2588\u2588\u2588 survey finds that people offer different judgments about these building blocks of trust when it comes to eight groups of people who hold positions of power and responsibility in America : members of Congress , local elected officials , K-12 public school principals , journalists , military leaders , police officers , leaders of technology companies and religious leaders .\nNotable shares of the public give people in these powerful jobs low ratings when it comes to behaving ethically , dealing with ethical problems in their ranks and admitting mistakes . Half or more of Americans think these influential people act unethically at least some of the time , ranging from 50 % who believe this about military leaders to 81 % who feel members of Congress act unethically \u201c some , \u201d or \u201c all or most of the time. \u201d Additionally , 77 % believe this about the leaders of technology companies and 69 % think this about religious leaders .\nAt the same time , a third or more of Americans think that unethical behavior is treated relatively lightly \u2013 that is to say , wrongdoers face serious consequences only a little of the time or less often . Indeed , majorities believe that members of Congress ( 79 % ) , local elected officials ( 57 % ) , leaders of technology companies ( 55 % ) and journalists ( 54 % ) admit mistakes and take responsibility for them only a little of the time or none of the time . Some 49 % say the same of religious leaders .\nThese views emerge in a survey that covered several dimensions of public confidence in those who hold these positions of power and responsibility . The questions probed public views about several essential aspects of public confidence \u2013 such as whether these groups care about people , handle resources responsibly or provide accurate information to the public . Survey respondents were asked to choose whether the group members act in these ways \u201c all or most of the time , \u201d \u201c some of the time , \u201d \u201c only a little of the time \u201d or \u201c none of the time . \u201d\nThe survey shows that beyond the realms of ethics and transparency , Americans have varying levels of confidence in key aspects of job performance by those who hold important positions of power and responsibility . For instance , U.S. adults have relatively high levels of confidence that these people will perform key aspects of their duties ( for example , that leaders of technology companies build products and services that enhance people \u2019 s lives ) \u201c some of the time \u201d or more often , and that they will handle resources responsibly .\nGenerally , the public has the most confidence in the way K-12 public school principals , military leaders and police officers operate when it comes to caring about people , providing fair and accurate information to the public and handling resources responsibly . Some 84 % think principals care about the students they serve \u201c some of the time \u201d or \u201c all or most of the time , \u201d 79 % think police officers care about them at that level of frequency , and 73 % have the same level of confidence in military leaders . The public places somewhat lower \u2013 but still relatively high \u2013 levels of confidence in religious leaders , journalists and local elected officials .\nMembers of Congress and leaders of technology companies do not have the same level of public confidence when it comes to several performance attributes . For instance , 48 % of adults think tech firm bosses care about people \u201c all or most of the time \u201d or \u201c some of the time , \u201d and 50 % feel that way about members of Congress . Similarly , 46 % think members of Congress provide fair and accurate information that often , and 61 % think this about leaders of tech firms . Some 47 % think members of Congress handle resources responsibly at least some of the time .\nWhen queried about their views related to specific aspects of each group \u2019 s mission , the public gives relatively good marks to all of these actors , with military leaders ranking the highest and members of Congress the lowest . For instance , 90 % of adults believe military leaders do a good job preparing military personnel to protect the country \u201c all or most of the time \u201d or \u201c some of the time , \u201d 83 % think technology company leaders build products and services that enhance lives , and 63 % think local elected officials do a good job promoting laws that serve the public .\nThe survey posed two questions about the performance of police officers and people had somewhat varying views : 84 % say police do a good job protecting people from crime \u201c all or most of the time \u201d or \u201c some of the time. \u201d A smaller share ( 62 % ) say police officers do a good job treating racial and ethnic groups equally at least some of the time .\nThese readings about those who have power and responsibility were gathered in four different segments of a survey of 10,618 U.S. adults conducted Nov. 27 to Dec. 10 , 2018 , using the Center \u2019 s nationally representative American Trends Panel . Panelists were randomly assigned to one of the four segments , and each segment focused on questions about two of the eight categories of people in positions of power and responsibility covered in this report . The margin of sampling error for the smallest of the four samples is plus or minus 3.0 percentage points .\nThe groups of those who have power and responsibility were chosen because they play key roles in American society and have important effects on the day-to-day lives of Americans .
