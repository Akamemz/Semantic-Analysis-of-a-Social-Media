( Carlos Barria/Reuters )\nTo the Lawyer Left , elections represent a policy choice only when Democrats win .\nAs I write on Friday , the restraining order hasn \u2019 t come down yet . But it \u2019 s just a matter of time . Some federal district judge , somewhere in the United States , will soon issue an injunction blocking enforcement of the Trump administration \u2019 s restrictions on asylum applications .\nThe restrictions come in the form of a rule promulgated jointly by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security , and a proclamation issued by President Trump . In conjunction , they assert that an alien who wishes to apply for asylum in the United States must act lawfully : An alien who is physically present here and wishes to apply must be in the country legally ; an alien outside the country who wishes to apply must present himself at a lawful port of entry \u2014 not attempt to smuggle his way in or force his way in as part of a horde ( i.e. , no invasions by caravan ) .\nOf course , what used to be assumed is today deemed intolerable . It is no longer permitted to expect of non-Americans what is required of Americans \u2014 adherence to American law while on American soil .\nTherefore , the fact that the administration \u2019 s action is entirely reasonable will not matter . No more will it matter that , contrary to numbing media repetition , the rule and proclamation derive from federal statutory law . Nor will it make any difference that , in part , the president is relying on the same sweeping congressional authorization based on which , just four months ago , the Supreme Court affirmed his authority to control the ingress of aliens based on his assessment of national-security needs .\nJust two things will matter . The first is that the asylum restrictions represent a Trump policy that reverses Obama policies \u2014 specifically , policies of more lax border enforcement , and of ignoring congressionally authorized means of preventing illegal aliens from filing frivolous asylum petitions ( with the result that many of them are released , evading further proceedings and deportation ) . The second is that , precisely to thwart the reversal of Obama policies , President Obama made certain that the vast majority of the 329 federal judges he appointed were progressive activists in the Obama mold .\nThe media-Democrat complex will tell you this is \u201c the rule of law. \u201d In reality , it is the rule of lawyers : the Lawyer Left on the front line of American decision-making , a line that runs through courtrooms , not Capitol Hill .\nYou can already hear the retort : Conservatives do the same thing \u2014 put conservative judges on the bench to dictate conservative results . Au contraire . Conservatives really do want the rule of law , as in the laws that Congress passes and the president signs .
