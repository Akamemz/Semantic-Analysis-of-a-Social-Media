That legislation, passed in recent days, has removed the specter of a closed government, at least for a while.\n\nCongress had another non-accomplishment of note: It did not get in the way of the federal budget deficit's shrinkage.\n\nDuring the worst of the Great Recession in 2009, the annual budget shortfall ballooned to nearly 10 percent of the size of the entire economy, as measured by GDP. Since then, the deficit has been melting away, and it is on track to drop to just 2.6 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015.\n\nAt that level, \"the deficit can easily be financed,\" Silvia said.\n\nCongress might have derailed such fiscal progress by significantly increasing spending or cutting tax revenues.
