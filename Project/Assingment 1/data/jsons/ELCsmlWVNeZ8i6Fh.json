Angry young men brought down the U.S. flag in the courtyard , burned it and replaced it with a black banner bearing Islam 's declaration of faith \u2014 `` There is no God but Allah . ''\nYemeni security forces who rushed to the scene fired in the air and used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators , driving them out of the compound after about 45 minutes and sealing off the surrounding streets . It was not immediately clear whether anyone was inside the embassy at the time of the attack .\nDemonstrators removed the embassy 's sign on the outer wall , set tires ablaze and pelted the compound with rocks .\nYemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi ordered an investigation into the attack .\nHadi avowed to bring the culprits to justice , saying the attack by a `` rowdy crowd '' was part of a conspiracy to derail Yemen 's close relations with Washington .\nThe Embassy of the Republic of Yemen in Washington , D.C. said in a statement obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Yemen strongly condemned the attack on the U.S. compound , but says the situation is under control .\n`` Fortunately no casualties were reported from this chaotic incident . The government of Yemen will honor international obligations to ensure the safety of diplomats and will step up security presence around all foreign missions , '' the statement said . `` We strongly urge all those that would wish to incite others to violence to cease immediately .\nPentagon officials tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Pentagon and U.S. Navy officials are monitoring the situation in Yemen , but so far have received no request for military assistance there following the Embassy breach .\n`` We are doing everything we can to support our mission in Yemen , '' a senior administration official told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` We 've had good cooperation from the Yemeni government which is working with us to maintain order and protect our facilities and people .
