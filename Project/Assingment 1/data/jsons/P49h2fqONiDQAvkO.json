Fool me twice, shame on me.\u201d That\u2019s precisely the predicament that Congress is in today with the Senate\u2019s immigration proposal. Though perhaps well-intentioned, the Senate proposal repeats the mistakes of the past.\n\nThe Senate amnesty proposal is flawed for many reasons, but three in particular.\n\nFirst, the Senate bill legalizes almost everyone in the country illegally before the borders are secure. It provides legalization first and enforcement later, if ever.\n\nIn 1986, Congress gave amnesty to 3 million illegal immigrants. It was agreed to with the promise of increased immigration enforcement and enhanced border security. Though the amnesty was enacted, the enforcement never occurred.\n\nNow, more than 25 years later, there are 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Clearly, the 1986 amnesty didn\u2019t solve the problem of illegal immigration; it made the situation worse.\n\nNo matter how they try to spin it, the Senate bill is amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants. When you legalize someone who is in the country illegally, that is amnesty. The Senate bill gives legal status and, eventually, citizenship to millions of individuals who have disregarded our immigration laws.\n\nThe Senate plan makes promises of enforcement, but a closer look raises serious questions. For example, under the Senate bill, the Obama administration must come up with a way to achieve a 90 percent apprehension rate at \u201chigh-risk\u201d areas of the border.\n\nWhy not secure 100 percent of the entire border? Of course, by limiting the focus to only high-risk areas, the Senate proposal will just push illegal immigration to other parts of the border.\n\nIn 2010, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that only 6.5 percent of the southern border is under \u201cfull control\u201d of the Border Patrol.
