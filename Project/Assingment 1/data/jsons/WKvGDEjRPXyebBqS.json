    "content": "On the morning after the presidential election , David Goodfriend was crushed . Dumbfounded . He sat in his Toyota Corolla in a parking lot next to a hiking trail in Bethesda , listening to talk radio , alone and inert , wondering where it all went wrong .\n\u201c When George W. Bush was re-elected , I thought , \u2018 This is the end of the country as I know it , \u2019 \u201d said Mr. Goodfriend , a Washington lawyer and former Clinton White House staffer . \u201c Those of us who supported John Kerry just couldn \u2019 t believe that more people supported Bush . We had one view of the Iraq War and the American economy and were convinced we were right \u2013 but Kerry lost .\n\u201c This time around , you have people who can not believe that there are more people who support Barack Obama . They see the economy differently . They see social issues differently . There \u2019 s a very close analogy there . \u201d\nIndeed . As conservatives mourn \u2013 and by mourn , we mean full-on , biblical wailing and teeth-gnashing , and that \u2019 s just from Karl Rove \u2013 Republican nominee Mitt Romney \u2019 s defeat in a contest most on the political right were convinced he would win , they can find consolation in the fact that liberal America has been through the same dark night of the partisan soul : the doubt and disbelief , the anger and finger-pointing , the fuming promises to move to Canada .\nIn fact , conservatives should do more than take solace in past liberal anguish \u2013 they should take notes . Because while some on the left aren \u2019 t exactly sympathetic regarding the election \u2019 s outcome , they do have empathy . And plenty of practical , hard-earned coping advice .\nTo wit : Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala moved past Mr. Kerry \u2019 s defeat by refocusing on the 2006 midterm elections , writing a self-critical book with fellow strategist James Carville and spending time coaching his children \u2019 s Little League and basketball teams .\n\u201c And drinking , \u201d Mr. Begala said in an email interview . \u201c Especially Shiner Bock beer . \u201d\nLike Mr. Goodfriend , David Quigg spent the day after the 2004 election in a daze . A 40-year-old photographer and political writer from Seattle , he recalled looking at his two children \u2013 one an infant , the other a toddler \u2013 and breaking down in tears .\n\u201c That surprised me , \u201d Mr. Quigg said . \u201c I had this vision that the world was going to be this place where they were going to have to pretend to be Canadian to travel anywhere , because America \u2019 s reputation would be so bad . I wasn \u2019 t even angry , just superdepressed . I suspect that is probably similar to what conservatives are feeling now . \u201d\nPerhaps . Not to put too fine a point on it , but some on the right are , well , freaking out . Consider :\nOnline , the Cincinnati Tea Party posted a short obituary for the nation reading \u201c RIP America July 4 , 1776-November 6 , 2012 Death was ruled a suicide . \u201d\nIn Arizona , a 28-year-old woman reportedly ran over her husband with her car because she thought he had contributed to Mr. Obama \u2019 s re-election by not voting .\nOn Twitter , Donald Trump blasted the Electoral College , claimed \u201c the world is laughing at us , \u201d called American democracy \u201c a sham and a travesty , \u201d said the nation was in \u201c serious and unprecedented trouble \u201d and called for both a \u201c march on Washington \u201d and a \u201c revolution . \u201d\n\u201c The Republicans are convinced that the republic is dead , \u201d said Democratic strategist Jim Duffy . \u201c Liberty is dead . The state is going to run our lives . No more entrepreneurs . No more free thought .\n\u201c Well , the older I get , the more I \u2019 m amazed that the extremes on both sides are so much alike . In 2004 , a lot of Democrats felt that Bush was a cowboy fool from Texas who literally couldn \u2019 t walk and chew gum at the same time and was leading the country to ruin . As it turns out , we \u2019 re still here . \u201d\nAs Mr. Goodfriend points out , the United States has survived the Civil War , the Great Depression , Pearl Harbor and Watergate . Plus 10 seasons of \u201c Two and a Half Men. \u201d No matter how disappointed conservatives feel following Mr. Obama \u2019 s re-election , apocalyptic histrionics give the nation too little credit and Mr. Obama far too much \u2013 particularly when coming from otherwise vocal advocates of American exceptionalism .\n\u201c Many of us thought that Bush would be the end of America as we know it , \u201d said comedian and author Baratunde Thurston . \u201c And sure , there were a few policies and wars we strongly disagreed with . But when it comes to the important things , we still have our bacon and our \u2018 Real Housewives . \u2019 \u201d\nConservatives long have criticized liberals for being elitist , smug and out of touch , convinced that they are both smarter and morally superior to the very voters they \u2019 re attempting to persuade .\nIn the wake of Mr. Romney \u2019 s loss , the right would do well to avoid the same mistake .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no good lesson in getting your face bloodied in a political fight if you don \u2019 t realize how much you believed your own spin and PR and BS , \u201d said Nato Green , a left-leaning comic , activist and writer for the FX series \u201c Totally Biased With W. Kamu Bell. \u201d \u201c In 2004 , it was a hard lesson to realize that half of America just didn \u2019 t like us . But like in comedy , you can \u2019 t play nationally by hanging out in coffee shops in San Francisco and Portland . If Republicans want to win people over , they need to go spend some time hanging out with undocumented immigrants and people who actually have had abortions . \u201d\nFollowing a bitter electoral defeat , Mr. Goodfriend said , it \u2019 s easy and emotionally satisfying to write off the opposing slice of the electorate \u2013 as liberals did by dismissing red states as \u201c Jesusistan \u201d or as Fox television host Bill O \u2019 Reilly did when he concluded that Mr. Obama \u2019 s voters \u201c want stuff \u201d and \u201c feel entitled to things . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s tougher and more necessary to look in the mirror .\n\u201c After Bush won , the Democrats had to say that Kerry had some flaws as a candidate , the way Romney had some flaws , \u201d Mr. Goodfriend said . \u201c They had to do some soul-searching when it came to why voters didn \u2019 t trust them on some of the issues that carried the day , like national security .\n\u201c That \u2019 s actually a healthy process . The worst thing you can do is just say everybody else must be wrong because we are so right . That is a recipe for losing the next election . \u201d\nIn the annals of empty gestures , threatening to leave the country following a disliked political outcome ranks somewhere between President Nixon \u2019 s post-resignation \u201c V \u201d sign and basketball coach Phil Jackson \u2019 s book \u201c The Last Season . \u201d\nIn 2000 , Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder and the late director Robert Altman both promised to vacate America if Mr. Bush won the presidency ; eight years later , actor Stephen Baldwin promised to depart if Mr. Obama won the Democratic nomination ; two years after that , radio host Rush Limbaugh said he would move to Costa Rica if Congress passed the Affordable Care Act .\nPerhaps unsurprisingly , all of the above remained American citizens . Which is also why the 2007 film \u201c Blue State \u201d \u2013 a love story about a disaffected supporter of Mr. Kerry who disembarks to Canada following the 2004 election \u2013 is , in fact , fictional .\n\u201c I had a feeling of estrangement in 2004 , like , \u2018 I don \u2019 t understand where I live , \u2019 \u201d said \u201c Blue State \u201d director Marshall Lewy , who once volunteered for Mr. Kerry \u2019 s campaign in Ohio . \u201c I thought it would be a funny premise for a movie .
