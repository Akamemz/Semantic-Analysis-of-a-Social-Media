    "content": "When Henry Adams wrote in the early 20th century that `` politics , as a practice whatever its professions , had always been the systematic organization of hatreds , '' there was ample \u2588\u2588\u2588 to take him literally .\nThe world back then was on the verge of a cataclysmic war that would kill 17 million people and help incubate both communism and fascism . Adams had come of age in London as the son of the American ambassador under President Abraham Lincoln , a man who knew all too well how political disputes can turn bloody . And Adams ' great-grandfather , the second president of the United States , was accused by Thomas Jefferson 's supporters during the famously acrimonious 1800 election of having , among many other unpleasant things , a `` hideous hermaphroditical character . ''\nSo maybe the one positive of the 2016 version of American political hatred is that it probably wo n't make people work double shifts down at the morgue . But everything else about this repellant contest between the two most reviled major-party nominees in modern history points to an alarming resurgence of that foul and dangerous defect of judgment known as collectivism .\nWhen we hear the c word nowadays it 's usually in the context of Stalin 's agricultural five-year plans or the rah-rah slogans on 1930s posters . But there 's another , more personal meaning of the term that has dwindled in usage , even while its application to major-party politics seems to ratchet up each cycle . And that is : treating the disparate individuals within any given bloc as sharing a collective set of characteristics , intentions , and pathologies . It 's what Hillary Clinton meant with `` basket of deplorables , '' it 's what Donald Trump has done with `` Mexican heritage '' and its variants , and it 's all too often the nightstick that our friends and loved ones grab for when talking about politics in a presidential year .\nWhat makes the Democratic version of collective antipathy particularly noxious is the fact that it often comes disguised as a treacly appeal to unity . Trump `` wants to divide us , '' Clinton lamented at the Democratic National Convention . `` We have to heal the divides in our country.\u2026And that starts with listening , listening to each other . Trying , as best we can , to walk in each other 's shoes . ''\nUnless , of course , you have or work with large amounts of money . `` Wall Street , corporations , and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes , '' Clinton thundered later in the same speech . `` If companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas , we 'll make them pay us back . ''\nClinton 's vanquished Democratic opponent , the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders , is even more tin-eared about his own hypocrisy . `` This election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutions , '' Sanders said in his convention speech . `` Not just bombast , not just fearmongering , not just name calling and divisiveness . '' But a few minutes later , Sanders engaged in some bombastic fearmongering of his own , bemoaning that `` the wealthiest people in America , like the billionaire Koch brothers\u2026spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and in the process undermine American democracy . '' ( David Koch is a trustee of \u2588\u2588\u2588 Foundation , which publishes this magazine . )\nClinton 's most controversial instance of Othering during this season came at a September fundraiser in New York , where she said , `` to just be grossly generalistic , you could put half of Trump 's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables . Right ? The racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamophobic\u2014you name it.\u2026Now some of those folks , they are irredeemable , but thankfully they are not America . '' While the irredeemable and un-American twists were new ( as was the memorable metaphor ) , Clinton 's behind-closed-doors sentiment only mirrored what the Democratic nominee has said routinely throughout this dreary campaign .\nAt an October 2015 Democratic presidential primary debate , Clinton was asked by moderator Anderson Cooper , `` Which enemy are you most proud of ? '' Her reply , after some throat-clearing : `` Probably the Republicans . '' Some people laughed , but it was n't really a joke . When Vox Editor in Chief Ezra Klein asked Clinton nine months later whether she regretted the remark , she said , `` Not very much , '' adding : `` You know , they say terrible things about me , much worse than anything I 've ever said about them . That just seems to be part of the political back and forth now\u2014to appeal to your base , to appeal to the ideologues who support you . We have become so divided . '' Do tell .\nThe best that you can say about Hillary Clinton 's collectivism\u2014and the Democratic habit of mind that accepts and repeats such formulations unblinkingly\u2014is that at least the deplorables chose their own status , whether through true bigotry or mere party membership .
