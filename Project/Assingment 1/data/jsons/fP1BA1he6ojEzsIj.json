''\n`` First of all , I do n't think he 's a doctor ; secondly , he 's never laid eyes on me ; and thirdly , I 've been asymptomatic since I 've been here , '' Hickox told Crowley Sunday .\nIn a separate interview with CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen , Hickox elaborated on what she thought of Christie 's assessment of her medical condition .\n`` I 'm sorry , but that 's just a completely unacceptable statement in my opinion . For ( Christie ) -- a politician who 's trusted and respected -- to make a statement that 's categorically not true is just unacceptable and appalling . ''\nHickox told Crowley that mandatory quarantine is `` not a sound public health decision '' and that public health officials -- not politicians -- should be making the policies related to Ebola and public safety .\n`` For the first 12 hours , I was in shock . Now I 'm angry , '' she added .\nOn Sunday , Hickox 's lawyers met with Hickox at the hospital , saying they had a 75-minute conversation through a piece of clear plastic while she sat inside the tent .\n`` She 's fine . She 's not sick , '' lawyer Steven Hyman said in a sidewalk news conference aired on CNN affiliate WABC . `` She went and did a magnanimous thing and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity , not put in isolation because some political leaders decided it looks good to do that .

''\nOn Sunday night , New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo announced he was changing the state 's mandatory 21-day quarantine policy for health workers who return from the Ebola zone . People who worked with Ebola patients but do n't show symptoms of having the virus can serve their 21-day quarantine at home , the governor 's office said .\nChristie spokesman Kevin Roberts said late Sunday night : `` The protocol is clear that a New Jersey resident with no symptoms , but who has come into contact with someone with Ebola , such as a health care provider , would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home . Nonresidents would be transported to their homes if feasible and , if not , quarantined in New Jersey . ''\nOn Fox News Sunday morning , Christie said he had `` no second thoughts '' about New Jersey 's mandatory quarantine for health care workers .\n`` I believe that folks who want to take that step and are willing to volunteer also understand that it 's in their interest and the public health interest to have a 21-day period thereafter if they 've been directly exposed to people with the virus , '' he said .\nChristie also told `` Fox News Sunday '' that a voluntary system of quarantine is n't reliable .\n`` I do n't believe that when you 're dealing with a serious situation like this that we can count on a voluntary system ; this is the government 's job . ''\nAt a news conference Saturday , the governor said , `` I 'm sorry if in any way she was inconvenienced , but inconvenience that could occur from having folks that are symptomatic and ill out amongst the public is a much , much greater concern of mine .

The country launched a five-year study to unravel the mystery of the long-term health effects that plague survivors of the viral disease. Since the epidemic started more than a year ago in a remote village in Guinea, more than 11,000 people have died, the vast majority in three West African nations, according to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization . And that number is believed to be low, since there was widespread under-reporting of cases, according to WHO.
