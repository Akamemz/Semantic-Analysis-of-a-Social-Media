    "content": "From The New York Times , I \u2019 m Michael Barbaro . This is \u201c The Daily. \u201d Today : As the pandemic quickly spreads across the U.S. , hundreds of hospitals are now confronting their first serious cases of the coronavirus . Susan Dominus on the lessons from the first confirmed case in New Jersey . It \u2019 s Monday , March 30 . Sue , tell me how you first heard about James Cai .\nWell , a few weeks ago I heard about this young guy , a 32-year-old physician assistant , who was the very first patient in all of New Jersey to test positive for Covid-19 . And so I reached out to him while he was still at the hospital . And I was sort of wondering , would it possibly be OK , could you maybe find some time to talk ? And he said , sure , call me now . I \u2019 m in isolation , in other words , and I have time .\njames cai Hello ? [ COUGHING ] susan dominus Are you there ? james cai Yes . [ COUGHING ] susan dominus OK .\njames cai So my name is James Cai , and I \u2019 m a physician assistant .\nAnd his mother and grandfather live in New Jersey , and so he spends quite a bit of time there as well .\njames cai And I work as a primary care , urgent care and nursing home P.A .\nHe came to this country when he was about 16 from Shanghai . And he \u2019 s married and has a 20-month-old daughter , whom he adores .\nsusan dominus Why did you go into medicine in the first place ? Why were you drawn to medicine ? james cai Oh , because of my grandparents . They are doctors . My grandfather is an anesthesiologist in Shanghai . And when I was young , I always sick , so I always went to his hospital . So I had a good impression .\nAnd as someone working in the medical field , was James expecting to interact with this epidemic , the coronavirus ? Was he maybe even thinking he would end up treating coronavirus patients ?\nWell , he doesn \u2019 t work in a hospital . And because he works in private practice , I think he probably imagined he might be working remotely \u2014 with telemedicine .\njames cai I actually heard about coronavirus many months ago when China had outbreak . But I always followed the disease .\nBut because of the family background and because he does work in medicine , when news of the coronavirus did start coming out of Wuhan , he definitely understood how quickly the virus could spread . And he definitely understood that the only way to guarantee that you could survive this was by not getting it in the first place .\njames cai Around end of February , I started to pile up all the food , like canned foods , frozen vegetables , dumplings .\nSo soon after the coronavirus landed on the west coast , he and his family went to Costco and stocked up \u2014\njames cai Our family plan is to stay home for two months .\nRight . So they were going to avoid any meaningful exposure to the virus ?\nYeah , if there was communal spread and it had become widespread , their plan was to shelter in place .\nsusan dominus So you weren \u2019 t sure at what point you would start doing that , but you felt you \u2019 d know when it was time ? james cai Yes .\nBut , you know , he \u2019 s stocking up at the end of February . You know , people in the U.S. were still flying all over the country . Kids were going to school . Bloomberg was in the race for president . People were planning vacations and weddings and all sorts of conferences and events . And the same was true of James . So like everybody else , he \u2019 s going about his life . And around this time , without really too much concern about his health , he went to a medical conference in Times Square .\njames cai So I changed diaper for my daughter and gave her morning milk . And I kissed my wife and to go to conference .\nOn the fourth day of the conference , Monday , March 2 , he comes down with a cough . And he starts to realize he \u2019 s actually getting sick .\njames cai I start to cough and a fever and tired .\nSo he leaves and texts his wife that he \u2019 s going to go to New Jersey , where his mom has a house . His mom \u2019 s away . And he doesn \u2019 t want to come home and get his wife and the baby sick .\njames cai Because of my daughter , when I went home , she always hugged me and kissed me . And she will catch it .\nAnd what \u2019 s running through his head at this moment ? Is he thinking , I have a bad cough ? I might have the flu ? Is coronavirus even on his mind ?\nNot really . I mean , there had not been a single case in all of New Jersey . He thought he probably had the flu . By then , he was mostly feeling this bad cough . He had an elevated heart rate . His eyes were really runny . He had diarrhea . He was not feeling well at all . But he also was not alarmed . You know , he decided to go to one of those drop-in centers to get a flu test , because he wanted to be told he didn \u2019 t have the flu so he could go home . So the doctor gives him a strep test and a flu test . They discuss whether he should get a coronavirus test , in fact , but the doctor didn \u2019 t have one . So they moved on . And the results came back that although the strep and the flu tests were negative , his symptoms were consistent with something called a pulmonary embolism , which is a clot in your lung that can be fatal .\nSo this could potentially be even more serious than just a seasonal flu or \u2014\njames cai So after , I went direct to the Hackensack emergency room .\nSo the doctor sends him to the E.R . at the Hackensack University Medical Center , which is not far from that doctor \u2019 s office .\njames cai And in the emergency room , they asked me questions . Asked me if I cough . I said , I do , I do have cough . I do have shortness of breath .\nSo as called for , the doctors do a CT scan . And after they do , they realize that , no , he does not have a pulmonary embolism . But that in fact , because of the symptoms he \u2019 s having and the way his lungs look in the scan \u2014\njames cai They see a ground glass nodules . So this can be coronavirus .\nAnd how do the doctors at this hospital react to that ?\nWell , at this point , they haven \u2019 t seen any coronavirus patients . So they don \u2019 t seem to him terribly alarmed . That said , they do put him in a tiny isolation room , a windowless room on the floor of the emergency room . That \u2019 s where he spends the night , texting his friends and his wife and getting increasingly unnerved and feeling quite ill .\njames cai I was nervous . And at the same time , since I \u2019 m in the hospital , I \u2019 m going to check everything . Make sure I \u2019 m OK and then I go home .\nSo then on Tuesday , March 3 , which is the second day in the hospital \u2014\njames cai They decide to do a test on me . So the test takes about 24 hours or 48 hours .\n\u2014 they do a Covid-19 test . And they tell him he \u2019 s going to have to wait a few days for the result , but he shouldn \u2019 t worry , he \u2019 s young and healthy . At the same time , he \u2019 s wildly Googling symptoms for Covid-19 and realizing that he has almost every one of them .\njames cai I had maybe lied to myself , was like , trying to calm myself down . I don \u2019 t have the Covid-19 , I shouldn \u2019 t have it .\nAnd so , it \u2019 s day three for James in the hospital . It \u2019 s Wednesday , March 4 . He \u2019 s still waiting for the results in his tiny little room with a TV . And \u2014\narchived recording ( newscaster 1 ) We we begin tonight with breaking news regarding the coronavirus . archived recording ( newscaster 2 ) Yeah , that virus arriving in the Garden State tonight . Governor Phil Murphy announcing the first presumptive positive case of the virus right here in New Jersey .\narchived recording ( newscaster 2 ) A man in his thirties is hospitalized in Bergen County .\nThere \u2019 s a guy in his thirties in Bergen County , which is where he is , who \u2019 s tested positive for coronavirus . It \u2019 s the first case in New Jersey .\nThere \u2019 s even a tweet from the governor of New Jersey confirming it .\narchived recording ( newscaster 2 ) \u2014 \u201c We take this situation very seriously and have been preparing for this for weeks . I urge residents to remain calm \u201d \u2014\nAnd it occurs to James , they really might be talking about him .\njames cai And then I asked the doctor , saying , is this me ? And the doctor \u2019 s saying , no , your test is not back yet .\nAnd of course , he hasn \u2019 t heard anything about the results of his test yet ?\nsusan dominus Wow . So you found out from the news from the governor of New Jersey ? james cai Yes . On TV . And I asked the doctor . The doctor say , the result is not back yet .\nAnd then the next day , his doctors come to him and say , yes , you have tested positive . And he is the first person in New Jersey to have tested positive for Covid-19 .\nRight . And perhaps the first person in the history of the universe to find out he has a disease , not from his doctor , but from TV news .\nSo he \u2019 s really scared . But the hospital is telling him that he really has nothing to worry about . He \u2019 s a 32-year-old guy . He \u2019 s got no preexisting conditions .\njames cai Even Dr. [ INAUDIBLE ] was telling me , oh you \u2019 re so young . It \u2019 s like a flu .\njames cai If it \u2019 s not because everybody is talking about corona , you can go home already .\nYou know , if it weren \u2019 t for all this attention about the coronavirus , you \u2019 d be home right now , just getting better in the comfort of your own bedroom .\nIn other words , it would probably just self-resolve in somebody of his health ?\njames cai I mean , that day , I was so depressed .\nI think he felt that as a medical professional , he actually \u2014 he knew that he was quite vulnerable , that nobody was invulnerable . And there was this disconnect between his own concerns and their own insistence that he was overly anxious .\nIt also dawns on him that he is the first person in this hospital to be treated for coronavirus .\njames cai I feel like , I \u2019 m in real trouble . Why I come to this hospital ? Because I feel they don \u2019 t know how to treat this disease , and they don \u2019 t have deep understanding about this disease .\nNobody there has any experience . Nobody there can make good predictions . Nobody there has institutional knowledge about what happens when this goes wrong or something unexpected happens . He \u2019 s the first person , and that \u2019 s a very frightening position to be in .\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . So Sue , James is newly diagnosed . He \u2019 s in isolation at this hospital in Hackensack , New Jersey . He \u2019 s been there for about four days . Physically , how is he doing at this point ?\nsusan dominus When you first got the results of the positive test , on a scale of 1 to 10 , how bad did you feel physically ? 10 being the worst ? james cai I would say 10. susan dominus Wow .\njames cai Getting worse . So my heart is compensating , beating very fast .\nHe definitely has that cough . And he also is having real trouble breathing .\njames cai It \u2019 s like I \u2019 m in the water . susan dominus Tell me more about that . james cai It \u2019 s like , normally , we can just take very deep breaths in and out .\nHe describes it as that feeling when you \u2019 re underwater and you have to come up to gasp for breath , but you can \u2019 t quite get that oxygen that you want . And it \u2019 s very panicking feeling . It \u2019 s a very scary feeling .\njames cai So my lung is not allowing me to take deep breaths .\nAnd how is the hospital treating him now that he \u2019 s officially tested positive ?\nThey move him to a room with certain protections in place . And they \u2019 re keeping an eye on his numbers . And they \u2019 re giving him oxygen when he needs it . And he \u2019 s also keeping an eye on his numbers . And he \u2019 s worried , because he is not breathing well . And on Friday , March 6 , his fifth day in the hospital , he worries that he is desaturating to a dangerous level .\nIt means that when you desaturate below a certain level , your blood is not getting enough oxygen from your lungs for you to function in a normal , healthy way . And this is really concerning to him .\njames cai You have pneumonia , it \u2019 s normal . Just use oxygen .\nBut he still has the sense that the hospital is telling him he \u2019 s overreacting , that he \u2019 s being too anxious . He \u2019 s going to recover just fine .\njames cai I was confused . And also , I was worried , because I think I \u2019 m not getting enough care . And my oxygen level dropped , and they \u2014 they can not even see it .\nAnd why do you think people in hospital are saying that ? And maybe more importantly , why are they thinking that ? Why are they insisting on being so calm about what it would mean to have an infection like this ?\nI would have to guess that it \u2019 s because the widespread impression that people had was that young people were not going to be terribly affected by this virus , and that it was going to feel like a very , very bad flu . And that he was going to recover just fine , just like the statistics supposedly said he was going to .\nsusan dominus And did you actually feel yourself having difficulty breathing at that point ? james cai I just feel tightness . susan dominus Tightness in your chest ? james cai I feel like , a very scary \u2014 very scared . And I don \u2019 t know what to do next .\nAnd James is all too aware that no one in that hospital has ever treated anyone with coronavirus . And he \u2019 s really worried about his symptoms , because he knows he \u2019 s feeling worse and worse every day .\njames cai So I told my cousin , I told everybody , and they just start searching . .\nSo he starts reaching out to friends of his who are plugged into the Chinese medical community , including his best friend , who \u2019 s a physician \u2014 and whom he calls his cousin \u2014 and his boss . And they start making phone calls and trying to get information from experienced people who can maybe share what they \u2019 ve learned .\nYou know , there \u2019 s advice that he should get high doses of vitamin C , there \u2019 s some discussion of whether he should get a steroid treatment if things get worse .\nThey say that maybe he wants to look into antiviral medication . They tell him he shouldn \u2019 t wait too long before getting a second CT scan . But his doctors were really reluctant to do that .\nThey felt like they were giving him good care and that probably the results of the CT scan would not change that .\nSo James is more or less beginning to advise his own doctors on how to treat him , based on his research , based on his relationship with other medical professionals , which is pretty unusual .\nYes . Very unusual . And then the evening of the 7th , he starts desaturating to a level that really scares him . He \u2019 s concerned that if he desaturates to a certain degree , there could be no turning back . He \u2019 d have to be intubated , which definitely increases , you know , all of the risks of the illness . It would mean that a machine was going be doing all the breathing for him . It could lead to organ failure and in some cases , of course , death .\njames cai And I mean , if I intubated at night , I probably would just die by myself alone , without seeing the loved ones .\nAnd his friends \u2014 also , some of them see this real urgency to save his life . And you know , one of his friends said to me that he personally felt responsible for making sure that the doctors took James \u2019 s case as seriously as possible . Here he is . He \u2019 s the first health care worker in New Jersey also to come down with Covid-19 . If he didn \u2019 t make it , it was going to feel like the battle was over before it had even begun .\njames cai You always live in fear that you \u2019 re never going to wake up . And also , in isolation . And nobody can see you . So it \u2019 s very miserable . If people die , think about it , people die and they can not see their loved ones . What \u2014 I mean , like , I feel like it \u2019 s very tough , right ? For somebody to die alone . susan dominus You were scared . I mean , you were probably too weak to really speak forcefully , but you were letting them know that you felt that your life was on the line at this point . james cai Yeah .\nAnd we don \u2019 t exactly know why , but on the 8th , he did get that second CT scan .\nIt \u2019 s bad . He has pneumonia in both lungs . 30 to 40 percent of his lungs seem to be affected . That \u2019 s astonishing , that it would go from a small spot just a few days earlier to where it is now . And if he had gotten that bad in three days or four days since the last CT scan , how much worse was he going to be in another four days ? And now , James starts to worry that he really might not survive this .\njames cai I was praying to everybody , to God , to Buddha , to everybody , saying , don \u2019 t let me die . When I know my oxygen levels keep desaturating , one of my requests is can I see my mother and my wife or my daughter for the last time ? It was that time , when my chest X-rays show so bad , and my oxygen level every day is dropping , and I would tell them that I have to be strong , but I don \u2019 t know how many days I can live . And the good thing is , after the CT , they listened . When she saw second CT , she was like , OK , we have to treat you .\nI spoke to a doctor at the hospital who was part of the team overseeing his care . And he said they \u2019 d been looking at the whole clinical picture , had recognized that he was declining even before the CT scan . But from James \u2019 s point of view , everything changed after the scan . He feels like , now they \u2019 re taking this very seriously and they \u2019 re listening to him . They \u2019 re coming around to seeing just how serious it is . And also recognizing that , yes , even a young person can get very , very sick with coronavirus . And they \u2019 re willing to try something .\nAnd at this stage , what is he asking them to do ?\njames cai So then a doctor in China recommend a high-flow machine .\nJames wants a few different types of treatment . He \u2019 s been advised that the doctors should try providing him a more intensive form of oxygen therapy . And he wants to go on three experimental antiviral medications \u2014 Kaletra , chloroquine and remdesivir . And at this point , he and the doctors at Hackensack and all the other doctors he \u2019 s working with are pretty much all on the same page . He finally gets the main things he \u2019 s been asking for .\njames cai And I think the next day , Dr. [ INAUDIBLE ] came in . He said , the medication \u2019 s here . We \u2019 re going to give it to you .\nAnd finally , after more than a week in the hospital , James starts to turn around . He does start to feel better .\njames cai So after the first day , my fever finally dropped . And my oxygen stopped dropping . I \u2019 m getting better and better every day . So that \u2019 s the whole thing .\nAnd does he have a sense , do you have a sense , do his doctors have a sense of which of these treatments was responsible for that ?\nNot really . I mean , it might have been any one of the drugs , or all of the drugs , or the oxygen , or some combination of that . Or he might have just gotten better on his own . We really don \u2019 t know .\nsusan dominus And so I asked you how you felt on a scale of 1 to 10 , 10 being the worst , when you first got the results of the test , and you said that you were a 10 . On a scale of 1 to 10 , how do you feel now ? james cai I would say now , maybe 3. susan dominus That \u2019 s pretty good . james cai Yeah , because I feel like all the symptoms have gone . I mean , I will be maybe no worry if tests come back negative . Then I know the virus is dead . Now , I don \u2019 t know if it is dead or not . susan dominus It \u2019 s now 10:37 , and I need you to get a good night \u2019 s sleep . So I \u2019 m going to call you in the morning and see how your oxygen level were . Is that OK ? james cai Yes . OK . Thank you . susan dominus All right . Thanks , James . Bye . Bye . james cai Good night . Bye-bye .\nSue , it feels \u2014 correct me if I \u2019 m wrong \u2014 like a big reason why James survived was because he was such an aggressive advocate for himself . And he had this network of expertise that he could tap into . He himself was a medical professional . And that that put him in a very strong position . But I wonder why the people around him in this hospital were not better prepared , given the stage of this pandemic when he arrived in Hackensack .\nWe don \u2019 t really know what saved his life , because these drugs are still in clinical trials . What we do know is that the entire story of coronavirus in this country is a story of lack of preparation . People did not believe that it simply was never going to be as bad here as it was in Wuhan or Milan . That is a universal story . It was hardly just these doctors at this hospital . I mean , part of it is that they are busy people . They are moving things really quickly . They are saving lives every day . In fact , we all know that they \u2019 re saving lives and putting their own lives on the line right now . But also , it is just hard to put yourself back in that moment \u2014 March 1 , March 2 or the end of February \u2014 and remember how unlikely we all still hoped and believed , against all evidence , that this wasn \u2019 t going to be devastating here the way it was elsewhere .\nThat said , to their credit , the doctors at this hospital were open-minded and they were flexible and they were nimble . And they were willing to try whatever they could that was safe when they realized that whatever they had been doing definitely was not working . And I know James feels really appreciative , ultimately . He sent out a tweet that expressed his gratitude for the hospital saving , as he sees it , his life .\nSue , what do you think the lesson of this story is , of James , his very unique situation in these early days of the pandemic in the United States , and of what happened to him at this hospital ?\nOne of the things that I \u2019 m hearing from doctors is that until you are in this moment and experiencing the onslaught of patients , it is very hard to imagine it . You can \u2019 t really know until you \u2019 re actually living it . And you know , every hospital in this country is likely to have its James . It \u2019 s going to have that first patient who comes in , who is really ill. They \u2019 re not exactly sure how to treat it . We still really don \u2019 t know how best to treat this virus . That is the hard , cold truth of it . There are some protocols that we hope will help , that are thought might help . But it \u2019 s unclear . It \u2019 s so new . And it \u2019 s going to be really hard for all those hospitals . And they \u2019 re going to have to make difficult choices . They \u2019 re going to have to make complicated ethical choices . They \u2019 re going to have to make decisions on the fly and build up their clinical experience . And it \u2019 s not going to be easy for any of them .\nSue , how is James doing at this point ? I don \u2019 t know when the last time it was that you spoke with him , but what did he tell you ?\nHe \u2019 s home . He is still in quarantine . So he still has not been able to see his wife or daughter . And his lungs are still recovering . It \u2019 s unclear just how fully they will recover . You know , it \u2019 s definitely a long road ahead of him . And at the same time , you know , he \u2019 s reading the news and he is feeling so lucky .\njames cai Hello ? susan dominus Hi , James , it \u2019 s Sue . How are you doing ? james cai I \u2019 m good . susan dominus Are you actually in your own home ? james cai Yes . susan dominus How does it feel ? james cai It feels great . I \u2019 m going to sleep on my own bed . susan dominus Fantastic . james cai Once I \u2019 m out of the hospital , I feel like I \u2019 m alive . I feel like everything is so new to me . The grass , trees , cars , new people face , the sky . And then when I drive on the road , I appreciate every building , every people I see . I feel like it \u2019 s a second chance to live again , to be alive . susan dominus What is the first thing you \u2019 re going to say to your daughter and wife when you finally get to see them in person ? I know you \u2019 re quarantining for almost two more weeks now . james cai Yes . So when I see my daughter and my wife , I definitely will give them big hugs . Try to don \u2019 t let them go . I maybe will , like , have my daughter in my arms all the time . I will come home and spend every minute with my family . Appreciate every day , living . susan dominus All right . Good night . Have a great night \u2019 s sleep . Thanks , James . james cai Thank you . Thank you for checking in on me . susan dominus My pleasure . Bye . Goodbye . james cai Bye-bye .\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . Here \u2019 s what else you need to know today . In interviews on Sunday , members of the president \u2019 s coronavirus task force delivered dire warnings about the pandemic \u2019 s projected path in the United States .\narchived recording ( dr. deborah birx ) No state , no metro area will be spared . And the sooner we react , and the sooner the states and the metro areas react and ensure that they put in full mitigation , at the same time understanding exactly what their hospitals need , then we \u2019 ll be able to move forward together and protect the most Americans .\nSpeaking to NBC News , Dr. Deborah Birx said that the White House was asking every state to prepare for the kind of outbreak now occurring in New York , where there are about 60,000 infections .\narchived recording ( jake tapper ) Well , Dr. Birx said yesterday , as you know , that she doesn \u2019 t think any city will be spared from this virus . How many cases do you think the U.S. will reach ? archived recording ( dr. anthony fauci ) I mean , looking at what we \u2019 re seeing now , you know , I would say between 100 and 200,000 cases \u2014 excuse me , deaths . But I just don \u2019 t think that we really need to make a projection when it \u2019 s such a moving target .\nOn CNN , Dr. Anthony Fauci said that millions of Americans could eventually be infected , and that between 100,000 and 200,000 could die .\narchived recording ( dr. anthony fauci ) What we do know , Jake , is that we \u2019 ve got a serious problem in New York . We have a serious problem in New Orleans . And we \u2019 re going to be developing serious problems in other areas .",
    "content_original": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d Today: As the pandemic quickly spreads across the U.S., hundreds of hospitals are now confronting their first serious cases of the coronavirus. Susan Dominus on the lessons from the first confirmed case in New Jersey. It\u2019s Monday, March 30. Sue, tell me how you first heard about James Cai.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nWell, a few weeks ago I heard about this young guy, a 32-year-old physician assistant, who was the very first patient in all of New Jersey to test positive for Covid-19. And so I reached out to him while he was still at the hospital. And I was sort of wondering, would it possibly be OK, could you maybe find some time to talk? And he said, sure, call me now. I\u2019m in isolation, in other words, and I have time.\n\njames cai Hello? [COUGHING] susan dominus Are you there? james cai Yes. [COUGHING] susan dominus OK.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was the story that he told you?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nSo James lives and works in New York City.\n\njames cai So my name is James Cai, and I\u2019m a physician assistant.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nAnd his mother and grandfather live in New Jersey, and so he spends quite a bit of time there as well.\n\njames cai And I work as a primary care, urgent care and nursing home P.A.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nHe came to this country when he was about 16 from Shanghai. And he\u2019s married and has a 20-month-old daughter, whom he adores.\n\nsusan dominus Why did you go into medicine in the first place? Why were you drawn to medicine? james cai Oh, because of my grandparents. They are doctors. My grandfather is an anesthesiologist in Shanghai. And when I was young, I always sick, so I always went to his hospital. So I had a good impression.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd as someone working in the medical field, was James expecting to interact with this epidemic, the coronavirus? Was he maybe even thinking he would end up treating coronavirus patients?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nWell, he doesn\u2019t work in a hospital. And because he works in private practice, I think he probably imagined he might be working remotely \u2014 with telemedicine.\n\njames cai I actually heard about coronavirus many months ago when China had outbreak. But I always followed the disease.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nBut because of the family background and because he does work in medicine, when news of the coronavirus did start coming out of Wuhan, he definitely understood how quickly the virus could spread. And he definitely understood that the only way to guarantee that you could survive this was by not getting it in the first place.\n\njames cai Around end of February, I started to pile up all the food, like canned foods, frozen vegetables, dumplings.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nSo soon after the coronavirus landed on the west coast, he and his family went to Costco and stocked up \u2014\n\njames cai Our family plan is to stay home for two months.\n\nsusan dominus\n\n\u2014 for like, two months\u2019 worth of supplies.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So they were going to avoid any meaningful exposure to the virus?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nYeah, if there was communal spread and it had become widespread, their plan was to shelter in place.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd well ahead of the rest of us.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nYeah, I think that\u2019s right.\n\nsusan dominus So you weren\u2019t sure at what point you would start doing that, but you felt you\u2019d know when it was time? james cai Yes.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nBut, you know, he\u2019s stocking up at the end of February. You know, people in the U.S. were still flying all over the country. Kids were going to school. Bloomberg was in the race for president. People were planning vacations and weddings and all sorts of conferences and events. And the same was true of James. So like everybody else, he\u2019s going about his life. And around this time, without really too much concern about his health, he went to a medical conference in Times Square.\n\njames cai So I changed diaper for my daughter and gave her morning milk. And I kissed my wife and to go to conference.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nOn the fourth day of the conference, Monday, March 2, he comes down with a cough. And he starts to realize he\u2019s actually getting sick.\n\njames cai I start to cough and a fever and tired.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nSo he leaves and texts his wife that he\u2019s going to go to New Jersey, where his mom has a house. His mom\u2019s away. And he doesn\u2019t want to come home and get his wife and the baby sick.\n\njames cai Because of my daughter, when I went home, she always hugged me and kissed me. And she will catch it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what\u2019s running through his head at this moment? Is he thinking, I have a bad cough? I might have the flu? Is coronavirus even on his mind?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nNot really. I mean, there had not been a single case in all of New Jersey. He thought he probably had the flu. By then, he was mostly feeling this bad cough. He had an elevated heart rate. His eyes were really runny. He had diarrhea. He was not feeling well at all. But he also was not alarmed. You know, he decided to go to one of those drop-in centers to get a flu test, because he wanted to be told he didn\u2019t have the flu so he could go home. So the doctor gives him a strep test and a flu test. They discuss whether he should get a coronavirus test, in fact, but the doctor didn\u2019t have one. So they moved on. And the results came back that although the strep and the flu tests were negative, his symptoms were consistent with something called a pulmonary embolism, which is a clot in your lung that can be fatal.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo this could potentially be even more serious than just a seasonal flu or \u2014\n\nsusan dominus\n\nYes. Certainly more serious than the flu.\n\njames cai So after, I went direct to the Hackensack emergency room.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nSo the doctor sends him to the E.R. at the Hackensack University Medical Center, which is not far from that doctor\u2019s office.\n\njames cai And in the emergency room, they asked me questions. Asked me if I cough. I said, I do, I do have cough. I do have shortness of breath.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nSo as called for, the doctors do a CT scan. And after they do, they realize that, no, he does not have a pulmonary embolism. But that in fact, because of the symptoms he\u2019s having and the way his lungs look in the scan \u2014\n\njames cai They see a ground glass nodules. So this can be coronavirus.\n\nsusan dominus\n\n\u2014 he might actually have coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how do the doctors at this hospital react to that?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nWell, at this point, they haven\u2019t seen any coronavirus patients. So they don\u2019t seem to him terribly alarmed. That said, they do put him in a tiny isolation room, a windowless room on the floor of the emergency room. That\u2019s where he spends the night, texting his friends and his wife and getting increasingly unnerved and feeling quite ill.\n\njames cai I was nervous. And at the same time, since I\u2019m in the hospital, I\u2019m going to check everything. Make sure I\u2019m OK and then I go home.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nSo then on Tuesday, March 3, which is the second day in the hospital \u2014\n\njames cai They decide to do a test on me. So the test takes about 24 hours or 48 hours.\n\nsusan dominus\n\n\u2014 they do a Covid-19 test. And they tell him he\u2019s going to have to wait a few days for the result, but he shouldn\u2019t worry, he\u2019s young and healthy. At the same time, he\u2019s wildly Googling symptoms for Covid-19 and realizing that he has almost every one of them.\n\njames cai I had maybe lied to myself, was like, trying to calm myself down. I don\u2019t have the Covid-19, I shouldn\u2019t have it.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nAnd so, it\u2019s day three for James in the hospital. It\u2019s Wednesday, March 4. He\u2019s still waiting for the results in his tiny little room with a TV. And \u2014\n\narchived recording [SOUND OF LOCAL NEWS THEME]\n\nsusan dominus\n\n\u2014 a local news report comes on.\n\narchived recording (newscaster 1) We we begin tonight with breaking news regarding the coronavirus. archived recording (newscaster 2) Yeah, that virus arriving in the Garden State tonight. Governor Phil Murphy announcing the first presumptive positive case of the virus right here in New Jersey.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nAnd the news report says \u2014\n\narchived recording (newscaster 2) A man in his thirties is hospitalized in Bergen County.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nThere\u2019s a guy in his thirties in Bergen County, which is where he is, who\u2019s tested positive for coronavirus. It\u2019s the first case in New Jersey.\n\narchived recording (newscaster 2) Governor Murphy saying \u2014\n\nsusan dominus\n\nThere\u2019s even a tweet from the governor of New Jersey confirming it.\n\narchived recording (newscaster 2) \u2014 \u201cWe take this situation very seriously and have been preparing for this for weeks. I urge residents to remain calm\u201d \u2014\n\nsusan dominus\n\nAnd it occurs to James, they really might be talking about him.\n\njames cai And then I asked the doctor, saying, is this me? And the doctor\u2019s saying, no, your test is not back yet.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd of course, he hasn\u2019t heard anything about the results of his test yet?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nNo, he has not heard anything.\n\nsusan dominus Wow. So you found out from the news from the governor of New Jersey? james cai Yes. On TV. And I asked the doctor. The doctor say, the result is not back yet.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nAnd then the next day, his doctors come to him and say, yes, you have tested positive. And he is the first person in New Jersey to have tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And perhaps the first person in the history of the universe to find out he has a disease, not from his doctor, but from TV news.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nLet\u2019s hope so.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how does the hospital react in this moment?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nSo he\u2019s really scared. But the hospital is telling him that he really has nothing to worry about. He\u2019s a 32-year-old guy. He\u2019s got no preexisting conditions.\n\njames cai Even Dr. [INAUDIBLE] was telling me, oh you\u2019re so young. It\u2019s like a flu.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nIn fact, one doctor even told him \u2014\n\njames cai If it\u2019s not because everybody is talking about corona, you can go home already.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nYou know, if it weren\u2019t for all this attention about the coronavirus, you\u2019d be home right now, just getting better in the comfort of your own bedroom.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn other words, it would probably just self-resolve in somebody of his health?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nThat was definitely the expectation.\n\njames cai I mean, that day, I was so depressed.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nI think he felt that as a medical professional, he actually \u2014 he knew that he was quite vulnerable, that nobody was invulnerable. And there was this disconnect between his own concerns and their own insistence that he was overly anxious.\n\njames cai America is not ready.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nIt also dawns on him that he is the first person in this hospital to be treated for coronavirus.\n\njames cai I feel like, I\u2019m in real trouble. Why I come to this hospital? Because I feel they don\u2019t know how to treat this disease, and they don\u2019t have deep understanding about this disease.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nNobody there has any experience. Nobody there can make good predictions. Nobody there has institutional knowledge about what happens when this goes wrong or something unexpected happens. He\u2019s the first person, and that\u2019s a very frightening position to be in.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Sue, James is newly diagnosed. He\u2019s in isolation at this hospital in Hackensack, New Jersey. He\u2019s been there for about four days. Physically, how is he doing at this point?\n\nsusan dominus When you first got the results of the positive test, on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad did you feel physically? 10 being the worst? james cai I would say 10. susan dominus Wow.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nHe is feeling worse by the day.\n\njames cai Getting worse. So my heart is compensating, beating very fast.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nHe definitely has that cough. And he also is having real trouble breathing.\n\njames cai It\u2019s like I\u2019m in the water. susan dominus Tell me more about that. james cai It\u2019s like, normally, we can just take very deep breaths in and out.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nHe describes it as that feeling when you\u2019re underwater and you have to come up to gasp for breath, but you can\u2019t quite get that oxygen that you want. And it\u2019s very panicking feeling. It\u2019s a very scary feeling.\n\njames cai So my lung is not allowing me to take deep breaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how is the hospital treating him now that he\u2019s officially tested positive?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nThey move him to a room with certain protections in place. And they\u2019re keeping an eye on his numbers. And they\u2019re giving him oxygen when he needs it. And he\u2019s also keeping an eye on his numbers. And he\u2019s worried, because he is not breathing well. And on Friday, March 6, his fifth day in the hospital, he worries that he is desaturating to a dangerous level.\n\njames cai And I desats.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nHe desats.\n\nsusan dominus You desaturated.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does that mean, to desaturate?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nIt means that when you desaturate below a certain level, your blood is not getting enough oxygen from your lungs for you to function in a normal, healthy way. And this is really concerning to him.\n\njames cai You have pneumonia, it\u2019s normal. Just use oxygen.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nBut he still has the sense that the hospital is telling him he\u2019s overreacting, that he\u2019s being too anxious. He\u2019s going to recover just fine.\n\njames cai I was confused. And also, I was worried, because I think I\u2019m not getting enough care. And my oxygen level dropped, and they \u2014 they cannot even see it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why do you think people in hospital are saying that? And maybe more importantly, why are they thinking that? Why are they insisting on being so calm about what it would mean to have an infection like this?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nI would have to guess that it\u2019s because the widespread impression that people had was that young people were not going to be terribly affected by this virus, and that it was going to feel like a very, very bad flu. And that he was going to recover just fine, just like the statistics supposedly said he was going to.\n\nsusan dominus And did you actually feel yourself having difficulty breathing at that point? james cai I just feel tightness. susan dominus Tightness in your chest? james cai I feel like, a very scary \u2014 very scared. And I don\u2019t know what to do next.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nAnd James is all too aware that no one in that hospital has ever treated anyone with coronavirus. And he\u2019s really worried about his symptoms, because he knows he\u2019s feeling worse and worse every day.\n\njames cai So I told my cousin, I told everybody, and they just start searching. .\n\nsusan dominus\n\nSo he starts reaching out to friends of his who are plugged into the Chinese medical community, including his best friend, who\u2019s a physician \u2014 and whom he calls his cousin \u2014 and his boss. And they start making phone calls and trying to get information from experienced people who can maybe share what they\u2019ve learned.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhich is what?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nYou know, there\u2019s advice that he should get high doses of vitamin C, there\u2019s some discussion of whether he should get a steroid treatment if things get worse.\n\njames cai He translate the seventh edition.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nThey say that maybe he wants to look into antiviral medication. They tell him he shouldn\u2019t wait too long before getting a second CT scan. But his doctors were really reluctant to do that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy was that?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nThey felt like they were giving him good care and that probably the results of the CT scan would not change that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo James is more or less beginning to advise his own doctors on how to treat him, based on his research, based on his relationship with other medical professionals, which is pretty unusual.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nYes. Very unusual. And then the evening of the 7th, he starts desaturating to a level that really scares him. He\u2019s concerned that if he desaturates to a certain degree, there could be no turning back. He\u2019d have to be intubated, which definitely increases, you know, all of the risks of the illness. It would mean that a machine was going be doing all the breathing for him. It could lead to organ failure and in some cases, of course, death.\n\njames cai And I mean, if I intubated at night, I probably would just die by myself alone, without seeing the loved ones.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nAnd his friends \u2014 also, some of them see this real urgency to save his life. And you know, one of his friends said to me that he personally felt responsible for making sure that the doctors took James\u2019s case as seriously as possible. Here he is. He\u2019s the first health care worker in New Jersey also to come down with Covid-19. If he didn\u2019t make it, it was going to feel like the battle was over before it had even begun.\n\njames cai You always live in fear that you\u2019re never going to wake up. And also, in isolation. And nobody can see you. So it\u2019s very miserable. If people die, think about it, people die and they cannot see their loved ones. What \u2014 I mean, like, I feel like it\u2019s very tough, right? For somebody to die alone. susan dominus You were scared. I mean, you were probably too weak to really speak forcefully, but you were letting them know that you felt that your life was on the line at this point. james cai Yeah.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nAnd we don\u2019t exactly know why, but on the 8th, he did get that second CT scan.\n\njames cai And it come back very bad.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nIt\u2019s bad. He has pneumonia in both lungs. 30 to 40 percent of his lungs seem to be affected. That\u2019s astonishing, that it would go from a small spot just a few days earlier to where it is now. And if he had gotten that bad in three days or four days since the last CT scan, how much worse was he going to be in another four days? And now, James starts to worry that he really might not survive this.\n\njames cai I was praying to everybody, to God, to Buddha, to everybody, saying, don\u2019t let me die. When I know my oxygen levels keep desaturating, one of my requests is can I see my mother and my wife or my daughter for the last time? It was that time, when my chest X-rays show so bad, and my oxygen level every day is dropping, and I would tell them that I have to be strong, but I don\u2019t know how many days I can live. And the good thing is, after the CT, they listened. When she saw second CT, she was like, OK, we have to treat you.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nI spoke to a doctor at the hospital who was part of the team overseeing his care. And he said they\u2019d been looking at the whole clinical picture, had recognized that he was declining even before the CT scan. But from James\u2019s point of view, everything changed after the scan. He feels like, now they\u2019re taking this very seriously and they\u2019re listening to him. They\u2019re coming around to seeing just how serious it is. And also recognizing that, yes, even a young person can get very, very sick with coronavirus. And they\u2019re willing to try something.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd at this stage, what is he asking them to do?\n\njames cai So then a doctor in China recommend a high-flow machine.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nJames wants a few different types of treatment. He\u2019s been advised that the doctors should try providing him a more intensive form of oxygen therapy. And he wants to go on three experimental antiviral medications \u2014 Kaletra, chloroquine and remdesivir. And at this point, he and the doctors at Hackensack and all the other doctors he\u2019s working with are pretty much all on the same page. He finally gets the main things he\u2019s been asking for.\n\njames cai And I think the next day, Dr. [INAUDIBLE] came in. He said, the medication\u2019s here. We\u2019re going to give it to you.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nAnd finally, after more than a week in the hospital, James starts to turn around. He does start to feel better.\n\njames cai So after the first day, my fever finally dropped. And my oxygen stopped dropping. I\u2019m getting better and better every day. So that\u2019s the whole thing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd does he have a sense, do you have a sense, do his doctors have a sense of which of these treatments was responsible for that?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nNot really. I mean, it might have been any one of the drugs, or all of the drugs, or the oxygen, or some combination of that. Or he might have just gotten better on his own. We really don\u2019t know.\n\nsusan dominus And so I asked you how you felt on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, when you first got the results of the test, and you said that you were a 10. On a scale of 1 to 10, how do you feel now? james cai I would say now, maybe 3. susan dominus That\u2019s pretty good. james cai Yeah, because I feel like all the symptoms have gone. I mean, I will be maybe no worry if tests come back negative. Then I know the virus is dead. Now, I don\u2019t know if it is dead or not. susan dominus It\u2019s now 10:37, and I need you to get a good night\u2019s sleep. So I\u2019m going to call you in the morning and see how your oxygen level were. Is that OK? james cai Yes. OK. Thank you. susan dominus All right. Thanks, James. Bye. Bye. james cai Good night. Bye-bye.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSue, it feels \u2014 correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 like a big reason why James survived was because he was such an aggressive advocate for himself. And he had this network of expertise that he could tap into. He himself was a medical professional. And that that put him in a very strong position. But I wonder why the people around him in this hospital were not better prepared, given the stage of this pandemic when he arrived in Hackensack.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nWe don\u2019t really know what saved his life, because these drugs are still in clinical trials. What we do know is that the entire story of coronavirus in this country is a story of lack of preparation. People did not believe that it simply was never going to be as bad here as it was in Wuhan or Milan. That is a universal story. It was hardly just these doctors at this hospital. I mean, part of it is that they are busy people. They are moving things really quickly. They are saving lives every day. In fact, we all know that they\u2019re saving lives and putting their own lives on the line right now. But also, it is just hard to put yourself back in that moment \u2014 March 1, March 2 or the end of February \u2014 and remember how unlikely we all still hoped and believed, against all evidence, that this wasn\u2019t going to be devastating here the way it was elsewhere.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nThat said, to their credit, the doctors at this hospital were open-minded and they were flexible and they were nimble. And they were willing to try whatever they could that was safe when they realized that whatever they had been doing definitely was not working. And I know James feels really appreciative, ultimately. He sent out a tweet that expressed his gratitude for the hospital saving, as he sees it, his life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSue, what do you think the lesson of this story is, of James, his very unique situation in these early days of the pandemic in the United States, and of what happened to him at this hospital?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nOne of the things that I\u2019m hearing from doctors is that until you are in this moment and experiencing the onslaught of patients, it is very hard to imagine it. You can\u2019t really know until you\u2019re actually living it. And you know, every hospital in this country is likely to have its James. It\u2019s going to have that first patient who comes in, who is really ill. They\u2019re not exactly sure how to treat it. We still really don\u2019t know how best to treat this virus. That is the hard, cold truth of it. There are some protocols that we hope will help, that are thought might help. But it\u2019s unclear. It\u2019s so new. And it\u2019s going to be really hard for all those hospitals. And they\u2019re going to have to make difficult choices. They\u2019re going to have to make complicated ethical choices. They\u2019re going to have to make decisions on the fly and build up their clinical experience. And it\u2019s not going to be easy for any of them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSue, how is James doing at this point? I don\u2019t know when the last time it was that you spoke with him, but what did he tell you?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nHe\u2019s home. He is still in quarantine. So he still has not been able to see his wife or daughter. And his lungs are still recovering. It\u2019s unclear just how fully they will recover. You know, it\u2019s definitely a long road ahead of him. And at the same time, you know, he\u2019s reading the news and he is feeling so lucky.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLucky to be alive?\n\nsusan dominus\n\nTo be alive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you, Sue.\n\nsusan dominus\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\njames cai Hello? susan dominus Hi, James, it\u2019s Sue. How are you doing? james cai I\u2019m good. susan dominus Are you actually in your own home? james cai Yes. susan dominus How does it feel? james cai It feels great. I\u2019m going to sleep on my own bed. susan dominus Fantastic. james cai Once I\u2019m out of the hospital, I feel like I\u2019m alive. I feel like everything is so new to me. The grass, trees, cars, new people face, the sky. And then when I drive on the road, I appreciate every building, every people I see. I feel like it\u2019s a second chance to live again, to be alive. susan dominus What is the first thing you\u2019re going to say to your daughter and wife when you finally get to see them in person? I know you\u2019re quarantining for almost two more weeks now. james cai Yes. So when I see my daughter and my wife, I definitely will give them big hugs. Try to don\u2019t let them go. I maybe will, like, have my daughter in my arms all the time. I will come home and spend every minute with my family. Appreciate every day, living. susan dominus All right. Good night. Have a great night\u2019s sleep. Thanks, James. james cai Thank you. Thank you for checking in on me. susan dominus My pleasure. Bye. Goodbye. james cai Bye-bye.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. In interviews on Sunday, members of the president\u2019s coronavirus task force delivered dire warnings about the pandemic\u2019s projected path in the United States.\n\narchived recording (dr. deborah birx) No state, no metro area will be spared. And the sooner we react, and the sooner the states and the metro areas react and ensure that they put in full mitigation, at the same time understanding exactly what their hospitals need, then we\u2019ll be able to move forward together and protect the most Americans.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSpeaking to NBC News, Dr. Deborah Birx said that the White House was asking every state to prepare for the kind of outbreak now occurring in New York, where there are about 60,000 infections.\n\narchived recording (jake tapper) Well, Dr. Birx said yesterday, as you know, that she doesn\u2019t think any city will be spared from this virus. How many cases do you think the U.S. will reach? archived recording (dr. anthony fauci) I mean, looking at what we\u2019re seeing now, you know, I would say between 100 and 200,000 cases \u2014 excuse me, deaths. But I just don\u2019t think that we really need to make a projection when it\u2019s such a moving target.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn CNN, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that millions of Americans could eventually be infected, and that between 100,000 and 200,000 could die.\n\narchived recording (dr. anthony fauci) What we do know, Jake, is that we\u2019ve got a serious problem in New York. We have a serious problem in New Orleans. And we\u2019re going to be developing serious problems in other areas.\n\nmichael barbaro",
