'' The report , further , said the NSA should `` purge '' the files .\nThe president did not go nearly as far when he called last week for ending government control of phone data collected from hundreds of millions of Americans .\nCarney claimed the president , in his address last week , did `` directly derive '' some of his ideas from the board 's draft recommendations . But he made clear that Obama does not see eye to eye with them on the legitimacy of mass phone record collection .\n`` The administration believes that the program is lawful , '' he said .\nNevertheless , the findings could be used as leverage in federal lawsuits against NSA spying . The report concluded that the NSA collection raises `` constitutional concerns '' with regard to U.S. citizens ' rights of speech , association and privacy .\n`` The connections revealed by the extensive database of telephone records gathered under the program will necessarily include relationships established among individuals and groups for political , religious , and other expressive purposes , '' it said . `` Compelled disclosure to the government of information revealing these associations can have a chilling effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights . ''\nThe panel added that the program `` implicates constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth Amendments . ''\nThe recommendations are sure to meet resistance in Washington . House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers , R-Mich. , who has been a staunch defender of the NSA , voiced dismay at the report 's findings .\n`` I am disappointed that three members of the Board decided to step well beyond their policy and oversight role and conducted a legal review of a program that has been thoroughly reviewed , '' he said in a statement , noting that federal judges have found the program to be legal dozens of times .\nThe report also rejected claims that the program was necessary to cover up a gap in intelligence arising from a failure to detect Al Qaeda members in the United States prior to the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks . U.S. officials had claimed that the phone data collection program would have made clear that terrorist Khalid al-Mihdhar was calling a safehouse in Yemen from a San Diego address .\n`` The failure to identify Mihdhar 's presence in the United States stemmed primarily from a lack of information sharing among federal agencies , not of a lack of surveillance capabilities , '' the report said . `` This was a failure to connect the dots , not a failure to connect enough dots . ''\nThe board 's recommendations go well beyond the reforms ordered by Obama in a major speech last Friday , in which he said that the phone records database would no longer be held by the NSA . Obama also tightened restrictions on gathering and accessing phone data , but did not recommend the program 's end .\nThe PCLOB recommendations also are more sweeping than reforms proposed by another panel of experts . That panel , the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies , advised Obama in December to restrict phone surveillance to limited court-ordered sweeps .\nAlong with its call for ending bulk phone surveillance , the oversight board report outlined 11 other recommendations on surveillance policy , calling for more government transparency and other reforms aimed at bolstering civil liberties and privacy protections . The board called for special attorneys to provide independent views in some proceedings before the secret spy court -- as opposed to Obama 's plan for a panel of experts that would participate at times . The board also urged the administration to provide the public with clear explanations of the legal authority behind any surveillance affecting Americans .\nLegal opinions and documents `` describing the government 's legal analysis should be made public so there can be a free and open debate regarding the law 's scope , '' the board said .
