The remaining reactor will be shut down next April .\nThis is the exact wrong time to be closing Indian Point , which by itself reliably provides about 25 percent of the electricity consumed in New York City . Closing the plant will reduce the resilience of New York \u2019 s electric grid and increase the state \u2019 s reliance on natural gas for electricity production .\nWhat if gas supplies were suddenly stopped or reduced due to an accident , terrorism or a cyberattack ?

And what would happen if those wind turbines were destroyed by a hurricane ?\nThe decision to prematurely shutter the nuclear plant was a victory for environmental groups \u2014 including Riverkeeper and the Natural Resources Defense Council \u2014 which repeatedly claimed Indian Point was unsafe and that the 16 terawatt-hours of carbon-free electricity it produces every year could be replaced by renewables and increases in efficiency .\nThe groups convinced Cuomo of that , and three years ago , he announced the plan to close Indian Point .
