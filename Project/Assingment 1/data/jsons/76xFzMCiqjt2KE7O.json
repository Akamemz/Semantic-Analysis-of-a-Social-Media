The numbers are very strong , '' said Joseph LaVorgna , chief economist Americas at Natixis .

On absolute levels , the last time three quarters each had 3 percent or more growth was in the period ending in the first quarter of 2005 .\nGrowth was 3.2 percent in the third quarter of 2017 , and 3.1 percent in the second quarter .
