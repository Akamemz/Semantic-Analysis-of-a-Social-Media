    "content": "Obama \u2019 s Clean Power Plan ( CPP ) is facing some opposition from his own party in Kentucky and Missouri . The ambitious green energy plan aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 . It \u2019 s a regulatory nightmare that will hurt millions of Americans , especially those in rural areas and living on fixed-incomes . It will impact Americans \u2019 electrical costs , and possibly gut millions of jobs within the black and Hispanic communities . Also , states that didn \u2019 t vote for Obama in 2012 are disproportionately impacted . In Missouri , the Clean Power Plan was projected to cost the state $ 6 billion by 2030 , which is why Attorney General and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Chris Koster has planned to join other states suing to block these regulations\nThe state \u2019 s utilities , including Ameren Missouri , had urged Koster to join the states \u2014 most of them Republican-led \u2014 fighting the rules . Koster , the only Democrat running for governor in Missouri , has sued the EPA over other recent regulations , including the controversial \u201c Waters of the U.S. \u201d rule strongly opposed by large agricultural interests . Koster made the announcement Friday in a speech at a meeting of rural electric cooperative members in Branson . He argued that the state \u2019 s businesses rely on lower-cost energy and costs would rise under the EPA \u2019 s rules , which would shift Missouri \u2019 s heavy reliance on coal power to renewables and natural gas . \u201c The EPA \u2019 s Clean Power rule effectively eliminates Missouri \u2019 s competitive advantage as a low energy-cost state , \u201d Koster said according to a transcript of his speech released Friday .\nIn Kentucky , Democratic gubernatorial candidate and current Attorney General Jack Conway remains pro-coal . In his 2010 senate bid ended in defeat to incumbent Republican Sen. Rand Paul , but both men ran in support of mountaintop coal mining . He even has his pro-coal record on his campaign website . This year , he signed a letter , with other state attorneys general , to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy noting that the new ozone regulations are set at an \u201c unachievable \u201d level for his state .\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is giving states until September of 2016 to draft strategies to curb their emissions based on CPP \u2019 s goals . Some states have sued to delay the deadline , though , in September , the D.C. Court of Appeals rejected the petition .
