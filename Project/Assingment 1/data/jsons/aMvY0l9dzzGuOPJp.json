Most recently , a gene therapy treatment from Novartis was priced at a whopping $ 2.1 million .\nDespite Democrats \u2019 consensus about the problem and the broad way to solve it ( more government regulation ) , there \u2019 s disagreement among lawmakers about the best route to take .\nAlthough Pelosi \u2019 s bill is not yet finalized , she has laid out some general outlines at various caucus meetings , including some recent updates that responded to progressive pushback : According to the pieces she \u2019 s revealed so far , the bill would enable Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to negotiate on prescription drugs covered by Medicare , but a final price would be decided by the Government Accountability Office if no agreement could initially be reached .\nThat approach differs significantly from two other bills , one introduced by Rep. Ro Khanna ( D-CA ) and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) , the other by Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( D-TX ) and Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D-OH ) . Doggett and Brown \u2019 s legislation , which has garnered the support of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , would not include a GAO middle-man in negotiations . Additionally , it would enable a pharmaceutical company \u2019 s competitors to produce a generic version of a drug if a firm did not engage in negotiations fairly .\nA key difference in the Democrats \u2019 options \u2014 of involving a third party in the negotiations , even if it \u2019 s a government body \u2014 has been a point of contention , due to concerns about how this added step might make the process clunkier , while also limiting potential price reductions .\nTo top it all off , progressives argue that the process for developing this bill has been opaque \u2014 although they \u2019 ve been heartened by the latest tweaks by House Leadership , Politico reports . According to a senior Democratic aide , the heads of the two major committees with jurisdiction over the legislation have been making the rounds with different Democratic constituencies as they try to flesh out the proposal .\n\u201c We need the same type of transparency in writing drug pricing legislation as for pricing drugs , \u201d Doggett told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in a statement .\nAs lawmakers await the final version of a bill spearheaded by Pelosi , there are still outstanding questions about whether it will be ambitious enough .\nThe HHS Secretary isn \u2019 t currently allowed to negotiate prescription prices directly\nHouse Democrats \u2019 legislation , whatever form it winds up taking , is intended to address a major problem they see in the way prescription drug negotiations work .\nUnder current law , the HHS Secretary is barred from directly negotiating the prices of prescription drugs covered by Medicare , an arrangement established in 2003 as part of the Medicare Modernization Act that set up Medicare \u2019 s prescription drug benefit . Presently , private plans that offer Medicare Part D benefits negotiate drug costs independently . But they often lack the leverage to secure the kinds of reductions the government may be able to obtain , given its bargaining power .\nProponents of changing this system argue that the federal government could have significantly more sway if it was directly involved in pricing discussions , especially because Medicare beneficiaries represent roughly a third of prescription drug expenditures on an annual basis . They point to the Department of Veterans Affairs , which negotiates prescription drug prices for both retired and active troops in the US military , and is able to obtain medicines at a major discount compared to the rest of the market .\nPharmaceutical companies counter that drug prices reflect the high costs of research and development that go into producing groundbreaking medicines . And , historically , Republicans have argued that the government shouldn \u2019 t get more involved in determining prices anyway .\nIn 2016 , however , President Donald Trump signaled that he was interested in changing the 2003 law as well . At the time , Trump argued that the government needed to get involved in reducing prescription drug prices , a stance the GOP has previously pushed against .\nBecause of Trump \u2019 s position , Pelosi has repeatedly suggested that this issue is one of the few areas where Democrats could potentially work with him to get legislation through Congress . If they were successful , it \u2019 s something both Democrats and the president could tout as a substantive bipartisan achievement .\nWhat we know about the Pelosi bill \u2014 and the two big reasons it \u2019 s raised progressive ire\nAt the moment , the final version of the Pelosi bill is still in flux , though an official rollout is expected in the coming months . As HuffPost \u2019 s Zach Carter and Daniel Marans previously reported , the contours of the proposal as described during a caucus meeting in late May had spurred outcry from progressives who argued that the legislation didn \u2019 t go far enough to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable . Pelosi more recently signaled that she was making updates to the proposal in response to the critiques it \u2019 s received , the Hill \u2019 s Peter Sullivan reports .\nHere \u2019 s what we know about the speaker \u2019 s plan so far , though these pieces have not been finalized :\nIt would enable HHS Secretary Azar to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies on the prices of drugs covered by Medicare .\nIf the companies and HHS are not able to reach an agreement , the Government Accountability Office \u2014 an independent agency that conducts research and advises Congress \u2014 would help set a final price . ( This is different from a binding arbitration process that had been proposed by the House speaker in an earlier version of the measure . )\nAs a reference point for price-setting , GAO would use the median pricing for a particular drug in other countries around the world .\nThe plan is calling for negotiations that target roughly 250 drugs , though it does not cap the number of drugs that would be part of negotiations .\nIf a company does not comply with the negotiations for a particular drug , it would be penalized with an excise tax of 50 percent of its sales on the drug from the previous year .\nWhile the GAO is seen as a better option than a third-party private arbiter ( something that had been floated in prior talks ) by critics of the leadership plan , there \u2019 s a lot of unanswered questions about how exactly the body would handle this job . The GAO is usually tasked with delivering oversight and other reports on government activities , not managing government negotiations .\n\u201c If the GAO is provided with the resources to construct an in-house unit to do this , that \u2019 s definitely possible , \u201d says Rachel Sachs , a law professor at Washington University at St. Louis . George Mason University health policy professor Len Nichols agreed that GAO was \u201c certainly capable , \u201d though he noted that guidance from health economists would be crucial .\nThe role that GAO could potentially play is not the only part of the proposal that \u2019 s prompted questions , however .\nThe idea of a drug minimum has also emerged as another point of contention . Previously , Pelosi had suggested a 25-drug floor , though the speaker has since said her plan would aim to target about 250 drugs . Critics had expressed worries that any number set by the legislation would instead become a de facto maximum , and negotiations would peter out once an agreement was reached on a select number of drugs .\nAdvocates in favor of establishing a drug floor suggest that it would force the HHS secretary to engage in negotiation on a set list of drugs , at the very least , and note that there is a specific group of drugs that account for a high proportion of spending . \u201c The data show that Congress should focus Medicare price negotiations on key drugs for the same reason that Willie Sutton robbed banks ; that \u2019 s where the money is , \u201d said Ben Wakana , executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs in a statement .\nExperts on the subject also note that any prescription drug negotiations would likely have to be tested on a smaller pool before such efforts could be effectively implemented more broadly .\n\u201c The discussion should be around trying this with a limited amount of drugs to start with , then you figure out what infrastructure is needed and how it \u2019 s going to work , \u201d University of Pittsburgh health policy professor Walid Gellad tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c Even proponents of ideas that aren \u2019 t limited in any numerical fashion would agree that prioritization is important . It just won \u2019 t be possible for an administration to negotiate all drugs in the first year , \u201d says Sachs .\nBeyond the mechanics of the negotiations , one of progressives \u2019 biggest concerns is whether the bill has an adequate backstop that will ding companies with a financial penalty if they don \u2019 t comply with the process .\nCompanies that refused to participate would be slapped with a tax equal to 50 percent of their prior year \u2019 s sales of the drug . Prices on all drugs covered under Medicare Parts B and D could not be increased going forward , and any company that still did so would have 100 % of the price hike taxed away .\nDoggett \u2019 s bill , however , which has more than 100 cosponsors , takes a much more aggressive tack on the matter .\nIf companies did not treat negotiations fairly , Doggett \u2019 s bill would enable HHS to issue licenses to competitors who would be able to produce the same drug as a generic , effectively eliminating a company \u2019 s monopoly on a particular drug .\nThis approach would push companies to approach negotiations around drug pricing more seriously \u2014 and make sure that patients could still access a particular drug even if the company manufacturing it opted out of negotiations .\nAs has been the case in many clashes between progressives and House Leadership , some of the tension in recent months has been fueled by the process behind the legislation \u2019 s rollout .\nMany progressives had previously said they felt like there \u2019 s been a startling lack of communication as the bill has been developed . \u201c People have not been included , \u201d Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Mark Pocan ( D-WI ) told Politico \u2019 s Adam Cancryn in early June . \u201c There has been no process up to now . \u201d\nHouse leadership is seemingly taking more progressive feedback into account , however . This past week , Pelosi \u2019 s decision to target roughly 250 drugs is evidence of that , and it \u2019 s a move that \u2019 s since been heralded by CPC co-chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal ( D-WA ) , Politico reports .\n\u201c Leadership and the committees of jurisdiction continue to solicit feedback and incorporate ideas from across the Caucus in order to develop the strongest , boldest possible legislation to lower prescription drug prices for all Americans , \u201d Pelosi spokesperson Henry Connelly told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nDemocratic leadership has also been in talks with staffers at the White House for months , given Trump \u2019 s interest in working on the issue . It makes for some confusing optics , but some experts argue that such collaboration is vital for getting anything passed and signed into law . A senior Democratic aide told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the conversations with the White House that focus on this subject have simply been discussions and not negotiations .\nStill , the openness to working alongside Trump on the issue \u2014 even as the administration flagrantly obstructs other Democratic efforts and investigations \u2014 has prompted some on the left to question whether he even has the capacity to be a reliable partner .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s live up to that promise and not go small in an attempt to satisfy a president who can not be satisfied , \u201d Doggett has said . \u201c After Trump \u2019 s recent tantrum on infrastructure , it seems unlikely that we can count on any purported administration legislative endorsement . \u201d\nThe future of this bill is up in the air\nReducing prescription drug prices \u2014 much like tackling surprise medical bills \u2014 is an issue that has widespread voter support , which makes it more likely that something could actually make it through a divided Congress .\nAccording to a 2018 poll from Kaiser Family Foundation , 96 percent of Democrats support giving the government the ability to negotiate directly in order to reduce drug prices for those on Medicare , while 92 percent of Republicans feel the same .\nBringing drug prices down would be a clear political victory for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle . And Trump \u2019 s interest in working on this issue has provided Republicans some cover to back away from their historic position of protecting pharmaceutical business interests , says Brendan Buck , a partner at Blue Engine Media , who had previously advised former House Speaker Paul Ryan .\n\u201c The president has totally shuffled the politics on this issue in a way that \u2019 s pretty remarkable , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c The new willingness for Republicans to take on drug companies just didn \u2019 t exist five years ago . \u201d\nBuck added , however , that White House support on a bill may not be enough to win over Senate Republicans .\n\u201c I caution the idea that [ Democrats ] can work just with the White House , not because of unreliability , but just because the Senate cares a lot about this , \u201d he said , adding , \u201c There is no outcome on drug pricing that the Progressive Caucus will endorse that Mitch McConnell will put on the floor . \u201d\nThat tension has repeatedly put House Democratic leaders in a tough spot , and it could ultimately be evident in whatever bill the speaker finally unveils .\nOn the one hand , Democratic leaders are interested in securing a bipartisan win , which could mean a bill with concessions that both Trump and Republicans will accept , according to HuffPost .
