    "content": "Recent events in Ferguson , Missouri , have once again made the nation consider the durability of racial injustice as a defining factor of the American experience . Black children go to increasingly segregated schools , experience significantly less mobility than whites and are far more likely to be incarcerated for nonviolent crimes . The American dream has always been defined by upward mobility , but for black Americans , it \u2019 s harder to get into the middle class , and a middle-class lifestyle is more precarious .\nThere are numerous factors that help explain why blacks have lower levels of upward mobility , but a surprisingly unpersuasive one is family structure . Conservatives like to tout the research of Raj Chetty and others who find that , \u201c The fraction of children living in single-parent households is the single strongest correlate of upward income mobility among all the variables we explored. \u201d But this observation comes with a caveat -- children in two-parent households fare worse in areas with large numbers of single parents . There is reason to believe the causation is reversed . Rather than single-parent households causing low upward mobility , low upward mobility and rampant poverty lead to single-parenthood .\nTwo researchers from the National Bureau of Economic Research \u2014 Melissa Schettini Kearney and Phillip B. Levine \u2014 find that single motherhood is largely driven by poverty and inequality , not the other way around . They write ,\nThe combination of being poor and living in a more unequal ( and less mobile ) location , like the United States , leads young women to choose early , non-marital childbearing at elevated rates , potentially because of their lower expectations of future economic success .\nA report by the British Rowntree Foundation had a similar finding : \u201c Young people born into families in the higher socio-economic classes spend a long time in education and career training , putting off marriage and childbearing until they are established as successful adults. \u201d Women in the slow track , in contrast , face \u201c a disjointed pattern of unemployment , low-paid work and training schemes , rather than an ordered , upward career trajectory. \u201d This is largely due to \u201c truncated education . \u201d\nMost recently , Bhashkar Mazumder finds that , among those between the late 1950s and early 1980s , 50 percent of black children born into the bottom 20 percent of the income scale remained in the same position , while only 26 percent of white children born into the bottom 20 percent of the income scale remained in the same position . His research finds that the role of two-parent families for mobility is less important than conservatives assert . While living in a two-parent households increases upward mobility for blacks , it has no effect on upward mobility for white children , nor does it affect downward mobility for either race . If marriage has a significant effect , it is not marriage per se , but rather income and parenting effects that are at work ; married people by default have more incomes and more time to spend with children . The solution , then , is paid leave , universal pre-K and government-provided daycare , not wealthy conservatives clutching their pearls and chastising young people for not getting hitched .\nSo , marriage fails to explain black-white gaps in mobility . What , then , is responsible for the lack of upward mobility among blacks ?\nRacial segregation explains how it \u2019 s so easy for the black middle class to slip back into poverty . As sociologist John R. Logan writes , \u201c The most recent census data show that on average , black and Hispanic households live in neighborhoods with more than one and a half times the poverty rate of neighborhoods where the average non-Hispanic white lives. \u201d This has profound implications for upward mobility .\nA 2009 study by Patrick Sharkey finds that , \u201c Neighborhood poverty alone accounts for a greater portion of the black-white downward mobility gap than the effects of parental education , occupation , labor force participation , and a range of other family characteristics combined. \u201d Sharkley finds that if black and white children grew up in similar environments , the downward mobility gap would shrink by 25-to-33 percent . As the chart below shows , black children are far more likely to grow up in high poverty disadvantaged neighborhoods , which makes upward mobility difficult . ( Source )\nThe war on drugs disproportionately targets people of color : One in 12 working-age African-American men are incarcerated . While whites and blacks use and sell drugs at similar rates , African-Americans comprise 74 percent of those imprisoned for drug possession . The U.S. prison population grew by 700 percent between 1970 and 2005 , while the general population grew only 44 percent . The effects of incarceration on upward mobility are profound .\nBruce Western finds that , \u201c by age 48 , the typical former inmate will have earned $ 179,000 less than if he had never been incarcerated. \u201d This impact , however , is more profound for blacks . Western finds that incarceration reduces lifetime earnings for whites by 2 percent , but Hispanics and blacks by 6 percent and 9 percent , respectively . All of this means that men who are incarcerated will live a life at the bottom . For men who begin life in the lowest income quintile , only 2 percent of those who are incarcerated will make it into the top fifth , while 15 percent of those who are not incarcerated will .\nIn `` When Work Disappears , '' Harvard sociologist William Julius Wilson points to the importance of occupational segregation -- the fact that African-Americans who are often concentrated in poor urban areas struggle to get jobs in the suburbs or places with a long commute . Only 2.9 percent of white workers rely on public transportation , compared to 8.3 percent of Latino workers and 11.5 percent percent of black workers .\nAn excellent example of occupational segregation is in Silicon Valley , where data released after pressure from advocacy groups like Color of Change suggests that at Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , Yahoo , Google and eBay , only 3 to 4 percent of workers are black or Hispanic . However , a study by Working Partnerships USA finds that , \u201c While Blacks and Latinos make up only 3 to 4 percent of the disclosed companies \u2019 core tech workforce , they are 41 percent of all private security guards in Silicon Valley , 72 percent of all janitorial and building cleaning workers , and 76 percent of all grounds maintenance workers. \u201d ( Source )\nMuch of the problem is social networks . Recent research by Nancy DiTomaso finds that favoritism perpetuates inequality , even in the absence of racial bias . She finds that most employees relied on social networks to obtain a majority of the jobs they held in their lifetime . Because social networks tend to be segregated , this fosters occupational segregation . Miles Corak shows that many children get their first job through their parents , further solidifying the effect of social networks on occupational segregation .\nMarianne Bertrand finds that changing the names on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to those that are traditionally white or black affects call-backs for jobs . White-sounding names were 50 percent more likely to get called for an initial interview . She also finds that whites with better r\u00e9sum\u00e9s were 30 percent more likely to get a call-back than whites with worse r\u00e9sum\u00e9s , but for blacks , more experience only increased call-backs by 9 percent . Another barrier to employment can be social networks .\nWealth is an important part of a middle-class lifestyle . When a family or individual is struck with illness or the loss of a job , wealth provides support . When a child attends college or is trying to get on his or her feet , a family with wealth can help pay the bills . The large wealth gaps between black families and white families , then , helps explain why black families have such high levels of downward mobility . The recently released Survey of Consumer Finances allows us an opportunity to examine wealth gaps . Matt Bruenig finds that , \u201c The median white family has a net worth of $ 134,000 . The median Hispanic family has a net worth of $ 14,000 . The median black family has a net worth of $ 11,000 . \u201d\nBetween 2007 and 2010 , all racial groups lost large amounts of wealth . However , the effects fell disproportionately on Hispanics and blacks , who saw a 44 percent and 31 percent reduction in wealth , compared to an 11 percent drop for whites . This was due to blacks and Latinos disproportionately receiving subprime loans , both because of outright lending discrimination and housing segregation . A recent research brief by the Institution on Assets and Social Policy finds that the wealth gap between white families and African-Americans has tripled between 1984 and 2009 . They find five main factors responsible for driving the gap , which together explain 66 percent of the growth in inequality . The factors , in order of importance , are number of years of homeownership , household income , unemployment , college education and financial support or inheritance\nThe U.S. increasingly has a two-tiered education system , with students of color trapped in underfunded schools . ( Source ) A recent study finds that , \u201c schools with 90 percent or more students of color spend a full $ 733 less per student per year than schools with 90 percent or more white students . \u201d\nSchools today are becoming more segregated , rather than less segregated . The average white student attends a school that is 72.5 percent white and 8.3 percent black , while the average black student attends a school that is only 27.6 percent white , but is 48.8 percent black . These schools are underfunded and understaffed . In 2001 , the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit after 18 public schools had \u201c literature classes without books , \u201d computer classes where students discuss what they would do if they had computers , \u201c classes without regular teachers \u201d and classes without enough seats where students stood in the back .\nMazumder finds that student scores on the Armed Forces Qualification Test ( a comprehensive test taken toward the last few years of high school ) can help explain differences in upward mobility between blacks and whites . He also finds that completing 16 years of education is a crucial factor in upward mobility . The fact that AFQT scores help predict upward mobility is often used by those who argue that racial differences in intelligence largely explain differences in upward mobility . However , since the AFQT is taken in high school , a better explanation is that differences in AFQT scores represent the combined impacts of poverty , bad schools , wealth gaps , substandard healthcare and segregated employment opportunities working together to reduce long-term mobility .\nThe idea that there are biological factors reducing upward mobility for African-Americans is both odious and entirely false . As Nathaniel Hendren told me when discussing his research ,\nWe can absolutely reject that theory . In order to believe that theory , you have to believe that the spacial differences across the U.S. are differences in some kind of transmission of genes . Suppose you move from one area to another and you have a kid . Does your kid pick up the mobility characteristics of the place you go to ? Now obviously , your genes don \u2019 t change when you move . What we find is that kids start to pick up the mobility characteristics of the place they move to , and they do so in the proportion to the amount of time they end up spending in that place . The majority of the differences across places are casual . If people lived in different places , they would have different outcomes .\nThis all leads to the saddest conclusion -- were it not for poorly conceived policies , we could have more upward mobility in the U.S . While conservatives like to point at cultural factors and throw up their hands , a far more productive solution is to redress our massive public policy problems -- like the war on drugs and dropout mill schools -- that are proven to reduce upward mobility .\nThe conservative mind-set is ahistorical -- we are told to throw away the legacy of slavery and segregation and expect blacks to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps , ignoring the structural dynamics keeping them down . Research by Graziella Bertocchi and Arcangelo Dimico finds that counties with higher concentrations of slave ownership in 1870 had higher levels of poverty and racial inequality in 2000 . Matthew Blackwell finds that Southerners who live in counties with higher levels of slave ownership in 1860 express more racial resentment and are more likely to oppose affirmative action . As Marx noted , \u201c Men make their own history , but they do not make it as they please ; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances , but under circumstances existing already , given and transmitted from the past . The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living . \u201d",
