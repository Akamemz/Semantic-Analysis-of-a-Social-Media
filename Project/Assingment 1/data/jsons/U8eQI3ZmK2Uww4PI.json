It marked the second time in a week \u2014 and certainly not the last \u2014 that the House has targeted President Barack Obama 's law , with Republicans confident that Americans ' unease with the overhaul will produce major GOP wins in the November elections .\nSome of the most vulnerable Democrats facing re-election this fall from Arizona , Georgia , New York and Florida voted for the bill . Last week , 67 Democrats bucked the administration and backed a bill to bolt new security requirements on the law .\nThe bill would require the administration to report weekly on the number of visits to the government healthcare website , the number of Americans who applied and the number of enrollees by ZIP code , as well as other statistics . It stands no chance in the Democratic-led Senate .\nThe administration has reported monthly on enrollment , announcing last week that 2.2 million signed up through the end of December and nearly 4 million had been deemed eligible for Medicaid .\n`` We know the president 's healthcare law is driving up costs for middle-class families , making it harder for small businesses to hire , and hurting the economy , but there 's still a lot we do n't know , '' said House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , contending that the administration `` has n't provided a clear picture of where enrollment stands .
