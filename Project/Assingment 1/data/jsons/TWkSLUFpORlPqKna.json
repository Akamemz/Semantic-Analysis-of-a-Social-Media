''\nBut then there is the camp that ensured that the Republican platform included language rejecting not just same-sex marriage but also the watered-down alternative that many elected officials find more palatable : civil unions . The GOP platform committee also defeated a proposed amendment that said all Americans should be treated `` equally under the law '' as long as they 're not hurting anyone else .\nKansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach , who is known for his immigration hard-line , implied that it was fine to treat gays and lesbians differently because : `` Our government routinely judges situations where you might regard people completely affecting themselves like , for example , the use of controlled substances , like , for example , polygamy that is voluntarily entered into .

Many political observers see Mitt Romney 's choice of spending hawk Paul Ryan as his running mate as pretty strong evidence that this view is prevailing at the top of the ticket .\nBut then there is the group that ca n't seem to resist the catnip of social conservatism and that charges into the abortion debate . The platform also includes an across-the-board ban on all abortions , even in the case of rape or incest .
