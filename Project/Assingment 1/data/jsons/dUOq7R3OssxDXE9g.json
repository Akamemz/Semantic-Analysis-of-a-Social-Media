Although military men and women have been taking stands on specific issues and running for office for centuries , Defense Department officials and a host of retired generals say the attacks have become personal , bitter and harmful to the armed forces \u2019 reputation as an apolitical organization that , above all else , respects the chain of command and puts country over politics .\nObservers say the process began with retired Navy Adm. William J. Crowe \u2019 s endorsement of Bill Clinton in 1992 and has spiraled out of control . They warn that partisanship could do lasting damage to Americans \u2019 faith in the military .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not normal . I don \u2019 t think it does the U.S. military any good , \u201d said retired Army Gen. Thomas Spoehr , director of the conservative Heritage Foundation \u2019 s Center for National Defense . \u201c If you have senior military officers expressing partisan views , I think it has the potential to jeopardize the amazing trust the American people convey to their military . \u201d\nMr. Spoehr and other retired generals interviewed by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 say there is plenty of blame to go around , including for President Trump , who has criticized military officers by name in a way never seen before .\nOver the past several months , the president has taken aim at retired Navy Adm. William H. McRaven \u2014 the architect of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden \u2014 by saying he should have caught the al Qaeda mastermind sooner .\nMr. Trump also blasted former Defense Secretary James N. Mattis , the former Marine Corps general who resigned last month amid a policy disagreement over U.S. involvement in Syria and Afghanistan .\n\u201c What \u2019 s he done for me ? How had he done in Afghanistan ? Not too good , \u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Mattis during a Cabinet meeting last week .\nThe president also has engaged in a bitter feud with retired Army Gen. Stanley M. McChrystal , who said last week that he believes Mr. Trump is immoral and doesn \u2019 t tell the truth .\nMr. Trump responded by saying Gen. McChrystal is known for his \u201c big , dumb mouth . \u201d\nAnalysts and retired officers say the president \u2019 s role in the erosion of the line between the military and politics can not be ignored .\nThey point to retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn as a pivotal figure in that erosion . The outspoken Trump supporter attacked Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Republican National Convention and led chants of \u201c lock her up \u201d in front of a raucous crowd . Now , he is awaiting sentencing as part of special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation into Russian collusion with the Trump campaign .\nAlthough Mr. Flynn made the remarks , there is a belief that Mr. Trump \u2019 s sharp tone has helped pull some retired officers into the political muck .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s certainly highlighted by the operating style of this president , \u201d said retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula , dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies . \u201c I think the manner in which the current president acts does elicit some of the responses you \u2019 re seeing . \u201d\nOther analysts say Mr. Trump \u2019 s apparent willingness to disregard the advice of his military advisers \u2014 for example , deciding to withdraw troops from Syria and deploying forces to the U.S.-Mexico border over the objections of Pentagon leaders \u2014 has spurred the backlash .\n\u201c Today , the politicization process is on steroids , \u201d Gordon Adams , a professor at American University \u2019 s School of International Service , wrote in a recent blog post . \u201c It is not that officers have suddenly gone rogue . It is because this president arrived in office untethered . Trump is the accelerant . \u201d\nMr. Trump , however , also has been the target of unprecedented attacks . Retired generals and other military and intelligence officials regularly parade across cable TV to assail the commander in chief on personal and policy levels .\nJust days before midterm elections in November , retired Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , railed against the president \u2019 s decision to send troops to the southern border . Critics interpreted his remarks as encouragement for voters to support Democrats .\n\u201c Our men and women in uniform are better trained , better equipped , and better led so they meet any threat with confidence , \u201d Mr. Dempsey tweeted Nov. 1 . \u201c A wasteful deployment of over-stretched Soldiers and Marines would be made much worse if they use force disproportional to the threat they face . They won \u2019 t . \u201d\nMr. Dempsey \u2019 s comments , along with the words and actions of Mr. McChrystal , Mr. Flynn and other retired officers , are part of a troubling trend of well-respected military men and women using their authoritative voices to influence the political process , observers say .\n\u201c I was disappointed and , frankly , surprised that Gen.
