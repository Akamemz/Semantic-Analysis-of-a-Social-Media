    "content": "In a sign that he is seriously considering a run for president , Ohio Gov . John Kasich says he is studying up on foreign policy and making his views known on the urgency of tackling the Islamic State threat . `` You will not solve this problem with only air power , '' Kasich told The Washington Post as he prepared for a trip to the early-voting state of South Carolina . `` There needs to be a coalition of NATO , Arab states , and ultimately some boots on the ground to stop the advancement of that group . '' He said that the West and the Arab world `` need to get serious about stopping this kind of radicalism . If not , it will continue to spread and just bombing is imposing the status quo at best . `` Kasich emphasized that he backs targeted , multinational strikes instead of a prolonged war against Iraq-based jihadists.He said dealing with the ISIS threat `` is probably something that can be addressed without an extended affair and without nation-building or any of that . `` Kasich 's comments appear to place him somewhere in the middle of the Republican Party when it comes to U.S. involvement abroad , in between strong supporters like Arizona Sen. John McCain and skeptics like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.On Wednesday , he is scheduled to arrive in South Carolina , home to GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham , who is reportedly considering a run for president next year . Like his close political ally McCain , Graham favors a robust U.S. role abroad and is sharply critical of the Obama administration 's handling of foreign policy.In his interview with the Post , Kasich noted that during his 18 years in the House of Representatives , he served on the Armed Services Committee , `` dealing largely with military operations , as well as how you use them and when you use them . `` The governor added that in recent weeks , he has discussed foreign policy with veteran Washington hands like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania congressman Robert Walker , among others.Kasich ( not a consistent backer of increased Pentagon spending during his nine terms in Congress ) said he understands the concerns some Republicans have about some defense projects . Kasich noted that more than 30 years ago he voted against sending U.S. Marines to Lebanon for what turned out to be an ill-fated peacekeeping mission.After Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 , however , Kasich voted for President George H.W . Bush 's plan to send troops to drive Iraqi forces out of that country . `` I do n't like the idea of getting involved in civil wars and I 've always been a military reformer who is interested in special forces and using technology in better ways , '' Kasich said .",
