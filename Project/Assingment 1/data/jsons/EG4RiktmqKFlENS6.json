Its impact will be long-lasting .\nWest \u2019 s gospel revival coincides with his political independence . So far , this is West \u2019 s most powerful statement since supporting President Trump and wearing a MAGA cap in public . By reviving his faith in the word of God and the independence of black Americana gospel , he forces others to remember the moral foundation of the civil-rights movement , which has been forgotten and deliberately disregarded by fervent secular liberals . ( It was at a high pitch during the funerals that turned the spiritual transitions of Aretha Franklin and Elijah Cummings into shameless political rallies . )\nThrongs of fans and worshipers taking part in West \u2019 s various Sunday Services concerts across the country over the past year are vividly documented in the 38-minute film Jesus Is King . ( The IMAX visual emphasis on land , sky , and clouds evokes George Stevens \u2019 s 70 mm The Greatest Story Ever Told . ) When worshipers sing the lyric \u201c He walked with my mother / I want Him to walk with me , \u201d the song \u2019 s emotional resonance recalls the faith of generations \u2014 from before the sea change of black politics \u2019 bitter alignment with the tenets of Communist atheism .\nThe beautiful essence of Jesus Is King is its non-bitterness . Despite private struggle and public pushback ( \u201c Before the flood , they did the same to Noah \u201d ) , West has realized a way to avoid and confound liberal media \u2019 s trap : the promotion of black bitterness as the core of African-American self-realization . Jesus Is King is a spiritual work thanks to its deep feeling \u2014 pure expression brought to today \u2019 s calamitous social condition . The album rejects any recourse to political solutions . West \u2019 s personal movement , and the public convocation of his Sunday Services , is clearly against the politics of division .\nAmerica \u2019 s \u2019 50s\u2013 \u2018 60s civil-rights movement was based on righteousness \u2014 justice and virtue were understood as moral measures learned from the Church , not social license . That \u2019 s what gave the fire-hosed marchers and lunch-counter martyrs their courage . While West has always defied the commonplace worldly sentiments of hip-hop culture ( letting the preppie image oppose the street-thug image yet still flashing bling ) , Jesus Is King shows maturity .

Kanye answers it in defiant gospel songs that explore sustenance . \u201c Closed on Sunday \u201d wittily boasts , \u201c Don \u2019 t let them indoctrinate / closed on Sunday / You my Chick-fil-A . . . / No more livin \u2019 for the culture / We nobody \u2019 s slaves . \u201d\nIn \u201c On God \u201d ( or is it \u201c en garde \u201d ? ) he raps , \u201c 13th Amendment ended / That \u2019 s on me. \u201d He refines his TMZ meme \u201c Slavery was a choice \u201d that was deliberately misunderstood by many . Rejecting the grip of history and the fetish that politicians have made of slavery , it comes down to being a song about self-reliance as a personal choice , thus a song of greater political faith than any that Paul Robeson or Pete Seeger ever sang .\nNone of the many negative reviews of Jesus Is King are convincing . They all emanate from the seat of scoffers \u2014 the \u201c smart \u201d folk who are beyond religion , committed to liberal-Democrat agnosticism , and resentful of everything else . They accuse West of a mental disorder to explain his support of Christianity and President Trump . The hatefulness of these assertions is surpassed only by their literal tone-deafness ; they can \u2019 t hear how lovely this music is .\nThe album opens with \u201c Every Hour , \u201d a short series of staccato praise shouts derived from the Southwestern Michigan State Choir \u2019 s mighty recording \u201c Write My Name Above , \u201d where the lead singer implored , \u201c I need you every hour / I need your cleansing power. \u201d It \u2019 s followed by \u201c Selah , \u201d the album \u2019 s first climax , featuring a black gospel \u201c Hallelujah \u201d chorus .
