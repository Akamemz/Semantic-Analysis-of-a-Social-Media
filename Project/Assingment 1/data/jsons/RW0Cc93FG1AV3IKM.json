It attracted some Republican votes by increasing penalties for anyone convicted of material support for terrorism and by making it possible for intelligence agencies to keep tracking suspected terrorists for 72 hours after they enter the country before needing a warrant .\nThe measure faces a more uncertain future in the Senate , where a similar bill failed by two votes to overcome a filibuster last year . But because the legal authority for domestic bulk data collection expires on June 1 , Congress faces a deadline that is likely to prompt it to take at least some action rather than let the program disappear altogether .\nThe bulk collection program , authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act , generated some of the fiercest criticism after Mr. Snowden revealed details about it in 2013 . The N.S.A . cast the widest possible net for call data by forcing the major phone companies , under a secret court order , to pour their data directly into government computers . But what the government received was only \u201c metadata \u201d \u2014 phone numbers called , as well as the duration and time of calls , but not the content of the conversations .\nUnder the new legislation , the government would no longer be allowed to keep a database of that information and would be limited to obtaining data from the telecommunications companies when there is a \u201c reasonable , articulable suspicion \u201d that a \u201c specific selection term \u201d used to request data is associated with international terrorism , according to an analysis by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a civil liberties advocacy group .\nThe foundation \u2019 s analysis said the bill \u201c should end \u201d the bulk collection of \u201c everybody \u2019 s phone records. \u201d But it pointed out that the N.S.A . could still search for records beyond telephone data with fewer restrictions .
