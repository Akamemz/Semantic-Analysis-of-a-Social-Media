    "content": "President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be briefed Friday on a report prepared by the U.S. intelligence community on Russian hacking activities in the presidential election -- after he spent this week still questioning the veracity of their previous assessments .\nOn Thursday , President Obama received a briefing on the report -- prepared by the CIA , FBI and NSA -- which he had ordered in December . Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday that an unclassified version of the report will be made public early next week . In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday , Clapper previewed some of the report \u2019 s findings .\n\u201c Hacking was only part of it , \u201d he said about Russia \u2019 s cyber activities during the election . \u201c It also entailed classical propaganda , disinformation , fake news . \u201d\nClapper will be one of four intelligence chiefs to brief Mr. Trump on the report Friday at Trump Tower in New York . The other briefers will be CIA Director John Brennan , FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers .\nFor weeks , the president-elect has been questioning the U.S. intelligence community \u2019 s integrity and its assessment that Russia not only launched cyberattacks against the U.S. to sow doubt in the election , but to sway the outcome in favor of Mr. Trump . Since the final weeks of the campaign , he also doubted that Russia was responsible .\nMr. Trump claimed on New Year \u2019 s Eve that he had information no one else had on Russian hacking and that he would reveal it publicly this week , but he has not yet followed through on that statement . On Wednesday , he posted a tweet indicating he \u2019 s still not convinced Russia is to blame for cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) , other political groups and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign chairman John Podesta .\nThe `` Intelligence '' briefing on so-called `` Russian hacking '' was delayed until Friday , perhaps more time needed to build a case . Very strange ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 4 , 2017\nA number of Republicans in Congress like Rep. Michael McCaul , R-Texas , chairman of the Homeland Security Committee , are adamant about the need for the new administration to develop a more clear-cut cyber policy and to punish Russia for its actions .

John McCain , R-Arizona , and other Republicans warned at his committee \u2019 s hearing that Russia must suffer the consequences .\n\u201c Every American should be alarmed by Russia \u2019 s attacks on our nation , \u201d said McCain . Later in the day , he told reporters that the Trump administration should work with Congress to craft a cyber policy .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll be glad to work with them , but they \u2019 ve got to have a policy and a strategy , \u201d he said as he continued to blast the Obama administration for lacking a plan . \u201c They \u2019 ve never had one . They \u2019 ve reacted to every single attack in a different way . It \u2019 s just crazy . \u201d\nClapper , Rogers and undersecretary of defense for intelligence , Marcel Lettre , issued a joint statement Thursday , warning that Russia is a \u201c full-scope cyber actor . \u201d\n\u201c We assess that only Russia \u2019 s senior-most officials could have authorized the recent election-focused data thefts and disclosures , based of the scope and sensitivity of the targets . Russia also has used cyber tactics and techniques to seek to influence public opinion across Europe and Eurasia , \u201d they said . \u201c Looking forward , Russian cyber operations will likely target the United States to gather intelligence , support Russian decision-making , conduct influence operations to support Russian military and political objectives , and prepare the cyber environment for future contingencies . \u201d\nLast week , the Obama administration announced a new series of sanctions against Russian intelligence agents and entities that the U.S. says were responsible for hacks into the DNC and other servers . In addition to the targeted sanctions , 35 Russian operatives were expelled from the U.S. in retaliation .\nSen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , said those actions weren \u2019 t good enough and had some advice for the president-elect : \u201c When you listen to these people [ in the intelligence community , ] you can be skeptical , but you have to understand they \u2019 re the best among us . \u201d\n\u201c I think what Obama did was throw a pill . I \u2019 m ready to throw a rock , \u201d Graham said . \u201c If we don \u2019 t throw rocks , we \u2019 re going to make a huge mistake . \u201d\nOver the next week , Sen.
