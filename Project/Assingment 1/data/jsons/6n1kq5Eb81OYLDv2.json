A White House-led partnership , Operation Warp Speed , allocated almost $ 10 billion to the effort , and as much as $ 1.2 billion has been promised on a single vaccine candidate .\nPharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca pledged to have at least 300 million doses for the USA delivered as early as October \u2013 probably even before a vaccine is approved .\nIn an effort to cut through some of the hyperbole and get a realistic sense of when a vaccine will be widely available , \u2588\u2588\u2588 created a panel of nationally known experts in medicine , virology , immunology , logistics and supply chain issues to estimate how far we are from a coronavirus vaccine . Every month , these experts will track progress and highlight inevitable setbacks .\nIf you think of it as a clock ticking from midnight ( when the pandemic began ) to noon ( when vaccines will be widely available in the USA and life returns to something approaching normal ) , then as of June , the panel said it \u2019 s about 4 a.m .\n\u201c The sun has not yet peeked over the horizon , but the horizon glows in the East . We are no longer in darkness , \u201d said Dr. Kelly Moore , associate director of immunization education with the Immunization Action Coalition .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 vaccine panel is designed to offer readers an objective , nonpartisan understanding of how close we are to getting an effective vaccine distributed to the nation \u2019 s residents .

But for a vaccine to end up in a pharmacy or doctor 's office near you , companies will have to produce hundreds of millions of doses , then deliver them across the country and eventually the world .\nFor June , 11 panelists answered our timeline question . Their answers fell between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. , with a median of 4 a.m. \u2013 the point where half of the answers were earlier and half were later .\nThe majority said progress on coronavirus vaccines is remarkably far along as scientists work 24/7 on ways to end the pandemic .\n\u2018 The brightest minds in the world are in this fight , and they are moving with an incredible sense of urgency , \u201d said Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath , president and CEO of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization , a trade group .\nIn a historic and global effort , the basic science behind dozens of vaccine development efforts has mostly been finished in the six months since the virus first appeared .\n\u201c The vaccine candidates are largely in hand , \u201d said Dr. William Schaffner , a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University .\nThe global effort has been stellar , said Florian Krammer , a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City .\n\u201c I have never seen science move so fast , \u201d he said .\nThough the science to come up with candidate vaccines was hard , it wasn \u2019 t insurmountable , given advances in genetics , virology and immunology .\n\u201c Science has provided cutting-edge technologies that were not possible a decade ago , \u201d said Prakash Nagarkatti , an immunologist and vice president for research for the University of South Carolina .\nMany of the vaccines in the pipeline rely on new technologies whose underlying science is understood , although the actual techniques are being worked out .\nHaving a vaccine for just the USA wo n't protect us , said Erica Ollmann Saphire , a structural biologist and professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology .\nThe important date isn \u2019 t when the first person in the USA can go to the doctor \u2019 s office and get the first shot .
