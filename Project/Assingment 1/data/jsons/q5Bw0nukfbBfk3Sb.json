America and China 's dream\nForty five years ago as a high school senior , I stood on street corners handing out literature for Senator Robert F. Kennedy \u2019 s run for president . I listened to him quote Shaw and say , \u201c Some see things as they are and say why , I dream things that never were and say why not. \u201d I believed that his vision would bring a prosperous and peaceful America .\nLast February I stood with Chinese President , Xi Jinping - he was then vice president - at a luncheon and I experienced a new kind of Chinese leader . I presented him with a photo album of his father \u2019 s 1980 American visit hosted by our organization . The photos showed a Chinese delegation of provincial governors and party secretaries , led by his father , visiting the United States right after the historic \u201c opening \u201d of China and eager to understand the American dream as they met with leaders and ordinary Americans across the United States .\nRather than simply saying thanks and putting the book aside , he opened it and we discussed each picture . He told me who each Chinese leader was , asked where the pictures were taken and who each American was . It was unscripted , human , extended far beyond the allocated time and showed a Chinese leader willing to expose his human side . Today when President Xi speaks of his \u201c Chinese dream , \u201d I \u2019 m reminded of that time 45 years ago when RFK talked about that dream . Like RFK , President Xi dreams of poverty alleviation , national rejuvenation , and freedom from corruption .\nHis message is to not repeat the mistakes of history , to not allow historic great power rivalries to dictate our future . This weekend , when President Obama meets President Xi in California , they will have the first opportunity to define that concept together and see if they can dream things that never were and ask why not .\nWe have already begun to see the outlines of Xi \u2019 s China dream . On the domestic front , Premier Li Keqiang , in a speech delivered to senior party leaders , committed to an aggressive agenda for economic reform , pledging to reduce government involvement in the economy and allowing market forces to play a greater role in guiding economic growth and increasing investment and innovation .\nThe National Development and Reform Commission proposed an absolute cap on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as a cap on coal consumption . Additionally , Xi \u2019 s elevation of substance over form , his decision to follow in the footsteps of Deng Xiaoping \u2019 s 1992 Southern trip by visiting Shenzhen ( which relaunched economic reform ) , and his anti-corruption drive , all combine to demonstrate his commitment to reform .\nInternationally , China is becoming the responsible stakeholder that Robert Zoellick called for in his speech before our National Committee in 2005 . Unequivocal statements that a denuclearized Korean peninsula is China \u2019 s first priority , vastly improved military-to-military relations between our countries , commitment to establish standards for cyber hacking and progress on long-stalled discussions regarding diligence by auditors on Chinese listed companies show progress on issues long stalled .\nXi \u2019 s dream is about reform , and Obama should do all that he can do to help him achieve the reform he seeks . As a first step , Obama and Xi should announce the commencement of negotiations for a free trade agreement with a three-year deadline for conclusion . Just as WTO accession helped Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji reform China , a free trade pact would do the same , as well as add jobs here in America .\nThey should also enliven the negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty and set a one-year deadline for completion . Bilateral investment will play an increasingly important role in this new great power relationship . To jump start a major Chinese investment in the U.S. , Obama should also pledge to authorize exports of shale gas to China . Construction of the terminals and extraction of the gas will create American jobs , reduce China \u2019 s reliance on imported energy and coal , reduce China \u2019 s CO2 emissions , and improve its environment .\nThe protection of intellectual property must be a top priority in a new great power relationship because both sides require it . In order to achieve an innovation society , China knows it must protect intellectual property . For the U.S. , theft of its citizen \u2019 s intellectual property makes it difficult to believe that China is committed to a truly new relationship . The presidents should establish a bilateral task force to agree on specific policies that will ensure greater protection for intellectual property .\nFinally , the presidents should announce that Obama will visit China within the next twelve months and during that visit he will directly address the Chinese people about his vision of the future for America and U.S.-China relations .
