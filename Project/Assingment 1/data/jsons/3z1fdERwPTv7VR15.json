I bet we could count on one hand\u2014or more likely , on no hands\u2014the number of conservative commentators who were insisting that the Bush White House should come clean about what Scooter Libby did in relation to the Valerie Plame matter . But now , suddenly , Barack Obama must come clean on all particulars , or he \u2019 s , you guessed it , the dreaded Nixon ! Of course , Nixon wasn \u2019 t always the dreaded Nixon , because to the conservatives of the early 1970s who agreed 110 percent with Tricky Dick \u2019 s claims of executive privilege , he was the heroic , stalwart Nixon . It \u2019 s only when a Democrat is in , apparently , that democracy itself is on the line .\nDemocrats and liberals do the same thing to some extent when the situations are reversed , sure . But only to an extent . The ease of movement from sarcophagal stonewalling to high dudgeon is a peculiarly right-wing trait , because it \u2019 s the right that started the modern-day sense that you \u2019 re either on the team or in the shithouse . You might think in some dark , private space that Benghazi is mostly smoke , but if you \u2019 re trying to make your bones as part of the right-wing noise machine , you know to keep those doubts to yourself .\nI can name you a number of liberal columnists who thought in 1998 that Bill Clinton had disgraced his office and who wrote absolutely scabrously of him , even calling for his resignation .
