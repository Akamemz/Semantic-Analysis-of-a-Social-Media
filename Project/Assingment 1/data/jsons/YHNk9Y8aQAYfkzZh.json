    "content": "President Trump \u2019 s advisers are reportedly having a big internal debate over whether the US should pull out of the Paris climate deal \u2014 the key international treaty to address global warming .\nDuring the campaign , Trump promised to \u201c cancel \u201d the deal , and senior adviser Stephen Bannon wants him to follow through immediately , reports Coral Davenport of the New York Times . On the other side , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Ivanka Trump are urging Trump to keep the US in the treaty , fearing that an abrupt withdrawal would have \u201c broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications . \u201d\nBut there are a few important nuances to this issue worth drawing out . If Trump does decide to walk away from Paris , pay attention to how he does it \u2014 since that could influence whether countries like India or Brazil end up paring back their climate efforts in response . Conversely , if Trump ends up sticking with Paris , we \u2019 ll have to see if the US waters down its various promises under the accord \u2014 and also how the State Department approaches negotiations on the treaty \u2019 s future in the years ahead . Because that , too , could undermine the accord .\n1 ) If Trump decides to leave the Paris deal , how does he do it ?\nUnder the Paris climate deal , nearly every nation put forward an individual pledge to curb greenhouse gas emissions . The US vowed to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 . China vowed to get 20 percent of its energy from low-carbon sources by 2030 . And so on . Countries also agreed to meet regularly and review and strengthen their pledges , known as \u201c nationally determined contributions \u201d ( NDCs ) .\nBut the Paris accord isn \u2019 t a legally binding treaty \u2014 it hasn \u2019 t been ratified by the Senate , and it \u2019 s effectively voluntary . So if Trump wanted , he has a few options for pulling out , each more drastic than the last .\nOne possibility would be for Trump to invoke the Paris accord \u2019 s formal withdrawal mechanisms , which would take four years to complete . Or , more radically , the US could pull out of the underlying United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , which would take just one year to do and signal that the US is withdrawing from all international efforts on climate change .\nEither option would be seismic . \u201c If they pull out altogether , \u201d Light says , \u201c the chances increase that developing countries like Brazil or India back away from their own commitments and say , \u2018 Why should we bother doing this if the world \u2019 s biggest historical emitter is completely out of the game now ? \u2019 \u201d\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean other countries would leave the deal , too \u2014 China and India have their own reasons for acting on global warming \u2014 but a US withdrawal could well blunt the global momentum on climate action that has been building the past few years .\nNow , if Trump opts for withdrawal , he \u2019 s likely to face all sorts of international condemnation and blowback . Europe , China , and other countries could threaten to withhold cooperation on issues the US cares about . Maybe Trump wouldn \u2019 t care . But it \u2019 s also possible , as Sen. Bob Corker ( R-TN ) hinted to the Times , that Trump will decide it \u2019 s smarter to just keep the US in the Paris deal . After all , the individual pledges are voluntary . There \u2019 s no concrete harm in hanging around . Why not ?\n2 ) If Trump sticks with Paris , does he revise the US pledges downward ?\nOkay , now imagine Trump decides to stay in the Paris accord . After the initial fanfare subsides , there \u2019 s the crucial question of whether the Trump administration would try to fulfill any of the Obama administration \u2019 s commitments under the deal \u2014 including the pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 .\nOdds are , they wouldn \u2019 t . Trump has already vowed to repeal many of Obama \u2019 s climate policies , including the Clean Power Plan to curtail emissions from power plants as well as various regulations around methane leaks from oil and gas operations . That will make it nearly impossible to meet Obama \u2019 s pledge .\nSo one very real possibility is that the Trump administration simply revises the US emissions goal downward \u2014 something they have the legal right to do ( though it would flout the spirit of the accord , which aims to enhance ambition over time ) . A move like that might , in turn , lead other countries to reconsider their own climate plans . If the United States isn \u2019 t taking its pledge seriously , why should they ?\nOn top of that , a core part of the Paris deal involves the US pledging $ 3 billion in aid to poorer countries to help them expand clean energy and adapt to droughts , sea-level rise , and other ravages of global warming . The Obama administration already chipped in $ 1 billion . But Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration have insisted they have no intention of delivering the rest .\nSome experts think that Trump abandoning US commitments on aid could be nearly as damaging to international climate efforts as withdrawing from Paris altogether . \u201c For the developing countries , this will be a sign that America is unreliable and that the benefits of staying engaged in climate negotiations are fleeting , \u201d writes David Victor , a political scientist with the University of California San Diego .\nThat said , Light thinks this outcome could prove less disruptive than total withdrawal : Say Trump stayed in Paris , revised down the US targets , and dismantled the Clean Power Plan . Even then , Light points out , there \u2019 d still be enough action from states and cities that you could imagine the US making at least some headway on emissions , even if far less than Obama promised . \u201c And that would still leave the possibility that the US could rebound [ on climate action ] after one term of Trump , \u201d he says .\n3 ) If Trump sticks with Paris , how might US negotiators shape future agreements ?\nThe 2015 Paris deal was only a first step in the long , grinding process of dealing with climate change \u2014 and a woefully inadequate step at that . If you add up all the NDCs worldwide , they don \u2019 t come close to keeping us below 2\u00b0C of global warming . They add up to a severe 3\u00b0C or more , depending on which analysis you trust :\nThe hope with the Paris accord was that these individual national pledges would be strengthened over time , as countries cooperated and pushed each other to pursue deeper emissions cuts . So a key question here is what role US climate negotiators might play in this ratcheting process .\nFor example : Over the next two years , negotiators are meeting at the UN to hash out rules around how to review individual country pledges and policies . This \u201c transparency mechanism \u201d could prove a contentious subject . The Bush and Obama administrations had long pushed for strict , uniform transparency standards . China and various developing nations , by contrast , have in the past preferred a \u201c bifurcated \u201d system that holds them to somewhat looser reporting requirements .\nIf Trump does stay in Paris , will the US try to hold China and other developing countries to the strictest transparency standards possible ? And if so , how much leverage will the US really have here if we \u2019 re also reneging on our emissions targets and aid promises elsewhere ? ( Obviously , if the US leaves Paris entirely , it won \u2019 t have any leverage over transparency . )\nThis sounds like an obscure issue , but for many observers it \u2019 s critical . After all , climate change is a collective action problem . Countries are less likely to take the plunge and push for emissions cuts unless they know everyone else will jump with them . \u201c To me , the essence of this agreement is what it can do to strengthen confidence that everyone \u2019 s doing their fair share , primarily through greater transparency , \u201d says Elliot Diringer , executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions . \u201c With greater confidence , everyone can do more . Weaker transparency rules would make it harder to strengthen confidence and ambition over time . \u201d\nBeyond transparency , the world \u2019 s nations are also supposed to formally take stock of their progress by 2018 and then submit new \u2014 and ideally stronger \u2014 NDCs by 2020 . But this process of strengthening global pledges could get bogged down if the United States is dismantling domestic climate policies and weakening its stated ambitions . It \u2019 s not hard to imagine India or China feeling less pressure to step up their efforts if the richest country on Earth is backsliding .\nThe basic point here is that the Paris climate deal isn \u2019 t guaranteed to succeed just because Trump sticks with the agreement . These nuances of what happens to a process that \u2019 s already well underway really do matter \u2014 and there are lots of ways the US could potentially weaken it from within .\nFurther reading : Our primer on how the Paris climate deal works .",
