But conservatives have not been roundly pleased with Kasich , in part because he is evidently something of a committed Christian .\nLast year , Kasich fought doggedly to expand Medicaid coverage in Ohio , extending healthcare to some 275,000 poor people . When queried as to why a conservative would push for expanded coverage , Kasich explained his reasoning thus :\n\u201c I had a conversation with one of the members of the legislature the other day . I said , \u2018 I respect the fact that you believe in small government . I do , too . I also know that you \u2019 re a person of faith . Now , when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter , he \u2019 s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small . But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor . You better have a good answer . \u2019 \u201d\nConservative critics did not have a good answer . If Kasich \u2019 s challenge required a faith-based , well-reasoned critique of Medicaid to defend Republican animus , that wasn \u2019 t what it received . Instead , Kasich \u2019 s right-wing opponents produced a series of attacks that seemed straight out of the Richard Dawkins school of rhetoric . At RedState , for instance , Jason Hart complained that \u201c Kasich leaned heavily on his Christian faith to push the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , \u201d and glossed over Kasich \u2019 s explanation of his Christian reasoning as : \u201c anyone who opposes Medicaid expansion will have to answer for their opposition when they die . \u201d\nOf course , Kasich didn \u2019 t suggest that anyone who opposes Medicaid expansion will have to answer for such at the pearly gates ; he merely pointed out that , at this point in time , Medicaid expansion is the only option for extending healthcare coverage to poor people in Ohio , making it the most sensible Christian option .
