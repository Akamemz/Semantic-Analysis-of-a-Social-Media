But it is one of the whitest states in the nation , which has led to questions about its influence . Those may only grow this cycle , when with less than a year to go until the national Democratic convention , there are still some two dozen candidates in the running .\nFor nearly 50 years , Iowa has played an outsize role in the presidential nomination process , with its first-in-the-nation caucuses . And while the state has a mixed track record when it comes to selecting presidents , it plays a pivotal role in winnowing the field . On the Democratic side , seven of the past nine winners in Iowa have gone on to secure their party \u2019 s nomination .\nOver the course of 10 days this month , more than a million people will come to the Iowa State Fair to sample pork chops on a stick , ride the Ferris wheel , and gawk at the famous \u201c butter cow. \u201d Many will also encounter various Democratic presidential candidates , making their pitch from a soapbox .\nThere are few places in America where in a single muggy morning you can encounter Christian evangelists , eat a deep-fried Oreo , and meet not only the Cow Chip Throwing Grand Champion but also possibly the nation \u2019 s next commander in chief .\nBut this is Iowa , the farm state that for nearly 50 years has played an outsize role in the presidential nomination process , with its first-in-the-nation caucuses . It is home to just 3.2 million people , many of whom manage to meet the candidates face-to-face as they traipse through rites of passage such as the \u201c Wing Ding \u201d dinner and the Iowa State Fair .\nIn truth , Iowa has a mixed track record when it comes to actually selecting presidents . Since Jimmy Carter rode a surprise victory in the caucuses here in 1976 all the way to the White House , only two others have followed suit ( George W. Bush in 2000 and Barack Obama in 2008 ) . But the state plays an undeniably pivotal role in winnowing the field : Placing lower than third here has proved fatal to nearly every campaign in modern history . And on the Democratic side , seven of the past nine winners in Iowa have gone on to secure their party \u2019 s nomination .\nIowa \u2019 s voters are known for being thoughtful and taking their vetting role seriously . But it is the sixth-whitest state in the nation , which in recent years has led to growing complaints about the fairness of its influence , as America \u2013 and the presidential field \u2013 has become more diverse .\nAnd so it has become a quadrennial question : Why Iowa ? How did a state that has six times more pigs than people become the gatekeeper of the road to the White House \u2013 and should that be changed ? That question takes on perhaps new urgency this cycle , when with less than a year to go until the national Democratic convention , there are still some two dozen candidates in the running .\n\u201c The bigger the field , the more important the caucus is , \u201d says Dennis Goldford , a political science professor at Drake University in Des Moines and co-author of \u201c The Iowa Precinct Caucuses : The Making of a Media Event . \u201d\nPolitical scientists and operatives in the state say there are good reasons for maintaining Iowa \u2019 s first-in-the-nation status . In an era of ever-costlier campaigns , its small size enables candidates with more modest budgets to get a foot in the door . That wouldn \u2019 t be possible in , say , California , where the outcome would be determined more by the number of ads a candidate could buy than how many hands they could shake at backyard events .\nThose personal encounters benefit the candidates , too \u2013 they tend to emerge from their time in Iowa with a better honed message , says David Redlawsk , a political psychologist at the University of Delaware who is taking a sabbatical to study the caucuses in Iowa . \u201c Candidates , if they \u2019 re going to get anywhere , get better by meeting people , talking to people , and learning from people , \u201d says Professor Redlawsk , who hosted backyard meetings with candidates when he lived here a decade ago .\nAs for concerns about lack of diversity , many point out that the Democratic National Committee made an effort to address the issue back in 2008 by moving both Nevada and South Carolina \u2013 which include substantial Hispanic and African American voter populations respectively \u2013 up in the primary calendar . That same year , it was the mainly white voters of Iowa who launched President Barack Obama .\nA standard stop for candidates is the Iowa State Fair , billed as one of the best if not the biggest state fairs in the country .\nOver the course of 10 days , more than a million people come through to sample pork chops on a stick , ride the Ferris wheel , and gawk at the famous \u201c butter cow \u201d \u2013 a cow made entirely out of butter ( and joined this year by butter \u201c Sesame Street \u201d characters ) . Presidential candidates are offered a soapbox on a busy corner to make their pitch .\n\u201c One of the great strengths of who we are as a nation and people is by our very nature we are aspirational , \u201d declares California Sen. Kamala Harris from behind the hay bales . \u201c We are a nation that was founded on noble ideals . \u201d\nSenator Harris \u2019 \u201c joyful fight \u201d won the endorsement last week of Sue Dvorsky , the influential former chair of the Iowa State Democratic Party . People are looking for that kind of a fighter , says Ms. Dvorsky . \u201c When she throws her head back and laughs in what are such dark times \u2026 that \u2019 s contagious . \u201d\nMs. Harris has been conspicuously ramping up her presence in the state , including a massive bus painted with her first name . But polls show she \u2019 s still well behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2013 who has invested heavily in staff here and is drawing perhaps the largest and most enthusiastic crowds .\nAt the state fair , attendees are invited to cast a kernel of corn for their preferred candidate . So far , the results are tracking pretty closely with official polls .\nSpeaking in the wake of back-to-back mass shootings , many of the candidates try to strike a balance between recognizing the gravity of the challenges facing the country and the perennial American desire to look ahead with hope and optimism . They criticize the president , while also seeking to present an alternative vision .\n\u201c We are the nation that beat the Nazis , [ put a man ] on the moon , and mapped the human genome . ... We are a country that did those things together , \u201d proclaims Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey , calling for a revival of civic grace . \u201c This election is not about one guy and one office . It \u2019 s who we must be together . \u201d\nJill Applegate from Des Moines asks Senator Booker about improving child care in the U.S. She says she prefers candidates who don \u2019 t just focus on the president .\n\u201c We know Trump is bad , \u201d she says , holding a whirring purple and pink fan in front of her face to ease the muggy heat . \u201c I \u2019 d rather hear more about what their plans are . \u201d\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , who can barely make his way through the fairgrounds thanks to a massive media mob , reminds supporters that all the things he said four years ago that were deemed \u201c too radical \u201d are now practically mainstream \u2013 and urgently needed .\n\u201c This is a monumental time in our country , \u201d he thunders .\n\u201c Go Trump ! \u201d shouts a man sporting an \u201c Iowans for President Trump \u201d shirt .\n\u201c You \u2019 re a racist and a bigot , and you ... \u201d says a lady nearby , trailing off .\nThe Trump supporter , Mike Duff , says he attended one of Donald Trump \u2019 s rallies ahead of the 2016 election and was inspired by his message , which he sums up as \u201c Let \u2019 s be proud , let \u2019 s build our country up instead of giving it away . ... Let \u2019 s make the people around us successful . \u201d\nToday he \u2019 s part of a small group of pro-Trump folks standing around the soapbox \u2013 an effort to counter the intimidation he says they often feel from Democrats . These days , he says , many people are afraid to put out Trump yard signs , and when they do , they \u2019 re often ripped up .\nChrista Case Bryant/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Mike Duff is one of a small group of Trump supporters making a show of support for the president near the soapbox for Democratic candidates at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines on Aug. 11 , 2019 . He says he 's gotten a few dirty looks , but `` 10 to 1 '' it 's been thumbs-up .\nIf there \u2019 s one thing Democratic voters agree on , it \u2019 s the need to oust the president .\n\u201c I would vote for a parakeet if they would beat Donald Trump , \u201d says Mary Breiner , who \u2019 s visiting the fair from California , and says she has been horrified by what she sees as the president \u2019 s racism .\n\u201c As long as they get Trump out of there , \u201d agrees Robert Piggee , an African American Vietnam veteran selling T-shirts on his lawn near the fairgrounds to raise awareness about veteran suicides . \u201c We need the people of the U.S. to gel \u2026 and come together with a solution . \u201d\nBut there \u2019 s a debate within the Democratic Party over the best way to beat Mr. Trump . Is it by courting moderates and working-class voters who feel alienated from a party increasingly dominated by coastal elites ? Or by choosing a firebrand progressive like Senator Sanders or Senator Warren , who may inspire higher turnout among the party \u2019 s base , and motivate some who might not otherwise vote to head to the polls ?\n\u201c People need to know us by how bold we \u2019 re going to be \u2013 otherwise they \u2019 re going to stay home , \u201d says New York Mayor Bill de Blasio from the soapbox . \u201c That \u2019 s what happened in 2016 . \u201d\n\u201c We need to be for big , bold change , \u201d Mayor De Blasio continues . \u201c That \u2019 s how we energize people . \u201d\nEnergizing people is key to Iowa \u2019 s system , which until this cycle required people to come out in person on a weekday evening and spend several hours caucusing with other voters . It \u2019 s not as simple as casting a ballot and getting an \u201c I voted \u201d sticker , as in primary states .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a very wispy kind of measure , \u201d says Professor Goldford . \u201c I can explain quantum physics to you more easily . \u201d\nThis year , the Democratic National Committee has added key changes \u2013 many pushed by Senator Sanders \u2019 camp \u2013 to increase transparency and accountability . For the first time , raw numbers will be released showing voters \u2019 first preferences before the nonviable candidates are weeded out . And a limited number of call-in opportunities will allow voters who can \u2019 t attend in person to indicate their ranked preferences for candidates .\n\u201c You have a big burden on your shoulders , \u201d Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar tells the crowd .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThey know it \u2013 and they like it that way .\n\u201c We really savor the opportunity to do this , \u201d says Tom Henderson , the former chairman of the Polk County Democrats . \u201c Iowa voters aren \u2019 t arrogant about this . They take it as a great privilege . \u201d",
