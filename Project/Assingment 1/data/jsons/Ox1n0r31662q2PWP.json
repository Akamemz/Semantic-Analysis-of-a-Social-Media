Chris Christie thinks parents should be able to choose whether to vaccinate their children . `` Parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well , '' he told reporters Monday .\nNo , they should n't . Parents should n't have much matter of choice in vaccinating their children because people like Livia Simon do n't have a matter of choice in the issue , either .\nSimon is a a six-month-old infant in California . Babies her age do n't have strong enough immune systems to handle the flu vaccine . So Livia depends on me and you and everyone around her getting vaccinated .\nthe point of vaccination is n't to stop you from getting disease . it 's to stop spread .\nMore specifically , she depends on something called herd immunity : a firewall that stops a disease from bouncing from me to you and , eventually , to six-month-old Livia . Herd immunity matters the most for those with compromised immune systems like infants , the elderly , and some auto-immune disease patients ( some people who have AIDS , for example , ca n't get the measles vaccine ) .\nThe point of getting vaccinated is n't to keep you from getting the flu ( or measles , mumps or whooping cough ) . It 's not , as Christie seems to frame it , a decision about keeping your kids safe from disease . It 's to keep you and your kids from spreading all those diseases to people like Livia \u2014 people who do n't have the option to get vaccinated .\nThis year , we screwed up . Because some people did n't get vaccinated , more than 80 people caught measles in an outbreak that started at Disneyland . At least six of them are infants who are less than 12 months old .\nWe nearly screwed it up for Livia , too . As her mother Jennifer told the Washington Post earlier this week , Livia had to spend the last month in quarantine because an unvaccinated child who visited her pediatrician 's office may have exposed her to the disease .\nThis is very risky : approximately 1 to 2 of every 1,000 children infected with measles will die from the disease . Luckily , very few people get infected with measles these days ( thanks entirely to the vaccine ) but , when it strikes , measles will kill .\n`` Some parents see it as a personal choice , like homeschooling , '' Jennifer told the Post . `` But when you choose not to vaccinate , you \u2019 re putting other children at risk . You \u2019 re putting your child above other people \u2019 s children . ''\nEach day , we make dozens of decisions that directly relate to our health . We decide to wear a seatbelt on our way to work , or we do n't . And sometimes , we choose the riskier path for reasons of convenience or comfort or pleasure . We might not wear a bike helmet or we might have a second drink at happy hour ( Or a third . Or a fourth ) .\nThese are decisions about the amount of risk that we want to take on as individuals , and we accept the risks of our own decisions .\nDeciding whether or not to get vaccinations \u2014 or to get our children vaccinations \u2014 is not one of those decisions . Vaccination is not a personal decision . It has the potential to affect hundreds , maybe thousands , of other people .\nvaccination is a decision that Affects hundreds , maybe thousands of other people\nObjections to vaccination among those healthy enough to get immunized ( those of us over the age of one , essentially ) typically just are n't good enough to justify the risk .\nMuch of it revolves around the safety of the vaccine . Even in the Amish community in Ohio , it was n't a religious belief that caused low vaccination rates \u2014 and laid the groundwork for a huge outbreak .

Ninety-seven percent of people who get two doses of the measles vaccine will not catch the disease ( compare that to this year 's flu vaccine , which reduces the risk of catching the disease by 23 percent ) .

About 92 percent of the American population is immunized against measles , for example .
