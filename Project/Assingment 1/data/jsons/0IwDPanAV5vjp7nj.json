How hard will he go after Republicans on the debt ceiling and government funding?\n\nPretty hard, as it turns out.\n\nObama was careful to praise a \u201cgrowing number of Republican senators\u201d who are \u201ctrying to get things done\u201d on immigration and other issues. But he ripped into \u201ca faction of Republicans in the House\u201d who he said would not give the Senate immigration bill a vote and \u201cgutted a farm bill that America\u2019s farmers and most vulnerable children depend on.\u201d\n\nAnd he went straight at the House Republicans over raising the debt ceiling and funding the government \u2014 two issues that will dominate Washington debate this fall.\n\n( WATCH: Obama will use 'every minute of the 1,276 days remaining')\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest they wouldn\u2019t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up \u2014 a fiasco that harmed a fragile recovery in 2011, and one we can\u2019t afford to repeat,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThe risk to this approach, which Obama has embraced repeatedly in the past to limited effect, is that it drives House Republicans crazy and makes it harder to seal deals on issues like the debt ceiling and funding the government.\n\nRepublicans on Wednesday showed no signs of warming up to the president\u2019s positions.

How bullish will he be on the economy?\n\nModerately so.\n\nOne of the risks going into the speech was that Obama would appear to be cheerleading a recovery that most average Americans are barely feeling as wages stagnate, good jobs remain elusive and many workers have simply given up looking.\n\nObama, as expected, did take some credit for \u201crescuing\u201d the auto industry \u2014 even as the city of Detroit has filed for bankruptcy \u2014 and turning massive jobs losses into steady job gains.\n\n\u201cAdd it all up, and over the past 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs.
