Louisiana is a likely GOP pickup, but it\u2019s expected to go to a December runoff.\n\nDemocratic incumbents have an edge in New Hampshire and North Carolina, but polls have tightened in recent weeks.\n\n( From POLITICO Magazine: Can Obama reboot?)\n\nWith that in mind, here are the 10 questions that will decide whether Republicans will close the deal on Tuesday:\n\nDo enough Republicans come home to save Pat Roberts in Kansas?\n\nThe three-term Republican senator is stuck in the low 40s in polls, largely because he\u2019s underperforming among the Republican base in the deep-red state.

But he\u2019s closing strong.\n\nWill vote-by-mail produce a surprise in Colorado?\n\nThe great uncertainty of this race, which most polls show Republican Rep. Cory Gardner leading Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, is the vote-by-mail factor. For the first time ballots were mailed to each registered voter in the state, and Democrats hope that will produce turnout levels higher than is typically seen in a midterm.\n\nRepublicans maintain a registration advantage in the state, but Democrats have dominated statewide the past decade by winning independents, or \u201cunaffiliated\u201d voters. Udall probably needs to win this group by double digits, operatives say, or he can win by a smaller margin if they compose a third or more of the electorate \u2014 something akin to a presidential election.\n\nA Quinnipiac poll that put Gardner up 46 percent to 39 percent last week showed the two basically tied among independents.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Barack Obama: \u2018Vote.

The Democrat\u2019s campaign released an internal poll around the same time that showed Udall up 1 point, but ahead by 10 points among independents.\n\nIs the Des Moines Register poll the real deal?\n\nA Des Moines Register poll this weekend showed Republican Joni Ernst up 7 points, and the feeling on the ground is that the open race has slipped away from Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley.\n\nThe Register\u2019s respected pollster, whose surveys have a solid history of mirroring the final outcome, said the race is basically over because so few people said they might still change their minds. Democrats pushed back by pointing to a series of polls last week showing a tighter race and touting success in early voting.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Tom Harkin: Joni Ernst as pretty as Taylor Swift? So what?)\n\nVoters see Ernst as more extreme than Braley and more beholden to outside interests (the Koch brothers), but they don\u2018t appear to care. Instead, they are more turned off by Braley\u2019s characterization of GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley as a \u201cfarmer from Iowa who never went to law school.\u201d\n\nHow much support does the Libertarian siphon from Republicans in Alaska?\n\nDemocrats have hammered Republican Dan Sullivan as a carpetbagger, on his record as attorney general and over a host of parochial issues (like his support for a controversial mine). But there\u2019s a class of voters who may not like Sullivan but won\u2019t vote to reelect Democratic Sen. Mark Begich because of his support for Obama priorities like Obamacare.\n\n( VIDEO: Election Day 2014)\n\nWith Sullivan leading in most polls, Begich is making a last-minute play to boost Libertarian Party candidate Mark Fish. Begich pushed to include Fish in the debates and has launched radio ads to note that Fish opposes the PATRIOT Act and electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency.\n\nA poll last week showed Fish getting 4.5 percent of the vote, which could be the difference in a close race.
