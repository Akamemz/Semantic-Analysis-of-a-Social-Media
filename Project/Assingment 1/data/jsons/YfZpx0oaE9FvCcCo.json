The president has tried unsuccessfully to kill the program , but he said Tuesday he will somehow keep it alive \u2014 without giving us any details .\nTrump would be wise to allow the 650,000 or so current DACA recipients , as well as other \u201c Dreamers , \u201d to stay in the U.S. , and he should support action from Congress that would let them earn eventual citizenship . It \u2019 s in our national interest and in Trump \u2019 s own political interest .\nIn addition , saving DACA recipients from deportation is the only fair and just way to treat young people who grew up here , often have no memories of the countries where they were born , in many cases don \u2019 t speak the languages of those countries , and are making tremendous contributions to our country .\nTRUMP VOWS TO SIGN IMMIGRATION EXECUTIVE ORDER : 'WE 'RE GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF DACA '\nOver 200,000 DACA recipients are working to protect the health and safety of Americans as our nation confronts the coronavirus pandemic . Nearly 1,000 have served in the military . Hundreds of thousands serve in critical roles throughout our economy .\nAt a White House news conference Tuesday evening , the president said as he was about to exit : `` We 're going to take care of DACA because I 'm going to be doing , in the not too distant future , pretty soon , I 'm going to be signing a new immigration action \u2014 very , very big merit-based immigration action \u2014 that , based on the DACA decision , I 'll be able to do . ''\n\u201c DACA is going to be just fine , \u201d the president said in a rambling Telemundo interview Friday . In addition to calling for merit-based immigration in that interview , he said : \u201c We 're going to have a road to citizenship. \u201d However , moments after the interview , in a sign of how his advisers see the issue , White House staff walked back Trump \u2019 s support for such a road .\nOver 200,000 DACA recipients are working to protect the health and safety of Americans as our nation confronts the coronavirus pandemic\nTrump campaigned for the presidency by attacking unlawful immigration and made construction of a border wall \u2014 which he falsely claimed Mexico would pay for \u2014 a central campaign promise .

Given the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling , it should be doing so .\nAt the same time , two of the president \u2019 s most valued bases of support have weighed in to give support to DACA recipients : the business community and evangelical Christians .\nDozens of CEOs and executives from America \u2019 s business community \u2014 including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , Amazon , General Motors , Target , Apple , Google and Facebook \u2014 wrote a letter to the president Saturday in which they note the contributions of DACA recipients , including as frontline workers during the coronavirus pandemic .\n\u201c As large American employers and employer organizations , we strongly urge you to leave the DACA program in place , \u201d members of the group wrote . \u201c DACA recipients have been critical members of our work force , industries , and communities for years now , and they have abided by the laws and regulations of our country to maintain their DACA status . \u201d\nAnd evangelical leaders wrote to the president last week : `` Consistent with your past comments affirming your concern and 'great love ' for this population , we plead with you to work toward good-faith compromise that would both be compassionate to immigrants and respect the rule of law .
