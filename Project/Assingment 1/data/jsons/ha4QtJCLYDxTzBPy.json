There is , as one would expect , a showman \u2019 s flair to the exercise . But what do I care about Trump \u2019 s meeting with Al Gore to shoot the warming breeze if two days later he gives me Scott Pruitt to make actual environmental policy \u2014 or , better , to gut EPA \u2019 s oppressive , unconstitutional policy ?\nAnd after eight years of \u201c workplace violence \u201d and \u201c man-caused disasters \u201d in which the administration \u2019 s knee-jerk response to jihadist terror was to suppress mention of jihadist terror while anguishing over phantom \u201c blowback \u201d against Muslims , I \u2019 ll take a president \u2014 okay , a president-elect \u2014 who prefers to console the Ohio State victims and celebrate the heroism of the cop who took out the jihadist .\nThis is good . I don \u2019 t like everything Trump has done so far , but I like an awful lot of it . And saying so is only fair .\nI was never in the immovably # NeverTrump camp , but I \u2019 ve been a critic .

( I am , for example , the principal author of the immigration memo Josh Rogin reported on in the Washington Post this week ) . I voted for Trump because , unlike some colleagues whose opinions carry a lot of weight with me , I was never persuaded against the reality that the election was a binary choice between him and Hillary Clinton .
