He rails against the decision by his own leadership to draft its Obamacare repeal measure almost entirely in private . The genial senator even steers away from derisively referring to the 2010 health care law as Obamacare , instead using its official term : The Affordable Care Act .\n\u201c I \u2019 m very interested in making sure pre-existing condition is covered and I wouldn \u2019 t consider it covered if it could be taken away in some other fashion , \u201d Moran said Thursday in a health-care-dominated town hall . \u201c Who in the room doesn \u2019 t have a pre-existing condition ?

The move demonstrated the limits of how far right some Republicans are willing to go to scale back public benefits , even in a conservative state .\nFor Moran , in one ear are groups like the Kansas Hospital Association , which notes that the Senate repeal bill would not only bar the state from expanding Medicaid eligibility but asks states like Kansas that didn \u2019 t expand to shoulder the costs for states that did \u2014 a concern echoed by Moran on Thursday .

All four House Republicans from Kansas voted in favor of their Obamacare repeal measure in May , and undoing the law remains largely popular throughout the state .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve been campaigning against Obamacare and rightfully so , for six or seven years , \u201d Rooks County GOP Chairman Jim Circle said . \u201c It \u2019 s time to do it and get on to other items on Trump \u2019 s agenda . \u201d\nBut those voices were rare even in this rural , conservative town , located 15 miles west of Moran \u2019 s boyhood home of Plainville and in a county where 84 percent of voters cast a ballot for Trump last November .\nOne attendee after another at the town hall , which was saturated by health care questions , raised concerns about dismantling Obamacare and praised Moran for opposing the Senate GOP bill . Even after the town hall ended , Moran listened to worries from disabled constituents about cuts to Medicaid .\nAfter one questioner noted that Moran earlier in the week said Kansans were not better off under Obamacare , the senator responded : \u201c There are people who tell me they are better off and I believe them . \u201d\nDuring the roughly 90-minute event , Cheryl Hofstetter Duffy , 58 , of neighboring Hill City , pressed the senator on why lawmakers won \u2019 t work together to improve Obamacare , rather than unravel it .\n\u201c I would not support him \u201d if Moran voted to repeal Obamacare , said Duffy , who said she is a registered Democrat but has previously voted for Moran . \u201c Oh , it is that critical . Absolutely . I voted for him in the past because I really felt he was putting people ahead of party . \u201d\nMoran \u2019 s opposition to the initial version of the Republican health care plan had been somewhat of a mystery on Capitol Hill , and he still isn \u2019 t considered among the top tier of headaches for GOP leaders .\nBut here in Palco , Moran was not shy about rattling off his critique of the Senate GOP bill .\nHe also veered off the party message saying he would have preferred a process to \u201c figure out where there are 60 votes to pass something that is so important to many Americans , \u201d implicitly rejecting the partisan fast-track approach GOP leaders deployed . It \u2019 s \u201c almost impossible to try to solve \u201d the Republicans \u2019 health care dilemma with just 50 votes , Moran added .\nThere are limits to how specific Moran would be , however .\nHe declined to take a position on a Trump proposal espoused by conservative senators that would repeal Obamacare now and come up with a replacement later .

Senior Republicans have tried to downplay Moran \u2019 s rejection of the initial GOP bill .\n\u201c Since people know that that was a discussion draft and that wasn \u2019 t the final draft , then obviously I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s any big reason to come out with guns blazing in support of the bill , \u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said last week of Moran \u2019 s opposition .\nMoran \u2019 s moment in the spotlight Thursday \u2014 a horde of national and state media descended on the tiny town \u2014 is unusual for the low-key Kansan who helped secure the GOP Senate majority as NRSC chairman during the 2014 election cycle .\nEven then , Moran didn \u2019 t use his successful chairmanship to climb the leadership ladder , unlike previous heads of the Senate GOP \u2019 s campaign arm .
