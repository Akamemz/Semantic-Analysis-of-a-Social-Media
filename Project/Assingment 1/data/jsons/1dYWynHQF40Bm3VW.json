    "content": "Last week , our military and intelligence services brought justice to Qassim Suleimani , Iran \u2019 s terror mastermind . President Trump ordered General Suleimani \u2019 s killing after months of attacks on Americans by Iran \u2019 s proxy forces in Iraq . These attacks culminated in a rocket strike that killed an American and wounded others , then the attempted storming of our embassy in Baghdad . The first attack crossed the red line drawn by the president last summer \u2014 that if Iran harmed an American , it would face severe consequences . The president meant what he said , as Mr. Suleimani learned the hard way .\nMr. Suleimani \u2019 s killing was justified , legal and strategically sound . But the president \u2019 s critics swarmed as usual . After the embassy attack , a Democratic senator declared that the president had \u201c rendered America impotent. \u201d Some Democrats then pivoted after the Suleimani strike , calling him \u201c reckless \u201d and \u201c dangerous. \u201d Those are the words of Senator Elizabeth Warren , who also described Mr. Suleimani \u2014 the leader of a State Department-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization plotting to kill American troops \u2014 as a \u201c senior foreign military official. \u201d Senator Bernie Sanders likened America \u2019 s killing of a terrorist on the battlefield to Vladimir Putin \u2019 s assassination of Russian political dissidents .\nSome Democrats seem to feel a strange regret for the killing of a monster who specialized in killing Americans . The linguist his proxies killed on Dec. 27 , Nawres Hamid , was merely his last victim out of more than 600 in Iraq since 2003 . His forces have instigated attacks against our troops in Afghanistan . He plotted a ( foiled ) bombing in Washington , D.C. , and attempted attacks on the soil of our European allies . He armed the terrorist group Hezbollah in Lebanon with rockets to pummel the Jewish state of Israel . And he was greeted moments before his death by a terrorist responsible for the bombing of our embassy in Kuwait in 1983 .\nSome of the president \u2019 s critics will concede that Mr. Suleimani was an evil man , but many complain his killing was unlawful . Wrong again . He was a United States-designated terrorist commander . As I have been briefed , he was plotting further attacks against Americans at the time of his death . The authority granted to the president under Article II of the Constitution provides ample legal basis for this strike . Furthermore , those who accept the constitutionality of the War Powers Act should recall that Congress \u2019 s 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force very much remain in effect and clearly cover the Suleimani operation . This will be a relief to the Obama administration , which ordered hundreds of drone strikes using such a legal rationale .",
