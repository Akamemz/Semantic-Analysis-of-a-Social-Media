    "content": "Since the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin\u2014assisted by three murderously indifferent cop buddies\u2014protests over abusive and lethal police conduct have spread across the country and turned destructive . Law-and-order types take that as an opening to shift the topic from the long , troubling history of law enforcement in this country to the excesses of the protesters . Conservative-populist pundit Tucker Carlson put the cherry on top of that tactic when he invoked the word `` tyranny '' and applied it not to government employees who deploy violence as a tool of first resort when terrorizing communities , but to those who turn violent in response .\n`` Rioting is a form of tyranny , '' Carlson said on his Fox News show . `` The strong and the violent oppress the weak and the unarmed . It is oppression . ''\nIronically , Carlson illustrated his point with video of people attacking police cruisers of the sort driven by Officers Chauvin , Tou Thao , J Alexander Kueng , and Thomas K. Lane , all of whom had either pinned Floyd or held back concerned passersby attempting to intervene . Subsequently , the Minneapolis Police Department abandoned the besieged Third Precinct building where the four officers worked and it was rapidly set ablaze by an angry crowd . None of that seems like `` tyranny '' so much as it looks like violent pushback from members of the public tired of being tyrannized by abusive government enforcers who have a reputation for specifically targeting African Americans . It more closely resembled the 1854 attempted storming of the federal courthouse in Boston to free escaped slave Anthony Burns\u2014during which a U.S. marshal was killed\u2014than it did an exercise in oppression .\nThat 's not to say all , or even the majority , of the crowd 's ire in Minneapolis and elsewhere has been focused on cop cars and government buildings . Grocery stores have been torched , pawn shops smashed , pharmacies looted , private cars and residential buildings destroyed . These all represent significant investments and , often , needed sources of income for their owners . None of those owners had anything to do with the killing of George Floyd , and many of them are horrified by the incident and support the protests .\nBut protests are n't directed by mass minds , and their participants often have conflicting priorities and agendas .
