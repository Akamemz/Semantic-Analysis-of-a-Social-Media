In foreign policy, the neoconservatives were best known for supporting idealistic nation-building abroad. They distrusted the rise of what would become political correctness and ever more government. They worried about violent crime and higher taxes. So decades ago, these Democrats joined the Republican Party.\n\nSince the 1980s, the neoconservatives have made up the elite of their newly adopted party \u2014 despite their unease with the conservative orthodoxy of border enforcement, fierce resistance to gun control and opposition to abortion.\n\nNow, a few neoconservatives are reinventing themselves again and returning to the Democrats to support Hillary Clinton. We could call them \u201cneoliberals.\u201d\n\nThey believe that socialist Bernie Sanders made the hard-left Mrs. Clinton seem like an acceptable centrist. As neoliberals, they hope that beneath her opportunistic embrace of Obamism, Mrs. Clinton still could recalibrate herself as more of a Democrat of the 1990s, a period when her husband, President Bill Clinton, championed balancing the budget while intervening abroad.\n\nNeoliberals \u2014 along with some members of the conservative establishment \u2014 consider Republican Party nominee Donald Trump to be toxic.

The neolibs will seek to expunge populists and to rebuild a defeated Republican Party in their own image as an improved version of the conservative establishment represented by the likes of Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush.\n\nThey may re-emerge as old Republican neoconservatives who will promote unfettered free trade, democracy-building abroad and \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d while downplaying social issues.\n\nIf Mr. Trump squeaks by, then the neoliberals certainly will be orphaned for good.
