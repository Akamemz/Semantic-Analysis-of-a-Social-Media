That equates to between 9 million and 9.9 million people enrolled through new government-run insurance markets created by the law .\nComing in below the CBO estimate would undermine the Obama administration \u2019 s effort to convince the public that its signature domestic policy initiative is working .

We expect the numbers to come in higher . \u201d\nThe insurance markets , called exchanges , are designed to allow people who don \u2019 t have coverage through an employer to compare prices and buy a health plan , often with the assistance of government subsidies for monthly premiums . Enrollment opens for 2015 on Nov. 15 and closes Feb. 15 , a window that is three months shorter than last year .\nSylvia Mathews Burwell , the HHS secretary , said she \u2019 ll consider enrollment to be a success this year if the U.S. uninsured rate continues to decline .
