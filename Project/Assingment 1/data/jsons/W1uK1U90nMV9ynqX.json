The candidates have rarely confronted each other on issues that generate wide interest and coverage .\nFurther narrowing the opportunities for voters to judge the two side by side , the candidates have come to agreement on only a single debate thus far , one scheduled for Oct. 5 in Los Angeles , although they disagree over who is to blame for this .\nHarris previously accepted a September debate in Sacramento that Sanchez declined .
