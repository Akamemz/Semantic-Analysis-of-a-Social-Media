    "content": "Peering into his laptop camera while filming a fidgety monologue for his Periscope audience last week , Breitbart.com investigative reporter Lee Stranahan spelled out an internal crisis that was unfolding at the \u201c alt-right , \u201d pro-Trump media hub . Convinced he was sitting on \u201c the biggest political story in the world , \u201d Stranahan announced that his boss , Washington political editor Matthew Boyle , had ordered him to stay away from future White House briefings , which meant Stranahan couldn \u2019 t ask press secretary Sean Spicer about the supposed blockbuster . ( Short version : Stranahan has strung together a conspiracy theory that would suggest the Russian hacking narrative is a complete fabrication by so-called deep state actors and a firm called Crowdstrike . ) \u201c I \u2019 m probably going to lose my job , \u201d Stranahan lamented during his televised update , noting \u201c I have five kids to feed . \u2026 But I \u2019 m not going to let this story get killed. \u201d Indeed , by week 's end , Stranahan was gone from Breitbart . He said he will now team up with The Gateway Pundit , the hyper-dishonest \u201c alt-right \u201d site that now boasts a White House press pass and commits itself to trolling journalists on the presidential beat . The weird public Stranahan meltdown was just the latest example of far-right media outlets seemingly cracking under the strain of the Trump era . Along with at Breitbart , internal dramas have recently played out publicly at Fox News , TheBlaze and Independent Journal Review , as right-wing media sources struggle to find their footing with Trump now in charge , and with the attention that comes with that . Accustomed to robotically blaming Democrats for all the supposed evils in the world , conservatives now have to deal with a political landscape where Republicans control the White House , the Senate , the House , and , possibly soon , the Supreme Court . Is dissent allowed ? Or is the new role to simply cheer whatever Republicans do , and serve as a convenient shield for the administration ? \u201c For years , conservatives breathlessly accused the media of being too easy on President Barack Obama and acting like a bunch of sycophantic boot-lickers for his administration . Turns out , some only wanted the chance to try it out for themselves once a Republican was in office , \u201d conservative commentator Amanda Carpenter wrote in Politico . \u201c Some of those who used to be the conservative movement \u2019 s most loyal government watchdogs are nothing but lapdogs now for Trump. \u201d At Glenn Beck \u2019 s TheBlaze , popular conservative host Tomi Lahren was temporarily suspended after she went on The View and made comments critical of anti-abortion activists . ( Lahren : \u201c I can \u2019 t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I \u2019 m for limited government but I think that the government should decide what women do with their bodies. \u201d ) In an usual display of newsroom friendly fire , Lahren \u2019 s comment was immediately condemned by her own colleagues at TheBlaze : Soon after Lahren \u2019 s tweet , a reporter at The Blaze , Kate Scanlon , tweeted , \u201c There is no \u2018 my truth. \u2019 There is only the truth. \u201d Another reporter at The Blaze , Kaitlyn Schallhorn , tweeted soon after : \u201c Even Hillary Clinton didn \u2019 t call pro-life conservatives hypocrites. \u201d Beck himself soon joined the pile-on . \u201c It takes intellectual honesty , and it takes a willingness to actually think these things through and to do more than just read Twitter or Facebook to get your news and your political opinions , \u201d Beck said on his radio show while denouncing Lahren , according to The Daily Caller . Beck has now reportedly fired the host . \u201c Glenn is reminding the world of his conservative principles by sidelining Tomi after she insulted conservatives by calling them hypocrites , \u201d one Beck \u201c insider \u201d told the New York Post . Over at Fox News , executives were recently left scrambling when the White House pointed to Fox senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano as a source for the inexplicable claim that former President Barack Obama had asked British intelligence to spy on Trump during the campaign . It was part of the White House \u2019 s larger failed attempt to support Trump \u2019 s baseless claim that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential election . The claim of British involvement sparked an international incident . Initially , a Fox News spokeswoman reported that Napolitano \u201c stands by his report on FOX & Friends , \u201d but then the full-on retreat began . By March 20 , Fox had taken the extraordinary step of yanking Napolitano off the air \u201c indefinitely. \u201d Vanity Fair 's Sarah Ellison spoke with a \u201c Fox News insider \u201d who told her : \u201c The key thing Judge Napolitano did was to say \u2018 Fox News is reporting that ... , \u2019 and he can \u2019 t say that . ' That breaks the trust , and you saw what it cost him . He is not a reporter and knows he 's not a reporter . '' The source claimed that Napolitano \u2019 s comments , and Trump \u2019 s championing of them , had created what Ellison described as \u201c an internal headache \u201d for Fox News : \u201c It \u2019 s a disaster , '' said the source . `` It \u2019 s a nightmare. \u201d Speaking of headaches , Independent Journal Review ( IJR ) handed out suspensions last week after the GOP-friendly news site published a bizarre column suggesting Obama might have pressured the federal judge in Hawaii whose ruling halted Trump \u2019 s latest attempt to establish a travel ban for six Muslim-majority countries . ( IJR column headline : \u201c Fmr President Obama Made 'Surprise Visit ' to Hawaii , Days Before Judge Issued Travel Ban Ruling. \u201d ) IJR editors later apologized for and retracted the story , but not before one staffer reportedly quit over the embarrassing episode . The site then suspended its chief content officer and two editors . ( On March 27 , Politico \u2019 s Hadas Gold reported that IJR video producer Colin Chocola also reportedly quit , citing issues he had with the \u201c direction \u201d of IJR that predated the Hawaii conspiracy theory flap . ) The dust-up was significant because the conservative-leaning IJR , founded in 2012 by former Republican operative Alex Skatell , was the only media outlet allowed to accompany Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on his recent trip to Asia -- a trip that yielded a laudatory puff piece published by IJR . The move to invite IJR was \u201c part of an effort to include a broader representation of U.S. media , \u201d according to the State Department . \u201c If willingness to tar a former president with conspiratorial garbage constitutes an element of media diversity , then the State Department succeeded , \u201d quipped Erik Wemple at The Washington Post , after IJR published its conspiratorial column about Obama .
