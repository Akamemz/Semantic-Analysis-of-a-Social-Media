Days later , when Netanyahu said that he had never disavowed his prior support for the possibility of a Palestinian state \u2013 support he expressed in a speech at Bar Ilan University in 2009 \u2013 the media accused Netanyahu of flip-flopping .\nThere is only one problem : Netanyahu never said that a Palestinian state was out of the question .\nThe interview in which Netanyahu expressed the much-misinterpreted remark took place with the conservative Israeli publication NRG . It also took place in Hebrew , a language virtually none of the members of the Western press read or speak ; most simply took the Ha \u2019 aretz report and ran with it . Netanyahu was asked directly about whether his Bar-Ilan speech was \u201c irrelevant. \u201d Here is what Netanyahu actually said :\nNETANYAHU : I think anyone who is going to build a Palestinian state today will be freeing up space to give an attack area to radical Islam against Israel . This is the reality created here in recent years . Anyone who ignores this sticks his head in the sand . The left does this , burying its head in the sand again and again . We are realistic and understand\u2026 NRG : If you are elected head of state , no Palestinian state will come to fruition ? NETANYAHU : Indeed . NRG : Construction in Jerusalem and the West Bank will renew ? NETANYAHU : We are continuing all the time , but that \u2019 s not a question about additional building . There is a real threat that the government of the left will join the international community and do their bidding\u2026 .\nNetanyahu continued by arguing that the left would buy into the \u201c international initiatives to return to the 1967 borders and divide Jerusalem . \u201d\nIn other words , Netanyahu did not discount the possibility of a Palestinian state forever .
