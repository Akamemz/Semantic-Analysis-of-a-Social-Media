    "content": "Yesterday we told you about the Bloomberg poll showing Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump by 12 points in the general election , noting that she has now led in nine straight polls dating back to mid-May . Even more worrisome for Republicans is Trump 's average support languishing in the high 30 's , even after his nice polling bump after locking up the GOP nomination . Let 's say you 're inclined to dismiss direct head-to-head polling -- we 've argued that it 's getting a bit late in the game for that -- and to write off the Bloomberg numbers as an outlier . Fine . But two subsequent national surveys offer additional cause for alarm among Trump supporters . A CBS News poll taken entirely after the Orlando terrorist attack shows heavy public opposition to Trump 's response to the massacre :\nPresident Obama gets net positive ratings for his response to the shooting in Orlando . 44 percent approve , while 34 percent disapprove . About a quarter do n't have an opinion . When asked to assess the responses of the presumptive nominees for President , Americans are divided on Hillary Clinton 's response to the attack , while ratings of Trump are more negative . 51 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Trump is responding to the Orlando attack , while just 25 percent approve . Most Democrats ( 62 percent ) approve of Clinton 's response , while just half of Republicans ( 50 percent ) approve of Trump 's . More independents are critical of Trump 's response than Clinton 's .\nObama is above water ( +10 ) , Clinton is running roughly even ( +2 ) , and Trump is deep underwater ( -26 ) . As for the presumptive GOP nominee 's ( quasi-resurrected ? ) temporary Muslim ban proposal , public opinion runs two-to-one in opposition , with independents breaking heavily against it . Writes Allahpundit : `` If even a major terror attack can \u2019 t get voters to take a second look at the would-be strongman , what \u2019 ll it take ? Trump \u2019 s image is so horribly poor among the general electorate that he can \u2019 t win without convincing voters to give him a second look . If a jihadi shooting up a nightclub while Trump is demanding a ban on Muslims abroad doesn \u2019 t do it , maybe nothing \u2019 s going to do it . '' A reasonable concern . Is his description of Trump 's standing among the overall electorate as `` horribly poor '' perhaps a bit unfair ? Not according to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll . Remember when I characterized Trump 's 67 percent unfavorable mark in that series as `` unelectable '' territory back in March ? Well , the billionaire rebounded to a less-catastrophic ( 37/60 ) after clinching the nomination last month , edging slightly ahead of Clinton on a hypothetical ballot . Those gains have now disappeared , and then some :\nWaPo/ABC poll : 55 % of voters hold unfavorable view of Hillary .\n70 % ( ! ) hold unfavorable view of Trump , including 56 % `` strong '' unfav . \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) June 15 , 2016\nYes , seven-in-ten American voters have a negative view of Trump , with the percentage expressing a `` strongly '' unfavorable opinion eclipsing Hillary 's high negatives , which have n't improved at all since securing her party 's crown . The preposterous notion that `` nothing hurts Trump '' ( the judge garbage has clearly taken a toll ) is being exposed in a general election setting , as many analysts anticipated . He is now 41 points underwater on favorability . Here 's how :\nPair that information with Bloomberg 's finding that 55 percent of likely voters say they 'd never pull the lever for him , and CBS ' measurement of broad opposition to his response to Orlando , and it would appear that Donald Trump and the Republican Party have a real problem on their hands .

The downside is shunting aside the voices of millions of primary voters who elected Trump , knowing full well exactly who he is . He was n't subtle .

Many of Trump 's fanatical followers would n't just shrug and turn out for whomever the party picks in Cleveland . They 'd angrily sit out the election , or they 'd show up to actively teach the party a lesson by punishing down-ballot Republicans . Whatever gains the party might win among independents and among the # NeverTrump margins , they 'd enrage a sizable portion of their own base in a way we 've never seen before . This week 's Bloomberg poll shows just 33 percent of GOP voters expressing enthusiasm about Trump ; that 's very low , but a party can not win by writing off one-third of its base . Even if the polling gets much worse for Trump between now and mid-July , and even if the appetite to dump Trump increases significantly among GOP voters mortified by the prospect of a Hillary presidency , I do n't see how a convention coup could possibly end well .
