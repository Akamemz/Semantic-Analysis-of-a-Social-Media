He wants to know if the Obama administration used the bureau to spy on him and his campaign .\nPresident Trump tweeted up a storm over the weekend -- writing , `` I hereby demand that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump campaign for political purposes-and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama administration . ''\nThe president 's tweets were in response to articles appearing in The Washington Post and The New York Times reporting that the FBI used an informant -- a retired American professor living in the United Kingdom -- to pass on information he learned while advising the campaign .\nHours later , the Justice Department announced it asked its inspector general to look into the matter . Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said if anyone did infiltrate the Trump campaign , the DOJ would need to know about it and then take action .\nUS Rep.
