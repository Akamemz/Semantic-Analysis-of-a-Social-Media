Before we jump from campaign frenzy to post-election celebration -- or disappointment -- we should not let Election Day pass without pausing to really absorb what an extraordinary thing democracy is .\nThe idea that the people have a right to decide who will govern them , that the men and women who want to become president have to undergo a grueling , months-long job application process , engaging with citizens , trying to persuade everyone , rich and poor , young , old , men , women -- everyone -- that they deserve the position , is a truly remarkable reality .\nIt is also a contagious idea that has spilled across the surface of the Earth like water seeking its natural level . But it is not a self-occurring , automatic state of affairs .\nOver the centuries , the strong simply seized power , and the masses regularly endured unjust rule . Democracy has come because of enormous effort and sacrifice . And in too many places , many are still struggling , even dying , to claim it as their own .\nAmerica 's democracy is flawed , yes . But it is nowhere near so flawed as to be rendered meaningless or beyond repair .\nThose who have spent their whole lives living under a democracy , or who have never witnessed the passion with which those living without it can yearn for a legitimate government , may not grasp just how stunning it is for all the people to have the power to choose their government . History , even recent and still-unfolding history , is filled with examples of dictatorship and tyranny . And it is rich with stories of courageous efforts to bring it down .\nNo one who remembers what happened in China in 1989 can take democracy for granted .
