    "content": "The coronavirus pandemic poses an obvious threat to physical safety , but advocates stress that Americans shouldn \u2019 t sleep on their mental health .\nNew York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , a Democrat , whose state has become an epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis , said Wednesday that more than 6,000 mental-health professionals had volunteered to provide free mental-health services .\nThe Empire State had at least 60,000 confirmed cases as of Monday morning , up from 37,258 just four days ago , making up a disproportionate share of the United States \u2019 143,055 confirmed cases . New York City accounts for 776 of the 2,513 deaths from the disease in the U.S .\n\u201c Some 35 % of Americans say their mental health has worsened over the past week , an increase over 22 % a week earlier . \u201d\n\u201c Don \u2019 t underestimate the emotional trauma that people are feeling , \u201d Cuomo said . The COVID-19 pandemic is , after all , a life or death situation , he added . New Yorkers can call a hotline at 1-844-863-9314 to schedule an appointment , he said .\nSome 35 % of Americans say their mental health has worsened over the past week , an increase over 22 % a week earlier , according to recent findings from the Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index . Forty-three percent said their emotional well-being had gotten worse , compared to 29 % a week earlier .\nAmericans \u2019 top worries related to coronavirus include that they or a family member will get sick from COVID-19 ( 62 % ) , a negative impact on investments such as retirement or college savings ( 51 % ) , and lost income due to reduced hours or workplace closure ( 46 % ) , according to a separate poll published last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation .\nAmong workers , 53 % say they \u2019 re worried they \u2019 ll lose income due to workplace closure or reduced hours , and 41 % worry they \u2019 ll risk exposure to coronavirus because they can \u2019 t afford to miss work , the Kaiser poll found .\n\u201c Social distancing is \u2018 actually physical distancing. \u2019 \u2018 Socially , we can remain even closer. \u2019 \u201d \u2014 Christine Moutier , the chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline \u201c has not experienced significant changes in call volume at this time , \u201d spokesperson Frances Gonzalez told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , though representatives from some crisis and suicide-prevention hotlines have reported increased call volumes in recent days .\nWhile the shared experience of navigating a pandemic can help individuals connect with one another , \u201c it also is going to be different for different people , so that can create its own challenges , \u201d said Christine Moutier , the chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention .\nA variety of stressors , including job loss , poor health , self-isolation and quarantine , and general anxiety and uncertainty , could negatively impact mental health . Some people may also be struggling with existing conditions such as substance-use disorders or depression .\nBut \u201c people are resilient , \u201d said Vaile Wright , a clinical psychologist and researcher at the American Psychological Association . \u201c We can adapt , \u201d she said . \u201c We can get through this . \u201d\nNormalize any intense uncomfortable emotions you \u2019 re having right now , said Joan Cook , a clinical psychologist and Yale School of Medicine associate professor who studies traumatic stress . Don \u2019 t judge yourself if you feel mild anxiety or depression , loneliness , boredom , frustration or anger . This is an unprecedented time for all of us , she said , and \u201c there are a lot of unknowns . \u201d\n\u201c While it \u2019 s important to ground ourselves by remembering to \u2018 count our blessings \u2019 and be grateful for our lives and any privileges we have , it is equally important for us to acknowledge that social distancing , quarantine or isolation is hard , \u201d Cook said . \u201c And know that you are not alone in finding the consequences of social distancing , like losing our jobs or being physically distanced from family and friends , also very difficult . \u201d\nGive yourself credit if you are following the social-distancing directives of federal , state and local health officials , Cook added . \u201c It \u2019 s important that we give ourselves the recognition when we do a good job , \u201d she said . \u201c You \u2019 re reducing the possibility of transmitting the virus , and protecting those who are most vulnerable . \u201d\nYou may be out of a job or working from home , but you still need to mind your basic human needs . Establish a routine , Wright said : Get enough sleep , get dressed in the morning , take a shower and eat a healthy diet . Exercise , she added , even if it \u2019 s just by going outside for fresh air . Build structure into an otherwise loose day by scheduling all of these needs , Moutier said .\n\u201c Mental health is not only critically important to pay attention to during COVID-19 for its own sake , \u201d Moutier added , \u201c but because the brain is connected to the body , how well we \u2019 re managing our mental health will directly affect our physical health \u2014 for example , things even like the strength of our immune system . \u201d\nStay in connected with friends and family through phone calls , text messages , FaceTime AAPL , -1.43 % video calls and social media . \u201c We all need to put in extra effort right now , \u201d Wright said . If you are struggling with tough emotions , reach out to the most trustworthy person in your life to share how you \u2019 re feeling , Moutier said ; that simple act could be a game changer .\nLaughter and play are \u201c critically necessary \u201d during this time , Moutier added . Moments of humor might be harder to come by right now , but try to prioritize them .\nIf you lack an existing social-support system , \u201c now is the time to go out and find connection with others , even if you don \u2019 t know who they are , \u201d Wright said . Seek out online support groups or social-media communities related to your interests . After all , social distancing is actually physical distancing , Moutier said . \u201c Socially , we can remain even closer . \u201d\nStay informed about the pandemic , especially at your local level , but try to get off your devices too , Wright said . \u201c Find the bit of the news that either empowers you or doesn \u2019 t drive up your anxiety , \u201d she said . Wright , for example , has found that TV pundits and Twitter TWTR , +0.30 % tend to make her more anxious . \u201c Absolutely do not read the news or check stuff before going to sleep , \u201d she added .\nThe federal government has expanded access to telemedicine in response to COVID-19 , as have some states . \u201c If you are in therapy or mental-health treatment , make sure that you continue it and ask your provider specifically if they \u2019 re providing video chat or telehealth , \u201d Moutier said .\nIf you believe your mental health is deteriorating , seek help . \u201c There \u2019 s evidence that shows that telehealth can be as effective as in-person treatment in many instances , \u201d she said . The present situation \u201c could be a tipping point for not just acceptance for telehealth , but also removing the barriers to it around reimbursement and access , \u201d Wright said .\nLook for an app that has scientific backing , as well as mental or behavioral-health experts who served as subject-matter experts , Wright said . Understand the app \u2019 s privacy policy and where your data might go , and look through the reviews . Experts praise the Department of Veteran Affairs \u2019 line of health apps , which includes apps for PTSD coping and mood boosting .\nIs your anxious mind racing at 100 miles per hour ? Theresa Nguyen , the chief program officer for the nonprofit Mental Health America , suggested the mental-heath technique of grounding . \u201c Grounding is a technique to use your five senses and just bring your attention to the present moment , \u201d she said . \u201c It \u2019 s very effective , because your mind can only think about one thing at a time . \u201d\nIf you \u2019 re gardening , for example , put your hand in the soil and just focus on that .

Much about the future of the pandemic remains unknown, and it\u2019s easy to feel a sense of impending doom. Try to shorten the time frame of your perspective, Nguyen said: \u201cIf you find yourself going to, \u2018What if the world is going to end?\u2019 you want to bring it back a little closer to, \u2018What am I going to do in two days, what am I going to do today, what does it look like right now?\u2019\u201d",
