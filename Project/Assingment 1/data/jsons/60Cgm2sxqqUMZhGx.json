The Pingels drove from Watford City , about seven hours away . | AP Photo What a delegate war really looks like The GOP campaigns get up close and personal to woo convention supporters .\nFARGO , N.D. \u2014 With a cocktail in one hand and cellphone in the other , Jessica Unruh was texting with a Donald Trump adviser when a Ted Cruz supporter tapped her on the shoulder .\nSuddenly , she was on the move across the Ramada Plaza ballroom , ushered to the front of a line of fans waiting for a photo with Carly Fiorina , who , upon being whispered Unruh \u2019 s identity , invited her through a back door to a more secluded spot where they could talk . The photo line could wait .\nBy the time Unruh emerged a few minutes later , the Trump adviser who \u2019 d been texting her was waiting himself \u2014 in person . \u201c I \u2019 m so sorry , \u201d she apologized . \u201c I \u2019 m getting pulled away in a million directions. \u201d Soon , Unruh was pulled anew , bypassing another long line in the halls of the hotel to find herself face-to-face with Ben Carson .\n\u201c Two hard sells today , no doubt , \u201d said Unruh , a state senator from North Dakota . She \u2019 s neither a major donor nor famous . But Unruh was a candidate to be one of her state \u2019 s delegates to the Republican National Convention \u2014 a distinction that put her at the center of the political universe over the weekend .\nThis is the new reality of the Republican primary . Cruz and Trump are no longer just battling over states . They \u2019 re battling over people .\nFor months , the fight for the Republican nomination has played out in candidates ' speeches , television interviews , debate performances and megarallies . But amid growing signs that the party could be headed to its first contested convention in a generation , the campaign is now being waged over the individual delegates , people like Unruh , who could ultimately hold the key to the GOP nomination .\n\u201c Here this weekend , ya \u2019 ll are going to be electing 28 delegates , \u201d Cruz said in a speech to the more than 1,600 state officials and activists gathered in Fargo on Saturday . \u201c It is entirely possible the men and women gathered here will decide this entire primary , will decide this nomination . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s no exaggeration . As Cruz presses to deny Trump the 1,237 delegates he needs to secure the Republican nomination in states still to vote like Wisconsin , New York and California , a second front is underway to determine who the actual delegates will be . Most of them will be free to vote for whomever they prefer should Trump fall short on the first ballot . Those in North Dakota were even more coveted ; they will arrive in Cleveland as free agents from the start .\nWhat played out in Fargo over the weekend was , in miniature , a portrait of the delegate battle to come : a mix of intrigue and intense lobbying , whispers of delegate misdirection , a super PAC \u2019 s quiet involvement , and a last-minute push to change the rules as everyone jockeyed to identify and elect loyalists .\nIt was also a preview of what a contested convention might look like . The campaigns argued over big things , like who would make the best president , and little things , like who served the best snacks . And everything seemed potentially decisive .\nSome Trump operatives working the convention bragged about their spread . One noted theirs was the only campaign to offer hot food \u2014 eggrolls and meatballs \u2014 on Friday night : \u201c In a place like this , food is the ultimate swag. \u201d At the convention site itself , among the available food for sale not from the campaigns was oil-and-gas industry themed fare , such as \u201c Frack Jacks \u201d ( buttermilk pancake mix ) , \u201c Drill Bits \u201d ( spicy crackers ) , \u201c Sweet Crude \u201d ( wild chokecherry syrup ) and \u201c Shale Crunch \u201d ( an almond-butter snack ) .\nCruz was the earliest to organize here and unquestionably had the deepest connections on the ground . His top local organizer , Bette Grande , has been supporting him for months , dating back to when Cruz \u2019 s father , Rafael Cruz , came to her house last September during a North Dakota campaign swing . Late Saturday night , as Fiorina posed for pictures nearby , Grande was hunched over a laptop finalizing a pro-Cruz delegate slate that would win big the next day .\nTrump was playing catch-up , but doing so ably , deploying four operatives as he nabbed the endorsement of the state \u2019 s lone House member , Rep. Kevin Cramer , who worked over the weekend to help place at least some Trump supporters on the state party \u2019 s list of recommended delegates .\nJohn Kasich \u2019 s forces were present but not did not compete at the same level . While Cruz came in person and sent Fiorina for three full days as a surrogate and Trump sent Carson for a speech and delegate-wooing , Kasich tapped former New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey , who wandered around the Ramada and convention site as unknown to the people in the crowd as they were to him . In a telling moment , Humphrey addressed the state convention after the ballots for the national delegation had already been cast .\n\u201c I was not familiar with the Kasich surrogate , \u201d said James Poolman , the North Dakota GOP vice chairman , who was elected as a national delegate .\nMeanwhile , an anti-Trump super PAC , Our Principles PAC , was quietly working the delegates to lobby against Trump . The group called every delegate on Friday and Saturday , deployed three local operatives to canvass the crowd and and put anti-Trump literature on every delegate \u2019 s chair .\n\u201c We will fight for every last delegate vote all the way to Cleveland , \u201d said Brian Baker , a senior adviser to the group .\nThe scene in Fargo was strange at times . At one end of the Ramada on Saturday night , Carson was meeting with potential delegates in small groups . At the other , Fiorina was doing the photo line . In between , kids were running the halls in bathing suits , taking advantage of the hotel \u2019 s giant indoor water slide as their parents refilled buckets of bottled beer . Humphrey , meanwhile , held court for an hours-long dinner at the Ramada \u2019 s restaurant with targeted potential delegates .\nOn Saturday , Cruz delivered a 1 p.m. speech but his work began earlier in the the morning , which he spent wooing key North Dakota GOP figures in the tunnels of Scheels Arena , as his campaign team brought selected state activists and supportive lawmakers in for photos and face time .\nCurly Haughland , the state \u2019 s Republican National Committee member , relished all the jockeying . He \u2019 s a longtime advocate of empowering Republican delegates , not the voters , in the primary process . \u201c The members choose in a closed association , \u201d he said . \u201c The voters choose in the fall . \u201d\nHaughland , whose RNC post automatically makes him a national delegate , has kept his 2016 loyalties to himself , as did some other notables . \u201c I have no idea what \u2019 s going on , \u201d Gov . Jack Dalrymple said , when asked about his 2016 favorite . \u201c I \u2019 m a terrible source . \u201d\nThe state party began by selecting a recommended slate of 25 delegates to the national convention , but the well-organized Cruz campaign had other plans . It pushed its own slate on the convention floor . But moments before voting was set to begin , one activist rose and ask all the delegates to declare their allegiances .\nThe party chairman put the idea to a voice vote and said it lost \u2014 only to be showered with boos . He called for a visual vote and again declared the motion a loser . \u201c Call the roll , \u201d came the shouts . He agreed , as the party 's executive director , Roz Leighton , walked off the floor and could be overheard saying , \u201c This has descended into chaos . \u201d\nThings calmed quickly ( the idea was ultimately voted down ) . But it was not hard to imagine a similar scene playing out in 100 days in Cleveland , but on a far larger scale and stage .\nWhen the final tally came in , Cruz \u2019 s campaign had crushed it , successfully filling 18 of the 25 available slots .
