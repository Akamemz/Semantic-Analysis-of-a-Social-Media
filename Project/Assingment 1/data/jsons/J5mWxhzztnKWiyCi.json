What's causing the long lines? It appears that it's the length of the ballot.\n\nProPublica reports that the ballot includes 11 constitutional amendments:\n\n\"Backed by Republican state lawmakers, the proposed amendments among other things seek to prohibit requiring individuals or businesses to purchase or provide health care as specified under the Affordable Care Act, prohibit public funding for abortion except in certain circumstances, and allow public funding for religious organizations. \"Unlike citizen-led ballot initiatives, which require court approval and are bound to a mere 75 words, legislative amendments face no such restrictions \u2013 in either word length or quantity.\"\n\nOne amendment \u2014 which proposes tax breaks for owners of vacation homes \u2014 comes in at 640 words.\n\nIf voters haven't done their homework, they have to read their way through a ballot that in some counties is 12 pages long.\n\nIn Other States:\n\nLong lines were also a problem.
