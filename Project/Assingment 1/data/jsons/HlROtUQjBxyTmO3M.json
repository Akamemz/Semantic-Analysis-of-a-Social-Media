    "content": "First of all , poor Melania . She was just trying to do her part and get the hell out of there . She deviated not a word from the teleprompter , except when thrown by unfamiliar words\u2014like when \u201c adversaries \u201d came out as \u201c advisories. \u201d Hey , they \u2019 re similar .\nSecond of all , how the hell does this even happen ? Watch the video of Melania and Michelle Obama superimposed upon each other , and you get a sense of how audacious the theft was and how perfect-for-TV this brouhaha is . If someone wrote the speech for Melania , how did that person get hired ? And if Melania wrote it herself , who let that happen ? ( Rule for first gentlemen and first ladies : do not pick your own words . )\n\u201c The worst scandals brand you forever . The least serious get forgotten fast and run out of gas in a day . \u201d\nIn case you missed it , I \u2019 m referring to the Melania-Michelle plagiarism flap\u2014that Melania lifted some paragraphs out of Michelle Obama \u2019 s 2008 convention speech . It is a major embarrassment to the Trump campaign and , without doubt , to Melania . That said , let \u2019 s not exaggerate its importance . Writing in The New Republic , Brian Beutler called it \u201c incredibly damaging \u201d \u2014which seems over the top . It \u2019 s devouring the oxygen right now . In 24 hours , it won \u2019 t be .\nEvery scandal has a half-life . The worst scandals brand you forever and keep unfolding forever . The least serious get forgotten fast and run out of gas in a day . I think Melania \u2019 s is of the latter sort .\nTo brand you forever , a scandal needs to reveal something hugely distasteful . This wasn \u2019 t that big a deal . She \u2019 s Donald \u2019 s wife , not Donald . To keep unfolding forever , a scandal needs to have an interesting mystery . This isn \u2019 t that interesting or mysterious . The question of how this blunder happened is worth a story , but not a lot of stories .\nContrast this with the scandal of erstwhile Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , who allegedly yanked a female reporter \u2019 s arm in a boorish manner . That kept going and going because the allegations were very distasteful ( assault ! ) and the mystery was interesting ( did he really do it as claimed ? ) . Every couple of days or so , it seemed , a new video emerged . It was an excellent dumb scandal .\nPlagiarism is one of those sins that doom journalists but not politicians or their wives . In 1987 , when running for president , Joe Biden plagiarized vast passages from Labour Party politician Neil Kinnock , which made for humiliating coverage . In 2008 , Barack Obama lifted passages from Massachusetts then-governor Deval Patrick , a misstep that Obama smoothly batted away by saying Patrick had suggested the lines because of the two men \u2019 s shared philosophy . Both men did okay in the long run .\nSo this will damage Trump a little but not much . The pearl-clutching is taking place in newsrooms , not in America \u2019 s living rooms .
