They need to come to terms with that in order to really help lead and to help push the progressive policy platform forward , \u201d he added of the party \u2019 s 2020 contenders.Leah Greenberg , a co-executive director of Indivisible , added that 2020 candidates who are expressing an openness to expanding the Supreme Court were \u201c exactly right , \u201d because \u201c Republicans have rigged the courts and we need to make them fair and credible again. \u201d Though Democratic grievances on the Supreme Court link back to Garland \u2019 s stonewalled nomination , tensions over the party \u2019 s court strategy have escalated during the Trump administration . Progressives skewered Senate Minority Leader ( D-N.Y. ) when he agreed to a nominations package last year that included 15 judicial nominees . Democrats announced in December that they would not agree to an end-of-the-Congress deal on Trump \u2019 s court picks.Meanwhile , Republicans nixed the 60-vote filibuster in 2017 to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia , in what many Democrats view as a stolen seat . Justice , Trump \u2019 s second pick , was confirmed by the narrowest margin in the Senate for a Supreme Court nominee since 1881 amid allegations of sexual assault and fears by progressives that he would tip the balance of the court to the right for decades. \u201c I think the Kavanaugh nomination has put a fire under progressives when it comes to the Supreme Court . It \u2019 s a recognition of the enormous impact the court has on our lives , the capacity to undermine key progressive victories like voting rights , controlling money in politics , reproductive rights and so forth , \u201d said Caroline Fredrickson , the president of the progressive American Constitution Society.She added that it \u2019 s \u201c not written in stone that the court has nine seats. \u201d A growing number of the party \u2019 s 2020 candidates are showing an openness , if not an outright commitment , to expanding the Supreme Court or making other judicial reforms if they win the White House.South Bend , Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Texas Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke have both signaled they could support expanding the court. \u201c This central objective that is to prevent the Supreme Court from continuing on this trajectory to become basically ruined by being a nakedly political institution , \u201d Buttigieg said during an interview with `` Pod Save America . '' \u201c This idea of adding justices is one way to do it. \u201d One idea , talked up by both O \u2019 Rourke and Buttigieg , would reform the court so that Republicans appointed five justices and Democrats appointed five justices . The 10 justices would then mutually agree on an additional five , bringing the total number on the court to 15.Republicans have lashed out at talk of expanding the courts .\nMcConnell has dismissed it as Democrats \u201c scrounging through the ash-heap of American history \u201d for their ideas .
