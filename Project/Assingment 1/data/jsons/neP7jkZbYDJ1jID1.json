    "content": "President Donald Trump made punishing China for trade misdeeds official U.S. policy on Thursday , imposing tariffs of 25 % on up to $ 60 billion of imports , with a focus on high-tech goods . While not as hostile as the $ 60 billion worth of tariffs floated in recent days , the move signals the beginning of a fractious era for China-U.S. economic relations as the two countries vie for technological supremacy .\nTrump said Thursday 's tariffs were `` the first of many , '' while China 's U.S. ambassador said Beijing is `` not afraid '' of a trade war .\nThe tariffs would apply to `` appropriate products , '' said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer , as the U.S. strikes back at China 's `` policy of forced technology transfer '' and cybertheft . Those products will reportedly include robots , aerospace , high-speed rail , biotech and other categories .\nOnce the list of some 1,300 products is made official , U.S. companies will have a window to comment and potentially seek relief . Trump , who signed a `` memorandum targeting China 's economic aggression , '' according to the White House , characterized the tariffs not as the start of a trade war , but part of `` a very large negotiation '' with Beijing .\nBut Trump said Thursday 's action will be the `` first of many '' to tackle the `` out of control '' U.S.-China trade gap .\n`` We do n't want a trade war with the United States , or with anybody else . But we are not afraid of it . If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us , we will fight , '' Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in a video posted on the Chinese embassy 's Facebook page . He said China `` would fight to the end .. with all necessary measures . ''\nBut he added that China will continue to work to `` manage our possible differences in a constructive way . '' He also said allegations that China is abetting intellectual property theft are `` groundless . ''\nThe Dow Jones industrial average , the S & P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite initially pared losses somewhat after the announcement , but sold off into the close , with all the major averages closing down at least 2.4 % . The Dow tumbled 2.9 % .\nEven as U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports start to kick in on Friday , Trump is making China the central front in his trade war , aiming to punish intellectual-property infringement by Chinese companies , abetted by strong-arm tactics from Beijing . That became clearer after Lighthizer said that the European Union , Brazil , South Korea , Argentina and others would get at least temporary exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs as negotiations proceed . Exemptions already had been granted to Mexico and Canada .\nThe tariffs aimed against China are n't enough to have a noticeable impact on economic growth , and it 's not yet clear how China will respond in the short term .
