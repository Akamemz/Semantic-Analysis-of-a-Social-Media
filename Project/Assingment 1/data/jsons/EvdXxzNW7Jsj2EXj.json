What they haven \u2019 t figured out is how to get this fundamentally different economic system to play by free market rules . A pivotal moment came in 2001 after 15 years of negotiations . China joined the World Trade Organization , which sets the rules for free and fair trade between member countries . \u201c All of the countries that were in the club at the time put enormous demands on China for what they needed to do. \u201d The Chinese committed to sharply lower tariffs and reduced some of the government \u2019 s role in how business gets done . But they argued then , as they still do now , that China is a developing country and so should be held to less stringent free trade standards . The hope was that these first steps would lead to even more sweeping changes . \u201c Why did we assume that ? The experience of communism was through the lens of the Soviet Union and its satellite states , which was ultimately not a success . And so the presumption was , China \u2019 s going to want to become like us , more market oriented. \u201d \u201c After China joined the W.T.O . in 2001 , you saw this enormous surge of Chinese exports to everywhere in the world , and to the United States in particular. \u201d \u201c They were kind of an elephant hiding behind mice with respect to other countries in global trade negotiations at the time. \u201d The U.S. and other countries complained that China was not opening its markets enough , and keeping the value of its currency artificially low to make Chinese exports more attractive . \u201c China has been making great strides using tools that are really not acceptable under the global trade system. \u201d China has continued to operate as a centrally planned economy . The government owns , influences or subsidizes major industries , giving them an artificial competitive edge . There are heavy restrictions on foreign investment , and foreign companies are pressured to share their technologies . \u201c China has become more market oriented , but dating back to probably 2007 , 2008 , I think it was recognized that China wasn \u2019 t on the path to become more like us . And so then countries began to think about , well , what do we do instead ? \u201d \u201c Some view the rise of Asia-Pacific with suspicion and fear . America doesn \u2019 t. \u201d Enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership , initiated by Bush , signed by Obama . \u201c When implemented , It won \u2019 t just boost trade and support jobs in our 12 countries . It will help set stronger rules for trade across the Asia-Pacific. \u201d Put less politely , It was also supposed to be a bulwark to China \u2019 s growing economic power . \u201c The idea was that China would want to join this great trading pact , and so they would have this incentive to reform their economy. \u201d \u201c This is the one that President Trump ripped up on his third day in office. \u201d \u201c The first one is withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201d \u201c I had seen the erosion of popular and congressional support for trade for many years . But I \u2019 d never seen anything like Donald Trump. \u201d \u201c Our founding fathers understood trade much better than our current politicians , believe me. \u201d Trade is generally accepted by economists as win-win for countries on the whole .
