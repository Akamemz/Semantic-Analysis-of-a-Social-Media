Mayor Tom Wheeler ordered police to stand down at the time and received backlash for doing so. The city prepared for the Proud Boys to hold a rally on Saturday, with Antifa showing up to counter protest. Wheeler made it clear that Portland is taking a \"zero tolerance\" policy during Saturday's activities.\n\nDespite the warning, Antifa, once again, became violent.\n\nAt one point, Antifa protestors had The Washington Examiner's Julio Rosas surrounded. They wanted him to report on what was taking place from the other side of the street because he \"wasn't with\" them.\n\nRosas attempted to explain that he was simply reporting on the events for his job but Antifa didn't care. They thought he was \"spying\" on them.\n\nI got surrounded by antifa and they shouted I had to leave. Police came in and took me aside to defuse the situation. pic.twitter.com/EZqLxxJvqZ \u2014 Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) August 17, 2019\n\nHe came up to me again and people again surrounded me.
