    "content": "Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has released his New Year \u2019 s resolutions for 2016 , which include advancing a conservative agenda and building on the success that he claims he has had since he was elected Speaker in October .\nBut , in his first two months as Speaker\u2014and his history before that\u2014Ryan has veered away from every single one of these . That suggests it \u2019 s highly unlikely Ryan will ever , as Speaker\u2014because of his record\u2014actually do anything productive , despite his claims that he has and that he will . His $ 1.1 trillion , two-thousand-plus page long omnibus spending bill alone broke most of these promises .\nDespite Ryan \u2019 s defensive claims in establishment-right media\u2014he \u2019 s appeared on Bill Bennett \u2019 s and Hugh Hewitt \u2019 s radio programs , but refuses to do interviews with actual conservatives like \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Mark Levin , Sean Hannity , or Rush Limbaugh to defend himself\u2014the omnibus spending bill , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 has detailed , was an absolute disaster for conservatives . It funded pretty much every single progressive objective of President Barack Obama \u2019 s efforts to fundamentally change America , and it even surrendered some of the previous small victories that Ryan \u2019 s predecessor , John Boehner , was able to secure , such as a school choice voucher program in Washington , D.C .\nRyan abandoned efforts to promote a \u201c conservative agenda \u201d years ago . Instead , Ryan has been one of the central advocates in the Republican Party for amnesty for illegal aliens and wide open borders with massively increased immigration to America . Ryan , of course , built a giant fence around his mansion in his hometown of Janesville , Wisconsin , but in his omnibus spending bill , he didn \u2019 t provide funding for a fence on the United States border with Mexico\u2014a fence that has been provided for in federal law for years but has yet to be built .\nRyan also promised in a pre-omnibus interview with Fox News \u2019 s Sean Hannity that he wouldn \u2019 t support any cuts to Muslim migration to America . That came after the House Freedom Caucus , according to its chairman , Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-OH ) , failed to obtain any commitment from him on Muslim migration before backing him for Speaker . That \u2019 s not to mention Ryan \u2019 s close relationship with Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( D-IL ) , the progressive left \u2019 s champion for illegal aliens .\nRyan has also served as one of the chief promoters\u2014an architect , if you will\u2014of the Obamatrade plan . He helped shove the Trade Promotion Authority ( TPA ) fast-track legislation\u2014which aims to grease the skids for the 5,544-page-long Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) globalist trade deal that empowers the Sultan of Brunei and potentially puts American communities at risk of succumbing to the Sultan \u2019 s brand of Sharia Law due to sovereignty concerns regarding land control in the deal\u2014through the House over conservative objections . Ryan , of course , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported at the time , also snuck a phony fix to immigration provisions into the TPA plan .\nAfter BuzzFeed \u2019 s McKay Coppins wrote one of the most vicious and inaccurate profiles on now-2016 GOP frontrunner Donald Trump\u2014prompting Trump to call him a \u201c scumbag \u201d and expose his lewd behavior toward women working at Trump \u2019 s Mar-A-Lago resort\u2014Ryan took Coppins to church with him for a glowing liberal profile in a leftist rag .\nThat \u2019 s not to mention Ryan \u2019 s horrendous big picture spending and budget deals . This latest omnibus\u2014which , again , Ryan has desperately tried to defend as some kind of win for conservatives , when everyone including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi knows that \u2019 s just not true\u2014is hardly his first awful big deal . Back in late 2013 , then-House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan negotiated a budget deal with then-Senate Budget Committee chairwoman Sen. Patty Murray ( D-WA ) .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported at the time , along with analysis from Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-AL ) , the Ryan-Murray budget deal increased the national deficit by at least $ 15.5 billion . Despite the spending increase\u2014again , hardly a conservative principle\u2014the deal cut veterans \u2019 pensions in order to pay for funding of tax credits that the United States government , at Ryan \u2019 s urging , has been wrongly paying out to illegal aliens across the country .\nRyan has frequently also swooped in at the last minute to bail out GOP establishment efforts to spend more taxpayer money . He backed the so-called \u201c CR-Omnibus \u201d in late 2014 , a bill that\u2014after virtually every Republican promised not to on the campaign trail , including the party chairman Reince Priebus\u2014ended up funding President Obama \u2019 s 2014 executive amnesty for illegal alien adults and his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood ( DACA ) executive amnesty for illegal alien children .\nAll that \u2019 s just the tip of the iceberg of Ryan \u2019 s anti-conservative actions in Congress\u2014a taste of what \u2019 s to come if he keeps following through with his historical viewpoint of pushing a \u201c conservative agenda . \u201d\nSo , now that his first New Year \u2019 s Resolution is thoroughly debunked\u2014he may end up changing , and conservatives can only hope he does , but most people don \u2019 t change\u2014let \u2019 s look at the rest of them .\nAs for GOP \u201c unity , \u201d while Ryan did end up securing support from many House Freedom Caucus members\u2014more than a majority of them\u2014he actually never earned an official endorsement from the group for his Speakership bid . To have gotten that , Ryan would have needed 80 percent of the group to support him in a House Speakership race . Ryan failed to achieve that . Interestingly enough , Ryan pledged to the American people\u2014and to House Republicans\u2014that he wouldn \u2019 t run for the House Speakership without an endorsement from the House Freedom Caucus , so his decision to run for the Speakership in the beginning was , like so many other things he \u2019 s done , built on an abject lie .\nMany House Republicans have given Ryan a pass in his first couple months as Speaker . They blame Boehner for a lot of the problems of the conference , and for the mess that currently exists . But again , if Ryan continues down the pathway that he \u2019 s been on so far , it \u2019 s hard to see enough of the Republican conference standing behind him and continuing to support him . The more liberal wing of the GOP conference , on the other hand , is likely to continue to push Ryan to support Boehner-esque K-Street goodie-laden legislation\u2014and the divide is almost certainly going to split up that \u201c unity \u201d that Ryan is pushing for .\nRyan \u2019 s third promise for the New Year\u2014 \u201c decentralized power \u201d away from the Speaker \u2019 s office\u2014has , to his credit , seen some advancement , although minor in the grand scheme of things . Ryan allowed Rep. Tim Huelskamp ( R-KS ) onto the powerful House Steering Committee , an entity that decides which members get on which committees . Some senior conservative aides\u2014chiefs of staff and other senior aides\u2014tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Ryan \u2019 s team has been much more open than Boehner \u2019 s was with them in the legislative process and is listening to them about concerns . It \u2019 s really not that hard to be better than nothing\u2014what Boehner was , who was so bad he \u2019 d literally call his own Republican members swear words while not even trying to work with conservatives\u2014so it \u2019 s not a huge improvement on Ryan \u2019 s part . It remains to be seen if Ryan will implement any actual structural reforms in the House of Representatives whatsoever , and he hasn \u2019 t as of this time done any of that .\nHe did , however , when failing to earn an official endorsement from the House Freedom Caucus , walk into a closed-door meeting with that group and basically promise them the world . Ryan promised them he \u2019 d give up the five votes\u2014which helps a Speaker centralize power\u2014the Speaker has on the Steering Committee ; that there wouldn \u2019 t be an amnesty or immigration bill until President Obama left office ; he pledged an end to retaliation against GOP members by GOP leadership , and he promised a return to regular order .\nDuring that Freedom Caucus meeting , Ryan \u2019 s plan was that the only way he \u2019 d run for Speaker was if House Republicans surrendered the ability under House Rules\u2014he wanted to change the rules\u2014to bring to the floor what \u2019 s a called a resolution to vacate the chair . That procedure\u2014which conservatives used to successfully bring Boehner to his knees and force him out of office\u2014would forcefully remove a Speaker who wasn \u2019 t fulfilling the will of the conference that elected him or her . That rule was literally put in place by Thomas Jefferson , a Founding Father , America \u2019 s third president , and the author of America \u2019 s Declaration of Independence from tyrant King George of Great Britain in 1776 . Not good enough for Ryan , it seems .\nHe hasn \u2019 t given up the five votes of the Speaker on the Steering Committee . He broke the immigration pledge by inserting into the omnibus bill a massive increase in H2B visas that allow more guest workers into America . He hasn \u2019 t done anything to prevent further retaliation against conservatives . And he hasn \u2019 t taken any steps back towards regular order\u2014and in fact has used back room procedures to block amendments on legislation of national importance , specifically a flawed refugee resettlement bill that Ryan falsely claimed \u201c paused \u201d Obama \u2019 s plans to resettle thousands of Syrians in cities and towns across America in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks . The only thing that bill did was require three people who serve at the pleasure of the president\u2014the FBI director , Secretary of Homeland Security , and Director of National Intelligence\u2014to sign off on the president \u2019 s plans . Ryan jammed that bill through the House by bringing it to the floor on a closed rule\u2014blocking any amendments to it from any members of the House\u2014then Ryan proceeded to fund the entire program with taxpayer dollars .\nThat means Ryan has already broken the second half of his fourth New Year \u2019 s resolution\u2014Regular Order\u2014and as for the first half of that resolution , Transparency , Ryan has that one covered in at least a couple different places . Firstly , in Ryan \u2019 s pre-Speakership-bid meeting with the House Freedom Caucus , a second demand\u2014in addition to eliminating from the House rules Jefferson \u2019 s rule against a tyrannical Speaker\u2014Ryan had for members was they couldn \u2019 t tell anyone what happened in that meeting , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported at the time .\nThen there \u2019 s also Obamatrade again . Back when members were pushing through\u2014at Ryan \u2019 s insistence\u2014the fast-track authority for the TPP and other trade deals , the text of the TPP was kept hidden in the basement of the U.S. Capitol and only made available to actual members of Congress who visited a classified reading room to view it . Now that it \u2019 s clear that it \u2019 s 5,544 pages long\u2014bigger than Obamacare and the Ryan-backed , Sen. Marco Rubio-championed \u201c Gang of Eight \u201d amnesty bill last congress combined\u2014there \u2019 s not a snowball \u2019 s chance in hell any member , including Ryan , who backed TPA actually read the TPP deal . That \u2019 s not to mention the fact that the other two major trade deals that TPA will grease through Congress , the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( T-TIP ) and the Trade In Services Agreement ( TiSA ) still have no text available for even members of Congress to read .\nAs for a culture change , Ryan \u2019 s fifth New Year \u2019 s resolution , when he \u2019 s doing all the same things as Boehner it \u2019 s truly hard to see anything shifting on Capitol Hill . He might be right about a culture change on Capitol Hill , though , just in a direction that \u2019 s not just anti-conservative but anti-Republican : Ryan has reportedly been planning to work closely with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid , whose party is in the minority , on major initiatives . When he announced that to a room full of his own Republican members , they laughed in Ryan \u2019 s face .\nLongtime conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly , in an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 published in mid-December , blew up Ryan \u2019 s sixth New Year \u2019 s resolution : the promise of a \u201c Next-Generation Platform . \u201d\nIn the interview , Schlafly called Ryan the Republican of yesterday because he backs issues that Republicans aren \u2019 t supposed to . \u201c Those are the issues we thought we beat when we elected a Republican Congress , \u201d Schlafly said of the globalist trade and mass immigration policies Ryan supports . \u201c It turned out we didn \u2019 t . \u201d\nAs for Ryan \u2019 s seventh and final New Year \u2019 s resolution\u2014Building on Progress\u2014how \u2019 s it possible to add to something you haven \u2019 t even started ?",
