That's how long the grand jury deliberated before deciding not to bring an indictment against Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9. St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced the grand jury had heard more than 70 hours of testimony from 60 witnesses before reaching its decision, which he said was supported by physical evidence.\n\nSadly, the grand jury's failure to return an indictment of Wilson was not surprising.

His brother, uncle and cousin served with the St. Louis Police Department, and his mother worked there for 20 years as a clerk. Newsweek noted McCulloch's \"long history of siding with the police.\" For the sake of impartiality, McCulloch should have let a special prosecutor take over the case.\n\nThe grand jury only needed to find \"probable cause\" to charge Wilson. That's one of the lowest legal standards in our justice system, below \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" (required for a criminal conviction) and \"preponderance of the evidence\" (the standard in a civil trial). The fact that McCulloch did not get an indictment for a killing that shocked the nation raises questions about whether he really wanted an indictment.\n\n\"We will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury,\" McCulloch said in August.

But the Ferguson proceedings dragged on for months, putting a burden on the jurors to recall everything and then decide wisely.

He chose not to do so, which is a troubling indicator of his interest in aggressively prosecuting this case.\n\nOpinion: Ferguson shows failure at every level\n\nSure, there are conflicting accounts of what transpired between Wilson and Michael Brown. Was Wilson in fear for his life, as he told investigators, when he and Brown struggled for his gun? Did Brown have his hands up when he was fatally shot?
