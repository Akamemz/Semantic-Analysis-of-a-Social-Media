We are bound by ideals. \u201d Barack Obama spent much of his presidency waging cultural warfare against the Jacksonians . But conservatives are now in danger of overcorrecting toward nationalism .\nOver the Fourth of July weekend , the discussion broke out again , with Jonah Goldberg responding to an episode of NRO \u2019 s The Editors podcast , and some of the eponymous editors ( Rich Lowry , Michael Brendan Dougherty , Ian Tuttle , Charles Cooke ) picking up the gauntlet .\nThere has always been a strong tension in our history between the conception of America as devoted to an ideal and as a people , a nation \u2014 in a similar if not quite the same sense as some blood-and-soil European countries . Thus Abraham Lincoln , echoing Jefferson , could describe us as \u201c a . . . nation . . . dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. \u201d But he could also write stirring blood-and-soil appeals , evoking in his First Inaugural \u201c the mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battle-field , and patriot grave , to every living heart and hearthstone , all over this broad land . \u201d\nIn the beginning , the tension between the two was not immediately apparent . The British colonists were an island people ; their native country had a breakaway , national church that was fully at home neither with the Catholics nor the Protestant denominations on the European mainland . Moreover , the settlers whose descendants would form the \u201c Jacksonian \u201d folk-group hewed to a harsher form of Protestant Calvinism that set them further apart , because they were a minority even within that island , and because predestination held that only a select few souls were saved . Meanwhile , their culture had been shaped by centuries living in one war-torn borderland ( most of them came from the region between northern England and southern Scotland ) and occupying another ( as Protestant settlers of Ireland , hence the term \u201c Scotch-Irish \u201d ) . This experience led the Scotch-Irish \u201c Jacksonians \u201d in particular to see the outside world as hostile and alien . The creeds of the original colonists might have been universal in theory , therefore , but in practice few wanted to live like them or among them : The nation-as-ideal could be ( and , particularly among the Jacksonians , was strongly felt to be ) coterminous with the folk-group .\nBut in the New World , five factors began to make America different . For one thing , the continent was huge and underpopulated ; from the earliest settlements through the \u201c closing of the frontier \u201d in 1891 , there was strong demand for immigrants to settle and secure the country . But other underpopulated frontier countries have , despite their apparent self-interest , successfully resisted immigration from different societies before . Americans chose to go a different route .\nThe struggles of the Protestant Reformation had taught the English to view other Protestant nations \u2014 Switzerland , Protestant Germany , Scandinavia \u2014 where their leaders had sometimes sought refuge , as a brotherhood . Now , many immigrants from these countries settled among the British colonists ; a small step away from a peoplehood of blood . Another step came from , ironically , the intensity of the religious feelings among the different groups of American settlers , especially the Puritans and Jacksonians . They each marked themselves as a people apart so fiercely and so successfully that when they had to cooperate again as the colonies grew , and especially during the struggle for independence , it looked as much like learning to forge one nation out of many as trying to band a bunch of Englishmen together .\nA bigger step : Because of their own religious beliefs , the Quakers in Pennsylvania and the Catholics in Maryland had let in many of the \u201c wrong \u201d ( i.e. , Catholic or heterodox ) sort of immigrant prior to the Revolution . The door that the Irish would later stream through in droves had already been propped open . Finally , the Declaration of Independence , as Charles C. W. Cooke pointed out on The Editors podcast , laid down a marker for all time which , no matter how often we may stray from it ( we are human , we err ) is there to remind us that we believe all men are created equal . This is our patrimony ; we can never fully reject it without rejecting ourselves .\nBy the time the colonies became a nation the stage was set for mass immigration \u2014 which for obvious reasons strained the tension between America \u2019 s sense of being a folk-group ( which strongly persisted , particularly in the backcountry ) and its universalist ideals .\nContrary to the bromide that America has always been a \u201c nation of immigrants \u201d ( in comparison with our supposed modern anti-immigrant sins ) , this wasn \u2019 t a process that was easy . In fact , it was much , much harder then than now . For every stripe of British Protestant , Catholics had been the ur-outsider ; by the 1830s and \u2019 40s they were coming by the millions , my ancestors among them , out of starving Ireland and Catholic Germany . In the spring of 1844 , nativist mobs burned Catholic churches in Philadelphia , killed dozens , and razed an immigrant neighborhood . Further north , the Archbishop of New York threatened to burn the city to the ground if his own mayor didn \u2019 t do a better job of protecting his flock . Two decades later , the largest urban insurrection in American history occurred as Irish immigrants rioted against conscription ; several regiments had to be dispatched from the pursuit of Lee after Gettysburg to restore order .\nIn the spring of 1844 , nativist mobs burned Catholic churches in Philadelphia , killed dozens , and razed an immigrant neighborhood .\nDuring the so-called Great Wave of Eastern and Southern European immigration in the late 19th century , the largest movement of people into America until the present day , there was a backlash : The Klan was renewed as an anti-immigrant force , deadly violence was widespread ( ranging from mass lynchings to anarchist bombings ) , and racial and religious discrimination was written into law , including the 1924 act that eventually nailed the \u201c Golden Door \u201d shut ( and kept it that way for two generations , despite the horrors of the Holocaust and the Second World War ) .\nNow , we are in the middle of a third wave of immigration . It has lasted longer and brought more people than any before , and if we are now feeling the tensions in our body politic , we can comfort ourselves that they are not nearly so bad as those in ages past . By historical standards , we \u2019 re doing a pretty good job . By the standards we like to hold ourselves to , on the other hand , we are right to be worried . The tension between the two ideals of American life has risen to the surface again , affecting every aspect of our politics and , increasingly , our daily lives .\nBut if the past has been rougher than is usually remembered , it \u2019 s equally vital that we trust a truth on the far side of a complexity : We are a nation of immigrants , and our ability to absorb and integrate 80 million people since 1820 ( when records were first kept ) has been an achievement without parallel in world history . So successful have we been , indeed , that many nations with no similar history have come to take it as axiomatic that democracy and mass immigration are synonymous , with implications that are being worked out across Europe as we speak .\nMeanwhile , in America , we have a somewhat different problem . The Baby Boomers were often the children or grandchildren of immigrants but were born during the end of the 1924-65 period when there was almost no legal immigration to the United States . That means on the one hand they \u2019 ve inherited a rich memory of the possibilities that America offers immigrants and immigrants offer America ; on the other , until recently , they had no living memory of the problems that mass immigration could cause in American society when it brings American idealism and Jacksonian nationalism into conflict . Furthermore , because one of the defining heroic moments of their childhood was the Civil Rights movement , and because that was opposed on ethno-nationalist grounds , they have a tendency to view Jacksonian nationalism tout court with suspicion .\nSo given our history , why not just be done with nationalism entirely ? This is the intuition of the \u201c woke \u201d Left , which tends to be more aware of this history than does the center \u2014 and to see it as of a piece with America \u2019 s ( much worse ) history of discrimination and violence against African Americans .\nThe center-left and center-right don \u2019 t perceive America as irredeemably broken in the same way the far Left does . But they do tend to believe that the \u201c universal solvent \u201d of American idealism has broken down past bigotries , and the virtues of the ideas-based country have conquered the demons of its populist side .\nThere are three big problems with such an approach . The first is the prosaic but important observation , obvious after 2016 , that many of their fellow citizens simply do not agree that nationalism should be buried . In a democracy , that raw fact matters .\nSecondly , and more important : Jacksonian instincts have been a powerful force for good , as well as evil , throughout American history . Jackson \u2019 s channeling of backcountry egalitarianism led to universal white male suffrage \u2014 and that in turn was the basis and animating spirit for truly universal suffrage . Whatever the seventh president might have thought of them , he \u2019 s the grandfather of the 15th and 19th Amendments . Jacksonian might has sustained and protected America \u2019 s ideals through the Revolution , Civil War , two World Wars , and the Cold War . Nor is this just a question of providing a raw mass of men ; leadership , too , has come from Jacksonian ranks . ( The most Jacksonian figure of the Civil War was arguably not Robert E. Lee , the Virginia Cavalier , but the unassuming , hard-fighting Ulysses S . Grant . ) And the sense of community with fellow-citizens that Jacksonian nationhood imbues in people has been at the heart of many of the ways by which we take care of one another , from the New Deal ( the Democrats used to remember this back when they won elections ) to the Burkean interstitial institutions Republicans would like to see greater reliance on .\nImmigrants themselves are looking to join the folk group , not to abolish it .\nFinally , the evidence of both history and our present moment strongly shows that immigrants themselves are looking to join the folk group , not to abolish it .\nIn every wave of immigration , vastly more people return home than popular legend acknowledges \u2014 as many as half of all Italians in the early 20th century , for instance .
