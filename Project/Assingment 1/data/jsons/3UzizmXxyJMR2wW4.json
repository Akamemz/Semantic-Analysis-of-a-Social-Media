    "content_original": "Thursday, April 25, on the Southern Methodist University campus in Dallas, Texas, four living presidents \u2014 Jimmy Carter, No. 39; George H.W. Bush, No. 41; Bill Clinton, No. 42, and Barack Obama, No. 44 \u2014 will honor one of their colleagues, George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, at the dedication of his presidential library.\n\nSo I take this occasion to remind my fellow liberal Democrats, many of whom continue to attack Bush in harsh and personal terms, of three things about him that I don\u2019t think they understand or appreciate.\n\nFirst, while there were many polices under Bush with which liberal Democrats (myself included) disagreed \u2014 such as tax cuts, the Iraq War and not paying for either (as well as the Afghan war) with current revenues rather than borrowed money \u2014 there must be a distinction between disagreement and personal attack.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nFor example, many Democrats still use the \u201clie\u201d word in describing Bush\u2019s rationale for the Iraq War \u2014 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This turned out to be wrong.But Democrats in the Clinton administration also believed Saddam had WMDs, as did most experts in the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nOur politics have become so poisoned and our government so dysfunctional precisely because too many people \u2014 on both sides \u2014 can\u2019t make a distinction between lies and being sincerely wrong.\n\nSecond, Bush is known for his brilliant slogan when he first ran in 2000, describing himself as a \u201ccompassionate conservative.\u201d But let\u2019s not forget that on many issues, Bush was more \u201ccompassionate\u201d than \u201cconservative\u201d \u2014 indeed, he was sometimes closer to Republican Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s free-market progressivism than William Howard Taft\u2019s laissez-faire conservatism.\n\nExamples include \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d education reform, presented together at the White House by Bush and the liberal icon Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) in the early days of the Bush presidency; support for broad immigration reform, very similar to the bipartisan legislation recently proposed in the Senate; and an extension of Medicare to include prescription drug benefits \u2014 the most far-reaching and generous Medicare reform since Lyndon Johnson.\n\nThird, it is important to remember what a good man with a good heart George W. Bush is.\n\nI know from personal experience.\n\nAs I have written before, I remember sitting next to Bush when we were in the same residential college at Yale (Davenport \u2014 he graduated a year after me). I recall an evening when a group of us was sitting in the common room outside the college dining hall after dinner and a fellow Yale student walked by who was known to be gay, but in those days was not \u201cout.\u201d Someone said some ugly homophobic slurs.\n\nI didn\u2019t like it, yet sat silently. But Bush snapped, saying something like \u201cHey, knock it off. Why don\u2019t you walk in his shoes awhile and feel what he feels?\u201d\n\nI remember thinking, \u201cWhoa.

Laura and I will miss our pal.\u201d\n\nI know my mom in heaven, who would never have voted for George W. Bush for president, would have read that comment about Barney and insisted:\n\n\u201cHe is a good man.\u201d\n\nI agree.\n\nGodspeed to you, George Bush, and blessings for your mom and dad and family on this great occasion.",
