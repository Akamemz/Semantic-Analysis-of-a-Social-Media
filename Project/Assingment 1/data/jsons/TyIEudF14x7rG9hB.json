In truth, his brand of populism isn\u2019t particularly new \u2014 it\u2019s a merger of Pat Buchanan\u2013era paleoconservatism and Bush-era compassionate conservatism. It\u2019s an attempt to rally government behind preferred conservative causes \u2014 rebuilding the family chief among them \u2014 rather than recognizing that government is typically an obstacle to those causes; it\u2019s an attempt to fill a gap in the soul with a policy-based solution.\n\nHere\u2019s Carlson\u2019s explanation of markets:\n\nMarket capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You\u2019d have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\n\nThis sounds far more like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren than it does like Ronald Reagan or Milton Friedman. That\u2019s because the democratic socialist movement has a lot in common with the economic populism of the Right. The Marxist Left claims that human failings are the result of private property\u2013based economic systems; therefore, private property\u2013based systems must be destroyed. Social democrats like Sanders and Warren agree, but also acknowledge the inherent power of markets (although Sanders speaks more like a Marxist than a social democrat). Social democrats believe that shackling the power of the market to the redistributive and regulatory power of the state represents the best way forward. That\u2019s why Sanders and Warren use the Nordic states as their models, rather than Cuba or the Soviet Union.\n\nThe populist Right largely agrees. Carlson explicitly states, along with Sanders and Warren, that voluntary decisions can amount to exploitation; he blames rich Americans for somehow, in unspecified fashion, convincing poorer Americans to conceive children out of wedlock. The free-market system, according to Carlson, has provided us with a lot of stuff, and \u201cyet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country.\u201d Therefore, free markets are responsible for our empty souls as well as for our fuller fridges.\n\nBut that\u2019s untrue. Typically, religious thinkers, as well as our founding fathers, recognized that prosperity could not exist without freedom, and that freedom could not exist without virtue. Free markets, in fact, were a result of certain virtuous underpinnings and fundamental conceptions about the value of individual human beings: Human beings were made in the image of God, had special value, were masters of their own labor, and could freely alienate that labor in voluntary transactions with others. Separating freedom from virtue would undercut freedom itself \u2014 we would inevitably begin to twist freedom to harm others as well as ourselves. As George Washington put it, \u201cof all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. . . . Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.\u201d James Madison agreed: \u201cTo suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout religion and morality we could, for a time, remain rich.
