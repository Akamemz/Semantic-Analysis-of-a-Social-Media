    "content": "Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ( R ) and his Democratic challenger Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke just had what was likely to be their last face-to-face debate before the November 6 midterm elections .\nAs they sparred over Medicare-for-all , the GOP tax cuts , and border security , both candidates continued to try to appeal to their bases in a race that has captured national attention and money and built up long-held Democratic hopes of turning Texas blue .\nCruz argued that O \u2019 Rourke is dangerously liberal , while O \u2019 Rourke called Cruz out-of-step and beholden to Republican donors .\nCruz emphasized that O \u2019 Rourke is too \u201c radical \u201d for Texas \u2014 trying to paint him as more to the left than progressive Sens . Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) and Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) .\nO \u2019 Rourke , on the other hand , repeatedly called Cruz a liar and accused him of taking votes to please Republican donors rather than working for the people of Texas . He even adopted a nickname from President Trump : \u201c Sen . Cruz is not going to be honest with you , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke said at one point . \u201c He \u2019 s dishonest , that \u2019 s why the president called him \u2018 lying Ted , \u2019 and that \u2019 s why the nickname stuck , it \u2019 s true . \u201d\nO \u2019 Rourke raised eye-popping $ 38 million in just three months , the most of any Senate candidate . There is undeniable hype surrounding his candidacy . But he is still the underdog in deep-red Texas . Even though some polling has shown the race in close single digits , Cruz has been in the lead in every single poll and is currently leading by 7 points , according to RealClearPolitics .\nO \u2019 Rourke still has another televised town hall with CNN that Cruz has said he won \u2019 t attend , so Tuesday night \u2019 s debate was the last chance for both candidates to be on stage and make their closing arguments together .\n1 ) Cruz is challenged on his vote for GOP tax cuts \u2014 and O \u2019 Rourke paints him as corrupt\nThe sweeping GOP tax cuts became a moment of contention in the Texas Senate debate when Cruz was asked by moderator Jason Whitely to square his longtime stance to not increase the national deficit with voting for a GOP tax bill that is projected to increase the national deficit by more than $ 1 trillion .\nOver his career in the Senate , Cruz was a noted critic of government spending under the Obama administration , calling it \u201c immoral \u201d spending that would add to the national debt . But when it came for Republicans running deficits , Cruz went on the defense .\n\u201c I \u2019 m proud to have supported the tax cut , the tax cut is producing enormous benefits for the state of Texas and for the country , \u201d Cruz responded . Soon after , Whitely challenged Cruz by asking about the projection of the Congressional Budget Office , Joint Committee on Taxation , and other nonpartisan groups that the tax cut will in fact add $ 1.6 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years .\n\u201c No it wouldn \u2019 t \u2014 that projection is wrong , \u201d Cruz said . \u201c The reason we have deficit and debt is not because we cut taxes and grow the economy . We need to control the out-of-control spending by cutting things like socialized medicine . \u201d\nO \u2019 Rourke used the opportunity to paint Cruz as corrupt , saying he voted for tax cuts and other Republican bills at the direction of donors and PACs \u2014 and highlighting his own pledge not to take PAC money .\n\u201c Follow the money , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke said . \u201c Those tax cuts will disproportionately flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash in a country that is riven with income inequality unseen seen since the last Gilded Age . \u201d\nO \u2019 Rourke is running as a progressive candidate in Texas , and Cruz seized on that . Cruz wanted voters who watched Tuesday \u2019 s debate to believe O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s vision for America was one with socialized medicine bogged down by long wait times , extremely high costs for the government , and open borders that would lead to immigrants streaming into the US .\nCruz \u2019 s stance on immigration is largely focused on securing the border . He \u2019 s interested in expanding H1-B visas for skilled immigrants but railed against amnesty for immigrants who arrived in the US illegally . O \u2019 Rourke , on the other hand , wants to pass the DREAM Act and provide a path to citizenship for DREAMers , the young unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the US illegally as children .\nWhen it came to the immigration issue , Cruz played to fears about crime south of the border , saying O \u2019 Rourke opposed even the most basic border security .\n\u201c Congressman O \u2019 Rourke not only opposes a wall ... he wants to tear down the ones we have , \u201d Cruz said , noting the wall between O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s hometown of El Paso , Texas , and neighboring Juarez , Mexico . \u201c There \u2019 s a wall there , that wall is one of the tools you use to protect us . \u201d\nO \u2019 Rourke shot back , saying the immigration policy he supports is about more than border walls \u2014 including a pathway to citizenship DREAMers .\n\u201c I care about the safety of every single person in the state of Texas , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke said . \u201c No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns , but smart policy will . \u201d\nThroughout the debate , Cruz called O \u2019 Rourke \u201c extreme , \u201d saying he was to the left of Bernie Sanders . There \u2019 s a strategy to this ; as Texas political scientist James Henson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Tara Golshan , Cruz is trying to define O \u2019 Rourke negatively because his name ID is still relatively low compared to the Republican senators .\nOne of the repeated attacks Cruz has lobbed at O \u2019 Rourke is that he would be weak on crime and not support law enforcement . That was something O \u2019 Rourke seemed eager to address on Tuesday ; he highlighted his support for local law enforcement multiple times .\n3 ) The debate showed two candidates still trying to appeal to the Democratic and Republican bases\nFundamentally , O \u2019 Rourke and Cruz \u2019 s messaging \u2014 and the voters they \u2019 re trying to appeal to \u2014 hasn \u2019 t really changed since they first started campaigning . Cruz is very much appealing to the state \u2019 s conservative base by attempting to paint his opponent as somewhat of a left-wing boogeyman . And he has good reason to : Older , whiter voters in Texas are more likely to turn out , and more likely to vote Republican .\nSo , predictably , Cruz hit at that message again on Tuesday . As the men debated health care and O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s support for Medicare-for-all , Cruz suggested that O \u2019 Rourke wanted to add illegal immigrants to the program , thus taking it away from senior citizens .\n\u201c The cost would be immense , \u201d Cruz said . \u201c He wants to put everyone who hasn \u2019 t paid into Medicare on Medicare . That would bankrupt Medicare . \u201d\nO \u2019 Rourke is making a noticeable effort to reach out to the state \u2019 s nonwhite populations \u2014 notably African Americans and Latinos \u2014 by talking about police brutality , race relations , and the importance of immigrants in the United States . It \u2019 s something he brought up in the first Senate debate in September but didn \u2019 t mention as much on Tuesday night . Instead , O \u2019 Rourke focused more on Latino voters , reiterating his support for the DREAM Act .\nO \u2019 Rourke is undoubtedly trying the riskier tactic to pull off a win in Texas , as nonwhite voters \u2014 especially Latino voters \u2014 tend to have much lower voter turnout rates . Whether they do come out for O \u2019 Rourke in November will tell us whether something big has changed in the Lone Star State \u2014 or not .",
