Ms. Carroll is the 22 nd woman to accuse him of sexual assault or misconduct . He talked crudely of grabbing women on the infamous Access Hollywood tape .\nBut Times executive editor Dean Baquet now says they should have played the story bigger . Ms. Carroll is a respected public figure . And she is publicly accusing a sitting chief executive of the United States .\nMedia ethicists say that it \u2019 s essential for editors to approach such stories carefully . They need to weigh evidence and check things out . The New York Times , for instance , tried to find corroborating evidence for the charges . Beyond two friends Ms. Carroll says she told at the time , they haven \u2019 t yet .\nPresident Trump denies the charges . He says Ms. Carroll is just trying to promote her latest book .\nLast week the Elle magazine columnist accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in a department store dressing room 23 years ago . Now critics and many journalists are openly questioning why this news didn \u2019 t get bigger play in The New York Times and other major media outlets .\nLast Friday , when the writer and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan 23 years ago , few of the nation \u2019 s major media outlets treated it as bombshell news .\nJust a few days later , however , many journalists and critics have begun to wonder why . The president immediately denied what would have been an explosive , news-dominating allegation , and he quickly attacked the well-known author \u2019 s credibility , suggesting her possible ulterior motives .\nMs. Carroll leveled her accusations , after all , in an excerpt taken from her fifth book , and published Friday in New York Magazine \u2013 a little more than a week before her book \u2019 s scheduled release . \u201c Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to get publicity for themselves , or sell a book , or carry out a political agenda , \u201d President Trump said .\nThe columnist \u2019 s accusation and the president \u2019 s denial were all but absent in this weekend \u2019 s headlines and Sunday morning roundtables , and many media watchers decried the fact that this latest allegation barely caused a stir .\nYet when it comes to discerning the credibility of those who allege sexual assault , many media ethicists and journalists say , it is actually essential that news outlets react in a sober-minded and particularly careful way .\n\u201c I do think that in the MeToo era , news outlets have had to be extremely cautious and extremely meticulous about what they publish , \u201d says Lauren Wright , lecturer in politics and public affairs at Princeton University in New Jersey , and a frequent political analyst on Fox News , CNN , and other news outlets . \u201c They do check it out , they do figure it out , and they do have that due diligence process , and that sometimes takes a few days . \u201d\nThe reporting of The New York Times and other outlets , in fact , helped give voice to the many women who were sexually harassed and assaulted by Hollywood moguls like Harvey Weinstein as well as Fox News titans Bill O \u2019 Reilly and Roger Ailes .\nStill , critics singled out the particular dearth of coverage in this weekend \u2019 s editions of the Times , which won a Pulitzer Prize for its investigations of what became the # MeToo movement . On Monday , the publication \u2019 s executive editor , Dean Baquet , admitted that \u201c we were overly cautious \u201d in their handling of Ms. Carroll \u2019 s allegations against the president .\nBut Mr. Baquet also provided insight into the guidelines the paper employs when trying to assess the credibility of an accuser . These include locating sources other than those mentioned by the accusers who are willing to corroborate their allegations on the record . In this story , Mr. Baquet said , The Times could not find any independent sources beyond the two friends Ms. Carroll cited in her book , or any other additional corroborating evidence .\nNevertheless , given that a respected public figure like Ms. Carroll , whose advice column \u201c Ask E. Jean \u201d has appeared in Elle magazine since 1993 , was making a public allegation against a sitting president \u201c should \u2019 ve compelled us to play it bigger , \u201d he said .\n\u201c But the history of coverage of sexual assault in America \u2019 s media has always been one of extreme caution , and that is driven by a sense of fairness , \u201d says Ken Paulson , former editor-in-chief of USA TODAY and now the director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro . \u201c It \u2019 s an allegation that , once unveiled , never gets put away . \u201d\nAnd all things being equal , Mr. Paulson suggests , President Trump \u2019 s questions about the credibility of his accuser and her possible motives are usually valid concerns .\n\u201c If you take the same fact situation , and someone in your community accuses a small-town mayor of rape from 23 years earlier , and there \u2019 s no other indications of such behavior , \u201d he says , \u201c you would look at that with considerable caution . You would ask understandable questions : Why is the allegation being made today ? \u201d\nBut as he and other observers point out , all things are far from equal when it comes to President Trump . Ms. Carroll is the 22nd woman to accuse Trump on the record of sexual assault or misconduct , and hers is in many ways the most serious , as she alleges an attack that included forced penetration .\nAdd to these accusations , too , the fact that the president described sexually assaulting women in the infamous Access Hollywood video and audiotapes .\n\u201c The credibility regarding charges of sexual assault should be the same as in any other matter : What are the facts , and who and how many people can testify to those facts ? \u201d says Paul Levinson , professor of media studies at Fordham University in New York . \u201c People should make decisions about whom to believe with the utmost gravity . The credibility of the accused and the accuser should both be taken into account . \u201d\nEven though Dr. Wright at Princeton University agrees that the news media has generally handled the recent allegations of rape against the president in an even-handed and proper way , she points out that it is far more complicated when it comes to assessing the credibility of women accusing powerful men of sexual assault .\n\u201c The first thing we always do is question their credibility and ask questions about them , \u201d she says . \u201c And their claims are always scrutinized ad nauseam . \u201d\n\u201c And the baseline , I would say , is not that we believe women , the baseline is that we do not believe women , \u201d continues Dr. Wright , author of \u201c Star Power : American Democracy in the Age of the Celebrity Candidate. \u201d \u201c And that has been the case going back to the beginning of time , as long as humans have existed \u2013 women have not been believed . \u201d\nFalse accusations are rare when it comes to sexual assault , according to an in-depth survey of existing research on the subject by the National Sexual Violence Resource Center , a nonprofit in Pennsylvania . Only 2 % to 7 % of accusations in various parts of the counter were found to be fabricated or false .\n\u201c Nobody wants to become famous from their story of sexual assault , \u201d Dr. Wright says . \u201c I mean , this idea has been proven again and again , that women face many more consequences when they come out with their story , and the rewards , really , are nonexistent . Society actually punishes you . \u201d\nSome observers also saw an \u201c outrage fatigue \u201d at work in the news media \u2019 s cautious response to Ms. Carroll \u2019 s accusations , especially on the heels of the divisive confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year . Others pointed out , too , that the most recent allegations against President Trump were part of a busy weekend in the news , including the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border and the administration \u2019 s mulling military action against Iran .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
