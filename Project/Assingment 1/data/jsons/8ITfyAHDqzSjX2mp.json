The question now is how big the Democratic advantage will be when results from all races are in . The results are largely in line with early predictions , though early returns suggested the scale of Democratic victories might be smaller than anticipated , and Democratic analysts such as James Carville declared the hope of a blue wave dead . Yet despite tough losses for Democrats in Senate and gubernatorial races , the House has shaped up about as well as the party could have hoped .\nDemocratic control of the House will shift the terrain in Washington , providing a genuine counterweight to President Trump for the first time in his presidency , and breaking the unified Republican control of the House , Senate , and White House . While it will be all but impossible for Democrats to actually enact any of their priorities into law , House control provides them a position to conduct strict oversight on the Trump administration .\nRead : How a blue wave could crash far beyond Washington\nThe Democratic wins have occurred across the country . They have won in districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 , and they have won in districts Trump won . There have been victories in traditionally Democratic states such as Illinois and Minnesota , but also in more exotic locales for Democrats in the current era , including Kansas and Oklahoma . Pennsylvania and Virginia are emerging as particular bright spots for the party early .\nThe wins in Virginia showcase the Old Dominion \u2019 s emergence as a solid Democratic state . In addition to Tim Kaine \u2019 s easy victory in the U.S. Senate race , the first flipped seat of the night to be called had Jennifer Wexton handily defeating Barbara Comstock in Northern Virginia \u2019 s Tenth District . Comstock is a longtime Republican soldier and the party poured millions of dollars into the race , but was unable to save the two-term representative .

Debbie Mucarsel-Powell defeated Carlos Curbelo in Florida \u2019 s Twenty-Sixth District .\nDemocrats also won in Illinois , with Sean Casten winning in the Sixth .

The president said he was on the ballot , and voters appear to have agreed , according to exit polls . While Democrats wrestled with how to speak about him on the campaign trail and in ads , his influence is visible in the results . Democrats competed in districts that Trump won handily in 2016 , including in the Rust Belt and even in deep-red Texas . Preliminary data show that turnout was exceptionally high among minorities and youth voters compared with recent midterm elections . In some cases , Trump \u2019 s personality and style were a factor .

While the issue is catnip to his base , his divisive and dark rhetoric wasn \u2019 t effective in rallying Republicans to the polls in numbers great enough to preserve their majority .\nThe Democratic victory ends a brief period of unified Republican control of government , including the White House , the House , the Senate , and effectively the Supreme Court . The House has been in Republican hands since the 2010 Tea Party wave .

They successfully stymied much of President Barack Obama \u2019 s agenda from 2011 on , but they largely failed to further conservative priorities . Federal spending continues to grow ; entitlements have not been cut ; Obamacare remains in place , though scaled back ; and after aiming for a tax-code overhaul , they had to settle for temporary tax cuts . Much of that class of 2010 has left the House or is leaving this year , and the party is also losing its leader . Wisconsin \u2019 s Paul Ryan , hailed as one of the party \u2019 s brightest young thinkers , was reluctantly thrust into the speakership , but opted to retire this year , apparently tired of being caught between the unpredictable and often outrageous president and a fractious caucus .\nIt \u2019 s likely that the Democratic leader , at least initially , will be a familiar face : former Speaker Nancy Pelosi . Although a growing number of Democrats have chafed against her leadership , and some won election this year promising not to vote for her , she remains the heavy favorite to reclaim the gavel\u2014at least to begin . Pelosi has been eager to reclaim the speakership , after serving in that role from 2007 to 2011 , but has said she is likely to be a \u201c transitional \u201d leader , paving the way for a new Democratic speaker in the near future .\nWith Republicans in control of the Senate and White House , any Democratic policy priorities will be largely symbolic , though tensions between very progressive members and those representing swing districts will test the cohesion of the caucus and the skills of its leaders . Where Democrats are likely to make their biggest impact is in oversight of the White House . The majority means Democratic chairs of committees will have subpoena power , and are likely to deluge the Trump administration with requests for documents and testimony on a range of issues .
