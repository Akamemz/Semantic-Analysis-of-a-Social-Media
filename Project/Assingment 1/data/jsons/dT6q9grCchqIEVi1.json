Displeased with Michael Wolff \u2019 s Fire and Fury , Trump called for a wholesale revision of America \u2019 s libel laws , first amendment be damned . The battle between the president and the press is now baked into our collective cake , a calcified feature not an errant bug .\nEnter Howard Kurtz \u2019 s Media Madness , which seeks to provide an explanation and narrative for the never-ending scrum between this president and the press , or as Kurtz frames it , \u201c the war over the truth \u201d .\nKurtz , a Fox News commentator , apportions guilt between both sides . But he is quicker to point a finger at the media for having discounted Trump \u2019 s chances for winning in 2016 than he is to lay blame at the Trump \u2019 s feet for his embrace of alternative facts as a new reality form .\nAs Kurtz sees things , Trump is a surrogate for his electoral base of disenchanted white working-class voters and therefore should be afforded greater patience even as he tramples on the truth . Media Madness acknowledges that Trump is \u201c loose with his language \u201d , fails to \u201c vet \u201d his pronouncements and \u201c sometimes regurgitates half-baked comments \u201d . Despite all this , Kurtz places the onus on the media , contending that it mistakenly takes Trump literally while arguing that Trump \u2019 s casualness does not always merit a press-driven fusillade .\nThe problem with this approach is that it requires a degree of calibration usually found among fine-precision instruments , and definitely not in Kurtz \u2019 s own body of work .
