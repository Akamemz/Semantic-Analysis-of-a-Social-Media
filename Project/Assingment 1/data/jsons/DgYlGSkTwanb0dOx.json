This article was produced in partnership with the Connecticut Mirror , which was a member of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Local Reporting Network in 2019 .\nOn a recent Sunday , protesters marched through the center of Weston , a small , wealthy town in southwest Connecticut . They chanted \u201c no justice , no peace \u201d and raised handwritten signs that read \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d and \u201c Silence is Violence . \u201d\nSomewhere in the crowd , Brian Murray hoisted his own message .\n\u201c Fact check : Weston , CT. No Black teachers . No Black police officers . No Black board members . No Black town of Weston government office members . \u201d\nMurray , one of the town \u2019 s few Black residents , viewed the June 7 protest through a different lens than his white neighbors .\n\u201c It was a photo opportunity . That \u2019 s all , \u201d said Murray , a limo driver and father of five who moved his family to the town eight years ago .\nBrian Murray lives in Weston , Connecticut , and is one of the town \u2019 s few Black residents . ( Cloe Poisson/CT Mirror )\nEight days after that protest , at which elected officials urged the overwhelmingly white crowd to fight racism , Weston officials turned their attention to housing . With a unanimous vote , they adopted the town \u2019 s strategic plan , which recommends keeping most development to single-family homes on lots of at least two acres , a requirement that has resulted in a typical sale price of $ 660,000 \u2014 and a lack of diversity . Just 1.4 % of residents are Black . Local officials rejected a suggestion to convert a vacant property into affordable housing for seniors . Instead , they carved out a small area of land surrounding the town green for potential development .\n\u201c Fundamentally , this is who we have been for a long time , \u201d said Ken Edgar , the chairman of Weston \u2019 s Planning and Zoning Commission , referring to the town \u2019 s large homes . \u201c We are trying to move the ball , but there would have to be demonstrated interest before I think we move the ball further and build diverse housing on small lots . \u201d\nDespite its liberal reputation \u2014 and Democrats controlling the legislature for the last 23 years and the governor \u2019 s mansion for nine \u2014 Connecticut is one of the most segregated places in the country . And with thousands of residents pouring into the streets this month to protest racism , housing advocates and progressive Democrats saw an opportunity to change that , calling for an overhaul of the state \u2019 s exclusionary housing laws .\nAt the state Capitol , Gov . Ned Lamont and legislative leaders have shelved a raft of proposals that could spur more affordable housing , after ending the legislative session early this year because of the coronavirus pandemic . Now , they are expected to return to Hartford next month for a special session to address a single reform in response to the protests : police accountability .\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter .\nThe limited agenda represents a stark retreat for leaders who began the year with bold pledges to tackle Connecticut \u2019 s affordable housing crisis .\nLamont in particular seemed poised to shift the debate , publicly criticizing wealthy towns , after a series of articles published by the Connecticut Mirror and \u2588\u2588\u2588 showed the lengths to which local jurisdictions have gone to block affordable housing , and by extension the people who need it .\n\u201c You know , I think they are nuts not to allow their downtowns to develop a little bit , not to have more multifamily housing , not to have more affordable housing , not to allow more of their community to live where they work , \u201d he told the Connecticut Mirror \u2019 s \u201c Steady Habits \u201d podcast in January .\nBut this month , after a Juneteenth event billed as \u201c A roundtable on Racial Equality and Social Justice , \u201d Lamont struck a more passive tone , telling reporters he supports leaving zoning decisions up to local officials . Asked whether some towns \u2019 zoning regulations are shutting out minorities , Lamont said , \u201c I \u2019 m not as interested as much in changing the laws within these \u201d towns .\nMax Reiss , a spokesman for the governor , said in a statement that the administration prefers to work collaboratively over forcing towns to allow projects that they don \u2019 t support . The state Department of Housing , he said , is currently building an affordable housing \u201c toolkit \u201d for local officials \u201c to make it easier to communicate the issue to their local communities . \u201d\n\u201c By working together toward a common goal , we can be much more successful , and effective , \u201d Reiss said . \u201c Divisive policies which promote conflict and inhibit growth are at the heart of the problems in this country . We do not believe in these kinds of policies in Connecticut , and are actively working against them . \u201d\nAny challenge to local control also faces an uphill battle in a legislature dominated by suburban lawmakers who represent communities that have fought changes for years . House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz , D-Berlin , said he doesn \u2019 t believe tackling zoning reforms is possible during a special session but is open to considering it .\n\u201c To have protracted debate and public input , I don \u2019 t believe the time frame will allow it , \u201d he said . \u201c The General Assembly as a whole has been struggling with this issue for years . Having a vote by early July is sort of hopeful and wishful to be honest . \u201d\nOther Democrats disagree . On Wednesday , the state House of Representatives \u2019 progressive caucus \u2014 representing nearly half of the party \u2019 s members in the lower chamber \u2014 announced it supports taking aim at exclusionary zoning during the special session .\n\u201c We need to take advantage of the moment that we have , \u201d said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney , D-New Haven .\nUrban legislators , many of them Black , say the police killing of George Floyd and the demonstrations that swept the nation exposed the need for systemic reforms in several areas of American life , including housing .\n\u201c If we don \u2019 t do it now , we will never get it done , \u201d said state Sen. Doug McCrory , D-Hartford , the vice chairman of the Housing Committee who has served in the legislature for 25 years .\n\u201c No longer do we chip around the outside and do what I call Novocain legislation , \u201d he added . \u201c That \u2019 s what we \u2019 ve been doing ever since I \u2019 ve been here . Just a little here . Just a little there because we don \u2019 t want to offend anybody . We don \u2019 t want anybody to be upset . No more . This is the time for the state of Connecticut to step up to the plate and be bold . \u201d\nA coalition of land use attorneys , planning and zoning commissioners and architects \u2014 named Desegregate CT \u2014 is pressing the legislature and governor to change the laws that allow local officials to block affordable housing in small towns . The result of so-called home rule has been a concentration of low-income units in urban areas .\nIn Hartford , some neighborhoods have as much as 70 % of the housing units reserved for low-income residents \u2014 which , in turn , puts a strain on the town \u2019 s ability to raise enough revenue to pay for things like schools and street repairs . \u201c I think it \u2019 s time for Connecticut to ask itself , what will these pandemics mean for our land use regime , \u201d said Sara Bronin , the leader of Hartford \u2019 s Planning and Zoning Commission and an expert on land use at UConn Law School . \u201c Segregation is an urgent crisis . \u201d\nTown officials say they \u2019 re not opposed to affordable housing in principle \u2014 but it has to fit in with what \u2019 s referred to as the \u201c character \u201d of their small communities . That typically means low-density projects , not multistory apartment buildings .\nBut civil rights leaders and developers have a name for this type of zoning \u2014 \u201c Jim Crow Zoning \u201d \u2014 because it allows Connecticut \u2019 s wealthier towns to shut out more affordable housing from being built , and the minorities who would live there . Developers argue that smaller projects don \u2019 t make financial sense because of the cost of the land and the construction . The rent they could charge would not justify the outlay , they say .\n\u201c The irony of BLM protests in white communities is it is these same towns that repeatedly block the development of affordable housing , which we know is an efficient way to promote integration , \u201d said Fionnuala Darby-Hudgens of the Connecticut Fair Housing Center , a nonprofit that advocates for more desegregation .\nAs the Connecticut Mirror and \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported last year , more than three dozen towns in the state have blocked construction of any privately developed duplexes and apartments within their borders for the last two decades . That often locks low-income people out of educational and employment opportunities . In southwest Connecticut , for example , it costs 3.5 times more to live near the high-scoring elementary schools in Westport , Weston or Wilton than in Bridgeport , one of the most impoverished cities in the state . It is the largest gap in the country , the Brookings Institution reported .\n\u201c Segregation is one of the roots of the evil in our society , and it \u2019 s perpetuated by exclusionary zoning . Let \u2019 s just call it what it is , it \u2019 s Jim Crow Zoning , \u201d said Richard Freedman , a developer with a history of fighting local officials to build affordable housing in high-end communities . \u201c It \u2019 s a system of social control , an insidious , complicated system of social control , just like the old Jim Crow laws . \u201d\nA luxury car drives through Weston , a small , wealthy town in the state \u2019 s southwest corner . ( Cloe Poisson/CT Mirror )\nLocal officials in towns that have rejected affordable housing have disputed claims of discrimination . They point to frail public infrastructure , clogged streets , a lack of sidewalks and concerns about overcrowding as reasons for denying projects .\n\u201c The challenge to our community is not just to the character of neighborhoods , but also to firefighting and police response , potentially to educational capacity , to human services support and to our tradition as a single-family home community , \u201d Jim Marpe , Westport \u2019 s Republican first selectman , told residents in his State of the Town Address last year .\nConnecticut stands out on the national stage . The suburbs surrounding New Haven are more exclusive than Silicon Valley , which is notorious for its high housing costs , according to research from Professor Robert C. Ellickson at Yale Law School . The towns of Bethany , Madison , Orange and Woodbridge designate more than 98 % of their residentially zoned land solely for single-family dwellings , built on lots of at least 1 acre . In each place , less than 3 % of the population is Black . In Guilford , 93 % is reserved for single-family homes and requires a 2-acre minimum . Just 1 % of the population there is Black .\nFor people of color , the experience can be isolating \u2014 and alienating .\nIn Weston , where only eight affordable housing units are reserved for low-income residents , Murray said that he and his family have experienced several instances of unequal treatment , such as when school officials expelled his eighth-grade son last year after a disciplinary incident . Murray filed a complaint with the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities , alleging his son was treated harshly because he is Black . The commission did not return a call seeking comment . William S. McKersie , superintendent of Weston Public Schools , and Anthony Pesco , the chairman of the Weston board of education , declined to comment on the case , saying they could not discuss individual students . But Pesco said , \u201c The board takes allegations of racial bias and racial injustice very seriously . \u201d\nThe only way conditions will improve , Murray said , is if the town makes it possible for more people from diverse backgrounds to be able to afford to move there and serve in public office . He pays $ 3,300 to rent a three-bedroom home in town .\nMurray holds a sign pointing out the lack of diversity in public office . ( Cloe Poisson/CT Mirror )\nEdgar , the chairman of the town \u2019 s Planning and Zoning Commission , attended Weston \u2019 s Black Lives Matter protest and said town officials recognize the need for affordable housing . \u201c We \u2019 re looking affirmatively towards having more diversification in our housing , \u201d he said , citing the town \u2019 s strategic plan , which designates the town center as a potential area for affordable housing . \u201c You \u2019 ve got to start some place . \u201d\nHe said residents generally oppose allowing homes to be built on smaller lots because it \u2019 s never been done . They \u2019 re also concerned that more children would move into the community , inflate school rolls and , in turn , lead to higher taxes . \u201c Can we build a new school to accommodate the hypothetical one-quarter acre homes ? It hasn \u2019 t been on the table in Weston , \u201d Edgar said .\nEnrollment in Weston schools has declined by 9 % over the last 10 years and is projected to drop by an additional 4 % over the next five . The district is now looking at consolidating to three schools from four .\nAcross Connecticut , the opposition to affordable housing in these wealthy enclaves remains stiff . Karen DuBois-Walton , president of the housing authority in New Haven and a member of the State Board of Education , said critics have hardened in recent years , evolving from being labeled NIMBY ( Not in My Back Yard ) to BANANA ( Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone ) .\n\u201c If we continue to subscribe to zoning policy that reinforces what we have at this point at the long end of a long history of inequity , then we will be agreeing that we are going to continue to reinforce racist policy , \u201d she said .\nInstead of challenging those zoning practices , though , state officials have steered taxpayer money to build more subsidized developments in struggling communities with high crime , few jobs and struggling schools .\nThe Connecticut Mirror and \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported last year that 80 % of the state \u2019 s 27,000 subsidized housing units were located in struggling communities , literally erecting pockets of poverty . Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers , designed to help low-income people find decent housing outside poor areas , have also failed ; the bulk are being used in high-poverty neighborhoods because those are the only places with available rentals for voucher recipients .\nOver the past month , Rodney Williams has protested at several Black Lives Matter demonstrations in New Haven in the wake of Floyd \u2019 s death . He grew up in housing projects in Brooklyn , New York , and has lived in Newhallville , a poor section of New Haven , for years .\n\u201c When the man was saying , \u2018 I can \u2019 t breathe , \u2019 the truth is America has had they foot on our neck ever since we was young , \u201d he said . \u201c If we had access to opportunities , we could afford to live where we want to live . We should be able to live where we want to live . \u201d\nDesegregate CT , the coalition of attorneys and local land use officials , is developing proposals to rein in local control and clear the path for more affordable housing .\nSome Democrats also want to revive legislation that died during the regular session this year . Among the proposals : expanding the jurisdiction of housing authorities so they could build in surrounding communities and starting a pilot program that would allow children to continue attending their school if they win a housing voucher and decide to move .\nMuch depends on Lamont , who has tread lightly ; in fact , he has deferred to legislative leaders entirely on the agenda for a special session . In January , he floated tying state spending on transportation upgrades in affluent communities \u2014 such as new or renovated train stops \u2014 to local approval of more affordable housing projects . But the money was set to come from installing toll roads throughout the state , a proposal that died . Now , amid the economic downturn , the state coffers for transportation projects are nearly empty .\nAside from legislation , the governor can still influence the housing debate through the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority , where his appointees decide where to direct public funding to construct affordable housing . But even there , officials say they plan to continue using a selection process that hinges on local approval \u2014 a system that critics argue results in the warehousing of poor people in poor communities .\nUnder the existing system , few developers of affordable housing even propose building in wealthy towns , fearing organized opposition .\nThat was the case in Waterford , where Harold Foley , owner of Georgia-based HF3 Group LLC , proposed a 40-unit apartment complex on the property where Cohanzie Elementary School closed in 2008 . Located in an area of single-family homes , across the street from a baseball field and playground , the proposal drew immediate protests from neighbors . Some said they feared affordable housing would not fit in with the neighborhood . Others worried about crime . Still others cited traffic and the impact on property values . The developer ultimately walked away from the project .\nPlans to develop Cohanzie Elementary School into affordable housing units drew protests from neighborhood residents and were abandoned . ( Jacqueline Rabe Thomas/CT Mirror )\nSeveral local elected officials attended the town \u2019 s recent Black Lives Matter protest .\nBeth Sabilia , a Democrat and selectwoman , said she opposed the project because of the neighbor concerns but she did not weigh in publicly at the time . \u201c I \u2019 ve always been schooled to give the zoning board their lane , let them stay in their lane . \u201d\n\u201c People want to stay in their lanes , \u201d she added , \u201c but I \u2019 m not necessarily sure that staying in your lane is the way to move ahead . \u201d\nJacqueline Rabe Thomas is a staff reporter for The Connecticut Mirror covering education and housing .

The district is now looking at consolidating to three schools from four.\n\nAcross Connecticut, the opposition to affordable housing in these wealthy enclaves remains stiff. Karen DuBois-Walton, president of the housing authority in New Haven and a member of the State Board of Education, said critics have hardened in recent years, evolving from being labeled NIMBY (Not in My Back Yard) to BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone).\n\n\u201cIf we continue to subscribe to zoning policy that reinforces what we have at this point at the long end of a long history of inequity, then we will be agreeing that we are going to continue to reinforce racist policy,\u201d she said.\n\nInstead of challenging those zoning practices, though, state officials have steered taxpayer money to build more subsidized developments in struggling communities with high crime, few jobs and struggling schools.\n\nThe Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica reported last year that 80% of the state\u2019s 27,000 subsidized housing units were located in struggling communities, literally erecting pockets of poverty. Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, designed to help low-income people find decent housing outside poor areas, have also failed; the bulk are being used in high-poverty neighborhoods because those are the only places with available rentals for voucher recipients.\n\nOver the past month, Rodney Williams has protested at several Black Lives Matter demonstrations in New Haven in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death. He grew up in housing projects in Brooklyn, New York, and has lived in Newhallville, a poor section of New Haven, for years.\n\n\u201cWhen the man was saying, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe,\u2019 the truth is America has had they foot on our neck ever since we was young,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had access to opportunities, we could afford to live where we want to live. We should be able to live where we want to live.\u201d\n\nDesegregate CT, the coalition of attorneys and local land use officials, is developing proposals to rein in local control and clear the path for more affordable housing.\n\nSome Democrats also want to revive legislation that died during the regular session this year. Among the proposals: expanding the jurisdiction of housing authorities so they could build in surrounding communities and starting a pilot program that would allow children to continue attending their school if they win a housing voucher and decide to move.\n\nMuch depends on Lamont, who has tread lightly; in fact, he has deferred to legislative leaders entirely on the agenda for a special session. In January, he floated tying state spending on transportation upgrades in affluent communities \u2014 such as new or renovated train stops \u2014 to local approval of more affordable housing projects. But the money was set to come from installing toll roads throughout the state, a proposal that died. Now, amid the economic downturn, the state coffers for transportation projects are nearly empty.\n\nAside from legislation, the governor can still influence the housing debate through the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, where his appointees decide where to direct public funding to construct affordable housing. But even there, officials say they plan to continue using a selection process that hinges on local approval \u2014 a system that critics argue results in the warehousing of poor people in poor communities.\n\nUnder the existing system, few developers of affordable housing even propose building in wealthy towns, fearing organized opposition.\n\nThat was the case in Waterford, where Harold Foley, owner of Georgia-based HF3 Group LLC, proposed a 40-unit apartment complex on the property where Cohanzie Elementary School closed in 2008. Located in an area of single-family homes, across the street from a baseball field and playground, the proposal drew immediate protests from neighbors. Some said they feared affordable housing would not fit in with the neighborhood. Others worried about crime. Still others cited traffic and the impact on property values. The developer ultimately walked away from the project.\n\nPlans to develop Cohanzie Elementary School into affordable housing units drew protests from neighborhood residents and were abandoned. (Jacqueline Rabe Thomas/CT Mirror)\n\nSeveral local elected officials attended the town\u2019s recent Black Lives Matter protest.\n\nBeth Sabilia, a Democrat and selectwoman, said she opposed the project because of the neighbor concerns but she did not weigh in publicly at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve always been schooled to give the zoning board their lane, let them stay in their lane.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople want to stay in their lanes,\u201d she added, \u201cbut I\u2019m not necessarily sure that staying in your lane is the way to move ahead.\u201d\n\nJacqueline Rabe Thomas is a staff reporter for The Connecticut Mirror covering education and housing.
