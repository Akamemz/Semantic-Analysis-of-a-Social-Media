    "content_original": "1. What is Juneteenth?\n\nThe holiday gets its name from June 19, 1865. That\u2019s the day the Union army arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce that all African-American slaves in the state were free in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation. The state was the last in the Confederacy to receive word that the Civil War was over and that slavery had been abolished, and the last where the federal Army established its authority.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2. What\u2019s been its significance?\n\nAs early as 1866, freed African Americans in Texas held a celebration on the date to commemorate the end of slavery. As black families emigrated from the southern U.S. after the Great Depression, observance spread throughout the country. In 1968, shortly after Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination, his Poor People\u2019s Campaign held a Juneteenth Solidarity Day, giving the holiday a new prominence in the civil rights movement.\n\n3. Is it an official holiday?\n\nIn 1980, the Texas legislature made it an official state holiday. Currently, 46 states and the District of Columbia mark the occasion as a holiday or a day of observation. But the holiday was still little known enough in 2017 outside the black community that the television show \u201cBlack-ish\u201d could build an episode around how few of the show\u2019s white characters had heard of it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n4. Why has it been gaining prominence?\n\nIn recent years, a number of Juneteenth commemorations were tied to themes raised by Black Lives Matter, a protest movement that was founded in response to police killings of African Americans.

What did Trump do?\n\nHe announced plans to hold a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on that day. He hasn\u2019t had an in-person rally since lockdowns were imposed to limit the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s spread in March. The move sparked an immediate reaction.\n\n6. What was the criticism about?\n\nAD\n\nThe choice of the date and the city riled both historians and African Americans for what they see as insensitivity to racial issues. In 1921 white rioters attacked a predominately black district in the city, Greenwood, killing up to 100 black residents and destroying hundreds of buildings. It\u2019s considered the worst incident of racial violence in U.S. history.\n\nAD\n\n7. What does Trump say?\n\nTrump said in an interview with Fox News on Thursday that his campaign didn\u2019t intentionally choose Juneteenth as the date for the rally. Late Friday night, he tweeted that \u201cMany of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date.\u201d He said that \u201cout of respect for this Holiday,\u201d the rally would be moved to the 20th. Paris Dennard, senior communications adviser for black media affairs at the Republican National Committee, had said earlier in the day that he had discussed the Greenwood massacre with Trump at a White House meeting last week. Trump told him he had recently read about the incident. Dennard said that he raised Tulsa with the president as an example of economic destruction and how long it could take black communities to recover from riots and looting.\n\nAD\n\n8. Which companies are making it a holiday?\n\nAD\n\nJack Dorsey made both Juneteenth a formal company holiday at both Twitter Inc. and Square Inc., both of which he leads.
