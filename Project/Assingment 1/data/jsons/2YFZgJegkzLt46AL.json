Why did Kevin McCarthy remove himself from the running for speaker without even having a vote ? And if the problem with McCarthy is that he was n't conservative enough , why are people talking about Paul Ryan \u2014 who is n't any more conservative than McCarthy \u2014 as possibly being able to step into the breach ?

So here goes .
