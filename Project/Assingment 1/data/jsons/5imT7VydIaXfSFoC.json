ET on December 20 , 2019 . I knew nothing about Cole before meeting him ; he was just a name on a list of boys at a private school outside Boston who had volunteered to talk with me ( or perhaps had had their arm twisted a bit by a counselor ) . The afternoon of our first interview , I was running late . As I rushed down a hallway at the school , I noticed a boy sitting outside the library , waiting\u2014it had to be him . He was staring impassively ahead , both feet planted on the floor , hands resting loosely on his thighs . My first reaction was Oh no . It was totally unfair , a scarlet letter of personal bias . Cole would later describe himself to me as a \u201c typical tall white athlete \u201d guy , and that is exactly what I saw . At 18 , he stood more than 6 feet tall , with broad shoulders and short-clipped hair . His neck was so thick that it seemed to merge into his jawline , and he was planning to enter a military academy for college the following fall . His friends were \u201c the jock group , \u201d he \u2019 d tell me . \u201c They \u2019 re what you \u2019 d expect , I guess . Let \u2019 s leave it at that. \u201d If I had closed my eyes and described the boy I imagined would never open up to me , it would have been him .\nBut Cole surprised me . He pulled up a picture on his phone of his girlfriend , whom he \u2019 d been dating for the past 18 months , describing her proudly as \u201c way smarter than I am , \u201d a feminist , and a bedrock of emotional support . He also confided how he \u2019 d worried four years earlier , during his first weeks as a freshman on a scholarship at a new school , that he wouldn \u2019 t know how to act with other guys , wouldn \u2019 t be able to make friends . \u201c I could talk to girls platonically , \u201d he said . \u201c That was easy . But being around guys was different . I needed to be a \u2018 bro , \u2019 and I didn \u2019 t know how to do that. \u201d Whenever Cole uttered the word bro , he shifted his weight to take up more space , rocking back in his chair , and spoke from low in his throat , like he \u2019 d inhaled a lungful of weed . He grinned when I pointed that out . \u201c Yeah , \u201d he said , \u201c that \u2019 s part of it : seeming relaxed and never intrusive , yet somehow bringing out that aggression on the sports field . Because a \u2018 bro \u2019 \u201d \u2014he rocked back again\u2014 \u201c is always , always an athlete. \u201d The definition of masculinity seems to be contracting . When asked what traits society values most in boys , only 2 percent of male survey respondents said honesty and morality . Cole eventually found his people on the crew team , but it wasn \u2019 t a smooth fit at first . He recalled an incident two years prior when a senior was bragging in the locker room about how he \u2019 d convinced one of Cole \u2019 s female classmates\u2014a young sophomore , Cole emphasized\u2014that they were an item , then started hooking up with other girls behind her back . And the guy wasn \u2019 t shy about sharing the details . Cole and a friend of his , another sophomore , told him to knock it off . \u201c I started to explain why it wasn \u2019 t appropriate , \u201d Cole said , \u201c but he just laughed . \u201d\nThe next day , a second senior started talking about \u201c getting back at \u201d a \u201c bitch \u201d who \u2019 d dumped him . Cole \u2019 s friend spoke up again , but this time Cole stayed silent . \u201c And as I continued to step back \u201d and the other sophomore \u201c continued to step up , you could tell that the guys on the team stopped liking him as much . They stopped listening to him , too . It \u2019 s almost as if he spent all his social currency \u201d trying to get them to stop making sexist jokes . \u201c Meanwhile , I was sitting there \u201d \u2014Cole thumped his chest\u2014 \u201c too afraid to spend any of mine , and I just had buckets left . \u201c I don \u2019 t know what to do , \u201d he continued earnestly . \u201c Once I \u2019 m in the military , and I \u2019 m a part of that culture , I don \u2019 t want to have to choose between my own dignity and my relationship with others I \u2019 m serving with . But \u2026 \u201d He looked me in the eye . \u201c How do I make it so I don \u2019 t have to choose ? \u201d I \u2019 ve spent two years talking with boys across America\u2014more than 100 of them between the ages of 16 and 21\u2014about masculinity , sex , and love : about the forces , seen and unseen , that shape them as men . Though I spoke with boys of all races and ethnicities , I stuck to those who were in college or college-bound , because like it or not , they \u2019 re the ones most likely to set cultural norms . Nearly every guy I interviewed held relatively egalitarian views about girls , at least their role in the public sphere . They considered their female classmates to be smart and competent , entitled to their place on the athletic field and in school leadership , deserving of their admission to college and of professional opportunities . They all had female friends ; most had gay male friends as well . That was a huge shift from what you might have seen 50 , 40 , maybe even 20 years ago . They could also easily reel off the excesses of masculinity . They \u2019 d seen the headlines about mass shootings , domestic violence , sexual harassment , campus rape , presidential Twitter tantrums , and Supreme Court confirmation hearings . A Big Ten football player I interviewed bandied about the term toxic masculinity . \u201c Everyone knows what that is , \u201d he said , when I seemed surprised .\nYet when asked to describe the attributes of \u201c the ideal guy , \u201d those same boys appeared to be harking back to 1955 . Dominance . Aggression . Rugged good looks ( with an emphasis on height ) . Sexual prowess . Stoicism . Athleticism . Wealth ( at least some day ) . It \u2019 s not that all of these qualities , properly channeled , are bad . But while a 2018 national survey of more than 1,000 10-to-19-year-olds commissione d by Plan International USA and conducted by the polling firm PerryUndem found that young women believed there were many ways to be a girl\u2014they could shine in math , sports , music , leadership ( the big caveat being that they still felt valued primarily for their appearance ) \u2014young men described just one narrow route to successful masculinity . * One-third said they felt compelled to suppress their feelings , to \u201c suck it up \u201d or \u201c be a man \u201d when they were sad or scared , and more than 40 percent said that when they were angry , society expected them to be combative . In another survey , which compared young men from the U.S. , the U.K. , and Mexico , Americans reported more social pressure to be ever-ready for sex and to get with as many women as possible ; they also acknowledged more stigma against homosexuality , and they received more messages that they should control their female partners , as in : Men \u201c deserve to know \u201d the whereabouts of their girlfriends or wives at all times . Feminism may have provided girls with a powerful alternative to conventional femininity , and a language with which to express the myriad problems-that-have-no-name , but there have been no credible equivalents for boys . Quite the contrary : The definition of masculinity seems to be in some respects contracting . When asked what traits society values most in boys , only 2 percent of male respondents in the PerryUndem survey said honesty and morality , and only 8 percent said leadership skills\u2014traits that are , of course , admirable in anyone but have traditionally been considered masculine . When I asked my subjects , as I always did , what they liked about being a boy , most of them drew a blank . \u201c Huh , \u201d mused Josh , a college sophomore at Washington State . ( All the teenagers I spoke with are identified by pseudonyms . ) \u201c That \u2019 s interesting . I never really thought about that . You hear a lot more about what is wrong with guys . \u201d\nFrom May 2000 : The war against boys While following the conventional script may still bring social and professional rewards to boys and men , research shows that those who rigidly adhere to certain masculine norms are not only more likely to harass and bully others but to themselves be victims of verbal or physical violence . They \u2019 re more prone to binge-drinking , risky sexual behavior , and getting in car accidents . They are also less happy than other guys , with higher depression rates and fewer friends in whom they can confide .\nIt wasn \u2019 t always thus . According to Andrew Smiler , a psychologist who has studied the history of Western masculinity , the ideal late-19th-century man was compassionate , a caretaker , but such qualities lost favor as paid labor moved from homes to factories during industrialization . In fact , the Boy Scouts , whose creed urges its members to be loyal , friendly , courteous , and kind , was founded in 1910 in part to counter that dehumanizing trend . Smiler attributes further distortions in masculinity to a century-long backlash against women \u2019 s rights . During World War I , women proved that they could keep the economy humming on their own , and soon afterward they secured the vote . Instead of embracing gender equality , he says , the country \u2019 s leaders \u201c doubled down \u201d on the inalienable male right to power , emphasizing men \u2019 s supposedly more logical and less emotional nature as a prerequisite for leadership .\nThen , during the second half of the 20th century , traditional paths to manhood\u2014early marriage , breadwinning\u2014began to close , along with the positive traits associated with them . Today many parents are unsure of how to raise a boy , what sort of masculinity to encourage in their sons . But as I learned from talking with boys themselves , the culture of adolescence , which fuses hyperrationality with domination , sexual conquest , and a glorification of male violence , fills the void . Read : Today \u2019 s masculinity is stifling For Cole , as for many boys , this stunted masculinity is a yardstick against which all choices , even those seemingly irrelevant to male identity , are measured . When he had a choice , he would team up with girls on school projects , to avoid the possibility of appearing subordinate to another guy . \u201c With a girl , it feels safer to talk and ask questions , to work together or to admit that I did something wrong and want help , \u201d Cole said . During his junior year , he briefly suggested to his crew teammates that they go vegan for a while , just to show that athletes could . \u201c And everybody was like , \u2018 Cole , that is the dumbest idea ever . We \u2019 d be the slowest in any race. \u2019 That \u2019 s somewhat true\u2014we do need protein . We do need fats and salts and carbs that we get from meat . But another reason they all thought it was stupid is because being vegans would make us pussies. \u201d LEARNING TO \u201c MAN UP \u201d There is no difference between the sexes \u2019 need for connection in infancy , nor between their capacity for empathy\u2014there \u2019 s actually some evidence that male infants are more expressive than females . Yet , from the get-go , boys are relegated to an impoverished emotional landscape . In a classic study , adults shown a video of an infant startled by a jack-in-the-box were more likely to presume the baby was \u201c angry \u201d if they were first told the child was male . Mothers of young children have repeatedly been found to talk more to their girls and to employ a broader , richer emotional vocabulary with them ; with their sons , again , they tend to linger on anger . As for fathers , they speak with less emotional nuance than mothers regardless of their child \u2019 s sex . Despite that , according to Judy Y. Chu , a human-biology lecturer at Stanford who conducted a study of boys from pre-K through first grade , little boys have a keen understanding of emotions and a desire for close relationships . But by age 5 or 6 , they \u2019 ve learned to knock that stuff off , at least in public : to disconnect from feelings of weakness , reject friendships with girls ( or take them underground , outside of school ) , and become more hierarchical in their behavior .\nRead : Psychology has a new approach to building healthier men By adolescence , says the Harvard psychologist William Pollack , boys become \u201c shame-phobic , \u201d convinced that peers will lose respect for them if they discuss their personal problems . My conversations bore this out . Boys routinely confided that they felt denied\u2014by male peers , girlfriends , the media , teachers , coaches , and especially their fathers\u2014the full spectrum of human expression . Cole , for instance , spent most of his childhood with his mother , grandmother , and sister\u2014his parents split up when he was 10 and his dad , who was in the military , was often away . Cole spoke of his mom with unbridled love and respect . His father was another matter . \u201c He \u2019 s a nice guy , \u201d Cole said\u2014caring and involved , even after the divorce\u2014 \u201c but I can \u2019 t be myself around him . I feel like I need to keep everything that \u2019 s in here \u201d \u2014Cole tapped his chest again\u2014 \u201c behind a wall , where he can \u2019 t see it . It \u2019 s a taboo\u2014like , not as bad as incest , but \u2026 \u201d A college sophomore told me that he hadn \u2019 t been able to cry when his parents divorced . \u201c I really wanted to , \u201d he said . \u201c I needed to. \u201d His solution : He streamed three movies about the Holocaust over the weekend . Rob , an 18-year-old from New Jersey in his freshman year at a North Carolina college , said his father would tell him to \u201c man up \u201d when he was struggling in school or with baseball . \u201c That \u2019 s why I never talk to anybody about my problems. \u201d He \u2019 d always think , If you can \u2019 t handle this on your own , then you aren \u2019 t a man ; you aren \u2019 t trying hard enough . Other boys also pointed to their fathers as the chief of the gender police , though in a less obvious way . \u201c It \u2019 s not like my dad is some alcoholic , emotionally unavailable asshole with a pulse , \u201d said a college sophomore in Southern California . \u201c He \u2019 s a normal , loving , charismatic guy who \u2019 s not at all intimidating. \u201d But \u201c there \u2019 s a block there . There \u2019 s a hesitation , even though I don \u2019 t like to admit that . A hesitation to talk about \u2026 anything , really . We learn to confide in nobody . You sort of train yourself not to feel . \u201d\nRead : How boys teach each other to be boys I met Rob about four months after he \u2019 d broken up with his high-school girlfriend . The two had dated for more than three years\u2014 \u201c I really did love her , \u201d he said\u2014and although their colleges were far apart , they \u2019 d decided to try to stay together . Then , a few weeks into freshman year , Rob heard from a friend that she was cheating on him . \u201c So I cut her off , \u201d he said , snapping his fingers . \u201c I stopped talking to her and forgot about her completely. \u201d Only \u2026 not really . Although he didn \u2019 t use the word , Rob became depressed . The excitement he \u2019 d felt about leaving home , starting college , and rushing a fraternity all drained away , and , as the semester wore on , it didn \u2019 t come back . When I asked whom he talked to during that time , he shrugged . If he had told his friends he was \u201c hung up \u201d on a girl , \u201c they \u2019 d be like , \u2018 Stop being a bitch. \u2019 \u201d Rob looked glum . The only person with whom he had been able to drop his guard was his girlfriend , but that was no longer an option . Girlfriends , mothers , and in some cases sisters were the most common confidants of the boys I met . While it \u2019 s wonderful to know they have someone to talk to\u2014and I \u2019 m sure mothers , in particular , savor the role\u2014teaching boys that women are responsible for emotional labor , for processing men \u2019 s emotional lives in ways that would be emasculating for them to do themselves , comes at a price for both sexes . Among other things , that dependence can leave men unable to identify or express their own emotions , and ill-equipped to form caring , lasting adult relationships .\nBy Thanksgiving break , Rob was so distraught that he had what he called a \u201c mental breakdown \u201d one night while chatting in the kitchen with his mom . \u201c I was so stressed out , \u201d he said . \u201c Classes . The thing with my girlfriend. \u201d He couldn \u2019 t describe what that \u201c breakdown \u201d felt like ( though he did say it \u201c scared the crap \u201d out of his mom , who immediately demanded , \u201c Tell me everything \u201d ) . All he could say definitively was that he didn \u2019 t cry . \u201c Never , \u201d he insisted . \u201c I don \u2019 t cry , ever. \u201d I paid close attention when boys mentioned crying\u2014doing it , not doing it , wanting to do it , not being able to do it . For most , it was a rare and humiliating event\u2014a dangerous crack in a carefully constructed edifice . A college sophomore in Chicago told me that he hadn \u2019 t been able to cry when his parents divorced . \u201c I really wanted to , \u201d he said . \u201c I needed to cry. \u201d His solution : He streamed three movies about the Holocaust over the weekend . That worked . As someone who , by virtue of my sex , has always had permission to weep , I didn \u2019 t initially understand this . Only after multiple interviews did I realize that when boys confided in me about crying\u2014or , even more so , when they teared up right in front of me\u2014they were taking a risk , trusting me with something private and precious : evidence of vulnerability , or a desire for it . Or , as with Rob , an inability to acknowledge any human frailty that was so poignant , it made me want to , well , cry . BRO CULTURE While my interview subjects struggled when I asked what they liked about being a boy , the most frequent response was sports . They recalled their early days on the playing field with almost romantic warmth . But I was struck by how many had dropped athletics they \u2019 d enjoyed because they couldn \u2019 t stand the Lord of the Flies mentality of teammates or coaches . Perhaps the most extreme example was Ethan , a kid from the Bay Area who had been recruited by a small liberal-arts college in New England to play lacrosse . He said he \u2019 d expected to encounter the East Coast \u201c \u2018 lax bro \u2019 culture , \u201d but he \u2019 d underestimated its intensity . \u201c It was all about sex \u201d and bragging about hooking up , and even the coaches endorsed victim-blaming , Ethan told me . \u201c They weren \u2019 t like that in class or around other people ; it was a super-liberal school . But once you got them in the locker room \u2026 \u201d He shook his head . \u201c It was one of the most jarring experiences of my life . \u201d\nAs a freshman , Ethan didn \u2019 t feel he could challenge his older teammates , especially without support from the coaches . So he quit the team ; not only that , he transferred . \u201c If I \u2019 d stayed , there would \u2019 ve been a lot of pressure on me to play , a lot of resentment , and I would \u2019 ve run into those guys all the time . This way I didn \u2019 t really have to explain anything. \u201d At his new school , Ethan didn \u2019 t play lacrosse , or anything else . What the longtime sportswriter Robert Lipsyte calls \u201c jock culture \u201d ( or what the boys I talked with more often referred to as \u201c bro culture \u201d ) is the dark underbelly of male-dominated enclaves , whether or not they formally involve athletics : all-boys \u2019 schools , fraternity houses , Wall Street , Silicon Valley , Hollywood , the military . Even as such groups promote bonding , even as they preach honor , pride , and integrity , they tend to condition young men to treat anyone who is not \u201c on the team \u201d as the enemy ( the only women who ordinarily make the cut are blood relatives\u2014 bros before hos ! ) , justifying any hostility toward them . Loyalty is paramount , and masculinity is habitually established through misogynist language and homophobia . From March 2014 : Caitlin Flanagan on the dark power of fraternities As a senior in high school , Cole was made captain of the crew team . He relished being part of a unit , a band of brothers . When he raced , he imagined pulling each stroke for the guy in front of him , for the guy behind him\u2014never for himself alone . But not everyone could muster such higher purpose . \u201c Crew demands you push yourself to a threshold of pain and keep yourself there , \u201d Cole said . \u201c And it \u2019 s hard to find something to motivate you to do that other than anger and aggression . \u201d\nI asked him about how his teammates talked in the locker room . That question always made these young men squirm . They \u2019 d rather talk about looking at porn , erectile dysfunction , premature ejaculation\u2014anything else . Cole cut his eyes to the side , shifted in his seat , and sighed deeply . \u201c Okay , \u201d he finally said , \u201c so here \u2019 s my best shot : We definitely say fuck a lot ; fuckin \u2019 can go anywhere in a sentence . And we call each other pussies , bitches . We never say the N-word , though . That \u2019 s going too far . \u201d\n\u201c What about fag ? \u201d I asked . \u201c No , \u201d he said , shaking his head firmly . \u201c So why can \u2019 t you say fag or the N-word but you can say pussy and bitch ? Aren \u2019 t those just as offensive ? \u201d \u201c One of my friends said we probably shouldn \u2019 t say those words anymore either , but what would we replace them with ? We couldn \u2019 t think of anything that bites as much. \u201d \u201c Bites ? \u201d \u201c Yeah . It \u2019 s like \u2026 for some reason pussy just works . When someone calls me a pussy\u2014 \u2018 Don \u2019 t be a pussy ! Come on ! Fuckin \u2019 go ! Pull ! Pull ! Pull ! \u2019 \u2014it just flows . If someone said , \u2018 Come on , Cole , don \u2019 t be weak ! Be tough ! Pull ! Pull ! Pull ! , \u2019 it just wouldn \u2019 t get inside my head the same way . I don \u2019 t know why that is. \u201d He paused . \u201c Well , \u201d he said , \u201c maybe I do . Maybe I just try not to dig too deeply. \u201d Although losing ground in more progressive circles , like the one Cole runs in , fag remained pervasive in the language of the boys I interviewed\u2014including those who insisted that they would never use the word in reference to an actual homosexual . Fag has become less a comment on a boy \u2019 s sexuality , says the University of Oregon sociology professor C. J. Pascoe , than a referendum on his manhood . It can be used to mock anything , she told me , even something as random as a guy \u201c dropping the meat out of his sandwich. \u201d ( Perhaps oddest to me , Pascoe found that one of the more common reasons boys get tagged with fag is for acting romantically with a girl . That \u2019 s seen as heterosexual in the \u201c wrong \u201d way , which explains why one high-school junior told me that having a girlfriend was \u201c gay. \u201d ) That fluidity , the elusiveness of the word \u2019 s definition , only intensifies its power , much like slut for girls .\nRecently , Pascoe turned her attention to no homo , a phrase that gained traction in the 1990s . She sifted through more than 1,000 tweets , primarily by young men , that included the phrase . Most were expressing a positive emotion , sometimes as innocuous as \u201c I love chocolate ice cream , # nohomo \u201d or \u201c I loved the movie The Day After Tomorrow , # nohomo. \u201d \u201c A lot of times they were saying things like \u2018 I miss you \u2019 to a friend or \u2018 We should hang out soon , \u2019 \u201d she said . \u201c Just normal expressions of joy or connection. \u201d No homo is a form of inoculation against insults from other guys , Pascoe concluded , a \u201c shield that allows boys to be fully human. \u201d Just because some young men now draw the line at referring to someone who is openly gay as a fag doesn \u2019 t mean , by the way , that gay men ( or men with traits that read as gay ) are suddenly safe . If anything , the gay guys I met were more conscious of the rules of manhood than their straight peers were . They had to be\u2014and because of that , they were like spies in the house of hypermasculinity . Mateo , 17 , attended the same Boston-area high school as Cole , also on a scholarship , but the two could not have presented more differently . Mateo , whose father is Salvadoran , was slim and tan , with an animated expression and a tendency to wave his arms as he spoke . Where Cole sat straight and still , Mateo crossed his legs at the knee and swung his foot , propping his chin on one hand .\nThis was Mateo \u2019 s second private high school . The oldest of six children , he had been identified as academically gifted and encouraged by an eighth-grade teacher to apply to an all-boys prep school for his freshman year . When he arrived , he discovered that his classmates were nearly all white , athletic , affluent , and , as far as he could tell , straight . Mateo\u2014Latino and gay , the son of a janitor\u2014was none of those things . He felt immediately conscious of how he held himself , of how he sat , and especially of the pitch of his voice . He tried lowering it , but that felt unnatural , so he withdrew from conversation altogether . He changed the way he walked as well , to avoid being targeted as \u201c girly. \u201d \u201c One of my only friends there was gay too , \u201d he said , \u201c and he was a lot more outward about it . He just got destroyed. \u201d Guys who identify as straight but aren \u2019 t athletic , or are involved in the arts , or have a lot of female friends , all risk having their masculinity impugned . What has changed for this generation , though , is that some young men , particularly if they grew up around LGBTQ people , don \u2019 t rise to the bait . \u201c I don \u2019 t mind when people mistake me for being gay , \u201d said Luke , a high-school senior from New York City . \u201c It \u2019 s more of an annoyance than anything , because I want people to believe me when I say I \u2019 m straight. \u201d The way he described himself did , indeed , tick every stereotypical box . \u201c I \u2019 m a very thin person , \u201d he said . \u201c I like clothing . I care about my appearance in maybe a more delicate way . I \u2019 m very in touch with my sensitive side . So when people think I \u2019 m gay ? \u201d He shrugged . \u201c It can feel like more of a compliment . Like , \u2018 Oh , you like the way I dress ? Thank you ! \u2019 \u201d\nOne of Luke \u2019 s friends , who was labeled \u201c the faggot frosh \u201d in ninth grade , is not so philosophical . \u201c He treats everything as a test of his masculinity , \u201d Luke told me . \u201c Like , once when I was wearing red pants , I heard him say to other people , \u2018 He looks like such a faggot. \u2019 I didn \u2019 t care , and maybe in that situation no one was really harmed , but when you apply that attitude to whole populations , you end up with Donald Trump as president. \u201d W \u2019 s AND L \u2019 s Sexual conquest\u2014or perhaps more specifically , bragging about your experiences to other boys\u2014is , arguably , the most crucial aspect of toxic masculinity . Nate , who attended a public high school in the Bay Area , knew this well . At a party held near the beginning of his junior year of high school , he sank deep into the couch , trying to look chill . Kids were doing shots and smoking weed . Some were Juuling . Nate didn \u2019 t drink much himself and never got high . He wasn \u2019 t morally opposed to it ; he just didn \u2019 t like the feeling of being out of control . At 16 , reputation meant everything to Nate , and certain things could cement your status . \u201c The whole goal of going to a party is to hook up with girls and then tell your guys about it , \u201d he said . And there \u2019 s this \u201c race for experience , \u201d because if you get behind , by the time you do hook up with a girl \u201c she \u2019 ll have hit it with , like , five guys already . Then she \u2019 s going to know how to do things \u201d you don \u2019 t\u2014and that \u2019 s a problem , if she tells people \u201c you \u2019 ve got floppy lips \u201d or \u201c don \u2019 t know how to get her bra off . \u201d\nA lanky boy with dark , liquid eyes and curly hair that resisted all attempts at taming , Nate put himself in the middle of his school \u2019 s social hierarchy : friends with both the \u201c popular \u201d and \u201c lower \u201d kids . Still , he \u2019 d hooked up with only three girls since ninth grade\u2014kissing , getting under their shirts\u2014but none had wanted a repeat . That left him worried about his skills . He is afraid of intimacy , he told me sincerely . \u201c It \u2019 s a huge self-esteem suck. \u201d It would probably be more accurate to say that Nate was afraid of having drunken sexual interactions with a girl he did not know or trust . But it was all about credentialing . \u201c Guys need to prove themselves to their guys , \u201d Nate said . To do that , \u201c they \u2019 re going to be dominating. \u201d They \u2019 re going to \u201c push. \u201d Because the girl is just there \u201c as a means for him to get off and to brag. \u201d Before the start of this school year , Nate \u2019 s \u201c dry spell \u201d had seemed to be ending . He \u2019 d been in a relationship with a girl that lasted a full two weeks , until other guys told him she was \u201c slutty \u201d \u2014their word , he hastened to add , not his . Although any hookup is marginally better than none , Nate said , you only truly earn points for getting sexual with the right kind of girl . \u201c If you hook up with a girl below your status , it \u2019 s an \u2018 L , \u2019 \u201d he explained . \u201c A loss . Like , a bad move. \u201d So he stopped talking to the girl , which was too bad . He \u2019 d really liked her .\nAfter a short trip to the kitchen to watch his friend Kyle stand on a table and drunkenly try to pour Sprite from a can into a shot glass , Nate returned to the couch , starting to relax as people swirled around him . Suddenly Nicole , the party \u2019 s host and a senior , plopped onto his lap , handing him a shot of vodka . Nate was impressed , if a little confused . Usually , if a girl wanted to hook up with you , there were texts and Snapchats , and if you said yes , it was on ; everyone would be anticipating it , and expecting a postmortem .\nNate thought Nicole was \u201c pretty hot \u201d \u2014she had a great body , he said\u2014though he \u2019 d never been especially interested in her before this moment . Still , he knew that hooking up with her would be a \u201c W. \u201d A big one . He glanced around the room subtly , wanting to make sure , without appearing to care , that everyone who mattered\u2014everyone \u201c relevant \u201d \u2014saw what was going down . A couple of guys gave him little nods . One winked . Another slapped him on the shoulder . Nate feigned nonchalance . Meanwhile , he told me , \u201c I was just trying not to pop a boner. \u201d Nicole took Nate \u2019 s hand and led him to an empty bedroom . He got through the inevitable , cringey moments when you actually have to talk to your partner , then , finally , they started kissing . In his anxiety , Nate bit Nicole \u2019 s lip . Hard . \u201c I was thinking , Oh God ! What do I do now ? \u201d But he kept going . He took off her top and undid her bra . He took off his own shirt . Then she took off her pants . \u201c And that , \u201d he said , \u201c was the first time I ever saw a vagina . I did not know what to do with it. \u201d He recalled that his friends had said girls go crazy if you stick your fingers up there and make the \u201c come here \u201d motion , so he tried it , but Nicole just lay there . He didn \u2019 t ask what might feel better to her , because that would have been admitting ignorance . After a few more agonizing minutes , Nicole announced that she wanted to see what was going on upstairs , and left , Nate trailing behind . A friend handed him a bottle of Jack Daniel \u2019 s . Another high-fived him . A third said , \u201c Dude , you hit that ! \u201d Maybe the hookup hadn \u2019 t been a disaster after all : He still had bragging rights .\nThen he heard a senior , a guy Nate considered kind of a friend , loudly ask Nicole , \u201c Why would you hook up with Nate ? \u201d She giggled . \u201c Oh , I was drunk ! \u201d she said . \u201c I was so drunk ! \u201d They were calling him an \u201c L. \u201d By Monday morning , Nicole had spread the word that Nate was bad at hooking up : that he \u2019 d bit her lip , that he didn \u2019 t know how to finger a girl . That his nails were ragged . \u201c The stereotype is that guys go into gory detail , \u201d Nate said , but \u201c it \u2019 s the other way around. \u201d Guys will brag , but they \u2019 re not specific . Girls will go into \u201c what his penis looked like , \u201d every single thing he did . Nate said he felt \u201c completely emasculated , \u201d so mortified that he told his mom he was sick and stayed home from school the next day . \u201c I was basically crying , \u201d he said . \u201c I was like , Shit ! I fucked up. \u201d No question , gossip about poor \u201c performance \u201d can destroy a guy \u2019 s reputation almost as surely as being called a \u201c slut \u201d or a \u201c prude \u201d can destroy a girl \u2019 s . As a result , the boys I talked with were concerned with female satisfaction during a hookup ; they just didn \u2019 t typically define it as the girl having an orgasm . They believed it to be a function of their own endurance and , to a lesser extent , penis size . A college freshman in Los Angeles recalled a high-school classmate who \u2019 d had sex with a girl who told everyone he \u2019 d ejaculated really quickly : \u201c He got the nickname Second Sam . That basically scared the crap out of all the other guys. \u201d A college senior in Boston recounted how he would glance at the clock when he started penetration . \u201c I \u2019 d think , I have to last five minutes , minimum , \u201d he said . \u201c And once I could do that , I \u2019 d think , I need to get to double digits . I don \u2019 t know if it \u2019 s necessarily about your partner \u2019 s enjoyment . It \u2019 s more about getting beyond the point where you \u2019 d be embarrassed , maintaining your pride . It turns sex into a task\u2014one I enjoy to a certain degree , but one where you \u2019 re monitoring your performance rather than living in the moment . \u201d\nEventually , Nate decided that he had to take a stand , if only to make returning to school bearable . He texted Nicole and said , \u201c \u2018 I \u2019 m sorry that you didn \u2019 t enjoy it , [ but ] I would never roast you . Why are you doing this ? \u2019 \u201d She felt \u201c really bad , \u201d he said . \u201c She stopped telling people , but it took me until the next semester to recover. \u201d HOW MISOGYNY BECOMES \u201c HILARIOUS \u201d No matter how often I heard it , the brutal language that even a conscientious young man like Nate used to describe sexual contact\u2014you hit that ! \u2014always unnerved me . In mixed-sex groups , teenagers may talk about hooking up ( already impersonal ) , but when guys are on their own , they nail , they pound , they bang , they smash , they hammer . They tap that ass , they tear her up . It can be hard to tell whether they have engaged in an intimate act or just returned from a construction site . It \u2019 s not like I imagined boys would gush about making sweet , sweet love to the ladies , but why was their language so weaponized ? The answer , I came to believe , was that locker-room talk isn \u2019 t about sex at all , which is why guys were ashamed to discuss it openly with me . The ( often clearly exaggerated ) stories boys tell are really about power : using aggression toward women to connect and to validate one another as heterosexual , or to claim top spots in the adolescent sexual hierarchy . Dismissing that as \u201c banter \u201d denies the ways that language can desensitize\u2014abrade boys \u2019 ability to see girls as people deserving of respect and dignity in sexual encounters .\nFor evidence , look no further than the scandals that keep popping up at the country \u2019 s top colleges : Harvard , Amherst , Columbia , Yale ( the scene of an especially notorious 2010 fraternity chant , \u201c No means yes ; yes means anal \u201d ) . Most recently , in the spring of 2019 , at the politically progressive Swarthmore College , in Pennsylvania , two fraternities disbanded after student-run publications released more than 100 pages of \u201c minutes \u201d from house meetings a few years earlier that included , among other things , jokes about a \u201c rape attic \u201d and the acquiring of roofies , \u201c finger blasting \u201d a member \u2019 s 10-year-old sister , and vomiting on women during sex . When called out , boys typically claim that they thought they were just being \u201c funny. \u201d And in a way that makes sense\u2014when left unexamined , such \u201c humor \u201d may seem like an extension of the gross-out comedy of childhood . Little boys are famous for their fart jokes , booger jokes , poop jokes . It \u2019 s how they test boundaries , understand the human body , gain a little cred among their peers . But , as can happen with sports , their glee in that can both enable and camouflage sexism . The boy who , at age 10 , asks his friends the difference between a dead baby and a bowling ball may or may not find it equally uproarious , at 16 , to share what a woman and a bowling ball have in common ( you can Google it ) . He may or may not post ever-escalating \u201c jokes \u201d about women , or African Americans , or homosexuals , or disabled people on a group Snapchat . He may or may not send \u201c funny \u201d texts to friends about \u201c girls who need to be raped , \u201d or think it \u2019 s hysterical to surprise a buddy with a meme in which a woman is being gagged by a penis , her mascara mixed with her tears . He may or may not , at 18 , scrawl the names of his hookups on a wall in his all-male dorm , as part of a year-long competition to see who can \u201c pull \u201d the most . Perfectly nice , bright , polite boys I interviewed had done one or another of these things .\nHow does that happen ? I talked with a 15-year-old from the East Coast who had been among a group of boys suspended from school for posting more than 100 racist and sexist \u201c jokes \u201d about classmates on a group Finsta ( a secondary , or \u201c fake , \u201d Instagram account that is in many cases more genuine than a \u201c Rinsta , \u201d or \u201c real \u201d account ) . \u201c The Finsta became very competitive , \u201d he said . \u201c You wanted to make your friends laugh , but when you \u2019 re not face-to-face , \u201d you can \u2019 t tell whether you \u2019 ll get a reaction , \u201c so you go one step beyond. \u201d It was \u201c that combination of competitiveness and that \u2026 disconnect that triggered it to get worse and worse . \u201d\nAt the most disturbing end of the continuum , \u201c funny \u201d and \u201c hilarious \u201d become a defense against charges of sexual harassment or assault . To cite just one example , a boy from Steubenville , Ohio , was captured on video joking about the repeated violation of an unconscious girl at a party by a couple of high-school football players . \u201c She is so raped , \u201d he said , laughing . \u201c They raped her quicker than Mike Tyson. \u201d When someone off camera suggested that rape wasn \u2019 t funny , he retorted , \u201c It isn \u2019 t funny\u2014it \u2019 s hilarious ! \u201d \u201c Hilarious \u201d is another way , under the pretext of horseplay or group bonding , that boys learn to disregard others \u2019 feelings as well as their own . \u201c Hilarious \u201d is a haven , offering distance when something is inappropriate , confusing , depressing , unnerving , or horrifying ; when something defies boys \u2019 ethics . It allows them to subvert a more compassionate response that could be read as unmasculine\u2014and makes sexism and misogyny feel transgressive rather than supportive of an age-old status quo . Boys may know when something is wrong ; they may even know that true manhood\u2014or maybe just common decency\u2014compels them to speak up . Yet , too often , they fear that if they do , they \u2019 ll be marginalized or , worse , themselves become the target of derision from other boys . Masculinity , then , becomes not only about what boys do say , but about what they don \u2019 t\u2014or won \u2019 t , or can \u2019 t\u2014say , even when they wish they could . The psychologists Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson , the authors of Raising Cain : Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys , have pointed out that silence in the face of cruelty or sexism is how too many boys become men . Charis Denison , a sex educator in the Bay Area , puts it another way : \u201c At one time or another , every young man will get a letter of admission to \u2018 dick school. \u2019 The question is , will he drop out , graduate , or go for an advanced degree ? \u201d",
    "content_original": "Why boys crack up at rape jokes, think having a girlfriend is \u201cgay,\u201d and still can\u2019t cry\u2014and why we need to give them new and better models of masculinity\n\n\n\n\n\nLink Copied\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9:30 p.m. ET on December 20, 2019. I knew nothing about Cole before meeting him; he was just a name on a list of boys at a private school outside Boston who had volunteered to talk with me (or perhaps had had their arm twisted a bit by a counselor). The afternoon of our first interview, I was running late. As I rushed down a hallway at the school, I noticed a boy sitting outside the library, waiting\u2014it had to be him. He was staring impassively ahead, both feet planted on the floor, hands resting loosely on his thighs. My first reaction was Oh no. It was totally unfair, a scarlet letter of personal bias. Cole would later describe himself to me as a \u201ctypical tall white athlete\u201d guy, and that is exactly what I saw. At 18, he stood more than 6 feet tall, with broad shoulders and short-clipped hair. His neck was so thick that it seemed to merge into his jawline, and he was planning to enter a military academy for college the following fall. His friends were \u201cthe jock group,\u201d he\u2019d tell me. \u201cThey\u2019re what you\u2019d expect, I guess. Let\u2019s leave it at that.\u201d If I had closed my eyes and described the boy I imagined would never open up to me, it would have been him.\n\nBut Cole surprised me. He pulled up a picture on his phone of his girlfriend, whom he\u2019d been dating for the past 18 months, describing her proudly as \u201cway smarter than I am,\u201d a feminist, and a bedrock of emotional support. He also confided how he\u2019d worried four years earlier, during his first weeks as a freshman on a scholarship at a new school, that he wouldn\u2019t know how to act with other guys, wouldn\u2019t be able to make friends. \u201cI could talk to girls platonically,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was easy. But being around guys was different. I needed to be a \u2018bro,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t know how to do that.\u201d Whenever Cole uttered the word bro, he shifted his weight to take up more space, rocking back in his chair, and spoke from low in his throat, like he\u2019d inhaled a lungful of weed. He grinned when I pointed that out. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s part of it: seeming relaxed and never intrusive, yet somehow bringing out that aggression on the sports field. Because a \u2018bro\u2019 \u201d\u2014he rocked back again\u2014\u201cis always, always an athlete.\u201d The definition of masculinity seems to be contracting. When asked what traits society values most in boys, only 2 percent of male survey respondents said honesty and morality. Cole eventually found his people on the crew team, but it wasn\u2019t a smooth fit at first. He recalled an incident two years prior when a senior was bragging in the locker room about how he\u2019d convinced one of Cole\u2019s female classmates\u2014a young sophomore, Cole emphasized\u2014that they were an item, then started hooking up with other girls behind her back. And the guy wasn\u2019t shy about sharing the details. Cole and a friend of his, another sophomore, told him to knock it off. \u201cI started to explain why it wasn\u2019t appropriate,\u201d Cole said, \u201cbut he just laughed.\u201d\n\nThe next day, a second senior started talking about \u201cgetting back at\u201d a \u201cbitch\u201d who\u2019d dumped him. Cole\u2019s friend spoke up again, but this time Cole stayed silent. \u201cAnd as I continued to step back\u201d and the other sophomore \u201ccontinued to step up, you could tell that the guys on the team stopped liking him as much. They stopped listening to him, too. It\u2019s almost as if he spent all his social currency\u201d trying to get them to stop making sexist jokes. \u201cMeanwhile, I was sitting there\u201d\u2014Cole thumped his chest\u2014\u201ctoo afraid to spend any of mine, and I just had buckets left. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he continued earnestly. \u201cOnce I\u2019m in the military, and I\u2019m a part of that culture, I don\u2019t want to have to choose between my own dignity and my relationship with others I\u2019m serving with. But \u2026\u201d He looked me in the eye. \u201cHow do I make it so I don\u2019t have to choose?\u201d I\u2019ve spent two years talking with boys across America\u2014more than 100 of them between the ages of 16 and 21\u2014about masculinity, sex, and love: about the forces, seen and unseen, that shape them as men. Though I spoke with boys of all races and ethnicities, I stuck to those who were in college or college-bound, because like it or not, they\u2019re the ones most likely to set cultural norms. Nearly every guy I interviewed held relatively egalitarian views about girls, at least their role in the public sphere. They considered their female classmates to be smart and competent, entitled to their place on the athletic field and in school leadership, deserving of their admission to college and of professional opportunities. They all had female friends; most had gay male friends as well. That was a huge shift from what you might have seen 50, 40, maybe even 20 years ago. They could also easily reel off the excesses of masculinity. They\u2019d seen the headlines about mass shootings, domestic violence, sexual harassment, campus rape, presidential Twitter tantrums, and Supreme Court confirmation hearings. A Big Ten football player I interviewed bandied about the term toxic masculinity. \u201cEveryone knows what that is,\u201d he said, when I seemed surprised.\n\nYet when asked to describe the attributes of \u201cthe ideal guy,\u201d those same boys appeared to be harking back to 1955. Dominance. Aggression. Rugged good looks (with an emphasis on height). Sexual prowess. Stoicism. Athleticism. Wealth (at least some day). It\u2019s not that all of these qualities, properly channeled, are bad. But while a 2018 national survey of more than 1,000 10-to-19-year-olds commissione d by Plan International USA and conducted by the polling firm PerryUndem found that young women believed there were many ways to be a girl\u2014they could shine in math, sports, music, leadership (the big caveat being that they still felt valued primarily for their appearance)\u2014young men described just one narrow route to successful masculinity.* One-third said they felt compelled to suppress their feelings, to \u201csuck it up\u201d or \u201cbe a man\u201d when they were sad or scared, and more than 40 percent said that when they were angry, society expected them to be combative. In another survey, which compared young men from the U.S., the U.K., and Mexico, Americans reported more social pressure to be ever-ready for sex and to get with as many women as possible; they also acknowledged more stigma against homosexuality, and they received more messages that they should control their female partners, as in: Men \u201cdeserve to know\u201d the whereabouts of their girlfriends or wives at all times. Feminism may have provided girls with a powerful alternative to conventional femininity, and a language with which to express the myriad problems-that-have-no-name, but there have been no credible equivalents for boys. Quite the contrary: The definition of masculinity seems to be in some respects contracting. When asked what traits society values most in boys, only 2 percent of male respondents in the PerryUndem survey said honesty and morality, and only 8 percent said leadership skills\u2014traits that are, of course, admirable in anyone but have traditionally been considered masculine. When I asked my subjects, as I always did, what they liked about being a boy, most of them drew a blank. \u201cHuh,\u201d mused Josh, a college sophomore at Washington State. (All the teenagers I spoke with are identified by pseudonyms.) \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. I never really thought about that. You hear a lot more about what is wrong with guys.\u201d\n\nFrom May 2000: The war against boys While following the conventional script may still bring social and professional rewards to boys and men, research shows that those who rigidly adhere to certain masculine norms are not only more likely to harass and bully others but to themselves be victims of verbal or physical violence. They\u2019re more prone to binge-drinking, risky sexual behavior, and getting in car accidents. They are also less happy than other guys, with higher depression rates and fewer friends in whom they can confide.\n\nAnthony Blasko\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always thus. According to Andrew Smiler, a psychologist who has studied the history of Western masculinity, the ideal late-19th-century man was compassionate, a caretaker, but such qualities lost favor as paid labor moved from homes to factories during industrialization. In fact, the Boy Scouts, whose creed urges its members to be loyal, friendly, courteous, and kind, was founded in 1910 in part to counter that dehumanizing trend. Smiler attributes further distortions in masculinity to a century-long backlash against women\u2019s rights. During World War I, women proved that they could keep the economy humming on their own, and soon afterward they secured the vote. Instead of embracing gender equality, he says, the country\u2019s leaders \u201cdoubled down\u201d on the inalienable male right to power, emphasizing men\u2019s supposedly more logical and less emotional nature as a prerequisite for leadership.\n\nThen, during the second half of the 20th century, traditional paths to manhood\u2014early marriage, breadwinning\u2014began to close, along with the positive traits associated with them. Today many parents are unsure of how to raise a boy, what sort of masculinity to encourage in their sons. But as I learned from talking with boys themselves, the culture of adolescence, which fuses hyperrationality with domination, sexual conquest, and a glorification of male violence, fills the void. Read: Today\u2019s masculinity is stifling For Cole, as for many boys, this stunted masculinity is a yardstick against which all choices, even those seemingly irrelevant to male identity, are measured. When he had a choice, he would team up with girls on school projects, to avoid the possibility of appearing subordinate to another guy. \u201cWith a girl, it feels safer to talk and ask questions, to work together or to admit that I did something wrong and want help,\u201d Cole said. During his junior year, he briefly suggested to his crew teammates that they go vegan for a while, just to show that athletes could. \u201cAnd everybody was like, \u2018Cole, that is the dumbest idea ever. We\u2019d be the slowest in any race.\u2019 That\u2019s somewhat true\u2014we do need protein. We do need fats and salts and carbs that we get from meat. But another reason they all thought it was stupid is because being vegans would make us pussies.\u201d LEARNING TO \u201cMAN UP\u201d There is no difference between the sexes\u2019 need for connection in infancy, nor between their capacity for empathy\u2014there\u2019s actually some evidence that male infants are more expressive than females. Yet, from the get-go, boys are relegated to an impoverished emotional landscape. In a classic study, adults shown a video of an infant startled by a jack-in-the-box were more likely to presume the baby was \u201cangry\u201d if they were first told the child was male. Mothers of young children have repeatedly been found to talk more to their girls and to employ a broader, richer emotional vocabulary with them; with their sons, again, they tend to linger on anger. As for fathers, they speak with less emotional nuance than mothers regardless of their child\u2019s sex. Despite that, according to Judy Y. Chu, a human-biology lecturer at Stanford who conducted a study of boys from pre-K through first grade, little boys have a keen understanding of emotions and a desire for close relationships. But by age 5 or 6, they\u2019ve learned to knock that stuff off, at least in public: to disconnect from feelings of weakness, reject friendships with girls (or take them underground, outside of school), and become more hierarchical in their behavior.\n\nRead: Psychology has a new approach to building healthier men By adolescence, says the Harvard psychologist William Pollack, boys become \u201cshame-phobic,\u201d convinced that peers will lose respect for them if they discuss their personal problems. My conversations bore this out. Boys routinely confided that they felt denied\u2014by male peers, girlfriends, the media, teachers, coaches, and especially their fathers\u2014the full spectrum of human expression. Cole, for instance, spent most of his childhood with his mother, grandmother, and sister\u2014his parents split up when he was 10 and his dad, who was in the military, was often away. Cole spoke of his mom with unbridled love and respect. His father was another matter. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy,\u201d Cole said\u2014caring and involved, even after the divorce\u2014\u201cbut I can\u2019t be myself around him. I feel like I need to keep everything that\u2019s in here\u201d\u2014Cole tapped his chest again\u2014\u201cbehind a wall, where he can\u2019t see it. It\u2019s a taboo\u2014like, not as bad as incest, but \u2026\u201d A college sophomore told me that he hadn\u2019t been able to cry when his parents divorced. \u201cI really wanted to,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed to.\u201d His solution: He streamed three movies about the Holocaust over the weekend. Rob, an 18-year-old from New Jersey in his freshman year at a North Carolina college, said his father would tell him to \u201cman up\u201d when he was struggling in school or with baseball. \u201cThat\u2019s why I never talk to anybody about my problems.\u201d He\u2019d always think, If you can\u2019t handle this on your own, then you aren\u2019t a man; you aren\u2019t trying hard enough. Other boys also pointed to their fathers as the chief of the gender police, though in a less obvious way. \u201cIt\u2019s not like my dad is some alcoholic, emotionally unavailable asshole with a pulse,\u201d said a college sophomore in Southern California. \u201cHe\u2019s a normal, loving, charismatic guy who\u2019s not at all intimidating.\u201d But \u201cthere\u2019s a block there. There\u2019s a hesitation, even though I don\u2019t like to admit that. A hesitation to talk about \u2026 anything, really. We learn to confide in nobody. You sort of train yourself not to feel.\u201d\n\nRead: How boys teach each other to be boys I met Rob about four months after he\u2019d broken up with his high-school girlfriend. The two had dated for more than three years\u2014\u201cI really did love her,\u201d he said\u2014and although their colleges were far apart, they\u2019d decided to try to stay together. Then, a few weeks into freshman year, Rob heard from a friend that she was cheating on him. \u201cSo I cut her off,\u201d he said, snapping his fingers. \u201cI stopped talking to her and forgot about her completely.\u201d Only \u2026 not really. Although he didn\u2019t use the word, Rob became depressed. The excitement he\u2019d felt about leaving home, starting college, and rushing a fraternity all drained away, and, as the semester wore on, it didn\u2019t come back. When I asked whom he talked to during that time, he shrugged. If he had told his friends he was \u201chung up\u201d on a girl, \u201cthey\u2019d be like, \u2018Stop being a bitch.\u2019 \u201d Rob looked glum. The only person with whom he had been able to drop his guard was his girlfriend, but that was no longer an option. Girlfriends, mothers, and in some cases sisters were the most common confidants of the boys I met. While it\u2019s wonderful to know they have someone to talk to\u2014and I\u2019m sure mothers, in particular, savor the role\u2014teaching boys that women are responsible for emotional labor, for processing men\u2019s emotional lives in ways that would be emasculating for them to do themselves, comes at a price for both sexes. Among other things, that dependence can leave men unable to identify or express their own emotions, and ill-equipped to form caring, lasting adult relationships.\n\nBy Thanksgiving break, Rob was so distraught that he had what he called a \u201cmental breakdown\u201d one night while chatting in the kitchen with his mom. \u201cI was so stressed out,\u201d he said. \u201cClasses. The thing with my girlfriend.\u201d He couldn\u2019t describe what that \u201cbreakdown\u201d felt like (though he did say it \u201cscared the crap\u201d out of his mom, who immediately demanded, \u201cTell me everything\u201d). All he could say definitively was that he didn\u2019t cry. \u201cNever,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t cry, ever.\u201d I paid close attention when boys mentioned crying\u2014doing it, not doing it, wanting to do it, not being able to do it. For most, it was a rare and humiliating event\u2014a dangerous crack in a carefully constructed edifice. A college sophomore in Chicago told me that he hadn\u2019t been able to cry when his parents divorced. \u201cI really wanted to,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed to cry.\u201d His solution: He streamed three movies about the Holocaust over the weekend. That worked. As someone who, by virtue of my sex, has always had permission to weep, I didn\u2019t initially understand this. Only after multiple interviews did I realize that when boys confided in me about crying\u2014or, even more so, when they teared up right in front of me\u2014they were taking a risk, trusting me with something private and precious: evidence of vulnerability, or a desire for it. Or, as with Rob, an inability to acknowledge any human frailty that was so poignant, it made me want to, well, cry. BRO CULTURE While my interview subjects struggled when I asked what they liked about being a boy, the most frequent response was sports. They recalled their early days on the playing field with almost romantic warmth. But I was struck by how many had dropped athletics they\u2019d enjoyed because they couldn\u2019t stand the Lord of the Flies mentality of teammates or coaches. Perhaps the most extreme example was Ethan, a kid from the Bay Area who had been recruited by a small liberal-arts college in New England to play lacrosse. He said he\u2019d expected to encounter the East Coast \u201c \u2018lax bro\u2019 culture,\u201d but he\u2019d underestimated its intensity. \u201cIt was all about sex\u201d and bragging about hooking up, and even the coaches endorsed victim-blaming, Ethan told me. \u201cThey weren\u2019t like that in class or around other people; it was a super-liberal school. But once you got them in the locker room \u2026\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt was one of the most jarring experiences of my life.\u201d\n\nAs a freshman, Ethan didn\u2019t feel he could challenge his older teammates, especially without support from the coaches. So he quit the team; not only that, he transferred. \u201cIf I\u2019d stayed, there would\u2019ve been a lot of pressure on me to play, a lot of resentment, and I would\u2019ve run into those guys all the time. This way I didn\u2019t really have to explain anything.\u201d At his new school, Ethan didn\u2019t play lacrosse, or anything else. What the longtime sportswriter Robert Lipsyte calls \u201cjock culture\u201d (or what the boys I talked with more often referred to as \u201cbro culture\u201d) is the dark underbelly of male-dominated enclaves, whether or not they formally involve athletics: all-boys\u2019 schools, fraternity houses, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Hollywood, the military. Even as such groups promote bonding, even as they preach honor, pride, and integrity, they tend to condition young men to treat anyone who is not \u201con the team\u201d as the enemy (the only women who ordinarily make the cut are blood relatives\u2014 bros before hos!), justifying any hostility toward them. Loyalty is paramount, and masculinity is habitually established through misogynist language and homophobia. From March 2014: Caitlin Flanagan on the dark power of fraternities As a senior in high school, Cole was made captain of the crew team. He relished being part of a unit, a band of brothers. When he raced, he imagined pulling each stroke for the guy in front of him, for the guy behind him\u2014never for himself alone. But not everyone could muster such higher purpose. \u201cCrew demands you push yourself to a threshold of pain and keep yourself there,\u201d Cole said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to find something to motivate you to do that other than anger and aggression.\u201d\n\nAnthony Blasko\n\nI asked him about how his teammates talked in the locker room. That question always made these young men squirm. They\u2019d rather talk about looking at porn, erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation\u2014anything else. Cole cut his eyes to the side, shifted in his seat, and sighed deeply. \u201cOkay,\u201d he finally said, \u201cso here\u2019s my best shot: We definitely say fuck a lot; fuckin\u2019 can go anywhere in a sentence. And we call each other pussies, bitches. We never say the N-word, though. That\u2019s going too far.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about fag?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head firmly. \u201cSo why can\u2019t you say fag or the N-word but you can say pussy and bitch? Aren\u2019t those just as offensive?\u201d \u201cOne of my friends said we probably shouldn\u2019t say those words anymore either, but what would we replace them with? We couldn\u2019t think of anything that bites as much.\u201d \u201cBites?\u201d \u201cYeah. It\u2019s like \u2026 for some reason pussy just works. When someone calls me a pussy\u2014\u2018Don\u2019t be a pussy! Come on! Fuckin\u2019 go! Pull! Pull! Pull!\u2019\u2014it just flows. If someone said, \u2018Come on, Cole, don\u2019t be weak! Be tough! Pull! Pull! Pull!,\u2019 it just wouldn\u2019t get inside my head the same way. I don\u2019t know why that is.\u201d He paused. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe I do. Maybe I just try not to dig too deeply.\u201d Although losing ground in more progressive circles, like the one Cole runs in, fag remained pervasive in the language of the boys I interviewed\u2014including those who insisted that they would never use the word in reference to an actual homosexual. Fag has become less a comment on a boy\u2019s sexuality, says the University of Oregon sociology professor C. J. Pascoe, than a referendum on his manhood. It can be used to mock anything, she told me, even something as random as a guy \u201cdropping the meat out of his sandwich.\u201d (Perhaps oddest to me, Pascoe found that one of the more common reasons boys get tagged with fag is for acting romantically with a girl. That\u2019s seen as heterosexual in the \u201cwrong\u201d way, which explains why one high-school junior told me that having a girlfriend was \u201cgay.\u201d) That fluidity, the elusiveness of the word\u2019s definition, only intensifies its power, much like slut for girls.\n\nRecently, Pascoe turned her attention to no homo, a phrase that gained traction in the 1990s. She sifted through more than 1,000 tweets, primarily by young men, that included the phrase. Most were expressing a positive emotion, sometimes as innocuous as \u201cI love chocolate ice cream, #nohomo\u201d or \u201cI loved the movie The Day After Tomorrow, #nohomo.\u201d \u201cA lot of times they were saying things like \u2018I miss you\u2019 to a friend or \u2018We should hang out soon,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cJust normal expressions of joy or connection.\u201d No homo is a form of inoculation against insults from other guys, Pascoe concluded, a \u201cshield that allows boys to be fully human.\u201d Just because some young men now draw the line at referring to someone who is openly gay as a fag doesn\u2019t mean, by the way, that gay men (or men with traits that read as gay) are suddenly safe. If anything, the gay guys I met were more conscious of the rules of manhood than their straight peers were. They had to be\u2014and because of that, they were like spies in the house of hypermasculinity. Mateo, 17, attended the same Boston-area high school as Cole, also on a scholarship, but the two could not have presented more differently. Mateo, whose father is Salvadoran, was slim and tan, with an animated expression and a tendency to wave his arms as he spoke. Where Cole sat straight and still, Mateo crossed his legs at the knee and swung his foot, propping his chin on one hand.\n\nThis was Mateo\u2019s second private high school. The oldest of six children, he had been identified as academically gifted and encouraged by an eighth-grade teacher to apply to an all-boys prep school for his freshman year. When he arrived, he discovered that his classmates were nearly all white, athletic, affluent, and, as far as he could tell, straight. Mateo\u2014Latino and gay, the son of a janitor\u2014was none of those things. He felt immediately conscious of how he held himself, of how he sat, and especially of the pitch of his voice. He tried lowering it, but that felt unnatural, so he withdrew from conversation altogether. He changed the way he walked as well, to avoid being targeted as \u201cgirly.\u201d \u201cOne of my only friends there was gay too,\u201d he said, \u201cand he was a lot more outward about it. He just got destroyed.\u201d Guys who identify as straight but aren\u2019t athletic, or are involved in the arts, or have a lot of female friends, all risk having their masculinity impugned. What has changed for this generation, though, is that some young men, particularly if they grew up around LGBTQ people, don\u2019t rise to the bait. \u201cI don\u2019t mind when people mistake me for being gay,\u201d said Luke, a high-school senior from New York City. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an annoyance than anything, because I want people to believe me when I say I\u2019m straight.\u201d The way he described himself did, indeed, tick every stereotypical box. \u201cI\u2019m a very thin person,\u201d he said. \u201cI like clothing. I care about my appearance in maybe a more delicate way. I\u2019m very in touch with my sensitive side. So when people think I\u2019m gay?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt can feel like more of a compliment. Like, \u2018Oh, you like the way I dress? Thank you! \u2019 \u201d\n\nOne of Luke\u2019s friends, who was labeled \u201cthe faggot frosh\u201d in ninth grade, is not so philosophical. \u201cHe treats everything as a test of his masculinity,\u201d Luke told me. \u201cLike, once when I was wearing red pants, I heard him say to other people, \u2018He looks like such a faggot.\u2019 I didn\u2019t care, and maybe in that situation no one was really harmed, but when you apply that attitude to whole populations, you end up with Donald Trump as president.\u201d W\u2019s AND L\u2019s Sexual conquest\u2014or perhaps more specifically, bragging about your experiences to other boys\u2014is, arguably, the most crucial aspect of toxic masculinity. Nate, who attended a public high school in the Bay Area, knew this well. At a party held near the beginning of his junior year of high school, he sank deep into the couch, trying to look chill. Kids were doing shots and smoking weed. Some were Juuling. Nate didn\u2019t drink much himself and never got high. He wasn\u2019t morally opposed to it; he just didn\u2019t like the feeling of being out of control. At 16, reputation meant everything to Nate, and certain things could cement your status. \u201cThe whole goal of going to a party is to hook up with girls and then tell your guys about it,\u201d he said. And there\u2019s this \u201crace for experience,\u201d because if you get behind, by the time you do hook up with a girl \u201cshe\u2019ll have hit it with, like, five guys already. Then she\u2019s going to know how to do things\u201d you don\u2019t\u2014and that\u2019s a problem, if she tells people \u201cyou\u2019ve got floppy lips\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t know how to get her bra off.\u201d\n\nA lanky boy with dark, liquid eyes and curly hair that resisted all attempts at taming, Nate put himself in the middle of his school\u2019s social hierarchy: friends with both the \u201cpopular\u201d and \u201clower\u201d kids. Still, he\u2019d hooked up with only three girls since ninth grade\u2014kissing, getting under their shirts\u2014but none had wanted a repeat. That left him worried about his skills. He is afraid of intimacy, he told me sincerely. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge self-esteem suck.\u201d It would probably be more accurate to say that Nate was afraid of having drunken sexual interactions with a girl he did not know or trust. But it was all about credentialing. \u201cGuys need to prove themselves to their guys,\u201d Nate said. To do that, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be dominating.\u201d They\u2019re going to \u201cpush.\u201d Because the girl is just there \u201cas a means for him to get off and to brag.\u201d Before the start of this school year, Nate\u2019s \u201cdry spell\u201d had seemed to be ending. He\u2019d been in a relationship with a girl that lasted a full two weeks, until other guys told him she was \u201cslutty\u201d\u2014their word, he hastened to add, not his. Although any hookup is marginally better than none, Nate said, you only truly earn points for getting sexual with the right kind of girl. \u201cIf you hook up with a girl below your status, it\u2019s an \u2018L,\u2019 \u201d he explained. \u201cA loss. Like, a bad move.\u201d So he stopped talking to the girl, which was too bad. He\u2019d really liked her.\n\nAnthony Blasko\n\nAfter a short trip to the kitchen to watch his friend Kyle stand on a table and drunkenly try to pour Sprite from a can into a shot glass, Nate returned to the couch, starting to relax as people swirled around him. Suddenly Nicole, the party\u2019s host and a senior, plopped onto his lap, handing him a shot of vodka. Nate was impressed, if a little confused. Usually, if a girl wanted to hook up with you, there were texts and Snapchats, and if you said yes, it was on; everyone would be anticipating it, and expecting a postmortem.\n\nNate thought Nicole was \u201cpretty hot\u201d\u2014she had a great body, he said\u2014though he\u2019d never been especially interested in her before this moment. Still, he knew that hooking up with her would be a \u201cW.\u201d A big one. He glanced around the room subtly, wanting to make sure, without appearing to care, that everyone who mattered\u2014everyone \u201crelevant\u201d\u2014saw what was going down. A couple of guys gave him little nods. One winked. Another slapped him on the shoulder. Nate feigned nonchalance. Meanwhile, he told me, \u201cI was just trying not to pop a boner.\u201d Nicole took Nate\u2019s hand and led him to an empty bedroom. He got through the inevitable, cringey moments when you actually have to talk to your partner, then, finally, they started kissing. In his anxiety, Nate bit Nicole\u2019s lip. Hard. \u201cI was thinking, Oh God! What do I do now?\u201d But he kept going. He took off her top and undid her bra. He took off his own shirt. Then she took off her pants. \u201cAnd that,\u201d he said, \u201cwas the first time I ever saw a vagina. I did not know what to do with it.\u201d He recalled that his friends had said girls go crazy if you stick your fingers up there and make the \u201ccome here\u201d motion, so he tried it, but Nicole just lay there. He didn\u2019t ask what might feel better to her, because that would have been admitting ignorance. After a few more agonizing minutes, Nicole announced that she wanted to see what was going on upstairs, and left, Nate trailing behind. A friend handed him a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s. Another high-fived him. A third said, \u201cDude, you hit that!\u201d Maybe the hookup hadn\u2019t been a disaster after all: He still had bragging rights.\n\nThen he heard a senior, a guy Nate considered kind of a friend, loudly ask Nicole, \u201cWhy would you hook up with Nate?\u201d She giggled. \u201cOh, I was drunk!\u201d she said. \u201cI was so drunk!\u201d They were calling him an \u201cL.\u201d By Monday morning, Nicole had spread the word that Nate was bad at hooking up: that he\u2019d bit her lip, that he didn\u2019t know how to finger a girl. That his nails were ragged. \u201cThe stereotype is that guys go into gory detail,\u201d Nate said, but \u201cit\u2019s the other way around.\u201d Guys will brag, but they\u2019re not specific. Girls will go into \u201cwhat his penis looked like,\u201d every single thing he did. Nate said he felt \u201ccompletely emasculated,\u201d so mortified that he told his mom he was sick and stayed home from school the next day. \u201cI was basically crying,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, Shit! I fucked up.\u201d No question, gossip about poor \u201cperformance\u201d can destroy a guy\u2019s reputation almost as surely as being called a \u201cslut\u201d or a \u201cprude\u201d can destroy a girl\u2019s. As a result, the boys I talked with were concerned with female satisfaction during a hookup; they just didn\u2019t typically define it as the girl having an orgasm. They believed it to be a function of their own endurance and, to a lesser extent, penis size. A college freshman in Los Angeles recalled a high-school classmate who\u2019d had sex with a girl who told everyone he\u2019d ejaculated really quickly: \u201cHe got the nickname Second Sam. That basically scared the crap out of all the other guys.\u201d A college senior in Boston recounted how he would glance at the clock when he started penetration. \u201cI\u2019d think, I have to last five minutes, minimum,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd once I could do that, I\u2019d think, I need to get to double digits. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessarily about your partner\u2019s enjoyment. It\u2019s more about getting beyond the point where you\u2019d be embarrassed, maintaining your pride. It turns sex into a task\u2014one I enjoy to a certain degree, but one where you\u2019re monitoring your performance rather than living in the moment.\u201d\n\nEventually, Nate decided that he had to take a stand, if only to make returning to school bearable. He texted Nicole and said, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m sorry that you didn\u2019t enjoy it, [but] I would never roast you. Why are you doing this?\u2019 \u201d She felt \u201creally bad,\u201d he said. \u201cShe stopped telling people, but it took me until the next semester to recover.\u201d HOW MISOGYNY BECOMES \u201cHILARIOUS\u201d No matter how often I heard it, the brutal language that even a conscientious young man like Nate used to describe sexual contact\u2014you hit that!\u2014always unnerved me. In mixed-sex groups, teenagers may talk about hooking up (already impersonal), but when guys are on their own, they nail, they pound, they bang, they smash, they hammer. They tap that ass, they tear her up. It can be hard to tell whether they have engaged in an intimate act or just returned from a construction site. It\u2019s not like I imagined boys would gush about making sweet, sweet love to the ladies, but why was their language so weaponized ? The answer, I came to believe, was that locker-room talk isn\u2019t about sex at all, which is why guys were ashamed to discuss it openly with me. The (often clearly exaggerated) stories boys tell are really about power: using aggression toward women to connect and to validate one another as heterosexual, or to claim top spots in the adolescent sexual hierarchy. Dismissing that as \u201cbanter\u201d denies the ways that language can desensitize\u2014abrade boys\u2019 ability to see girls as people deserving of respect and dignity in sexual encounters.\n\nFor evidence, look no further than the scandals that keep popping up at the country\u2019s top colleges: Harvard, Amherst, Columbia, Yale (the scene of an especially notorious 2010 fraternity chant, \u201cNo means yes; yes means anal\u201d). Most recently, in the spring of 2019, at the politically progressive Swarthmore College, in Pennsylvania, two fraternities disbanded after student-run publications released more than 100 pages of \u201cminutes\u201d from house meetings a few years earlier that included, among other things, jokes about a \u201crape attic\u201d and the acquiring of roofies, \u201cfinger blasting\u201d a member\u2019s 10-year-old sister, and vomiting on women during sex. When called out, boys typically claim that they thought they were just being \u201cfunny.\u201d And in a way that makes sense\u2014when left unexamined, such \u201chumor\u201d may seem like an extension of the gross-out comedy of childhood. Little boys are famous for their fart jokes, booger jokes, poop jokes. It\u2019s how they test boundaries, understand the human body, gain a little cred among their peers. But, as can happen with sports, their glee in that can both enable and camouflage sexism. The boy who, at age 10, asks his friends the difference between a dead baby and a bowling ball may or may not find it equally uproarious, at 16, to share what a woman and a bowling ball have in common (you can Google it). He may or may not post ever-escalating \u201cjokes\u201d about women, or African Americans, or homosexuals, or disabled people on a group Snapchat. He may or may not send \u201cfunny\u201d texts to friends about \u201cgirls who need to be raped,\u201d or think it\u2019s hysterical to surprise a buddy with a meme in which a woman is being gagged by a penis, her mascara mixed with her tears. He may or may not, at 18, scrawl the names of his hookups on a wall in his all-male dorm, as part of a year-long competition to see who can \u201cpull\u201d the most. Perfectly nice, bright, polite boys I interviewed had done one or another of these things.\n\nHow does that happen? I talked with a 15-year-old from the East Coast who had been among a group of boys suspended from school for posting more than 100 racist and sexist \u201cjokes\u201d about classmates on a group Finsta (a secondary, or \u201cfake,\u201d Instagram account that is in many cases more genuine than a \u201cRinsta,\u201d or \u201creal\u201d account).\u201cThe Finsta became very competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wanted to make your friends laugh, but when you\u2019re not face-to-face,\u201d you can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019ll get a reaction, \u201cso you go one step beyond.\u201d It was \u201cthat combination of competitiveness and that \u2026 disconnect that triggered it to get worse and worse.\u201d\n\n\u200bAnthony Blasko\n\nAt the most disturbing end of the continuum, \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201chilarious\u201d become a defense against charges of sexual harassment or assault. To cite just one example, a boy from Steubenville, Ohio, was captured on video joking about the repeated violation of an unconscious girl at a party by a couple of high-school football players. \u201cShe is so raped,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThey raped her quicker than Mike Tyson.\u201d When someone off camera suggested that rape wasn\u2019t funny, he retorted, \u201cIt isn\u2019t funny\u2014it\u2019s hilarious!\u201d \u201cHilarious\u201d is another way, under the pretext of horseplay or group bonding, that boys learn to disregard others\u2019 feelings as well as their own. \u201cHilarious\u201d is a haven, offering distance when something is inappropriate, confusing, depressing, unnerving, or horrifying; when something defies boys\u2019 ethics. It allows them to subvert a more compassionate response that could be read as unmasculine\u2014and makes sexism and misogyny feel transgressive rather than supportive of an age-old status quo. Boys may know when something is wrong; they may even know that true manhood\u2014or maybe just common decency\u2014compels them to speak up. Yet, too often, they fear that if they do, they\u2019ll be marginalized or, worse, themselves become the target of derision from other boys. Masculinity, then, becomes not only about what boys do say, but about what they don\u2019t\u2014or won\u2019t, or can\u2019t\u2014say, even when they wish they could. The psychologists Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson, the authors of Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys, have pointed out that silence in the face of cruelty or sexism is how too many boys become men. Charis Denison, a sex educator in the Bay Area, puts it another way: \u201cAt one time or another, every young man will get a letter of admission to \u2018dick school.\u2019 The question is, will he drop out, graduate, or go for an advanced degree?\u201d",
