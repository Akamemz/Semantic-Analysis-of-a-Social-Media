    "content": "Earlier in the month , House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters that Republicans would soon introduce tangible legislation to uproot the failing Obamacare status quo and replace it with a better system . GOP leadership released an outline in mid-February that hinted at the approach they were planning to adopt -- and now a more detailed draft proposal has leaked into the press . With all the necessary caveats in place about how the document is by no means a finalized piece of legislation , it provides the most comprehensive and specific glimpse to date at Republicans ' long-awaited Obamacare alternative . Writing at Commentary , Noah Rothman sees a lot to like for conservatives :\n[ This would-be ] bill eliminates most of the onerous , market-distorting provisions contained within the Leviathan ACA . It eliminates many of the subsidies that reduce the incentives for those who are currently outside the labor force to remain there , and it kills the individual mandate to purchase insurance . Based on age , not income , the plan would establish tax credits to help uninsured patients afford private insurance plans . The plan scales back or eliminates some of ObamaCare \u2019 s most burdensome tax provisions , including Medicare surtax on wages and self-employment income . It eliminates federal Medicaid expansion by 2020 , but preserves capped payments to states based on the number of enrollees in states that expanded Medicaid already . Most encouragingly , the plan includes grants to states that would allow them to experiment with programs designed to increase coverage rates or reduce premiums .\nThen again , he argues , other elements appear to partially mimic or tweak Obamacare 's existing provisions . Conservative healthcare wonk Avik Roy also offers a 'mixed verdict ' analysis of the roadmap laid out in the leaked document . He notes that Republicans appear to have abandoned the flawed `` repeal and delay '' strategy , which would have rolled back large swaths of Obamacare via reconciliation , then punted the replacement piece to an undetermined later date . The problem with this idea was that major Obamacare regulations would still have stayed in place even after the law 's ( admittedly faulty ) structure to keep the entire system from rapidly collapsing had been gutted . The resulting market disruptions would have been catastrophic . The introduction and installation of a sustainable alternative plan to supplant Obamacare , as opposed to just creating a yawning Obamacare-less void , is both politically necessary and much more responsible from a public policy perspective . The GOP plan returns regulatory decisions about what viable coverage plans must cover back to the states ( an important departure from Obamacare 's federally-driven mandate bonanza ) , and gives insurers a wider berth for charging younger consumers lower premiums than older ones . These reforms would help create a wider array of available coverage , including cheaper options , and would help stabilize the risk pools that Obamacare is ruining .\nIn place of Obamacare 's federal marketplace and direct taxpayer subsidies , the GOP solution implements a regime of tax credits to assist Americans afford insurance plans . Roy argues that the way in which the draft GOP plan structures the credits is flawed , and also analyzes the proposed dollar amounts -- which range from $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 annually for most people . The proposal also entails critical reforms to Medicaid ( through a form of flexible block-granting ) and Health Savings Accounts ( roughly doubling the amount of money individuals and families can save for medical expenses tax-free ) . It also pumps billions into a modernized version of high risk pools , under which states can innovate and invest to help cover the medical expenses of their most vulnerable citizens . The new law would still prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions , so long as those people have maintained continuous coverage . This strongly incentivizes consumers to obtain coverage without imposing an individual mandate tax ( which is repealed under this plan ) , and while disincentivizing people to wait until they develop a health problem or injury before finally enrolling ( by permitting insurers to charge substantially more to people who seek to sign up after a coverage gap ) .\nOverall , there are disputes and details that will undoubtedly still need to be ironed out . That 's what debates , negotiations and legislative mark-ups are for . I 'd be quite surprised if the eventual legislative language were identical to the draft document , which is a useful and important starting point . Meanwhile , knee-jerk accusations from some conservatives that the plan amounts to `` Obamacare lite '' are unfair ; the core of the troubled law is removed and replaced with a system that massively curtails burdensome federal mandates and taxes , and offers much more flexibility and discretion to the states . These changes , if adopted , would represent a welcome paradigm shift . That said , it 's not as if federal spending , mandates and revenue-raisers will all magically disappear . Helping tens of millions of people have access to affordable coverage is a complex policy challenge . Republicans ' draft proposal seeks to end the current law , then provide needed solutions in a less intrusive and market-distorting way than the current sputtering reality under Democrats ' failed scheme . Finally , with media chatter about town hall meetings on healthcare all the rage these days ( with appalling displays like this receiving scant attention ) , I 'll leave you with a few points : ( 1 ) Conservatives should go out of their way to attend these events and make phone calls to their members ' offices in order to help stiffen GOP spines in the face of intense , and sometimes coordinated , liberal opposition .
