    "content": "Turning his attention yet again to the economy , President Obama on Wednesday zeroed in on the \u201c defining challenge \u201d of this generation \u2014 growing income inequality between the richest 1 percent and the rest of America .\nBut the president didn \u2019 t unveil any grand proposals to tackle the problem ; instead , he repeated a laundry list of initiatives centered on many familiar themes : economic growth through government investment ; job training and education reform ; stronger protections for labor unions and paycheck fairness legislation ; a hike to the minimum wage ; and a revamped approach to how Americans save for retirement in private accounts and in government programs such as Social Security .\nAlthough his speech was short on specific ideas , it was big on ambition . The president talked in broad terms about how the greatest nation on earth must not allow the middle class to stagnate and the poor to get poorer as rich Americans \u2019 net worth grows .\n\u201c I believe this is the defining challenge of our time \u2014 making sure our economy works for every working American . That \u2019 s why I ran for president , \u201d Mr. Obama said at an event in Southeast Washington hosted by the left-leaning Center for American Progress . \u201c It drives everything I do in this office . I know I \u2019 ve raised this issue before and some will ask why I raise the issue again right now . I do it because the outcomes of the debates we \u2019 re having right now , whether it \u2019 s health care , or the budget , or reforming our housing and financial systems , all of these things will have real practical implications for every American . I am convinced the decisions we make on these issues over the next few years will determine whether our children grow up in an America where opportunity is real . \u201d\nPointing out widening income disparities is not new for Mr. Obama , who spoke of the issue often during both of his presidential campaigns . Indeed , it has become a focal point of politics in the U.S. and led some leaders such as former Sen. John Edwards , North Carolina Democrat , to declare there are \u201c two Americas \u201d \u2014 one for the rich and another for everyone else .\nThe question isn \u2019 t whether income inequality should be addressed , analysts say , but how the problem should be approached . On that front , they say , Mr. Obama simply is offering more of the same .\n\u201c What I heard was the same old , very broad brush strokes : We need to help the middle class , we need to raise the minimum wage and we need to do more infrastructure projects . More spending , \u201d said Lance Roberts , CEO of STA Wealth Management who has more than 25 years of experience in private banking , investment management and venture capital .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s throw money at it , \u201d Mr. Roberts said of the administration \u2019 s approach to income disparities and a generally poor economy . \u201c If it doesn \u2019 t work , it \u2019 s because we didn \u2019 t throw enough money at it . We \u2019 ve done five years of this . \u201d\nIn those five years , income inequality has hit a record level , according to a September report from the University of California , Berkeley . The study shows that income gaps continue to grow despite the administration \u2019 s intentions .\nFrom 2009 to 2012 , the top 1 percent of incomes in the U.S. grew by more than 31 percent , while the bottom 99 percent went up by 0.4 percent . During the same period , the top 1 percent of earners captured 95 percent of all income gains .\nIn 2012 , as Mr. Obama neared the end of his first term that imposed massive government investment through his stimulus package , the top 1 percent of American incomes rose by nearly 20 percent while the bottom 99 percent of incomes grew by just 1 percent , according to the Berkeley report .\nRepublicans seized on the president \u2019 s remarks and framed them against the backdrop of such grim income statistics .\n\u201c The American dream is certainly more in doubt than in decades , but after more than five years in office , the president has no one to blame but himself , \u201d said Brendan Buck , a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican .\nThe president \u2019 s approach is \u201c more stimulus , more government programs and more government intervention into the job-creating private sector , \u201d Mr. Buck said . \u201c By now , and by the president \u2019 s own admission , it should be clear that is not the solution . \u201d\nIncome inequality usually is framed in purely economic terms , but the president cast it in a broader light and said it poses a fundamental threat to American democracy .\n\u201c Ordinary folks can \u2019 t write massive campaign checks or hire high-priced lobbyists and lawyers to secure policies that tilt the playing field in their favor at everyone else \u2019 s expense , \u201d he said . \u201c So people get the bad taste that the system is rigged .
