His rivals did it for him .\nThe rapid evaporation of the Wisconsin governor 's campaign on Monday quickly reshaped the already rollicking Republican presidential primary .

And they 're getting a lot of attention .\n`` It all really started mostly this morning , '' recalled Cliff Hurst , who began the day as Walker 's New Hampshire co-chair and ended it as Marco Rubio 's .

''\nAnd as the afternoon approached and rumors of Walker 's exit began to swirl , Walker national finance co-chairman Anthony Scaramucci found himself on the line with three different presidential candidates who rang his cell phone .\n`` Politics has a musical chairs component to it , '' he said . `` You have the hourglass of sand and at the end of the day , there 's only one seat . ''\nWalker 's political support eroded to nearly nothing , with a CNN/ORC national poll on Sunday showing that interest in his candidacy had been extinguished as candidates like Donald Trump , Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina rose to the top of the fray .
