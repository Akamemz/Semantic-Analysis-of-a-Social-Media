    "content": "After five months and four special elections under President Donald Trump , neither faction in the Democratic Party \u2019 s civil war can claim anything beyond \u201c moral victories \u201d ( better known as defeats ) and a whole bunch of excuses . Democrats nominated a folksy Berniecrat progressive , more or less , in Montana . He lost to a guy who punched out a reporter . They nominated a clean-cut Clintonite moderate , more or less , in suburban Atlanta . He lost to a woman who said she was against \u201c a livable wage . \u201d\nYes , the margins in those different elections in different places were similarly close -- but whatever you think you may know about Democratic turnout in those races , it was downright dreadful . ( They were close , in the end , because Republican turnout was even worse . ) Democrats also nominated hopeless unknowns in elections in Kansas and South Carolina where they never thought they had a chance \u2014 and came surprisingly close to winning those too . You know what they say about \u201c close . \u201d\nThere might be some complicated lessons to be learned here about patience and strategy and messaging and policy \u2014 or , in all honesty , there might not . Four off-year elections in red states is an extremely poor data set , subject to almost any interpretive spin you want to enforce . I \u2019 m already on record in full-Cassandra mode when it comes to the \u201c blue wave \u201d fantasy of 2018 that will supposedly produce a Democratic House majority , drive Trump from office and restore sanity , decency and normalcy from sea to shining sea . First of all , what sanity and normalcy are being restored , and where do we find them ? The status quo ante of Nov. 7 , 2016 ? Was that sane and normal ? Barack Obama \u2019 s first election night in 2008 ? Bill Clinton \u2019 s administration , before we realized he was a lecherous ogre with dreadful policies ? Who the hell knows ? It \u2019 s the liberal version of Making America Great Again .\nBut it \u2019 s way too early for \u201c I told you so. \u201d If we stick to the limited facts available at the moment , I think we can see the Democratic Party \u2019 s current predicament more clearly . Democrats and liberals across the country went all-in on Jon Ossoff \u2019 s campaign in the Sixth District of Georgia , I guess because it was the only game in town . They were hungry for a big symbolic victory that would validate the party and its 2018 campaign as the most authentic and most pragmatic vehicle for the anti-Trump resistance . Whatever they may say about it now , they thought they could win that one , and they didn \u2019 t . It wasn \u2019 t even a nail-biter or a photo finish : Republican Karen Handel , a compromised , inarticulate and conspicuously evil candidate , led the count from beginning to end and won by about 10,000 votes .\nAll that has happened since then , by way of internal reflection , is a renewal of the social-media war between the Bernie-fied progressives and the Hillary-style centrists , with each side accusing the other of being the reason none of us can have dessert without a swirl of Trump on top . Inevitably , the Ossoff episode is being read as a chapter in the Democratic civil war , although I suspect its real significance is broader than that .\nI agree with \u2588\u2588\u2588 contributor Bill Curry ( who worked in the White House under Bill Clinton ) that open internal conflict over policies and principles \u2014 and over the nature of power and politics , and what works and doesn \u2019 t work in American society \u2014 is a necessary aspect of rebuilding the Democratic Party . But I \u2019 m not sure any such contest of ideas is actually happening beneath all the name-calling and mutual recrimination . One of the problems illustrated in miniature by the Ossoff case is that Democratic moderates or centrists no longer do ideas , and appear to believe politics is better off without them .\nI 'm trying to get past some zero-sum question of who 's more right and who 's got a winning political strategy , which frankly is n't that interesting . Bernie Sanders and his insurgent troops have injected a ferocious new energy into the party , but they have no monopoly on the truth and some of them have undeniably behaved like jerks at times . At their most effective the Democrats have always been a party of factions ; every possible path back to power will involve a tactical alliance between mainstream liberal coalition-builders and progressives who seek major structural reform . If this party is to have any future at all , it can not see economic justice and full equality for women , LGBT people , African-Americans and immigrants as distinct or separable priorities .\nThe problem with the Democratic moderates is not they are moderates whose ideas are worse than those of their opponents . That 's a subjective question , after all , and such conflict is in the nature of politics . It 's more that they do n't want to talk about their ideas or defend them , and often -- as in the agonized case of Jon Ossoff -- give the strong impression of not having any .\nThe problem is that the constellation of neoliberal positions known as the \u201c Washington consensus , \u201d which has long been embraced by mainstream Democrats and Republicans alike -- positions on free trade and fiscal austerity and financial deregulation and the national security state and a bunch of related matters -- has suddenly become politically toxic . Bill Clinton would have been eager to defend and debate all those things 20 years ago ( and , hell , he probably still would ) but no major figure in the Democratic Party wants to talk about them today . Many people in the center or right of the party , wrong-footed by this entire development , either claim to have no ideology at all or claim to have forgotten or recanted a whole bunch of it . Jon Ossoff chose the first path ; Hillary Clinton the second . You will notice the parallels in terms of outcome .\nOssoff \u2019 s defeat was a crushing and confusing blow to the Clintonista moderates , who keep believing , Dorothy-style , that if they find the right pair of ruby slippers and click them together they can undo everything that happened in 2016 at a single stroke . Many of the excuses and rationalizations and \u201c next year in Jerusalem \u201d assurances offered to frame the Ossoff debacle sound reasonable enough , at first glance . They might seem even more so if those same people hadn \u2019 t spent the previous week assuring us , in the classic mode of adults who understand the real world and how it works , that Jeremy Corbyn \u2019 s unexpected success in the British election could provide no useful model for America or the Democrats because Corbyn hadn \u2019 t actually won anything .\nIt \u2019 s certainly true that Republicans had a built-in demographic advantage in the Georgia Sixth , which is mostly white and highly affluent and has been held by the GOP for almost 40 years . It \u2019 s true that previous incumbent Tom Price \u2014 now Trump \u2019 s secretary of health and human services \u2014 was re-elected last fall by a margin of 23 points . To take a giant leap off the top of Big Rock Candy Mountain , it is technically true that if the relative vote shift from Republican to Democrat that we saw in Georgia ( and Montana and South Carolina ) were replicated across the country in the 2018 midterms , Democrats would easily win back the House majority .\nBut I \u2019 m not sure how to characterize the argument that because this one thing happened , this one time , under these circumstances in these places , it \u2019 s bound to happen again on a grand scale in a national election a year and a half from now . You could say that it \u2019 s wildly optimistic , or that it represents a semi-endearing blind faith in the sudden return of \u201c normal \u201d American politics , in the face of all available evidence . Or you could just say that it \u2019 s a total crock . It \u2019 s the kind of thing losing political parties say , to convince themselves that their defeats are not actually defeats because the Democracy Fairy will turn them into victories at some undefined point in the future .\nFurthermore , as I hinted earlier , the dominant liberal narrative about what happened in the Georgia Sixth is somewhere between highly misleading and complete fiction . If you \u2019 ve gotten the impression that the commuter hellscape of the northern Atlanta 'burbs saw a surge of anti-Trump , pro-Democratic enthusiasm that wasn \u2019 t quite enough to put Ossoff over the top , that \u2019 s 100 percent fake news . Want to know how many votes Ossoff picked up with all those millions of dollars in outside donations and all those doorbell-ringing volunteers ? I will tell you : Essentially none .\nNo , it 's true . Ossoff received almost exactly the same vote total as the district \u2019 s previous Democratic nominee got against Tom Price in 2016 . ( In fact , he got 24 fewer votes than that guy . Twenty-four ! ) The race was close because Karen Handel underperformed drastically , getting about 66,000 fewer votes than Price did in November . I \u2019 m going to say that again : There were no Democratic gains in that district at all . The \u201c vote shift \u201d was entirely a matter of bummed-out Republicans staying home . The dynamic in Montana was similar , if slightly worse for both sides : Democrat Rob Quist got 40,000 fewer votes than the last defeated Democrat , while the infamous Greg Gianforte fell 95,000 votes short of previous GOP incumbent Ryan Zinke .\nMaybe that \u2019 s the grand Democratic strategy for 2018 : Depressed voter turnout ! Republicans are bewildered about Trump , and if you can run somebody so bland and inoffensive that they do n't get pissed off , they might not show up at all . It would be a measure of karmic payback for the Koch brothers , I guess .\nMore seriously , those startling numbers from Georgia call into question the apparently reasonable premise that the only way Democrats could possibly compete there was to run a milquetoast moderate with no discernible ideology . You can \u2019 t win in an archetypal \u201c Panera district \u201d like that one ( the theory holds ) by terrifying the polite , professional white folks with vows to tax the rich , provide health care for all and jack up the price of that Cinnamon Dolce Light Frappuccino with a $ 15 minimum wage .\nThat might all be true , as a matter of electoral calculus . But if the Democrats are now playing the Republicans \u2019 game of trying to shrink the opposing voter base instead of expanding their own , another Rubicon has been crossed in the degradation of democracy . Maybe an activist firebrand candidate might have expanded the Democratic base or motivated the district 's modest African-American population or done something , anything , beyond spending vast sums of money to accomplish literally nothing . Such a candidate might also might have sparked an intense Republican response and lost anyway , to be sure . But isn \u2019 t it better , in terms of morale and long-term strategy , to go down fighting on principle than to go down as a calculated nonentity ?\nJon Ossoff was not a whole bunch of things : He had no political experience and no discernible ideology . He did not actually live in the district where he ran for Congress . ( He did not look old enough to shave . ) To his credit , he was not Donald Trump , not a Republican , not vicious or venal or insane , and those things formed the entire text of his campaign .
