    "content": "The Changing Picture Of Poverty : Hard Work Is 'Just Not Enough '\nThere are 46 million poor people in the U.S. , and millions more hover right above the poverty line \u2014 but go into many of their homes , and you might find a flat-screen TV , a computer or the latest sneakers .\nAnd that raises a question : What does it mean to be poor in America today ?\nTake Victoria Houser , a 22-year-old single mother who lives in Painted Post , a small town in western New York . At first glance , her life does n't look all that bad . She lives in a cozy two-bedroom apartment . She has food , furniture and toys for her almost 2-year-old son , Brayden . He even likes playing a game called Fruit Ninja on her electronic tablet .\n`` He just likes touching it because he always sees me on my computer , my iPad or something , '' Houser says .\nBrayden 's father is out of the picture , and Houser knows she could be a lot worse off . At least she has a job earning $ 10 an hour preparing food in a company cafeteria .\nStill , you do n't have to look too far to see that her life is teetering on the edge . Her nice-looking apartment ? `` It 's kind of not a very safe place to live , '' she says . `` There 've been quite a few drug busts here . ''\nHouser says she 's scared to let her son play outside . Her next-door neighbor was recently arrested for allegedly murdering someone and stuffing the body in a cupboard .\nBut this subsidized housing is all she can afford . Most of Houser 's paycheck goes for things like food , diapers and gas . And she says what look like luxuries are necessities for her . They 're also mostly gifts from family or friends . She says she has a car to get to work , a computer to take online college courses , a cellphone to check up on her son .\nBut there 's one thing Houser does n't have , and that 's a lot of hope for the future .\nShe says she feels stuck in a never-ending cycle , constantly worried that one financial emergency \u2014 like a broken-down car \u2014 will send everything tumbling down .\n`` Poor to me is the fact that I 'm working my butt off . I 'm trying to go to school . I 'm trying to take care of my son , and that 's just not enough , '' she says .\nAnd it 's this frustration and despair that those who work with struggling families say is the true face of poverty today \u2014 that it 's not just a lack of material things .\n`` It used to be that if you were poor , you just did n't have the basic things , like maybe you did n't have a washer and dryer , and you were able to get by , '' says Kelly Wells , a case manager for Pro Action , a nonprofit community action agency that 's trying to help Houser and others like her .\n`` Now what I see with families is if you 're poor , you 're poor in every avenue : emotionally , supportwise , familywise , '' Wells says .\nShe and other social service providers in western New York say they 're seeing more families ripped apart \u2014 by drug abuse , domestic violence and mental illness .\n50 Years Later , Poverty Looks Different The face of being poor has changed since the 1960s , when President Johnson declared a war on poverty .
