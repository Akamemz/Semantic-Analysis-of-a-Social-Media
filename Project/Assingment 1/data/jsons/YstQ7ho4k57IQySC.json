Kelly Loeffler ( R-GA ) reported the first sale of stock jointly owned by her and her husband on Jan. 24 , the very day that her committee , the Senate Health Committee , hosted a private , all-senators briefing from administration officials , including the CDC director and Anthony Fauci , the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , on the coronavirus .\n\u201c Appreciate today \u2019 s briefing from the President \u2019 s top health officials on the novel coronavirus outbreak , \u201d she tweeted about the briefing at the time .\nThat first transaction was a sale of stock in the company Resideo Technologies valued at between $ 50,001 and $ 100,000 .
