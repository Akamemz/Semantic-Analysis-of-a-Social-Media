    "content": "After lagging for months at historic lows , Mitt Romney 's personal popularity has advanced in the final weekend to its highest of the 2012 campaign , rivaling Barack Obama 's . But Obama pushes back with greater enthusiasm among his supporters - and the race itself remains a tie .\nFifty-four percent of likely voters in the latest \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post tracking poll express a favorable opinion of Obama overall , the most basic measure of a public figure 's popularity . Yet 53 percent now see Romney favorably - a majority , remarkably , for the first time .\nIt 's a dramatic gain for Romney , who emerged from the Republican primaries as the least popular major party candidate in polling back to 1984 and remained there up to the debates . Just 40 percent saw him favorably as recently as late August , and it was essentially no better , 44 percent , after the party conventions .\nThe presidential debates clearly helped him : Sixty-two percent of likely voters describe Romney 's performance in the debates as a factor in their vote , and those who do so are a broad 23 points more likely to see him favorably overall , 61 percent vs. 38 percent . Substantially fewer cite Obama 's handling of the response to Hurricane Sandy as a factor in their vote , 49 percent .\nWhile the gap in overall favorability has closed to naught , and the debates boosted Romney 's personal popularity , Obama holds advantages in strength of support . Thirty-eight percent of likely voters see him `` strongly '' favorably , 8 percentage points more than say the same about Romney . `` Strong '' approval of the president 's job performance , at 34 percent , ties its highest since 2009 , and is nearly double its low in August 2011 . And the share of Obama 's backers who say they 're `` very '' enthusiastic about him has reached its highest of the campaign , moving ahead of Romney 's by a significant margin , 6 points , for the first time in two weeks .\nNotably , with 69 percent of his supporters very enthusiastic , the president has regained the strength-of-support levels he achieved in the 2008 election , after running behind that pace earlier this fall . Romney 's come even farther , more than doubling strong enthusiasm among his supporters since the spring , to 63 percent now , also numerically a new high .\nTHE RACE - These elements play out in a race that could n't be closer : Obama and Romney receive 48 percent support apiece among likely voters in this survey , produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates . By several standards their long-running deadlock has constituted the closest race in pre-election polling in decades .\nAs if it 's needed , independents - potentially swing voters in national elections - provide a further exclamation point . They now also divide precisely evenly , 46-46 percent . That matches Obama 's best to date among independents , and it 's a new low in this group for Romney , who 'd reached 58 percent support among independents just a week and a half ago .\nOne reason the bottom line has not been affected is that , as he 's slipped among independents , Romney 's bulked up among Republicans , with a new high of 97 percent support in his own party . If that holds Tuesday it 'd surpass the in-party record in exit polls dating to 1976 - 93 percent for George W. Bush in 2004 .\nObama has 91 percent support from Democrats - not shabby , but the fact that he 's losing 8 percent of Democrats to Romney , while winning only 3 percent of Republicans , is a challenge . John Kerry suffered a similar disproportion in 2004 ; the difference is that , in this poll , Democrats slightly outnumber Republicans among likely voters , by 4 points , while turnout between the parties was dead even in '04 .\nTHE VOTE - While the focus is on Election Day , for many that 's passed : Twenty-five percent of likely voters say they 've already voted , and an additional 16 percent intend to do so in advance . Obama is +7 points among those who 've voted or plan to vote early , trailing the wide 18-point advantage among early voters he held in ABC/Post 's 2008 pre-election polling . Romney , for his part , is +4 points among those who plan to vote on Election Day . While this year 's differences are n't significant given the sample sizes , these kinds of numbers , if they hold , could be a key element in the outcome of the race .\nThen again , with the contest this close overall , the result could turn on truly any factor - for example , how many women vote ( now +6 Obama ) vs. men ( +7 Romney ) ; how many whites vote ( +20 Romney ) vs. nonwhites ( +59 Obama ) ; how many young adults vote ( +25 Obama ) vs. seniors ( +12 Romney ) ; how many voters with post-graduate degrees vote ( +20 Obama ) vs. the larger proportion with undergraduate degrees only ( +5 Romney ) ; and whether evangelical white Protestants ( +70 Romney ) participate in their customary numbers .\nIn a close contest , in fact every group matters , which explains the campaigns ' hyperactive voter-contact efforts . Nationally 43 percent of likely voters say they 've been contacted by either or both campaigns ; in the eight states now classified as battlegrounds by the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Political Unit that soars to 65 percent . Contact rates have been nearly equal by both camps , a measure on which Obama outpaced John McCain four years ago .\nECONOMY - The issue of the race is the economy ; Obama 's vulnerability on it has been Romney 's key to the White House , yet Romney 's been unable to grasp it firmly . Today likely voters divide by a close 49-46 percent , Romney-Obama , in trust to handle the economy . A significant lead on this issue is what Romney 's needed to break away .\nObama , for his part , is back to a slight 6-point advantage on economic empathy - another element of his pushback against Romney , yet again , not nearly as wide as the president 's advantage on empathy earlier in the campaign .\nWith no strong breakout by either candidate on the economy or on economic empathy , a range of other concerns , predispositions and candidate attributes come to the fore . Obama generally led on those before the debates ; since then the divisions have tightened . Favorability is a prime example : a measure on which the candidates , as with the horse race itself , are tied .\nMETHODOLOGY - This \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone Oct. 30-Nov. 2 , 2012 , among a random national sample of 1,809 likely voters , including landline and cell-phone-only respondents . The survey , conducted after Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast , includes interviews with 283 likely voters in the Northeast . Results in that group are in accord with their pre-storm levels .\nResults have a margin of sampling error of 3 points , including design effect . ( Question 11 was asked Oct. 31-Nov. 2 among 1,485 likely voters ; those results also have a 3-point error margin . Question 29 was asked Nov. 1-2 among 1,164 likely voters ; those results have a 3.5-point error margin . ) The survey was produced for \u2588\u2588\u2588 by Langer Research Associates of New York , N.Y. , with sampling , data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York , N.Y .\nPartisan divisions , Democrats-Republicans-independents , are 33-29-34 percent among likely voters ; they were 39-32-29 percent in the 2008 exit poll .
