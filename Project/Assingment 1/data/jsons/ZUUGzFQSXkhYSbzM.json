As a biracial black woman of Jamaican and Indian descent , she ticked off a list of firsts as she climbed the ranks of national politics . She was the first woman , at the age of 38 , to lead San Francisco \u2019 s district attorney \u2019 s office . She was the first black woman and first Asian American woman to serve as California attorney general and US senator from the state\u2026 \u201c But in the end , it was Harris \u2019 own history that worked against her . As district attorney , she pioneered an innovative program that kept nonviolent first-time offenders out of jail . But she also boasted a tough-on-crime approach , including truancy programs that sent a handful of parents to jail . Harris , still in her first term in the Senate , ultimately could not reconcile the nearly two decades she spent in law enforcement with a rapidly changing political landscape on criminal justice issues that \u2019 s driven by the progressive base \u2019 s desire for systemic change. \u201d Jamilah King , Mother Jones\n\u201c She was dazzling in a Senate hearing room \u2014 who could forget her blistering interrogation of Attorney General William P.
