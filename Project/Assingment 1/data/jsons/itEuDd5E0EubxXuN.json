With second-quarter disclosures due at midnight July 15 , most campaigns released their figures late Wednesday and into the evening .\nAlready , just a few months into the race , the figures tell a few clear stories : Hillary Clinton is amassing a huge war chest , Republicans are getting some huge outside spending totals , and this campaign is going to be all about big spending . Here are the numbers and five things they tell us about fundraising and spending in the 2016 presidential race :\n1 . Hillary Clinton 's campaign has far out-raised all the others .\nClinton 's campaign has raised more than twice as much as any other campaign yet this cycle \u2014 $ 47.5 million . The next-highest-raising campaigns thus far in the 2016 cycle are Republican Marco Rubio ( $ 19.6 million ) , Clinton 's chief Democratic rival , Bernie Sanders ( $ 15.2 million ) , and Republican Ted Cruz ( $ 14.3 million ) . This puts the Clinton campaign 's fundraising roughly on pace with Obama 's $ 46.2 million raised at this point in the 2012 race .\nOf course , different candidates have been in the race for different lengths of time . Cruz , for example , announced in March , months before , for example , Bobby Jindal , who announced in June .\nOne statistic to watch closely in these early months is how much of their money the campaigns have spent already . Donald Trump , for example , has already spent 74 percent of his total receipts . Rick Santorum , Rick Perry , Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee have likewise all spent more than half of their total money raised thus far . Burning through a lot of money fast could help candidates get attention early on , but it could be tough to sustain over a long campaign .\nOK , technically this is something we learned not only from the FEC filings but from candidates and their superPACs themselves .\nUnlike the campaigns , the superPACs supporting individual candidates did not have FEC reports due today . But some campaigns have released numbers on the gargantuan totals some of those outside groups have brought in . A look at a few of those shows just how much of a game-changer that outside money can be , especially for the candidates whose campaigns are already the most successful fundraisers . Jeb Bush 's Right to Rise superPAC , for example , has reported that it raised $ 103 million , which means Bush has $ 114 million in his corner \u2014 10 times the $ 11.4 million his campaign raised , and enough to dwarf the total raised by the Clinton campaign plus the $ 15.6 million her Priorities USA PAC has reportedly raised .\nThese superPACs are n't constrained by donation limits ( like campaigns are ) and can still run ads in support of particular candidates . One trade-off is that they are not allowed to give money directly to campaigns , nor are they allowed to coordinate their efforts with political campaigns .\nBut that does n't mean they 're run by outsiders . Take Clinton 's main superPAC , for instance \u2014 it 's run by Guy Cecil , who was her 2008 campaign political director . Likewise , strategist Mike Murphy , who has worked with Jeb Bush since the 1990s , is running Bush 's superPAC , Right to Rise .\nOne other thing to keep in mind : Even the superPACs and the campaign fundraising do n't tell the full story on how much support a candidate has . Some candidates also have nonprofit groups known as 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) s on their sides \u2014 groups that , unlike superPACs and campaigns , do not have to disclose their donors at all , as Washington Post 's Matea Gold reports .\n3 . Ben Carson , Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders are the kings of small donors .\nCandidates are fond of touting their totals of unitemized donations \u2014 FEC-speak for donations of less than $ 200 \u2014 as a measure of their grass-roots support . Thus far , the candidates who have taken in the largest share of their individual donation totals from these small donors are Sanders ( 76 percent ) , Carson ( 68 percent ) and Paul ( 60 percent ) .\nAt the other end of the spectrum is Bush , who only received 3.4 percent of his individual contributions from those small donors . In fact , he spent more of his own money on his campaign than these small donors did .\nFor her part , Clinton 's campaign had a relatively small share of unitemized donations , at around 17 percent .\nLooking just at the major candidates ( which we 're defining here as the people who in the last quarter raised $ 100,000 or more , not counting self-funding ) , the total amount of spending on this election is already staggering : At this point in the 2012 cycle , these major candidates had taken in around $ 83 million . This time , it 's around $ 138 million .\nOf course , a part of this spike is that there are far more major candidates this time around \u2014 for example , 12 GOP candidates have raised more than $ 100,000 right now , compared with eight in the 2012 cycle . And on the Democrat side , there are three of these candidates this time ( Lincoln Chafee does n't make this cutoff , as he 's largely self-funded right now ) . Last time on the Democrat side , of course , there was simply Obama .\nAverage it out , and the amount per candidate is around $ 9 million , roughly where it was last time . However , while candidates ' slices of the fundraising pie may not have grown a lot on average , the total pie this time looks to be far bigger .\nTrump 's campaign reported $ 1.4 million in receipts \u2014 not massive , but enough to beat out a few other GOP candidates , including Santorum and Jindal .\nBut the majority of that was a loan from Trump himself . His individual donation tallies are remarkably small . Only $ 92,000 of his $ 1.4 million came from individual contributors , and only $ 32,000 of that came via those small , unitemized contributions .

With second-quarter disclosures due at midnight July 15, most campaigns released their figures late Wednesday and into the evening.\n\nAlready, just a few months into the race, the figures tell a few clear stories: Hillary Clinton is amassing a huge war chest, Republicans are getting some huge outside spending totals, and this campaign is going to be all about big spending. Here are the numbers and five things they tell us about fundraising and spending in the 2016 presidential race:\n\n1. Hillary Clinton's campaign has far out-raised all the others.\n\nClinton's campaign has raised more than twice as much as any other campaign yet this cycle \u2014 $47.5 million. The next-highest-raising campaigns thus far in the 2016 cycle are Republican Marco Rubio ($19.6 million), Clinton's chief Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders ($15.2 million), and Republican Ted Cruz ($14.3 million).

Rick Santorum, Rick Perry, Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee have likewise all spent more than half of their total money raised thus far. Burning through a lot of money fast could help candidates get attention early on, but it could be tough to sustain over a long campaign.\n\n2. SuperPAC donations totally change the game.\n\nOK, technically this is something we learned not only from the FEC filings but from candidates and their superPACs themselves.\n\nUnlike the campaigns, the superPACs supporting individual candidates did not have FEC reports due today. But some campaigns have released numbers on the gargantuan totals some of those outside groups have brought in.

In fact, he spent more of his own money on his campaign than these small donors did.\n\nFor her part, Clinton's campaign had a relatively small share of unitemized donations, at around 17 percent.\n\n4. It's going to be one huge-spending campaign.\n\nLooking just at the major candidates (which we're defining here as the people who in the last quarter raised $100,000 or more, not counting self-funding), the total amount of spending on this election is already staggering: At this point in the 2012 cycle, these major candidates had taken in around $83 million.

His individual donation tallies are remarkably small. Only $92,000 of his $1.4 million came from individual contributors, and only $32,000 of that came via those small, unitemized contributions.
