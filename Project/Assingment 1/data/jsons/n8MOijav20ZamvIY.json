Unlike the take-no-prisoners approach of two years ago , these candidates stressed the need to work with Democrats to get things done in Washington . Gone is the tea party-infused talk of confrontation . This diverse group -- top-tier candidates picked to be in the GOP 's `` Young Guns '' program -- includes an openly gay former Massachusetts state legislator , an African-American female mayor from Utah and an Indian-AmericanIvy league graduate from California . Unlike the take-no-prisoners approach of two years ago , these candidates stressed the need to work with Democrats to get things done in Washington .\nRichard Tisei , who was one of the few Republicans in the Democratic-dominated Massachusetts Senate , said that voters are frustrated with a polarized Congress and that he has a record of getting things done .\n`` I can bring my experience , having served in the Legislature on , you know , a state level , down here and hopefully bring some common sense and willingness to work across the aisle , '' Tisei told CNN .\nIf Tisei beats eight-term Democratic Rep John Tierney in November , he would be the first House Republican to say he 's gay while running for a first term in office .

Eric Cantor of Virginia , Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Kevin McCarthy of California . The three were concerned their party was n't doing enough to grow its base and recruit candidates in districts where the GOP lost in 2006 . The program grew to support 90 candidates in 2009 and became part of the National Republican Congressional Commitee . Those selected for the program received financial and political support from the national party , and 62 of them won in 2010 , helping to return the House gavel back to the GOP .\nDemocrats have a similar program they call `` Red to Blue . ''\nMcCarthy , who led GOP recruiting two years ago , which included outreach to females and minorities , told CNN `` the caliber of the candidates has only improved higher because of the success of the last one . '' The third-ranking House Republican said he thinks leaders will pick 30 to 40 Young Guns by this fall .\nFitting the `` young '' part of the bill is Indian-American Ricky Gill , 25 , who hopes he 'll become the youngest member of Congress next year . A Princeton University graduate who has endorsements from popular Republican Govs . Chris Christie of New Jersey and Nikki Haley of South Carolina , Gill said his campaign represents a `` GOP version 2.0 . '' He boasts that he 's raised the most money of any Republican challenger in the country in his bid to unseat Democratic Rep. Jerry McNerney in California .\nGill said the 9th Congressional District in California is the `` quintessential swing '' district . `` The person who 's going to win that race is the one who creates broad agreement about the issues of our day -- it 's getting people back to work ; it 's focusing on our agriculture economy . Those actually are consensus issues . ''\nMore so than Tisei or Gill , Mia Love may defy most people 's expectations of a GOP candidate -- a black , conservative Mormon from Utah . If elected to represent Utah 's 4th Congressional District , Love , the mayor of Saratoga Springs , would be the first black Republican congresswoman .\n`` There are a lot of people who have tried to define me as a person , '' Love , a daughter of Haitian immigrants , told CNN 's Kyra Phillips in an interview last month\nThis year , McCarthy and other Republicans said divided government in Washington means candidates need to stress their ability to find solutions .\nBrad Dayspring , a senior adviser to YG Action Fund , a super PAC that supports House Republican candidates , told CNN that in 2010 candidates talked about repealing President Barack Obama 's health care overhaul , criticizing the spending in the stimulus program and opposing Democratic proposals such as cap and trade , but this year the message centers on `` solving problems . ''\nDayspring , a former Cantor aide , said the party 's ideology and issues are n't changing as Republicans work to increase the GOP majority , but he noted `` a conservative in Massachusetts is going to look a lot different from a conservative in Arkansas . '' His group is evaluating GOP candidates across the country and plans to support 15 to 25 this cycle .\nHouse Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , insists the party is n't getting a makeover , saying Friday of these candidates , `` We did n't choose them for their demographics or their style .
