It \u2019 s as if Biden exists primarily as an idea , rather than an actual candidate .\nToday , as the country ( and the world ) enters what is likely to be a prolonged period of darkness , left to the mercy of a deadly virus , Biden is grappling with the reality of what he can\u2014and must\u2014do in this hour of crisis , as the man who would like to take over leadership of the United States .

He can \u2019 t truly unite the party \u2019 s warring factions . Nor can he begin stockpiling the vast amounts of money he \u2019 ll need for November . His momentum has effectively been stopped cold . For the foreseeable future , all live campaign events are canceled , so he can \u2019 t hit the stump to try to capitalize on the excitement he had just stoked .

What was striking was the sense of anguish and urgency articulated by everyone , everywhere , all the time . And that was before the pandemic .\nThere were the Bernie Sanders supporters on the campus of Florida International University who told me , however reluctantly , that they would vote for Biden because Donald Trump had to be stopped .
