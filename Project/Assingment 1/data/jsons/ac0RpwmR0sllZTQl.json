As he spreads messages at odds with public health experts , he \u2019 s putting real lives at risk .\nTrump \u2019 s case for ending social distancing has no support from health experts\nDuring Tuesday \u2019 s Fox News town hall \u2014 which took place a day after the US recorded its highest single-day death toll amid the coronavirus crisis so far \u2014 Trump rested his case for relaxing social distancing by comparing possible exposure to the coronavirus with unfortunate things that we just take to be facts of life , like the flu or car wrecks .\nHere \u2019 s what Trump had to say in response to Hemmer \u2019 s question about why resuming something approximating normal American social and business life as soon as possible is a good idea ( the video follows ) :\nLook , we lose thousands \u2014 I brought some numbers here \u2014 we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu . We don \u2019 t turn the country off . Now , when I heard the number \u2014 you know , we average 37,000 people a year \u2014 can you believe that ? And actually this year we \u2019 re having a bad flu system . But we lose thousands of people a year to the flu . We never turn the country off . We lose much more than that to automobile accidents . We didn \u2019 t call up the automobile companies and say , \u2018 Stop making cars . We don \u2019 t want any cars anymore. \u2019 We have to get back to work .\nTrump suggests going back to work during a pandemic is really no big deal because lots of people die from the flu and car accidents pic.twitter.com/pRTjmLH7xo \u2014 Aaron Rupar ( @ atrupar ) March 24 , 2020\nAlready facing a difficult reelection campaign before the outbreak of a deadly pandemic his government was unprepared to deal with , it \u2019 s understandable that Trump wants to stabilize an economy decimated by the social-distancing measures meant to stop the spread . But his comments ignore two big ways in which the coronavirus can \u2019 t be compared to the flu or car crashes : It \u2019 s far more contagious than either , and far more deadly .\nOne reason the coronavirus is so concerning is how contagious it is . Without social distancing , experts believe one infected person could infect up to 2.5 other individuals .\nBecause the coronavirus is so contagious , it could easily overwhelm America \u2019 s public health system , leaving hospitals too full to properly treat patients and equipment in short supply . That \u2019 s already on the cusp of happening in New York state , where Gov . Andrew Cuomo pleaded with the federal government earlier Tuesday to provide more medical gear , including much-needed ventilators to help patients with severe Covid-19 cases breathe .\nCUOMO : `` FEMA is sending us 400 ventilators ... I need 30,000 ... you want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators ? ... you 're missing the magnitude of the problem . '' pic.twitter.com/9VtzlvVOEb \u2014 Aaron Rupar ( @ atrupar ) March 24 , 2020\nCar crashes , of course , are not contagious , nor are there so many of them that they overrun hospitals or threaten the nation \u2019 s supply of medical masks and ventilators . That \u2019 s also the case with the flu . According to epidemiologists , an individual with the flu is at risk for spreading it to up to 1.3 people \u2014 about equal to coronavirus \u2019 s contagion level with strong social distancing .\nDespite this , Trump insisted the flu is more dangerous and singled out Cuomo for criticism . The president blamed the governor for a problem he \u2019 s powerless to solve , saying , \u201c He \u2019 s supposed to be buying his own ventilators. \u201d ( Cuomo and other governors argue it \u2019 s suboptimal for states to bid up prices by competing against each other for supplies , and that those purchases are best made by the federal government . )\nAt another point , Trump attacked Cuomo for not doing more on his own to prevent travel from China as the virus spread there . Experts , of course , argue that at best , travel bans like the one Trump instituted at a national level buy time for governments to act \u2014 time Trump failed to use . At worst , they \u2019 re useless .\n`` Do you blame the governor for that ? '' -- with a smug smirk on his face , Trump tries to pin blame for New York 's coronavirus outbreak on Gov .

We do not yet have a coronavirus vaccine , meaning the best tool we have to slow the spread of the virus and minimize deaths is to practice social distancing until testing is so common that we know how far the virus has spread .\nBut Trump \u2019 s argument during the Fox News town hall ( and elsewhere ) was to insist that Americans have already learned the necessary lessons of social distancing and will be careful about practicing it at work . But there \u2019 s really no way for a restaurant server to stay at least 6 feet away from customers , nor is it feasible , for example , for people to practice distancing in crowded buses or factories .\nTrump , however , doesn \u2019 t seem to understand the point of social distancing . During an interview with Fox News that aired after the town hall , he revealed this by telling Hemmer that he hopes to see churches packed on Easter .\nTrump on why he picked Easter as the day he wants to end strict social distancing and reopen American businesses : `` Easter is a very special day for me ...
