Biden tossed overboard the man he called his \u201c brother from another mother. \u201d He griped during the Democratic presidential debate Wednesday that Obamacare needs changes , the trade deal they negotiated falls short and too many illegal immigrants were deported .\n\u201c Absolutely not , \u201d he said when pressed on whether he would continue Obama administration deportation policies , which resulted in 400,000 removals a year , a figure that outraged liberal activists .\nThe Obama legacy took hits from Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California . She described the Affordable Care Act , often touted as Mr. Obama \u2019 s biggest accomplishment , as unacceptable \u201c status quo . \u201d\nSen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey trashed the former president \u2019 s immigration legacy .\nDeflecting criticism of his own administration , New York Mayor Bill de Blasio faulted the Obama Justice Department \u2019 s handling of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner , a black man who died in a chokehold by city police during his arrest for selling cigarettes on the street .\nMr. Biden pivoted Thursday to more forcefully defend Mr. Obama \u2019 s record .\n\u201c I was a little surprised about how much incoming there was about Barack , \u201d he said at a campaign stop at a Detroit diner . \u201c I \u2019 m proud of having served with him . I \u2019 m proud of the job he did . I don \u2019 t think there is anything he has to apologize for . \u201d\nMr. Biden didn \u2019 t reverse course on where he distanced himself from the country \u2019 s first black president .\nHowever , he defended the Obama immigration record , citing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals deportation amnesty granted to illegal immigrant \u201c Dreamers. \u201d He said the number of deportations was a poor yardstick for the administration \u2019 s accomplishments .\n\u201c The idea it \u2019 s somehow comparable to what this guy \u2019 s doing is bizarre , \u201d he said .\nZach Friend , a Democratic strategist who worked on Mr. Obama \u2019 s 2008 campaign , said it was a mistake to mess with the former president , whose popularity among Democrats has been as high as 97 % in recent polls .\n\u201c It seems counterproductive to focus on concerns with his legacy rather than on President Trump \u2019 s current policies , \u201d he said . \u201c Ultimately , the differences in shades of blue between these candidates pale in comparison to the differences between these candidates and the policies of the current administration .
