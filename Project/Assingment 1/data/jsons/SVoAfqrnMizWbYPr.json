Scott Tipton for the GOP nomination in Colorado \u2019 s Third District . Boebert is a conservative gun rights activist who touts her support for Trump , as well as her belief in \u201c personal freedom , citizen rights , and upholding the Constitution of the United States , \u201d on her campaign website .\nShe \u2019 s seemingly also on board with QAnon : In May , she told far-right personality and QAnon supporter Ann Vandersteel that the theory isn \u2019 t really her \u201c thing , \u201d but then later added , \u201c I hope that [ Q ] is real , because it only means America is getting stronger and better and people are returning to conservative values . \u201d\nAnd in the traditionally Republican Colorado Third District \u2014 Tipton won by about 8 points in 2018 \u2014 Boebert is also the favorite to win in November .\nIf she does , odds are good she won \u2019 t be alone in her familiarity with QAnon when she gets to Congress . Marjorie Taylor Greene , a Georgia Republican , almost won her primary outright in Georgia \u2019 s 14th District , which lacks an incumbent , and she \u2019 s on track to win again in the August runoff . Greene is even more open in her support for the conspiracy theory : In a 2017 video discussing it \u2014 one of several first uncovered by Politico \u2014 she told supporters that \u201c there \u2019 s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles out , and I think we have the president to do it . \u201d\nBoebert and Greene are the two QAnon-supporting candidates most likely to make it to Congress this November , but they \u2019 re not the only ones who have a shot . According to Media Matters , there are at least eight other QAnon-friendly candidates for Congress who have already won their primaries , as well as one more ( in addition to Greene ) who \u2019 s headed for a runoff .\nIt \u2019 s a surprising number of people to have successfully running for office while embracing an objectively wild conspiracy theory . But maybe not that surprising \u2014 after all , one of the president \u2019 s sons posted a QAnon graphic on Instagram just last month .\nCandidates don \u2019 t need to explicitly endorse conspiracy theories to elevate them\nAccording to Travis View , a QAnon expert and co-host of the podcast QAnon Anonymous , part of it is just politics , albeit a particularly Faustian variety . The fanatical dedication to QAnon that characterizes many of the conspiracy \u2019 s acolytes turns out to be very effective when it comes to spreading a particular candidate \u2019 s message \u2014 or , at least , it is if they think a candidate is on their side .\nOf Boebert , View says , \u201c I feel like she \u2019 s being very crafty in that she seems aware of what she needs to say in order to give enough wink and acknowledgment to the QAnon community without out-and-out endorsing it . \u201d\nWe can now add Lauren Boebert to the ever-growing list of QAnon supporters who are running for Congress . https : //t.co/VJbFGkYKLx pic.twitter.com/m1bklAfikp \u2014 Right Wing Watch ( @ RightWingWatch ) May 18 , 2020\nBoebert has continued to walk that fine line since her win on Tuesday . \u201c I \u2019 m glad the [ inspector general ] and the [ attorney general ] are investigating deep state activities that undermine the President , \u201d she said in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I don \u2019 t follow QAnon . \u201d\nBut Graham Brookie , an expert on disinformation and the director of the Atlantic Council \u2019 s Digital Forensic Research Lab , says that whether candidates like Boebert officially lay claim to the conspiracy theory doesn \u2019 t matter too much .\n\u201c She may not identify as an adherent of QAnon conspiracy theories , \u201d Brookie , a native of Colorado \u2019 s Third District , said in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c but she has certainly amplified them provably , and the impact is the same on the audience . \u201d\nI also happen to run a nonpartisan center dedicated to identifying & explaining disinformation .\nSo let me explain this : Lauren Boebert is an unabashed conspiracy theorist , who spreads QAnon & is unfit for elected office . https : //t.co/CZX86BYSbR \u2014 Graham Brookie ( @ GrahamBrookie ) July 1 , 2020\nQAnon supporters \u2014 and believers of other conspiracies \u2014 are \u201c primed to believe in code words and secrets , \u201d as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Jane Coaston explained :\nConspiracy theories create order out of chaos , attempting to make sense of events that don \u2019 t make sense . And researchers have found that fact-based arguments against them only serve to reinforce them in the minds of believers . That \u2019 s what makes QAnon or Sandy Hook trutherism or any other conspiracy theory so difficult to combat : Because conspiracy theories aren \u2019 t based on facts , conspiracy theorists aren \u2019 t receptive to them either .\nNot all QAnon-friendly candidates are like Boebert , though : Some exist much closer to the Greene end of the spectrum .\nSpecifically , View describes some QAnon supporters as \u201c pragmatic \u201d in their embrace of the conspiracy theory : \u201c cynical grifters who see the QAnon community as a bunch of people who can be exploited for money or online audiences , \u201d or even to win a Republican primary .\nBut in other cases , he says , \u201c you see people who are genuinely radicalized by the QAnon story. \u201d For example , View says , Jo Rae Perkins , who won the Republican nomination for Senate in Oregon , appears to be a \u201c true believer \u201d ; she even made explicit reference to Q in her victory speech this May .\nTacit support for QAnon makes sense for some candidates in today \u2019 s GOP\nWhen it comes to the recent surge in QAnon-supporting candidates , most of their voters \u2014 and there are about 600,000 of them , according to a calculation by the Washington Post \u2014 aren \u2019 t voting for Q directly . In fact , just over three-quarters of Americans have never heard of QAnon . But while QAnon encompasses a lot of truly wild conspiracies , at its heart , View says , is \u201c pervasive institutional distrust \u201d : a belief that \u201c the whole of mainstream media , the whole of the political system is entirely , irredeemably corrupt . \u201d\nAnd in the era of Donald Trump , that kind of populist messaging plays really , really well with the Republican primary electorate . ( Not only with Republicans \u2014 as the Atlantic \u2019 s David A. Graham points out , voters of all stripes can be conspiracy-prone , and our current political environment isn \u2019 t helping . But the Satanic-pedophilia stuff is basically only a thing on the extreme fringes of the GOP . )\nTipton , the Republican incumbent Boebert defeated , was endorsed by Trump \u2014 but Brookie argues that endorsement was in name only .\n\u201c From an ideological standpoint , candidates like Boebert tend to play to the kind of basest parts of Trump \u2019 s base , which his rhetoric has consistently promoted , endorsed , amplified , \u201d Brookie said . \u201c So a victory of a candidate like Boebert can \u2019 t be seen as anything other than an extension of Donald Trump \u2019 s influence on the Republican Party . \u201d\nIn other words , elements of the worldview underpinning QAnon don \u2019 t look all that different from what \u2019 s coming from the top of the ticket \u2014 which would explain the prevalence of QAnon signs at Trump rallies .\njust some extremely normal people at an extremely normal political rally for an extremely normal president https : //t.co/0Gxa9sa81B pic.twitter.com/9Z2pDX9zCg \u2014 Andrew Kirell ( @ AndrewKirell ) July 31 , 2018\nThe result is a fairly widespread acceptance of \u2014 or at least an openness to \u2014 it and other conspiracy theories . For example , a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in late May found that \u201c half of all Americans who name Fox News as their primary TV news source believe the conspiracy theory ( that Bill Gates wants to use mass vaccination to implant microchips ) , and 44 percent of voters who cast ballots for Trump in 2016 do as well . \u201d\n`` Half of all Americans who name Fox News as their primary TV news source believe the conspiracy theory ( that Bill Gates wants to use mass vaccination to implant microchips ) , and 44 percent of voters who cast ballots for Trump in 2016 do as well . `` https : //t.co/7edbgD0wZF pic.twitter.com/dPkfg9PQYy \u2014 Ben Collins ( @ oneunderscore__ ) May 22 , 2020\nAs NBC \u2019 s Ben Collins points out , that \u2019 s not a theory that Fox ever boosted .
