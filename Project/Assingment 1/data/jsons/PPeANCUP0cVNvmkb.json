So I think that people who want to support the foundation know full well what it is we stand for and what we \u2019 re working on . `` Others say her record is worth questioning and are giving it a second look as Clinton prepares to launch a national campaign , Bloomberg said . `` What exactly are her grand accomplishments on behalf of women ? '' asked Danielle Pletka , vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute , to Bloomberg . `` I 'm really impressed with how she turned around Saudi Arabia , '' Pletka told Bloomberg . `` She does n't do much more than talk . ''Other powerful women in the political and business sphere have also raised a cold eyebrow to Clinton 's contradictions , The New York Times reported , citing remarks from former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina . Fiorina told a Conservative Political Action Conference group in February that Clinton `` tweets about women 's rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights . `` Bill Clinton defended his family foundation 's donations from Middle East countries , the Times noted of the family 's quick pushback on the scrutiny . `` Do we agree with everything they do ?
