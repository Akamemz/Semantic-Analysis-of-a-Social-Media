    "content": "A raft of new polls out this week carried almost unanimously good news for Hillary Clinton , staking the Democratic presidential nominee to significant leads over Donald Trump . But there \u2019 s one potential warning sign in these polls should the race narrow : Clinton \u2019 s lead over Trump shrinks when voters are allowed to choose one of the major third-party candidates in the race .\nYet the Libertarian Party \u2019 s presidential ticket \u2014 composed of former GOP Gov . Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former GOP Gov . Bill Weld of Massachusetts \u2014 appears to draw more from voters who might otherwise be aligned with Clinton , especially younger voters .\nThe same is true of Green Party nominee Jill Stein \u2014 though to a lesser degree , since Stein doesn \u2019 t earn nearly the same level of support as Johnson .\nHere \u2019 s why Democrats should be concerned : As Trump \u2019 s support has dwindled in recent days \u2014 leaving the GOP nominee with just his fervent supporters \u2014 some soft voters might be moving into Clinton \u2019 s camp when asked on a two-way ballot , but defecting to a third candidate when given other options .\n\u201c Trump voters are mainly Trump voters , but Clinton voters are still not quite happy that they \u2019 re going to end up voting for her , \u201d said Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray , who has studied the role of third-party candidates in pre-election polls .\nThe extent to which Johnson and Stein are cutting into Clinton \u2019 s lead is small but fairly consistent . In the 15 major national polls conducted since the first night of the Republican convention last month that included both the two-way and four-way ballot tests , Clinton has had a smaller lead over Trump in nine , and her lead has been unchanged in five of them . In only in one of the surveys has Clinton \u2019 s lead actually increased when Johnson and Stein are included .\nMost of those differences are slight : The average difference in Clinton \u2019 s margin is only about 1.4 percentage points . If Clinton can maintain a significant lead nationally over Trump , Johnson and Stein will have no impact on her general-election chances . But if the race tightens again , they could be a factor , especially in states with long histories of voting for third-party candidates , like Minnesota , Colorado , New Mexico , Nevada and New Hampshire \u2014 third-party presidential candidates have won more than 2 percent of the aggregated vote in those states since 2000 .\nMany of the national polls offer a good test of how the race changes with Johnson , and sometimes Stein , added . Take this week \u2019 s Fox News poll : Clinton leads Trump on a head-to-head ballot test , 49 percent to 39 percent .\nBut immediately after , respondents were asked the same question \u2014 only with Johnson included . In that case , Johnson took 12 percent , dropping Clinton \u2019 s share to 44 percent , and Trump \u2019 s to 35 percent .\nIt was similar in a CNN/ORC poll this week : Clinton posted a 9-point lead in the head-to-head matchup with Trump , 52 percent to 43 percent . But when Johnson and Stein are thrown in , Clinton \u2019 s lead slips to 8 points , 45 percent to 37 percent . ( Johnson takes 9 percent , and Stein 5 percent . )\nWhy is Johnson ( and Stein , for that matter ) drawing more from Clinton when he is a former Republican in a year when Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to defect to the third-party candidates ?\nYoung voters . In the Fox News poll , Johnson gets 19 percent of voters younger than \u2014 but only 13 percent among voters 35-54 and 6 percent of voters 55 and older said they would vote for the former New Mexico governor .\nIn the CNN/ORC poll , Johnson and Stein take a combined 21 percent from respondents younger than 45 , but just 8 percent among voters 45 and older .\nIt all sets up a push-pull between Republican voters who aren \u2019 t on board with Trump , and younger voters who don \u2019 t like either candidate .\n\u201c The Libertarian is the stronger [ of the third-party candidates ] , which is more likely to pull from the right , \u201d said Democratic pollster Nick Gourevitch , whose firm , Global Strategy Group , is working for the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA . \u201c You have the young voter thing , which is more likely to pull from the left . \u201d\nBut the way pollsters are structuring their questions could also influence the results . Murray , the Monmouth University pollster , said the way most pollsters are approaching the question \u2014 asking the Clinton-Trump matchup first , then offering either Johnson or both Johnson and Stein \u2014 might be inflating the third-party candidates \u2019 vote shares .\n\u201c The evidence suggests that when you ask the four-person as follow-up question , it actually overstates the third-party vote share , \u201d Murray said .\nThe irony for Johnson , who is trying to crack 15 percent in the polls to guarantee a spot in the first debate next month , is that he actually wants to flip the order of those questions .\n\u201c Right now what \u2019 s happening is the question is getting asked by all the pollsters : Trump or Clinton ?
