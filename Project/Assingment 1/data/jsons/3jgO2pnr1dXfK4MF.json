both for activities tangential to the Russia probe.\n\nA different person in charge might have nipped those moves in the bud.\n\nWhoever took over if Mr Rosenstein departed - at the moment, Solicitor General Noel Francisco - could decide to curtail the scope of the investigation or push for a speedy resolution.\n\nAt the very least, Mr Francisco would assume the oversight duties knowing full well the president is watching very closely and has no hesitation going on the attack -
