    "content": "Republicans will rely on the sheer force of Donald Trump \u2019 s personality to tap into deep-seated voter anger . Democrats are counting on a superior field organization to serve as Hillary Clinton \u2019 s firewall .\nInterviews with state party chairs in the 11 critical battleground states that will likely decide the general election reveal the two major parties expect to employ vastly different playbooks for the November campaign , each adapted to \u2014 and shaped by \u2014 the presence of polarizing and historically unpopular nominees at the top of the ticket .\n\u201c His job is to be Mr. Trump , \u201d said Rob Gleason , the chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party . \u201c His appeal is very different than a normal politician . Usually , when we have rallies for people , we prepare weeks in advance . All he has to do is announce three days ahead of time he \u2019 s going to be somewhere and a huge crowd shows up . It always energizes people . \u201d\nGleason \u2019 s sentiments were echoed by GOP chairs across the swing states , from Colorado to Virginia to Michigan . They view Trump as a lightning rod for the anger of economically struggling Americans \u2014 particularly the white working class \u2014 and , despite his flaws , they can envision him causing a dramatic break from conventional voting patterns that will carry him to victory in November .\nPublicly , at least , they insist they aren \u2019 t worried about reports of fundraising shortfalls or Trump \u2019 s dismissal of the need for sophisticated data analytics . Leave the back-end operations like field organizing and data targeting to the state parties and Republican National Committee , they say .\n\u201c Quite frankly , the people who know how to win elections in the state of Florida are the people who have been winning elections in the state of Florida , \u201d said Blaise Ingoglia , chairman of the state GOP . \u201c [ In 2012 ] , we had people up in Massachusetts telling the people in the state of Florida how to win elections here \u2026 We know how to win the elections here in the state of Florida . It \u2019 s a lot easier to plug into the stuff we \u2019 re doing . \u201d\nDeployed the right way , Trump \u2019 s force-of-nature persona could help flip some long-blue states toward the GOP , others said .\n\u201c I think if he invests in Michigan and shows up in our state , he will do very well , \u201d said Ronna Romney McDaniel , chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party ( and niece of 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney ) . \u201c We haven \u2019 t had a candidate actually run a robust campaign in Michigan where they \u2019 re showing up post-convention . \u201d\nDemocratic state party leaders , on the other hand , tend to express confidence that their state-of-the-art field organizations will carry Clinton to victory .\n\u201c I think we are way ahead , \u201d said Martha Laning , chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party . \u201c We have over 50 field organizers in the state of Wisconsin . Our entire ticket is part of our coordinated campaign . \u201d\n\u201c Democrats are far more organized than Republicans are , \u201d added Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper . \u201c We have a very good operation we built that will merge into the coordinated campaign -- over 100 staff on the ground . \u201d\nWhile Democratic Party leaders described frequent , sometimes daily , communication with the Clinton campaign , Republican Party chairs were more likely to describe weekly or twice-monthly calls with the Trump camp . They expressed optimism that the frequency of communication will increase as the general election got underway .\n\u201c I can call him , \u201d Gleason said of Trump . \u201c He \u2019 ll call me back if I call him . He doesn \u2019 t have a lot of people that he \u2019 s talking to . It \u2019 s a small staff , and I think Hillary has 1,000 people . He \u2019 s relying on us . \u201d\nGOP leaders repeatedly described Trump \u2019 s winning coalition this way : disaffected coal workers in regions like southeast Ohio or southwest Virginia , struggling blue collar workers in industrial southwest Pennsylvania or suburban Michigan , combined with veterans , the bulk of traditional rank-and-file Republican voters \u2013 and a share of Democratic voters from minority groups who typically don \u2019 t vote GOP .\nThey expect animus toward Clinton will ultimately outweigh any discomfort with Trump , and insist that he is likelier to corral wayward Democrats than Clinton is to peel off disaffected Republicans .\n\u201c Call them whatever you want , Reagan Democrats , union Democrats \u2014 there \u2019 s a lot more opportunity to bring those Democrats into the fold than Hillary Clinton ever has at bringing even moderate Republicans into her fold , \u201d said Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann .\nDemocrats are likewise convinced that moderate Republicans will desert the party en masse , repelled by the extremes of Trump \u2019 s rhetoric .\n\u201c I think some Republicans are also going to vote for Hillary . Trump is just too offensive , \u201d said Patsy Keever , the North Carolina Democratic Party chairwoman . \u201c You don \u2019 t know what he \u2019 s going to do , you can \u2019 t trust him with the decisions of the country . It \u2019 s not a game . \u201d\nOne area where party officials on both sides of the aisle were in agreement : the two nominees would be competing among an electorate that \u2019 s more diverse than it \u2019 s ever been . More than half of the nearly 20 chairs interviewed in both parties expected a sharply higher Hispanic turnout .\n\u201c We need to appeal to nontraditional Republican voters \u2014 the Asian community , Hispanic community , African Americans , Indian Americans have a huge population in Northern Virginia and Richmond , \u201d said Virginia GOP Chairman John Whitbeck . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to win those groups . That \u2019 s the coalition . \u201d\nOn the GOP side , that challenge has crystallized over the past week . Trump \u2019 s campaign has been hammered in the wake of Trump \u2019 s racial attacks against an Indiana-born judge of Mexican descent , fueling Democratic confidence that his polarizing rhetoric will send Hispanic voters into their tent in droves .\n\u201c Every time he shows his face he gets us more votes , \u201d said Keever , who like all the chairs was interviewed prior to the mass shooting in Orlando . \u201c He galvanizes Democrats and just other people , who are not Democrats , who are unaffiliated or Republicans even . There \u2019 s just so many people who just can not stomach his lack of respect . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s a harrowing prospect for a Republican Party whose presidential ticket will be led by a candidate who has shredded a post-2012 GOP playbook that called for a more tolerant and inclusive approach toward minority voters . But some GOP leaders believe their recent outreach efforts could insulate them .\n\u201c We have been in the communities a lot earlier and with a very high concentration on Hispanic communities , minority communities , engaging in Venezuelan communities , Cuban communities , Puerto Rican communities , Haitian communities \u2026 faith-based communities within those communities , \u201d said Ingoglia , the Florida chairman .\n\u201c A lot of the Hispanic communities here in the state of Florida , they themselves , their parents or their grandparents have fled regions or countries that have been oppressive , \u201d he continued . \u201c What \u2019 s going to resonate with them \u2026 is that a Hillary Clinton presidency is going to turn this nation into something that more closely resembles the country that they fled from . \u201d\nColorado GOP Chairman Steve House , who predicted his state could hinge in part on 300,000 to 600,000 Hispanic voters , said the state party has been working aggressively to engage the Latino community in the state , with an outreach and ground operation underway . He also pointed to GOP Congressman Mike Coffman \u2019 s outreach efforts -- Coffman learned Spanish and engaged in a relentless effort to court Hispanic voters during his competitive 2014 reelection bid , and House suggested the effort could be a template for courting those voters in 2016 .\nIn a race featuring two candidates with high unfavorability ratings , though , the responses from party chairs on both sides suggested that they were more comfortable attacking the opposition than making an affirmative case for their own presumptive nominee . In some cases , they ignored the race altogether , or framed the presidential match-up as a referendum on local issues .\nIn Pennsylvania , Gleason cited scandals that sank the state \u2019 s treasurer and attorney general , as well as the indictment of Rep. Chaka Fattah . In Virginia , Whitbeck repeatedly invoked Democratic Gov . Terry McAuliffe , a Clinton ally who is facing a federal investigation regarding 2013 campaign contributions .\n\u201c Hillary Clinton is not popular in Michigan \u2026 We had a governor like that in Jennifer Granholm , \u201d said Romney McDaniel , referencing the state \u2019 s last Democratic governor , who left office in 2011 .\nShe credited the state \u2019 s current governor Rick Snyder for engineering an economic turnaround . \u201c Michigan is on the comeback but our memories are long and we remember what it was like to suffer through bad economic times in our state \u2026 There is a recognition that that could happen again . \u201d\nMichigan Democratic Party chairman Brandon Dillon scoffed at the analysis .\n\u201c Whatever Ronna \u2019 s putting in her lemonade , I \u2019 d like some of it , \u201d he said . \u201c The reason Michigan \u2019 s economy has turned around is because President Obama \u2019 s administration saved the auto industry \u2026This election is not going to be a referendum on Jennifer Granholm .
