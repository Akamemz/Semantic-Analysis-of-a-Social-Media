In the last two years , a man who massacred 49 people at an Orlando nightclub , another who set off bombs in the streets of New York City and a third who gunned down travelers at a Florida airport , had each been looked at by federal agents but later determined not to warrant continued law enforcement scrutiny .\nFBI assessments are routinely opened after agents receive a tip , which could be sparked by something as simple as noticing odd activity in a neighbor \u2019 s garage or a classmate \u2019 s comments .
