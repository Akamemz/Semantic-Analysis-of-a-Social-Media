    "content": "Two innocent members of the public have died after a knifeman went on a rampage this afternoon in London .\nArmed police shot dead a knifeman wearing a fake suicide vest today after he stabbed up to five people in a shocking terrorist attack as frightened crowds fled the scene .\nWitnesses on the scene said the man had been brandishing two knives and had attacked people on the north side of London Bridge before running into the centre at around 2pm .\nThis evening Met Police crime commissioner Cressida Dick praised the members of the public who helped and said counter terrorism is working around the clock to identify those who have lost their lives , working to understand 'what has happened and if anyone else was involved ' .\nDramatic video footage showed the knifeman being tackled to the ground by at least six heroic members of the public . One man chased the attacker with a fire extinguisher while one also held a Narwhal whale tusk up at him , which he is thought to have achieved at Fishmongers ' Hall .\nSeconds later police told people on top of the suspect to move away , before dragging the last bystander to safety and opening fire . Officers were heard shouting 'stop moving ' twice before shooting the man at close range .\nOne of the brave heroes was on the other side of the bridge and ran over to help , tackling the man and wrestling the knife off him . The suspect lay on the ground still moving as officers backed away - clearly fearing they were still in danger .\nMeanwhile police immediately evacuated the south side of London Bridge near Borough Market , as hundreds of frightened bystanders began screaming and running for their lives as they heard shots being fired .\nIt has now emerged that the attacker had been known to officers and had connections to terror groups .\nThe incident started close to London 's main financial hub where thousands of bankers and finance workers travel every day .

Police said they are treating the stabbing , in which a man was shot by police , 'as though it is terror-related ' . The threat level was lowered on November 4 to 'substantial ' from 'severe ' , meaning attacks were thought to be 'likely ' rather than 'highly likely ' . Announcing the decision , Home Secretary Priti Patel said : 'Despite the change in the threat level , terrorism remains one of the most direct and immediate risks to our national security . 'Substantial continues to indicate a high level of threat , and an attack might well occur without further warning . 'As ever , the public should remain vigilant and report any concerns they may have to the police . 'Government , police and intelligence agencies will continue to work tirelessly to address the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms . 'The threat level is kept under constant review . ' The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre ( JTAC ) , an organisation made up of Government departments and other public bodies which reports to MI5 , makes the decision on the threat level independently of ministers after weighing up intelligence and information on known terrorist groups . A review is carried out every six months . The level was raised to 'critical ' in May 2017 after the Manchester Arena bombing and it was later downgraded to 'severe ' in September of that year . The threat level was downgraded earlier this month as the general who oversaw the US raid on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi warned the country was on alert for possible 'retribution attacks ' by extremists , while other terrorism experts reportedly warned security services would be 'braced for attempts to avenge his death ' .\nMs Benfield , who was on her way home from work , said she exited the bus and 'ran like hell ' to escape the shots .\nMs Bensfield , who was visibly shaken by the incident , said : ' I just ran as fast as I could .

Now everyone is being let out of this building but they 're saying you can not walk back towards London Bridge , go towards Liverpool Street . ' Pub-goers were also told by police to leave immediately and run as gunshots were heard in the London Bridge area . Luke Redman , 25 , was in the Monument pub with a full pint when officers entered . Mr Redman , a data scientist said he heard '12 or 15 ( gunshots ) in about 10 seconds , ' as he left the pub and ran down an alleyway to escape .\nAfter at least two shots were heard , passengers could be heard screaming , with one shouting : 'What the f * * * , they 've killed him . '\nA 31-year-old man who works in an office on Upper Thames Street , overlooking London Bridge , said he heard multiple gun shots coming from the bridge .\n'The first thing I saw was just police cars on the bridge and people were still walking around there . This was before all the armed police came in . Then there were loads of police and loads of gunshots .\n'The next thing I saw , about 10 or 15 minutes later , was a guy being dragged [ by police ] , then later on I saw a woman being carried on a green sheet .\n'She was being carried by four police officers and one appeared to be talking to her . '\nThe witness said he said saw police 'drag ' another man along the bridge .\n'When the guy was being dragged there was a man walking behind him who was topless and had blood on him , ' the witness said .\nBBC correspondent John McManus told BBC News that he had heard several gun shots on London Bridge .\n'Just a few minutes ago I was walking across London Bridge on the south bank to the north bank of the bridge , ' he said .\n'There appeared to be a fight going on the other side of the bridge , with several men attacking one man . '\n'Police then quickly arrived , including armed police , and then a number of shots were fired at this man .\n'Police have now cleared the bridge , everybody has been told to move back and now on the northern side of the bridge , but there are more shots going on .\n' I ca n't see what 's happening now because we 've been moved out of the way but there are shots going on , and you probably hear the police sounds as well .\n'Everybody has cleared the area , the entire bridge has been moved , and right on the northern part of the bridge , right up until quite near the Bank of England , is being cleared . '\n'There are more police coming into the area as I 'm speaking , they 're telling people to clear , to move back , ' Mr McManus continued .\n'We 've been moved back hundreds of metres back from the northern side of the bridge , and I can only assume the same has happened on the southern side of the bridge as well .

One man chased the attacker with a fire extinguisher while one also held a Narwhal whale tusk up at him, which he is thought to have achieved at Fishmongers' Hall.\n\nSeconds later police told people on top of the suspect to move away, before dragging the last bystander to safety and opening fire. Officers were heard shouting 'stop moving' twice before shooting the man at close range.\n\nOne of the brave heroes was on the other side of the bridge and ran over to help, tackling the man and wrestling the knife off him. The suspect lay on the ground still moving as officers backed away - clearly fearing they were still in danger.\n\nMeanwhile police immediately evacuated the south side of London Bridge near Borough Market, as hundreds of frightened bystanders began screaming and running for their lives as they heard shots being fired.\n\nIt has now emerged that the attacker had been known to officers and had connections to terror groups.\n\nThe incident started close to London's main financial hub where thousands of bankers and finance workers travel every day. It started outside Grade II listed building Fishmongers' Hall. Many buildings in the financial district were on high security this afternoon as roads were closed in the area, many workers were also stood outside their buildings as officers cordoned off the roads.\n\nFishmongers' Hall was today hosting an alumni event for prestigious alumni to have studied at Cambridge University. The attacker was a convicted terrorist who had served time in prison and was wearing an electronic tag, according to The Times newspaper. The paper added he was attending a Cambridge University conference on prisoner rehabilitation being held at Fishmongers' Hall and 'threatened to blow up' the building.\n\nWitnesses described a scene of panic around London Bridge, with ambulance crews giving CPR to one victim on the floor near Monument Underground station and some people helped to their feet after falling over in the rush. It has since been reported that at least twelve people have been left injured following the attack today and a Whitehall spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that there have been two fatalities.\n\nToday's incident comes two and a half years after the horrifying terrorist attack on London Bridge in June 2017 which saw Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, kill eight people and injure 48 others.\n\nUp to five people were stabbed before the knife maniac ran onto London Bridge shortly before 2pm this afternoon, where dramatic video (pictured above) showed he was tackled to the ground by at least six heroic members of the public\n\nOne of the bystanders on London Bridge was seen holding a knife (left) which appeared to have been taken from the suspect. Another man - believed to be the shot knifeman - could be seen lying on the ground, close to a knife (circled, right)\n\nThe image above gives a clear view of the suspected knifeman and the fake explosives device he was wearing at the time of the attack this afternoon\n\nThe alleged knifeman is pictured above on the floor with armed police on the right hand side.

Four officer took her to safety\n\nPolice apprehend a man in an street on the south side of London Bridge today as they respond to the incident. Other members of the public seem to be walking past obliviously\n\nSpeaking at a press conference this evening commissioner Dick said: 'Police were called at 13.58 and City of London officers had bravely and professionally confronted the suspect by 14.03 just five minutes later, if you are concerned about anyone there today please try to contact them and if you cannot, get in touch with us.\n\n'I want to thank all the emergency services personnel who are working tirelessly to deal with this incident. We want to thank the members of the public who helped by showing extraordinary courage or by following the instructions they were given by officers in the area.\n\n'In the coming days you will see more police patrolling our streets to help reassure those of you who are concerned.'\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was 'being kept updated' as he abandoned campaigning and rushed back to Westminster from his Uxbridge constituency. It comes weeks after the UK's terror threat level was downgraded.\n\nHe added: 'I can assure you and assure everyone that anyone involved in this attack will be hunted down and brought to justice.'\n\nMr Johnson has now suspended his campaigning on Saturday following the incident.\n\nExtra police officers will be on patrol across London in the wake of the attack, while British Transport Police said there also would be more officers on the transport network including firearms officers and other specialist teams.\n\nLondon Bridge station reopened this evening but cordons could remain in place across the city of the weekend 'due to other factors'.\n\nOne witness praised the bravery of one member of the public who intervened and disarmed the man.\n\n'This man was walking behind us on the other side of London Bridge when the attack began. He ran through traffic and jumped the central partition to tackle the attacker with several others. We ran away but looks like he disarmed him.

Today is also one of the biggest shopping days for the UK with Black Friday sales sweeping many stores across the country.\n\nAs well as city workers and tourists, those also thought to have been caught up in the incident were a group of Cambridge University students who were thought to have been attending an event nearby.\n\nA spokesman said: 'We are gravely concerned at reports that University of Cambridge staff, students and alumni were caught up in the incident at London Bridge. We are urgently seeking clarification and further details. Our thoughts are with all those who have been affected by these terrible events.'\n\nOne video showed what appeared to be police pulling equipment out of a vehicle nearby. Those in the video could be heard saying: 'They've actually got guns out.'\n\nOne bus driver, who was in the area at the time of the attack told of the moment police advised him to get out of his vehicle and run.\n\nBus driver Mustafa Salih was travelling towards London Bridge when he saw the cordons and police vehicles. Speaking to BBC London he said: 'A police officer came up to me and and said turn your engine off, get off and run.\n\n'I looked up and I could see a crowd of people coming towards me. One woman was crying, it was all very scary and we did not know what was happening'.\n\nNeil Basu, the head of UK counter-terrorism policing, said outside the New Scotland Yard headquarters shortly after 4pm: 'At approximately 2pm today, police were called to a stabbing at a premises near London Bridge.\n\nA police officer moves an uninvolved person away from a cordon after the incident today.

It looked like a fight. I saw a man who looked like he was carrying a stick and another man holding a fire extinguisher who were chasing the man with the knife.\n\n'They grabbed him and pinned him to the ground. The guy was hitting him with a stick and the other one was trying to hit him with the fire extinguisher.\n\n'Then three or four more people turned up and all of them held him on the ground. One of them grabbed his knife and prized it out of his hand.'\n\nForensic officers seemed to be pitching up this evening, as they continue to investigate the scene close to London Bridge\n\nA police man with a dog patrols the area near London Bridge after the stabbing in the area was declared a terrorist incident by the Met\n\nArmed police were seen patrolling the streets early this evening with emergency vehicles being parked up on both sides of the road\n\nPolice and emergency vehicles gather at Leadenhall near London Bridge as the force continues to deal with the fall out of this afternoon's attack\n\nHe added that they had all been very brave and said armed police shouted at everyone to get back.\n\nPolice evacuated London Bridge station and the surrounding area. Mr Basu said that specialist officers had been deployed after reports that the suspect had an explosive vest, but the device was believed to be a 'hoax'.\n\nHe added: 'Due to reports that the suspect might have had an explosive device specialist officers attended the scene. However, I can confirm at this time we believe a device that was strapped to the body of the suspect is a hoax explosive device.'\n\nA cordon was set up at Borough Market while evacuation continued from shops and businesses.\n\nMr Basu said he would give updates to the families of those injured 'as soon as we can get that information'.\n\n'A number of other people received injuries during this incident.

The Prime Minister rushed back into Central London from his Uxbridge constituency following the drama in the heart of the capital. His spokesman said he would be receiving 'further updates' on the unfolding incident. At the start of November the UK's terrorism threat level was downgraded to 'substantial' from 'severe', meaning an attack was now 'likely' rather than 'highly likely'. There are five levels of terror threat, with the highest being 'critical' - meaning that an attack is highly likely and will come in the near future. After dropping from the second-highest tier, severe, the UK is now on the third rung of danger.\n\nSpanish tourist Maria Ortega told today how she was ushered into a walk-in freezer for her own safety during the London Bridge terror attack.\n\nThe 45-year-old from southern Spain said: 'I'm visiting a friend of mine who lives in London and we were walking through Borough Market.\n\n'All of sudden people began shouting and running in panic. Someone grabbed me and took me into a butchers shop and to the freezer at the back.\n\n'There must have been seven or eight of us in there and we were there for about half an hour before we were able to leave.\n\n'It was strange being in there because there were slabs of meat hanging up but it was safer than being outside. My friend and I were split up and she took refuge in another shop.'\n\nHer friend Liz Martinez, who now lives in South London, added: 'It was really scary because all of a sudden there was a lot of panic.\n\n'We didn't know what was going on.

Eight people were killed and 48 seriously injured when terrorists struck on London Bridge two years ago. Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, mowed down pedestrians on the bridge before stabbing random members of the public around Borough Market. Police with riot shields on London Bridge on June 3, 2017 The trio were armed with ceramic knives and had fake suicide belts strapped around their waists during the marauding attack on the evening of June 3 2017. Unarmed police officers, medics and members of the public rushed to help save lives during the attackers' rampage around Borough Market. In less than 10 minutes, Butt, Redouane and Zaghba were shot dead after confronting armed officers in Stoney Street. Emergency personnel on London Bridge on June 3, 2017 At an inquest at the Old Bailey earlier this year, a jury found that the three terrorists were lawfully killed. A separate inquest concluded victims Xavier Thomas, 45, Chrissy Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sebastien Belanger, 36, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were unlawfully killed.\n\nMr Khan asked all Londoners to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police.\n\nBrendan Cox, whose wife Jo was murdered in a terror attack in Batley during the EU referendum campaign, tweeted: 'Please no one on any side use this for party advantage. Let it be a moment where we genuinely come together and show that terrorism will not divide us.'\n\nFormer defence minister Tobias Ellwood, who helped tackle a terror attack outside Parliament in 2017, tweeted that today's incident was a 'stark reminder of the dangerous and diverse threats we continue to face but also of the incredible bravery and professionalism of our emergency services in so swiftly closing this incident down'.\n\nDeputy White House press secretary Judd Deere said: 'President Trump has been briefed on this morning's attack at the London Bridge and is monitoring the situation. The United States strongly condemns all horrific acts of violence on innocent people, and we pledge our full support to our ally, the United Kingdom.'\n\nDuring a campaign visit to Cardiff, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson expressed concern at the incident at London Bridge.\n\nMs Swinson said: 'Clearly, we don't know the exact details of what has happened, and my thoughts are with everybody who has been caught up in that incident in whatever way.\n\n'Including, of course, the brave police who are dealing with it with professionalism and in the way in which they do become the first responders in these difficult times.'\n\nA witness who was on a bus going over the bridge said she thought she saw a 'stab vest or some sort of explosive vest' worn by the person lying on the bridge.\n\nKirsten Jones told BBC News: 'We thought it looked like there was a fight going on, people sort of tussling with each other, and then you realise it was police wrestling with one tall, bearded man.\n\n'I had my baby with me so I moved behind the stairwell to be safe, but then there was two shots, or two loud pops, I think, I think they were gun shots, two loud pops, and I also saw a dispensed taser and then the guy was lying on the floor.\n\n'He then pulled his coat back which showed that he had some sort of vest underneath, whether it's a stab vest, or some sort of explosive vest, the police then really quickly moved backwards, away.\n\n'Of course on the bus, we're panicking, we're almost as close as the police to him, and he was sort of lying there pulling his coat backwards, and the police were shouting at him and staying back from him.'\n\nConstruction worker Howard Walsh said that he and his colleagues saw the member of the public who restrained the attacker being led away by ambulance workers.\n\nPolice officers guard outside Borough Market after an incident at London Bridge this afternoon\n\nA Metropolitan Police armed response officer stands guard near Borough Market after today\n\nPeople leave the area as armed police with dogs patrol along Cannon Street in London this afternoon\n\nArmed police at the scene of an incident on London Bridge in the capital this afternoon\n\nHe said: 'We had literally finished working in House of Fraser.

Police said they are treating the stabbing, in which a man was shot by police, 'as though it is terror-related'. The threat level was lowered on November 4 to 'substantial' from 'severe', meaning attacks were thought to be 'likely' rather than 'highly likely'. Announcing the decision, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'Despite the change in the threat level, terrorism remains one of the most direct and immediate risks to our national security. 'Substantial continues to indicate a high level of threat, and an attack might well occur without further warning. 'As ever, the public should remain vigilant and report any concerns they may have to the police. 'Government, police and intelligence agencies will continue to work tirelessly to address the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms. 'The threat level is kept under constant review.' The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), an organisation made up of Government departments and other public bodies which reports to MI5, makes the decision on the threat level independently of ministers after weighing up intelligence and information on known terrorist groups. A review is carried out every six months. The level was raised to 'critical' in May 2017 after the Manchester Arena bombing and it was later downgraded to 'severe' in September of that year. The threat level was downgraded earlier this month as the general who oversaw the US raid on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi warned the country was on alert for possible 'retribution attacks' by extremists, while other terrorism experts reportedly warned security services would be 'braced for attempts to avenge his death'.\n\nMs Benfield, who was on her way home from work, said she exited the bus and 'ran like hell' to escape the shots.\n\nMs Bensfield, who was visibly shaken by the incident, said: 'I just ran as fast as I could. Hearing gunshots and running from them is not really a good feeling.\n\n'I was on the bus and there was a lot of traffic, but I remember it stopped. Then all of a sudden I see police officers yelling and people running off the bridge. I said 'please let me out, please let me out.'\n\n'Then I just ran as fast as I could. 'Pop pop pop' that's what it sounded like.

This was before all the armed police came in. Then there were loads of police and loads of gunshots.\n\n'The next thing I saw, about 10 or 15 minutes later, was a guy being dragged [by police], then later on I saw a woman being carried on a green sheet.\n\n'She was being carried by four police officers and one appeared to be talking to her.'\n\nThe witness said he said saw police 'drag' another man along the bridge.\n\n'When the guy was being dragged there was a man walking behind him who was topless and had blood on him,' the witness said.\n\nBBC correspondent John McManus told BBC News that he had heard several gun shots on London Bridge.\n\n'Just a few minutes ago I was walking across London Bridge on the south bank to the north bank of the bridge,' he said.\n\n'There appeared to be a fight going on the other side of the bridge, with several men attacking one man.'\n\n'Police then quickly arrived, including armed police, and then a number of shots were fired at this man.\n\n'Police have now cleared the bridge, everybody has been told to move back and now on the northern side of the bridge, but there are more shots going on.\n\n'I can't see what's happening now because we've been moved out of the way but there are shots going on, and you probably hear the police sounds as well.\n\n'Everybody has cleared the area, the entire bridge has been moved, and right on the northern part of the bridge, right up until quite near the Bank of England, is being cleared.'\n\n'There are more police coming into the area as I'm speaking, they're telling people to clear, to move back,' Mr McManus continued.\n\n'We've been moved back hundreds of metres back from the northern side of the bridge, and I can only assume the same has happened on the southern side of the bridge as well.'\n\nThe BBC correspondent said he could see a man lying on the ground but the situation was 'ongoing'.\n\n'There appeared to be a fight going on on the bridge, from what I could see, several people tried to restrain a man and it was then that armed police arrived and they fired shots at this person,' he said.\n\n'The last I could see before we were moving from the bridge was lying on the ground.\n\n'Since then, since we've been moved back, I've heard several more shots fired as well. So at this moment it seems to be a developing situation.'\n\nOn the picture on London Bridge, Mr McManus said: 'It's a busy, sunny Friday afternoon, with lots and lots of people out on the streets.\n\n'Many people going into London Bridge, which is a major train station for people travelling out to the south of London and to the south coast.\n\n'Of course, this is the business district, the City of London, so it's incredibly busy here but right now all the traffic has come to a complete halt, the police ticker tape has gone up, there's police cars everywhere.\n\n'I can see traffic being turned around to go back where it came from, because the whole of London Bridge, has now been sealed off and those armed police are on the bridge right now.'\n\nKelby McNally, OK!
