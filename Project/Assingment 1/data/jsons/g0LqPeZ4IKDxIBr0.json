    "content": "One wonders if Donald Trump has his own version of Jennifer Melfi\u2014the lovely , bespectacled psychiatrist who suffered through six seasons of Tony Soprano \u2019 s anxieties and unresolved conflicts on her couch . Melfi , portrayed by Lorraine Bracco , was the most intriguing character on The Sopranos because she was the most ambivalent\u2014about her job , love , men , the world\u2014and because she offered a window into the psyche of New Jersey \u2019 s No . 1 mobster . She was the looking glass through which we glimpsed all those moments of vulnerability and doubt , when we pierced through Soprano qua gangster\u2014who was never that interesting , who never achieved the pathos of , say , Vito Corleone\u2014and arrived at Soprano qua human being , who was always sort of fascinating . It would be amazing if there were a Dr. Melfi in some underground closet at Trump Tower , because that would suggest that PEOTUS is a human being capable of guilt , suffering , empathy , maybe\u2014maybe\u2014sympathy . Then , four or eight years from now , whenever we ( presumably ) emerge from this surreality , this person would write a tell-all , and we might learn it was in December 2016 , four weeks before he took office , when Donald Trump officially lost his virginity and discovered the Kremlin was not a legitimate government but a fancy , onion-domed , criminal syndicate . It was during this crisis of confidence that Trump canceled the rest of his thank-you tour and decamped to the Tower , where he sought refuge in the First Shrink \u2019 s bunker and poured out his darkest fears about his emotionally unavailable father and , in particular , the 400,000 dead Syrians for which his bro-pal Vladimir Putin , with the dastardly Bashar Assad , was responsible .\nFor now , they \u2019 re calling Aleppo the latest Srebrenica , Darfur , Rwanda . But Aleppo may have more in common with the future than the past . It may serve as the preamble to whatever comes after Pax Americana . We \u2019 ve been building to this moment , like all moments , for decades . In the post\u2013Cold War 1990s , America was the indisputable hyper-power ; the emerging markets of China and India were still embryonic ; the jihadists were stirring but not yet mobilized . In the first decade of this century , we led , were attacked , and then stumbled badly . Over the last eight years , we seemed to acknowledge that we were done leading , that we would lead from behind ( whatever that meant ) , that we would prefer that a constellation of right-minded countries ( or bloc of countries ) take our place .\nThroughout this period of decline , or stepping away , the ideas and visions that animated our leaders were believed by those leaders to be good and right . They may not have been\u2014in some cases , they definitely were not\u2014but that was our goal . And when we failed to attain those goals , the failure was more bitter because we didn \u2019 t set those goals cynically as much as out of a sense of conviction .\nThe problem with George W. Bush was that he believed Iraqis really would greet American G.I.s with open arms . The problem with Barack Obama was that he believed the world really would be a better place if only America would allow it to be . Those on the left and right who insist on viewing their partisan foes cynically , who assume they lie and dissemble because those with whom they disagree are necessarily Neanderthals or traitors or simply dumb , run into the same pitfall that Russians run into when trying to decode America : their cynicism makes them na\u00efve . It makes them not see what \u2019 s actually happening . We don \u2019 t know what will replace Pax Americana , but we can be confident it will lack the same moral urgency . That may mean fewer wars , which would be good , but probably not . It will probably mean more pillaging , more Thrasymachus , more Aleppos . The soon-to-be commander in chief of the most powerful military on Earth , the president of the country with the biggest economy , has signaled to the predators of the planet that now is their moment .
