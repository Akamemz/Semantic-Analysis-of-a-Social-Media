    "content": "When Donald Trump takes the oath of office on Friday , the Republican takeover of Washington will be complete \u2013 signaling a sharp departure from eight years of President Obama .\nIn many ways , the Trump era has already launched . The new Congress has begun the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) . Legislators are preparing to roll back a raft of federal regulations on such areas as overtime pay and funding for Planned Parenthood . Nominees for the incoming cabinet are poised for confirmation , despite some tough questioning from senators .\nConservatives are joyful , liberals despondent . But Obama \u2019 s domestic legacy runs deep , and will be more difficult to uproot than both sides seem to believe , analysts say . Popular elements of the ACA , a.k.a . Obamacare , may well survive . Ditto changes to the tax code that have helped low-income Americans . On immigration , both Mr. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan have suggested law-abiding \u201c dreamers \u201d won \u2019 t be deported .\nAnd at its most fundamental , there \u2019 s nothing Trump can do to take away Obama \u2019 s most profound legacy : his election , and reelection , as the first African American president of the United States .\n\u201c That will always be the first line about him in textbooks , the first line about him in his obituary \u2013 our first black president , \u201d says David Greenberg , a historian at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , N.J .\nSo , perhaps unique among all 43 American presidents who followed George Washington , Obama \u2019 s mere election guaranteed a singular role in United States history , before even taking office .\nBut Obama made clear throughout his first campaign that getting elected for its own sake wasn \u2019 t his goal . He wanted to change the nation \u2019 s trajectory , as President Reagan had , he told a newspaper in Reno , Nev. , early in 2008 .\nIt was that seemingly boundless aspiration to be a transformative leader , combined with his skills as an orator , that won Obama the presidency . Now , eight years later , he faces the judgments of historians , pundits , and the public . Assessments vary widely , and will continue to evolve for generations to come . But for now , the notion of Obama as a transformative president is probably a stretch .\nFor all the audacity that he brought to his first campaign in 2008 , once he assumed office , he often leaned toward caution \u2013 even in his first two years , when Democrats held the reins in Washington .\nIn crafting the ACA , for example , he worked within the existing private health-insurance system rather than offering more fundamental change . The same could be said of the financial crisis of 2008-09 , in which Obama did more to rescue the old system than to change it , liberal activists complain .\n\u201c President Obama is someone who is temperamentally very ambitious but also very cautious , \u201d says Professor Greenberg . \u201c And I think the caution in some ways accounts for the disappointments some people have felt \u2013 that he didn \u2019 t deliver transformation , he didn \u2019 t deliver the kind of radical change that some of his most Kool-Aid-drunk supporters expected back in 2008 . \u201d\nAfter an electoral rout in his first midterm elections put him on the defensive , Obama turned to unilateral action . His aggressive use of executive actions to enact policy , bypassing Congress , led to charges of an \u201c imperial presidency . \u201d\nThe hyperpartisan atmosphere that Obama walked into on Day 1 only grew worse , despite his campaign promise to unite the country .\nIn the end , Obama as president was both a singular figure and a party of one \u2013 unique in American history but also a man who neither won over his opponents nor built up his allies .\nMany analysts say he failed to build bridges on Capitol Hill . \u201c Obama was bipartisan , in that he lacked the temperament to work with either party in Congress , \u201d says historian David Pietrusza .\nOthers , such as Molly Reynolds of the Brookings Institution , argue that even a legislative master like Lyndon Johnson or Bill Clinton may well have struggled amid the prevailing partisan polarization .\nEither way , as he leaves office , Obama has a lot going for him : youth , a strong job approval rating ( in the mid-50s ) , and a plan for continued involvement in public life . His personal brand is intact . But his inability to build a broad coalition around his greatest domestic achievements leaves his legacy in peril .\nIn an interview with Fox News last April , Obama named his biggest accomplishment in seven words : \u201c Saving the economy from a great depression . \u201d\nEmergency measures by the new president , as well as those by his predecessor , George W. Bush , staunched the nation \u2019 s economic freefall . But some , including a record stimulus package passed just on Democratic votes , sparked a political backlash , giving rise to the populist anti-tax tea party movement .\nIt was to be one of several achievements that only hardened partisan lines . Passage of the ACA in 2010 added big-government tinder to the fire , and in the November midterms , Democrats lost control of Congress \u2013 for the rest of Obama \u2019 s presidency , it turned out . Now it faces a repeal in Congress .\nThe Dodd-Frank banking regulations , also passed in 2010 , are another Trump target , as is the Pacific-rim trade deal Obama backed .\nBut there \u2019 s a maxim in politics : It \u2019 s possible to deny people things , but it \u2019 s almost impossible to take things away .\nSome parts of the Obama legacy will be easier to dismantle than others . The Pacific trade deal is clearly dead , but Dodd-Frank might be difficult to unwind , analysts say . Meanwhile , some elements of the ACA could prove politically impossible to take away . The provision allowing adult children up to age 26 to stay on their parents \u2019 plan is one . The requirement that insurance companies take all customers , regardless of preexisting conditions , is another .\nOver the weekend , Trump told The Washington Post his goal is \u201c insurance for everybody \u201d \u2013 a tall order .\n\u201c One can well imagine more than just parts of the ACA surviving , \u201d says historian Robert Dallek . \u201c Remember , President Reagan never did get rid of food stamps or close the Department of Education . \u201d\nObama \u2019 s aggressive use of executive power may be one of his most consequential legacies , as he cedes the Oval Office to a businessman used to getting what he wants and new to the arcane ways of Congress .\nObama did not start this \u201c massive gravitational shift \u201d of power to the presidency , says Jonathan Turley , a constitutional law professor at George Washington University . But he has accelerated it .\nWhether helping certain categories of illegal immigrants or ordering up rafts of new rules and regulations by government agencies , Obama has relied on his \u201c pen and phone \u201d to get things done ever since Republicans retook Congress .\nFirst , there are legal questions . The Supreme Court unanimously struck down Obama \u2019 s recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board , a narrowing of presidential power .\nBut the larger problem with relying on executive authority is that it \u2019 s easy to reverse .
