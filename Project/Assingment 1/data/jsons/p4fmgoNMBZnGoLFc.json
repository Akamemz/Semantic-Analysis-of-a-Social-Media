    "content": "A mounting number of voter polls show that , despite shrill denunciations of the president by the Democrats for his alleged racism , Trump is enjoying a dramatic increase in his approval ratings among minorities . This isn \u2019 t , as some liberal news outlets and pundits have suggested , wishful thinking based on outlier polls . The trend began showing up in surveys early this year and appears to be gaining momentum . Some polls now show his approval numbers at 25 percent among African American voters and 50 percent among Hispanic voters . If those figures hold for the next 15 months , they will render Trump unbeatable in November of 2020 .\nIf this claim seems over the top , it should be remembered that Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite garnering only about 8 percent of the black vote and 29 percent of the Hispanic vote . Put another way , Clinton lost the election despite winning nearly 90 percent of the African American vote and two-thirds of the Hispanic vote . In other words , they simply can \u2019 t beat the president if he holds them to significantly lower percentages of these key voting blocs . The Democrats and their media enablers understand this , of course , which is why they have worked so diligently to discredit polls that confirm the president \u2019 s gains among minority voters .\nThis began in earnest when , in January of this year , Marist found that Trump \u2019 s approval rating among Hispanics had reached 50 percent . Then , in February , a Morning Consult poll showed Hispanic approval of the president at 42 percent . This was followed by a March poll from McLaughlin & Associates that found Hispanic approval for the president at 50 percent . All three polls were discounted as outliers by the media or simply ignored . This continued in June , after Harvard/Harris showed similar findings . Much the same strategy was still being pursued last week after Zogby Analytics discovered even worse news for the Democrats :\nRace also played a factor in Trump \u2019 s job approval rating . Hispanics , this time around , were much more likely to approve of his job performance [ 49 percent ] , while the president also saw his numbers jump with African Americans . This was his second straight poll with over a quarter support from African Americans [ 28 percent ] . If Trump wins half of Hispanics and a quarter of African Americans in 2020 , Democrats will be in trouble !\nThis is the understatement of the decade if Zogby \u2019 s numbers about African American voters are accurate , particularly combined with gains the president has seen among Independents , older Generation X voters , and maturing Millennial voters . Is it really possible that Trump , who has so often been accused of racism by the Democrats and the media , is gaining traction with black voters ? Zogby Analytics is by no means the only polling firm to find a shift toward Trump among the Democratic Party \u2019 s most loyal supporters . Rasmussen Reports , for example , found in an August survey that Trump \u2019 s approval among African Americans exceeded 30 percent :\nLike most Republicans , Trump has struggled to attract black voters , but this week \u2019 s surveying for the Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll has found a bump in black support for the president . It \u2019 s way too soon to say whether this is a temporary blip on the radar or whether Trump is on to something .\nAll of this raises the following question : Why would Hispanic and African American voters support the president if he is a rabid racist , red in tooth and claw ? It may be that they have heard such accusations leveled at so many Republicans , without any evidence , that many are no longer listening . When Trump publicly asked why Rep.
