    "content": "Joe Biden insists he still has a path to the presidential nomination . Others are having trouble seeing it .\nThe former vice president was viewed as the field 's frontrunner until voters started casting ballots . Now a disappointing fourth-place finish in the opening Iowa caucuses last week was followed by a disastrous fifth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday . The collapse of his support into single digits will not only make raising money and rallying supporters more difficult . It also raises questions about whether his campaign can survive until the Super Tuesday contests now three weeks away .\n`` It ai n't over , man ; we 're just getting started , '' Biden told a campaign crowd in Charleston , S.C. , where he headed instead of staying in New Hampshire . He struck a deliberately upbeat tone , emphasizing his commitment to African American and Latino concerns and noting the lack of racial diversity in the two states that had voted so far . `` Where I come from that 's the opening bell , not the closing bell , and the fight to end Donald Trump 's presidency is just beginning , just beginning . ''\nThat said , if Biden does n't score a convincing win in the Feb. 29 South Carolina primary \u2013 not impossible , but a challenge \u2013 his third bid for the presidency could be effectively over , and with it a career in elective office that has spanned six decades .\n\u2018 I 'll probably take a hit here ' : Biden faces big test in New Hampshire\nMeanwhile , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was riding high after carrying the popular vote in Iowa ( although not the delegate count ) and winning New Hampshire , although with a smaller margin that his landslide over Hillary Clinton four years ago . Former South Bend , Ind. , mayor Pete Buttigieg was a solid second , and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar parlayed a strong showing in the candidate debates into a surprising third-place finish . Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was a distant fourth , and Biden finished even lower .\nIn modern times , no candidate in either party has been nominated for president after a start as faltering as that . All but one of the eventual nominees won either in Iowa or New Hampshire . ( The exception was in 1992 , when Iowa was n't contested and Bill Clinton sold his second-place finish in New Hampshire as a victory by the `` comeback kid . '' )\nThis time , Biden 's calculation is that the Democratic race is so unsettled \u2013 and Sanders , a self-described democratic socialist , would be such a risky nominee \u2013 that history 's lessons wo n't apply .\nA month ago he led the field in New Hampshire , according to the RealClearPolitics average of statewide polls . That standing evaporated not because of a spectacular mistake but because of a mediocre campaign , overtaken by newer candidates with greater vigor . The relentless attacks by President Trump on Biden and his son , Hunter , on unfounded allegations of corrupt behavior in Ukraine did n't help .\nNow Biden 's transactional appeal to voters , once his strength , is his vulnerability .\nFrom the start , the fundamental premise of Biden 's campaign has been that he was the most electable candidate , best able to defeat Trump in November . The problem he faces now is this : The way to demonstrate electability is to win , and he has n't , at least not yet .\nThe early losses already have eroded confidence in the bargain he has offered . Before the Iowa caucuses , 44 % of those surveyed in a national Quinnipiac University Poll said Biden had the best chance of beating Trump . In a new poll released Monday , that number had plummeted to 27 % , only a bit higher than Sanders , at 24 % .\nWhen Biden spied two little boys squirming in the front row at a closing rally in downtown Manchester , he walked over with his handheld microphone to ask their names and hold out the promise of ice cream after the politics was done . His name was Keith , the first one said . The other ? `` Beau . ''\nBiden looked taken aback for an instant , and the crowd of several hundred people seemed to hold its collective breath . Then he said quietly , `` I have a Beau , too , '' and moved back to center stage .\nJust about everybody in the Rex Theater knew that the death of Beau Biden in 2015 from a malignant brain tumor had prevented his grieving father from running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 . Now , four years later , Joe Biden 's bid for the White House has taken on almost an elegiac air .\nHe has been dubbed `` Uncle Joe , '' with the familiarity and , perhaps , the eye-rolling exasperation that nickname suggests . Voters say they like him and respect his service , but some see him as a figure from a different era , shaped by the politics of the past .\n`` It just seems his time has passed , '' said Camille Brown , 62 , of Nashua , N.H. , the director of admissions at a community college who attended a candidate forum in Concord , N.H. , during the campaign 's final days . `` It 's time to pass the mantle .
