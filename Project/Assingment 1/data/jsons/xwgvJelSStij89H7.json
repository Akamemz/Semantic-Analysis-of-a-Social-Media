When I went to interview him in early 1980 , I was led to believe I \u2019 d be meeting a man who would change the world , or , at least , the little world of El Salvador . But he seemed on first encounter to be very gray , more a forgettable clerk than a firebrand cleric . Not a revolutionary , certainly . Not a martyr .

For three decades the theological machinery of John Paul II and Benedict XVI prevented the martyred Romero from advancing toward the formal title of saint , a long process that was fast-tracked for John Paul II himself , and also for much less sympathetic figures like the founder of the wealthy and secretive order Opus Dei .\nYes , symbolic gestures were made .
