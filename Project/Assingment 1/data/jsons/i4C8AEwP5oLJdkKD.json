    "content": "Nikki Haley , the one-time Republican governor of South Carolina and former U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations , is no longer in public life . But if a recent visit to a high school near her hometown is any indication , the public is n't done with her .\nThe 47-year-old married mother of two has a new book , `` With All Due Respect '' ( St. Martin 's Press ) , recounting both her tenure in the Trump administration , and her journey from small town Bamberg , S.C. , to the world stage .\nShe told `` CBS Evening News '' anchor Norah O'Donnell that she dislikes being described as `` ambitious . ''\n`` You know , when women are referred to as ambitious , it 's never in a positive light , '' Haley said . `` I 've heard that all my life : She 's so ambitious . No , I 'm passionate . I love what I do . I throw myself into it . So , I prefer 'badass . ' ''\nWhile Haley is a daughter of the South , she 's also the daughter of immigrants from India . She grew up as Nikki Randhawa .\n`` We were n't white enough to be white , we were n't black enough to be black , '' she said . `` We were the only Indian family [ in town ] . My father wore a turban , he still does to this day . My mom in town wore a sari . And I remember we would get teased . And I would leave the playground and come home , and I remember my mom would always say , 'Your job is not to show them how you 're different . Your job is to show them how you 're similar . ' ''\nIt 's a winning formula in politics , and Haley 's Southern charm is a point of pride , as well as a pointed weapon .\nIn 2016 , she campaigned for Florida Senator Marco Rubio , and against Donald Trump . At a February 29 , 2016 rally in Atlanta , Haley said , `` Donald Trump , show us your tax return ! ''\nWhen candidate Trump tweeted back , `` The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley ! , '' she replied with the withering put-down beloved by Southern women : `` Bless your heart . ''\n`` I have always kicked with a smile , '' Haley said . `` Yeah , I 've always said I wear high-heels and it 's not for a fashion statement . It 's when I see something wrong , I 'm gon na kick every time . ''\n`` Yes ! Look , I think that , you know , you have to be tough . But I do n't think you have to be disrespectful . ''\nNikki Haley : We should have the backs of the Kurds\n`` You also write in the book that part of your secret to success has been you 've been underestimated ? ''\n`` Does it motivate you ? 'Cause sometimes , for me , being underestimated motivates me . ''\n`` Oh , it absolutely motivates me . I love surprising people . I love letting them know what I 'm capable of . And I love challenging myself to prove to them , so that they can be proud . ''\nAs South Carolina Governor , Haley 's most challenging moment came in 2015 when a white supremacist slaughtered nine worshippers at Mother Emanuel , an historic black AME Church in Charleston . In the aftermath of that tragedy , Haley writes she feared Donald Trump 's angry campaign rhetoric could inspire even more violence .\nStill , after the 2016 election , Haley accepted his offer to become U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations . And those stilettos ? On her first day on the job , she came out kicking : `` For those who do n't have our back , we 're taking names . ''\nHaley was the president 's voice on issues that still dominate the headlines : Russian aggression in Ukraine , North Korea 's nuclear program , and the Syrian civil war . But her battles at the U.N. were rivaled by battle for control within the White House .\nHaley recounts a closed-door encounter with then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson : `` Kelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president , they were n't being insubordinate , they were trying to save the country \u2026 Tillerson went on to tell me the reason he resisted the president 's decisions was because , if he did n't , people would die . This was how high the stakes were , he and Kelly told me . We are doing the best we can do to save the country , they said . We need you to work with us and help us do it . This went on for over an hour . ''\n`` It absolutely happened , '' said Haley . `` And instead of saying that to me , they should 've been saying that to the president , not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan . It should 've been , 'Go tell the president what your differences are , and quit if you do n't like what he 's doing . ' But to undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing . And it goes against the Constitution , and it goes against what the American people want . And it was offensive . ''\n[ We asked them to respond . John Kelly tells `` Sunday Morning '' : `` If by resistance and stalling she means putting a staff process in place \u2026 to ensure the ( president ) knew all the pros and cons of what policy decision he might be contemplating so he could make an informed decision , then guilty as charged . '' ]\nHaley remains a fierce Trump loyalist , including on the issue of his asking the Ukrainian president to dig for dirt on the family of Democratic candidate Joe Biden .\nO'Donnell asked , `` Do you think ultimately the president will be impeached and removed from office ? ''\nHaley replied , `` No . On what ? You 're gon na impeach a president for asking for a favor that did n't happen and giving money and it was n't withheld ? I do n't know what you would impeach him on . And look , Norah , impeachment is , like , the death penalty for a public official . When you look at the transcript , there 's nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president . ''\n`` To be clear , it was not a complete transcript . There are still things that are missing from it . And in it , he does say , ' I would like you to do us a favor , though . ' ''\n`` The Ukrainians never did the investigation . And the president released the funds . I mean , when you look at those , there 's just nothing impeachable there . And more than that , I think the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this . Why do we have a bunch of people in Congress making that decision ? ''\nHaley , herself a daughter of immigrants , also defends President Trump on one of him most inflammatory statements : his tweet from this past summer in which he told four Democratic female members of Congress , three of whom were born in the United States , to `` Go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came . ''\nWas that appropriate ? `` No , it 's not appropriate , '' Haley replied . `` But I also can appreciate where he was coming from , from the standpoint of , do n't bash America over and over and over again and not do something to try and fix it . ''\nNikki Haley : Trump is n't the only one guilty of inflammatory rhetoric\nHaley insists she has no immediate plans to run for any office , including the presidency , and as she departed the Trump administration last year she said , `` I can promise you what I 'll be doing is campaigning for this one . ''\nShe told O'Donnell , `` A year is a long time in politics . It really is a lifetime in politics . And so , I think what 's best for me is take it a year at a time and see what happens . ''\nWith her new book , lucrative speaking engagements , and a seat on the corporate board of Boeing , Nikki Haley acknowledges there are still chapters to be written : `` I 'm too young to stop fighting . I 'll always be out there . I 'll always use the power of my voice for what I believe is good . ''",
