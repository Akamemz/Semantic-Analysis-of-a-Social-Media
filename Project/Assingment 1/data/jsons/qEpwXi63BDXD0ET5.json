My hunch is a fraction of that would have been a help in New Hampshire . \u201d\nBuckley told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he would meet with Inslee just like he would with any other potential 2020 candidate who comes through the state and that Inslee would ultimately get a fair shake . But he said local Democrats are still scratching their heads over Inslee \u2019 s decision not pump money into Kelly \u2019 s campaign against incumbent Republican Gov . Chris Sununu .\n\u201c I think some folks in New Hampshire had concluded that since they had made a decision at the DGA not to assist the Democratic gubernatorial campaign in New Hampshire , that he wasn \u2019 t running . So it might have taken a few people by surprise that he still expressed interest because usually , the DGA is very supportive of Democratic candidates for their first race here in New Hampshire , \u201d Buckley said .\nDemocrats were especially miffed , Buckley said , because polling showed Kelly within one point of Sununu a week before the election . As the DGA held back , the Republican Governors Association plowed more than $ 800,000 into the race .\n\u201c They knew based on the same polling as we did but they chose not to play , \u201d Buckley said of the DGA . \u201c I just think people were surprised , disappointed . But maybe they knew something that we didn \u2019 t know . Hopefully , they \u2019 ll fill us in on that and then we move on . \u201d\nThe blowback against Inslee is unusual since the chairmanship of both parties \u2019 national gubernatorial campaign committees is often utilized as a springboard to a presidential run . And that dimension of the job often results in favorable treatment to the early states . In 2014 , for example , as then-chairman of the Republican Governors Association , Chris Christie showered Iowa with $ 2.3 million in media and direct contributions to boost then-Gov . Terry Branstad \u2019 s reelection campaign . The Christie-led RGA spent even more in New Hampshire for unsuccessful GOP nominee Walt Havenstein .\nThe DGA didn \u2019 t completely abandon Kelly in 2016 . The organization did spend money on a private poll of the race for Kelly in the fall , according to two Democratic officials with knowledge of the survey , and it found Kelly lagging well behind Sununu .\nInslee also hosted a fundraiser for Kelly in Seattle , according to a Democrat with knowledge of the DGA \u2019 s fundraising events .\nBut the DGA did not spend a cent on television advertising for Kelly \u2014 a stark contrast to the $ 645,000 the RGA spent on ads for Sununu , according to Advertising Analytics . And in the final few weeks of the race , multiple internal polls on both sides showed the contest had tightened . Kelly personally pleaded with Inslee and the DGA to pour more money into the race saying that it was still winnable , according to Democrats with knowledge of those conversations .\nInslee , according to those Democrats , stressed he still supported Kelly but his hands were tied .\n\u201c Governor Inslee is proud to have led the Democratic Governors Association to its most successful cycle in 36 years , flipping 7 gubernatorial seats from red to blue , \u201d said Jamal Raad , a spokesman for the governor . \u201c He enjoyed working closely with Molly Kelly and to personally campaign for her election right after the primary . ''\nOne GOP campaign official involved in the governor \u2019 s race said Republicans were taken aback by the DGA \u2019 s decision to forego an investment in the contest .\n\u201c We were extremely surprised that the DGA did not invest more resources in the race , especially in the closing days , \u201d the official said . \u201c Instead , the DGA invested resources in places like Alaska , a race that was already lost for them . And they invested significant resources in states like Rhode Island , which ended up being a blowout for Gov . Raimondo . I still think even with resources by Dems , Sununu would have still won . But if DGA would have invested significant resources from the beginning , it could have been a different outcome . \u201d\nStill , the decision to stiff Kelly wasn \u2019 t completely unwarranted .
