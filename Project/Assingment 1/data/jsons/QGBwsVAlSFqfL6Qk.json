Even fortune tellers ?\nThese are just a few examples of a growing number of unnecessary occupational licenses . Indeed , one in every four Americans needs a government license just to do his or her job .

But too many licenses have nothing to do with protecting consumers . Worse yet , these laws might actually be making us less safe .\nThis is because licensing laws often prohibit certain individuals from obtaining licenses at all . If you have a felony background , for instance , the state of Tennessee bars you from becoming an interior designer or a cosmetologist . In California , 4,000 inmate firefighters helped battle last year \u2019 s wildfires . After their release , however , those same people would almost certainly be denied that same job simply because of their backgrounds .\nThe bottom line is that when people who have committed crimes can not find jobs once they \u2019 re released , they are more likely to commit more crimes . This not only hurts those individuals , it puts further pressure on taxpayers and jeopardizes public safety . Doing away with these unnecessary licensing requirements would help former offenders obtain honest employment , which not only complies with conservative principles , it reduces recidivism and keeps everyone safer .\nConservatism is about law and order and limited government . Accordingly , the government should focus on keeping people safe \u2013 not keeping people out of jobs simply because of a criminal past .
