A number of health insurance changes have already taken place , but this fall , just as the 2014 election season heats up , is the deadline for introducing the law \u2019 s core feature : the insurance marketplaces , known as exchanges , where millions of uninsured Americans can buy coverage , with subsidies for many .\nThe noticeable proliferation of `` Democrats fret over Obamacare '' stories in the mainstream media points to something other than a simple manifestation of liberal self-flagellation .
