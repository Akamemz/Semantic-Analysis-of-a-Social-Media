    "content": "When attorneys for the Trump administration defended the president \u2019 s executive order targeting sanctuary cities this month , they urged a federal judge not to take its wide-ranging threats too seriously .\nThe order was merely an example of the president \u2019 s use of the \u201c bully pulpit , serving the purpose of highlighting President Trump \u2019 s focus on immigration enforcement , \u201d the administration \u2019 s council told US District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco .\nThat argument failed to persuade . On Tuesday , Judge Orrick put a temporary halt to Mr. Trump \u2019 s executive order threatening to withhold federal funds from jurisdictions that limit local cooperation with immigration officials . It was the third time since Trump took office that a federal court put a halt to one of his executive orders \u2013 and the third time a court cited the president \u2019 s free-flowing bully pulpit to rule that an order likely overstepped the bounds of the Constitution .\nAs a first-time politician , Trump reveled in flouting establishment niceties and saying things few others would dare . From the start , the New York billionaire has employed a style of shoot-from-the-hip hyperbole that can be considered more rhetorical art than precise public policy .\nIt \u2019 s a style suited for bursts of provocative Tweets or stream-of-consciousness speeches . In the courtroom , where judges value verbal precision , the president \u2019 s hyperbole , which often runs roughshod over factual details , has often worked against him .\n\u201c In some respects , what we \u2019 re seeing is new , because courts have not used that kind of information before , \u201d says Nancy Kassop , professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz . \u201c But they haven \u2019 t had any reason to until now . They \u2019 re beginning to create a precedent that what a president says , even if it \u2019 s off-the-cuff , if it has policy consequence to it or policy significance to it , it can \u2019 t be ignored . \u201d\nIn March , federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland halted the president \u2019 s executive order suspending immigration from \u201c countries of concern , \u201d citing administration officials \u2019 many statements broadly condemning Islam , as well as candidate Trump \u2019 s statements calling for \u201c a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States \u201d \u2013 a statement still posted on the campaign site .\n\u201c Donald Trump appears to use rhetoric and words in a far different way from his predecessors , \u201d says Mark Jones , a fellow at Rice University \u2019 s Baker Institute of Public Policy in Houston . \u201c He \u2019 s far more prone to exaggeration and the use of language that is more of a metaphor for broader action rather than a concrete policy proposal . \u201d\n\u201c However , our legal system , our judges , our public are used to past presidents \u2019 presidential behavior , where what a president says is indicative of their intent , and that \u2019 s where President Trump \u2019 s actions on the campaign trail have got him into trouble in his first 100 days , \u201d Mr. Jones continues .\nIn his battle against \u201c sanctuary cities , \u201d Trump , as well as surrogates such as White House press secretary Sean Spicer and Attorney General Jeff Sessions , have said his administration would wield federal funding as \u201c a weapon \u201d against states like California , where many jurisdictions limit cooperation with immigration officials .\nThe problem is that the president can not simply wield funding as a kind of stick to prod states to get in line . Many Supreme Court precedents already limit the president \u2019 s ability to cut funding already allocated by Congress , legal experts say .\nThe president \u2019 s lawyers seemed to know this , arguing that the executive order should be interpreted more narrowly than the president \u2019 s public statements \u2013 or even the words of the order \u2019 s text itself . They told the judge to ignore the administration \u2019 s broad language , saying the president only had the power to withhold , at most , three small grants administered by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security .\nTrump \u2019 s lawyers also argued that the plaintiffs in the case , Santa Clara and San Francisco , should not have standing to sue , because the administration has not yet taken any action , or even defined what a sanctuary city is , exactly .\nIt was a curious concession that rendered the executive order \u201c toothless , \u201d Orrick wrote . The order , \u201c by its plain language , attempts to reach all federal grants , not merely the three mentioned at the hearing . \u201d\nAnd given all the administration \u2019 s saber rattling about holding sanctuary cities to account , Orrick described the Trump administration \u2019 s arguments in court as \u201c schizophrenic . \u201d\n\u201c There is no doubt a culture clash going on between judges who use language precisely and a populist president who freewheels with language and often shoots from the hip , \u201d says James Goodnow , an attorney with Fennemore Craig , headquartered in Phoenix , and a frequent legal commentator . \u201c Judges are in the business of ascertaining intent .... Courts then have to do their best to figure out intent from the papers in front of them or witness testimony . \u201d\n\u201c But Trump makes it easy , \u201d he continues . \u201c He live tweets his every thought to the entire world . In the case of the travel ban and his sanctuary city executive order , he indicated his apparent intent behind the laws time and again . In the sanctuary city case , justice department lawyers essentially argued that Trump was simply engaging in hyperbole \u2026 and he didn \u2019 t mean his comments to be taken literally . \u201d\n\u201c But when it comes to matters of national security or people \u2019 s livelihoods , judges are trained that words matter , \u201d Mr. Goodnow says .\nThe White House , in a statement , said Orrick \u2019 s ruling was \u201c yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single , unelected district judge \u201d who \u201c unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our nation . \u201d\nThe president lashed out against the ruling on Twitter . `` First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities \u2013 both ridiculous rulings .
