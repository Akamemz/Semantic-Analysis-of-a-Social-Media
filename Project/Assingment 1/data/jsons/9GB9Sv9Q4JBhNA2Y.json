The group had planned to have about 250 people at its quadrennial gathering , but organizers said in the past few weeks interest exploded and that now more than 500 people are expected .\nAn opening reception Thursday evening featured a speech from Yahne Ndgo , a vocal `` Bernie or Bust '' supporter who has now found a home in the Green Party . She said the Democratic National Committee rigged the Democratic primary in favor of Hillary Clinton .\n`` Are you going to try and go inside there and reform this party that has demonstrated in every way , with every opportunity , that they really do not give a flying f * * * about one thing that you care about ? '' Ndgo said to rousing applause . `` Or are you going to open up your mind to the possibility that there is something in place , a national organization that 's already in place that actually wants to hear from and represent your needs , your interests and your leadership ? To me , it 's not a hard decision . ''\nMargaret Flowers , who 's running on the Green Party line for Senate in Maryland , said the primary purpose of the weekend was to officially nominate Stein and her running mate , Ajamu Baraka , Saturday afternoon . But she acknowledged at a press conference Thursday that the gathering was also a chance for disaffected Sanders supporters to hopefully find a new home .\n`` It 's an opportunity for Greens to be together and for new people to learn about the Green Party and our values , '' Flowers said . `` I think the new people will find the GNC is very different from the RNC or the DNC . We 're real people . We 're people who really care . ''\nAndrea M\u00e9rida Cu\u00e9llar , one of the party 's national co-chairs , said the current election was `` unprecedented '' and that the `` shenanigans '' in Philadelphia at the Democratic National Convention had sparked new interest in their decades-old party .\n`` It is ever more crucial for us as a third-party entity , for us as a Green Party , to prepare ourselves and present a home for those people who have said enough is enough , '' she said .\nIt is ever more crucial for us as a third-party entity , for us as a Green Party , to prepare ourselves and present a home for those people who have said enough is enough .\n`` We 're very excited by this challenge , we welcome folks , like-minded who really see what has happened , the disaster of politics at the RNC and DNC .
