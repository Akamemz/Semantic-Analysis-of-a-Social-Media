But there he was , cheering in the stands at a football game he never attended , just behind a group of white students .\nSome employees in the marketing department had decided to photoshop his face into the image ; this , they thought , was a great way to project a diverse image to prospective students .\nThe decision might seem innocuous to many \u2014 a clumsy but well-intentioned attempt by a university to promote diversity . But according to Nancy Leong , a law professor at the University of Denver who focuses on civil rights and discrimination , it happens all the time . And it breeds even more racial resentment in society .\nIn 2013 , Leong wrote a lengthy article in the Harvard Law Review in which she labeled this practice \u201c racial capitalism \u201d : the use of nonwhite people by corporations and institutions to make money or boost their brand .\nThink of the controversial 2018 Super Bowl commercial in which Dodge used a Martin Luther King Jr. speech to peddle Ram trucks ; it was one of those uniquely late-capitalist moments where an act of protest or a racially progressive speech was reduced to a bland commercial prop .\nI reached out to Leong to talk about how racial capitalism exploits nonwhite people and why she believes the practice is bad for both individuals and society as a whole . A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows .\nRacial capitalism is the process of getting some sort of social or economic benefit from someone else \u2019 s racial identity . In the United States , this usually , though not always , involves white people benefiting from nonwhite racial identity . This is because white people in the US are more likely to have the power and resources to use another person \u2019 s identity to benefit themselves .\nCan you give me some specific examples of racial capitalism in practice , things that would be familiar to most readers ?\nA common example of racial capitalism is a school or a company intentionally putting photos of people of color on its website to inflate its appearance of diversity . This happens all the time . Sometimes schools have even been known to photoshop people of color into their brochures .\nRacial capitalism could also be something as simple as claiming that you can \u2019 t be racist because you have a black friend , or including a token minority character in a movie . Or it could be something like quoting Martin Luther King Jr. on Twitter when you \u2019 ve recently been accused of white supremacist views , like Rep. Steve King ( R-IA ) just did this past MLK Day .\nRacial capitalism is very common , and it \u2019 s often done by well-intentioned people who are completely unaware they \u2019 re doing it .\nWhy is racial capitalism problematic from your point of view ?\nToo frequently , racial capitalism is all show and no substance . We have a big problem with race relations in America . Racial capitalism doesn \u2019 t help , and it sometimes makes things worse .\nRacial capitalism breeds racial resentment . People of color know when they \u2019 re being showcased to benefit someone else \u2014 for example , a student of color whose photo is plastered all over their school \u2019 s website often resents the school for using them .\nThis is especially true if the student perceives that the school isn \u2019 t actually doing anything substantive to improve race relations , like providing funding to bring speakers to campus or taking the initiative to recruit racially diverse faculty members .\nI \u2019 m trying to imagine all the possible motivations for racial capitalism . Is it greed and cynicism ? Is it about signaling , however disingenuously , a commitment to diversity ?\nI think there are a lot of overlapping motivations . One is virtue signaling : \u201c Look at how inclusive and diverse this company is. \u201d Another is as a defense against racism : \u201c I can \u2019 t be racist because my best friend is black. \u201d Another is purely economic : \u201c Our movie will bring in a bigger audience if we cast this popular actor of color , even in a small role . \u201d\nWhen did this become a thing ? When did nonwhiteness acquire market value and become a commercial prop ?\nI trace it to a 1978 Supreme Court decision called University of California v. Bakke . That decision upheld race-based affirmative action programs but also said the only constitutional justification for affirmative action is promoting racial diversity . So ever since then , \u201c diversity \u201d has become a prominent part of our national conversation about race .\nAnd if diversity is a good thing , that gives people a reason to engage in racial capitalism . Of course , this is not to say that diversity is a bad thing , but the fact that the Supreme Court focused on it drew attention away from other important issues .\nFor example , if the Supreme Court had instead held that past discrimination could justify affirmative action \u2014 what lawyers call the \u201c remedial rationale \u201d \u2014 then we as a country would be more likely to have a necessary and painful conversation about race that would include everything from slavery to Jim Crow to redlining to the discriminatory administration of the GI Bill after World War II .\nThis is basically capitalist enterprises reducing race to a brand , in the same way they peddle lifestyles to targeted demographics .\nYes , absolutely . I think you could go even go further and say it is reducing diversity to a brand . This is one of the reasons that racial capitalism is problematic : It treats racial identity and diversity like commodities , which gives the impression that they are just like anything else you could buy or sell .\nIn what sense does whiteness carry inherent economic value in our culture ?\nIt \u2019 s the default setting . Law professor Cheryl Harris has written a wonderful article about this called \u201c Whiteness as Property. \u201d Whiteness has value in almost every setting due to conscious and unconscious bias .\nResearch shows that you are more likely to get a job interview if you have a white-sounding name . White people get better deals when they buy used cars and make more money when they sell things on eBay . Research even shows that professors are more likely to respond to an identical email when they think it was sent by a white student . Law firm partners rate an identical memo higher when they think it \u2019 s written by a white associate .\nI could go on and on , but you get the point .\nDoes the phenomenon you \u2019 re describing ever work in the reverse direction ? That is , do nonwhite people and institutions ever use whiteness to acquire social and economic value ?\nOccasionally , it could happen in the other direction . You might see a group that is predominantly people of color including some white people to try to help give legitimacy to the group . White people are sometimes seen as more authoritative even when they aren \u2019 t , and that can be valuable to nonwhite people .\nIt \u2019 s because of the way power is distributed in America . The most powerful people in politics , business , education , entertainment , and so on tend to be white \u2014 although this is slowly changing \u2014 and that means those people are in a position to make decisions that result in commodifying people of color . People of color are less likely to have that position of power .\nAll of this might seem counterintuitive to people , since whiteness has always been such a reliable source of value and power in this country .\nI agree , and it mostly still is . My point is that because of the increased focus on diversity , nonwhiteness also has a certain type of value now too . White people are also increasingly concerned about being labeled racist , and forming relationships \u2014 even superficial ones \u2014 with nonwhite people might seem like a defense against that .\nThere \u2019 s something very insidious about the inversion you describe here . For most of our history , nonwhite human beings were assigned value and sold as commodities . Today , a well-intentioned diversity rationale is being used to re-commodify and re-exploit racial differences .\nThis is one of my greatest concerns with racial capitalism . Racial capitalism feeds racial resentment \u2014 it \u2019 s not like nonwhite people don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going on here \u2014 and this is like throwing gasoline on the fire of racial tensions .\nAnd , of course , the irony is that the value of nonwhiteness is still largely measured by its worth to white people and predominantly white institutions .\nOne of the big problems with racial capitalism is the way it constrains nonwhite people . If you know your company hired you partly because you are Asian , you might feel pressure to allow your photo to be used all over the website or to attend every diversity event even when you \u2019 re swamped just doing the work for your actual job .\nWhite people , who aren \u2019 t usually pressured to do this kind of racial work , can just concentrate on their jobs . This has happened to me , when I am expected to mentor students of color , serve as the faculty adviser for racial affinity groups , or attend diversity events .\nI love doing those things , but it \u2019 s real work that is not always acknowledged by the institutions to which I \u2019 ve belonged . Racial capitalism leads to a lot of extra racial work for people of color .\nThere \u2019 s an example in your article of a largely white college that photoshopped an image of a black student onto a brochure in an attempt to offer the illusion of diversity on campus . I \u2019 m trying to be as generous as possible here , so I \u2019 ll just ask : Is this necessarily a bad thing ? Is it possible that they \u2019 re genuinely seeking to become more diverse and perhaps they just chose a clumsy way of doing it ?\nI do have some sympathy for colleges that do this . I think the generous construction is sometimes true : Colleges want to signal that this is a good place for people of color , but the fact is that they don \u2019 t have very many students of color , which is why we end up with this photoshopping .\nI \u2019 d suggest , though , that a more honest approach is better , backed up with a real economic commitment . What that might look like is a college that says , \u201c We care about diversity and we know we need to do better . That is why we are offering 50 full-tuition scholarships to people who will bring diversity , including but not limited to racial diversity , to our campus . \u201d\nI think people would find something honest and substantive like that very refreshing .\nIs the problem , then , a superficial commitment to diversity , in which nonwhiteness is just a commodity , a way for white people to profit from a loose affiliation with nonwhiteness ?\nYes . I think the superficiality is part of the problem . If you want to do something good for nonwhite people , put some real resources into it .\nDo you think our societal effort to promote diversity has had the unintentional effect of degrading nonwhiteness ?\nMaybe . If nonwhiteness is just a commodity that can be bought and sold , isn \u2019 t it just like cereal or ballpoint pens or anything else you can buy and sell ? I worry that people look at nonwhiteness as just another thing to acquire . You want some nonwhite friends at your party , just like you want great lighting and fancy decorations .\nThis is the question that keeps me up at night . I think the example I gave earlier relating to college recruiting highlights two things that will help : honesty and resources . If a school wants more students of color , it should come out and say so , and then show it \u2019 s sincere by putting some money into the problem .\nOur country is going down the wrong road when it comes to race . We have a president who is a consummate racial capitalist . He goes out of his way to tweet photos of himself with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in the Oval Office , yet he hasn \u2019 t appointed a single black woman to the federal judiciary , constantly vilifies brown immigrants , and called white supremacists in Charlottesville \u201c very fine people. \u201d You couldn \u2019 t find a clearer example of the divide between show and substance . As a country , we are getting hung up on the show and missing the mark when it comes to the substance .\nIn 2018 , a poll found that 64 percent of Americans think racism is still a major problem in American society and politics . Another 30 percent think racism is a problem . So almost everyone agrees that race relations in America are troubled . But glossy brochures with photos of smiling , racially diverse people aren \u2019 t going to heal our culture .\nWe need to come up with real , substantive solutions \u2014 not use racial capitalism as a way of avoiding the hard questions .",
