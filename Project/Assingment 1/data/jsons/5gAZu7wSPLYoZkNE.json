Sen. Thom Tillis , R-N.C. , says yes .\n`` About 60-70 percent of the base policy I think we 've already got common ground , and I also think some of the things that were n't in the House bill , now that we 've had time to hear from the business community , do more economic modeling , some of the changes we 'll even make will be well-received so that level of commonality is even higher than when it first came to the Senate , '' Tillis told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News .\nUnlike the House plan , the Senate bill calls for a one-year delay in phasing in cutting the tax rate on businesses .
