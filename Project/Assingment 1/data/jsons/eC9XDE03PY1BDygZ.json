    "content": "Katie blogged this episode yesterday , in which President Obama made an active decision not only to politicize the funeral of five slain police officers with a strident gun control message , but to do so with the cartoonishly false claim that handguns are more readily available to teenagers than computers or books . It would be a challenge to improve upon Charles Cooke 's instant reaction post at NRO -- but I 'll at least endeavor to add to it in a moment . First , here 's Cooke :\nDid this little moment really serve to help [ Obama 's ] cause ? Twenty minutes ago , almost everyone I know thought that the president was doing a good job with his address . Now , at least half of them are irritated and upset . On Twitter , a debate over books and Glocks has broken out . People are shouting at one another . Where there was harmony , now there is discord . This , remember , was a funeral \u2014 a funeral for one of the police officers who was murdered last Thursday . It wasn \u2019 t a rally . It wasn \u2019 t a White House press conference . It wasn \u2019 t a public statement , hastily arranged on the airport tarmac . It was a funeral . Presumably , those attending had all sorts of political opinions . Presumably , some of the cops were Republicans . Presumably , there was some serious disagreement in that room as to how the country should move forward . Wouldn \u2019 t it have been better to wait until the proceedings were over to call for change ? Wouldn \u2019 t it have been more politically effective for the president to have made his push somewhere else ? Again , I am not suggesting that Obama should stay quiet on the matter in general . While I wish that he wouldn \u2019 t indulge in crass overstatements , he of course has every right to lobby for whatever alterations to the status quo he happens to covet . I \u2019 m just wondering who thought it would be a good idea to make such a nakedly divisive statement at a memorial service . Anyone ?\nAnswer : Obama did , because he can not help himself . Our arrogant and self-righteous president is immersed in legacy-building , emboldened by an improved approval rating that has no doubt been inflated by public perceptions and media coverage of this year 's historically unpopular presumptive major party nominees . The truth is that Obama is a hardened ideologue , and always has been . His `` purple America '' coming out party in 2004 was a feel-good charade . His supposed policy 'pragmatism ' has been routinely exposed as empty posturing , a fraud . He is a hyper-political , uber-partisan man of the Left , and he 's intent on yanking the country in that direction as his political exit approaches . To that end , gun control has become something of an obsession . It also happens to be one of the few issues on which he 's been consistently and almost completely thwarted by bipartisan opposition . As a result , he 's decided to use his bully pulpit , and use it often , to try to move the needle in some meaningful way . He 's run the calculus and determined that every horrible act perpetrated with a gun presents an opportunity to advocate gun control -- immediately and loudly . It 's also fair to assume that he knew that a large online and on-air audience would be watching Tuesday 's memorial service , and chose to exploit the platform . He reportedly crafted much of the speech - including , presumably , the ludicrous and self-discrediting gun lie -- himself .\nEven if you agree with his policy prescriptions ( I generally do not ) , and believe that his grief over gun violence is genuine ( I do ) , you very well may concede that tramping down this rhetorical path , in this venue , was in poor taste and likely counter-productive . He surely understood this dynamic , too , but proceeded with his plan anyway . The man is not stupid ; he 's stubborn and incurably sanctimonious . Especially galling is the realization that if he 'd wanted to pay heed to his convictions on guns in a less inflammatory way , options were available to him .
