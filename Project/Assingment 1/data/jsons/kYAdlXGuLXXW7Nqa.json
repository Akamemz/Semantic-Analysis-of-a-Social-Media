She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted : someone who knew leaders around the world , who brought star power as well as expertise to the table .

She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries . She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington \u2019 s institutional ties to the region . Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women , and she criticized the Beijing government \u2019 s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations .\nIn January 2011 , before the Arab Spring , Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders , saying their countries risked \u201c sinking into the sand \u201d unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies . Certainly , the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure , but she did not cause that .\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama , as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels . We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria , but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders .\nMrs. Clinton , who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade , has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain , as she has in detail , why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership . She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done , and certainly more than any of the Republicans .\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change . It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and , should she win the White House , the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured . Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous , like Donald Trump \u2019 s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton \u2019 s marital infidelity . Some , like those about Mrs. Clinton 's use of a private email server , are legitimate and deserve forthright answers .\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer \u2014 a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity , women \u2019 s rights are enhanced , undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy , international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe .",
