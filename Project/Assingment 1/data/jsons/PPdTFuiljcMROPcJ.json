It showed Lewandowski , who called Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields \u201c delusional \u201d for claiming he grabbed her , doing just that . It also cut the factual foundation out from under Trump \u2019 s campaign , which repeatedly denied any wrongdoing on the night of March 8 , when the incident occurred following a news conference at Trump \u2019 s resort in Jupiter , Florida .\nBut in the hours between the tape \u2019 s release and Trump taking the stage here , any chance of it separating Trump from his fans vanished . As the networks played the tape on loop , the footage \u2014 much like Trump itself \u2014 became a Rorschach test , with everyone seeing what they wanted to .\nTrump wrapped up the hourlong town hall by portraying Lewandowski , a former police officer , as a sympathetic family man wrongly accused , and later \u2014 in yet another hour of national television afforded to him \u2014 portrayed himself as a defender of the downtrodden who stood with his maligned staffer when others wouldn \u2019 t . \u201c At first I said , \u2018 Oh this is terrible , \u2019 \u201d Trump said . \u201c And then I saw the tape .
