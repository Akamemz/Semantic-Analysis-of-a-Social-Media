Then , Barack Obama was re-elected to a second four-year term . Now , he 's been largely benched by his party , spending less time on the campaign trail than his much more popular wife , first lady Michelle Obama , former president Bill Clinton and potential future presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . Midterm elections are more local affairs and the issues vary from contest to contest .\nBut midterms have national consequences , and what happens Tuesday will help determine what President Obama can get done in his final two years in office . It will tee up the coming 2016 presidential contest and give Americans the chance to try on a more powerful GOP as they start to think about who should be the next president .\nBut first comes Tuesday and here is what 's going to happen :\n# 1 - There will be a surprise -- Something we 're listing below wo n't end up happening . This is an election and it is n't over yet . Voters are fickle and polls are n't perfect and predictions are even less so . So tune in to CNN Politics all day and night Tuesday . We will be here and it will be exciting .\nRelated : Sound like a political junkie with these 2014 midterm facts\n# 2 -Most Americans wo n't take part -- Really , it will be exciting on Tuesday . But most Americans wo n't have taken part in the election . Somewhere between 55 % and 65 % of eligible Americans vote in a presidential election ( about 130 million people in 2012 ) . Far fewer -- between 39 % and 42 % of Americans take part in a midterm election ( about 90 million in 2010 ) . A recent focus group of moms conducted by a group affiliated with Walmart suggested they would bone up for their votes by Googling candidates the night before . Voter excitement is actually down from 2010 , the last midterm election , according to the most recent CNN / ORC Poll . That poll also suggested voters are angry at their political process and at Washington , D.C. , either because they see their votes as not accomplishing change or they see the current logjam in Washington as intractable . Either way , less than half the eligible population is likely to show up and let their voices be heard in this election .\n# 3 - Democrats will lose the Senate -- Okay , this one is not a sure thing .

Among the rest of the races that CNN considers to be tossup or leaning toward the GOP , 7 of them are held by Democrats . Just three are held by Republicans .
