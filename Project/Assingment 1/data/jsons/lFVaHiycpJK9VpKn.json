I \u2019 m so sorry what has happened in Las Vegas , what has happened in your city , this mass killing , the single-largest one by a lone gunman in U.S. history . Can you talk about what the NRA is doing ?

And it \u2019 s been a terrible week in Las Vegas , and so , you know , I appreciate being on .\nWe \u2019 re happy to see that , you know , many of the legislators , including some of the ones here in Nevada , Congresswoman Dina Titus and various others , are supporting these regulations and moving forward with regulations to limit bump stocks , because that is part of the reason why this massacre occurred . However , we believe that this is going to then become an excuse for the NRA not to go further on this .\nAt the end of the day , what we really need to do is real substantive gun violence prevention policy . And the bump stock issue is a very important part of that conversation , and we \u2019 re very appreciative of that ; however , we also know the NRA , and we know their tactics . This is a political move on the part of the NRA to not have to go further for real gun violence prevention measures . And we know that they \u2019 re going to use this now as an excuse to say , \u201c Look , we gave you something . We \u2019 re not totally against everything . And let \u2019 s move forward with this so we don \u2019 t have to take real action on gun violence. \u201d And so , for me , as an advocate , as somebody who \u2019 s fighting for this every single day , you know , we want to see these bump stocks be taken out of commission ; however , we also want to see real gun violence prevention legislation move forward , both at the state level and nationally .\nAMY GOODMAN : So , I wanted to ask you about bump stocks , whether or not it \u2019 s regulated , and the NRA wants it to be done through the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , so it doesn \u2019 t go to Congress and they \u2019 re not voting on it . About what \u2019 s happening in Nevada , I mean , it \u2019 s not like he just used bump stocks .

So , I am a gun owner . We own a handgun . We don \u2019 t own 33 weapons , unlike this terrorist did . And , you know , what we believe , as gun owners , as responsible gun owners , is that there needs to be legislation in place to make it harder for people who shouldn \u2019 t own weapons to own weapons .\nAnd so , for me , Question 1 is a great example of that , our background check initiative , which passed .
