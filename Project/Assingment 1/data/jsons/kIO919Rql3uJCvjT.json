    "content": "Michael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine .\nIn February 2013 , Senator Marco Rubio let me sit in on the politics course he taught part time at Florida International University . He knew I was writing a cover story about him for Time magazine , but he still gave his students a master class in self-promotion in my presence , explaining the machinations he had used to persuade his colleagues to elect him speaker of the Florida House of Representatives : \u201c You raise money for them . You befriend them . You make sure your kids are friends with their kids . And then you cut the best deal you can. \u201d He also candidly described how partisan redistricting had driven him and his caucus toward ideological extremes : \u201c If you know the only way to lose your seat is to get out-conservatived in a primary , you \u2019 ll never let anyone get to your right . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m not telling you this is how it should be , \u201d he said with a grin . \u201c But it \u2019 s how it is . This isn \u2019 t a good-government class . It \u2019 s a politics class . \u201d\nThe story I wrote portrayed Rubio as a political animal , an ambitious , calculating , charismatic conservative who was positioning himself as the Barack Obama of the tea party . Titled \u201c Immigrant Son , \u201d it explored how a politician who had never accomplished much in the way of good government\u2014 \u201c his autobiography recounts virtually no substantive achievements beyond a hometown tree-planting project \u201d \u2014had become the most influential voice in the national debate over immigration reform , elevating his stature at a moment when the Republican Party was panicked about attracting Latino voters . I explored the borderland Rubio was trying to navigate as a child of immigrants who was also a child of the conservative movement , the thin line he was trying to walk \u201c between the Republican establishment and the base , between compassion and the rule of law , between family and politics . \u201d\nUnfortunately , the only thing anyone remembers about that story is the cover line my editors chose : \u201c The Republican Savior. \u201d As I \u2019 ve been reminded by a few billion mocking tweets since he dropped out Tuesday night , Rubio didn \u2019 t turn out to be the Republican savior . I get it ! In my own defense , as I \u2019 ve been trying to point out ever since Rubio posted his clever response to the cover three years ago , I never called him that .\nBut it \u2019 s useful for journalists to look back with a self-critical eye , and I don \u2019 t want to be overly defensive about my contributions to the Rubio hype machine . I did think he was the most likely GOP nominee back in 2013 , and I continued to think so until a few weeks ago , although I fortunately never said so in print . So what did I miss ?\nAt the risk of failing the self-critical test , my Time profile on Rubio \u2019 s immigration quandary still holds up . It made it clear that Rubio was already hedging on the reformist stance that had thrust him into the spotlight , demonstrating not only the intense personal pressure he felt from his family\u2014he played me a voice mail from his mother begging him not to \u201c mess with the immigrants \u201d \u2014but also the intense political pressure he felt from his tea party base . In our conversations , he was already throwing cold water on the prospects for reform , defending conservative critics of reform , and repeatedly insisting he wasn \u2019 t soft on illegal immigration . I wrote that \u201c the backlash has yet to materialize , \u201d but I also suggested that Rubio could easily abandon reform when it did materialize , which is exactly what he did .\nI \u2019 m more conflicted about whether I overestimated Rubio \u2019 s political talent . It \u2019 s possible that I exaggerated that talent because I was early to notice it . Back in June 2009 , when Rubio was running 30 points behind then-Republican Governor Charlie Crist in his long-shot race for Senate , I followed him on the campaign trail in Florida and wrote a story about how \u201c he electrified the crowds with eloquent arguments for tea-party principles. \u201d It was clear the GOP base loved him as much as it hated mushy-moderate Crist . \u201c When choosing between a Republican and a Republican , \u201d I wrote , \u201c Republicans usually pick the Republican . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s why I thought Rubio made so much sense for the GOP in 2016 ; he was the quintessential modern Republican . He stood for almost everything Mitt Romney stood for\u2014massive tax cuts , muscular foreign policy , social conservatism\u2014but while Romney , a former Massachusetts moderate , spoke Republican as a second language , Rubio was fluent . The one issue where he strayed from orthodoxy was immigration , but the Republican National Committee \u2019 s \u201c autopsy \u201d after Romney \u2019 s defeat had urged the party to moderate its views on immigration to attract more Hispanics to the party . And what better messenger than a telegenic young Cuban-American with a beautiful family and an inspiring personal story , the son of a bartender and a maid with an amazing rap about the American Dream ?\nWell , it didn \u2019 t work out , because Donald Trump happened . I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 m the only writer who didn \u2019 t foresee the Trump phenomenon , but I definitely didn \u2019 t foresee it . I still believe that in the kind of primary that most of us expected , Rubio would have been a formidable candidate , a tea partier who would have been acceptable to the establishment as a house-trained alternative to Ted Cruz . Even in the crazy-town primary that actually happened , Rubio drubbed Jeb Bush , Scott Walker , Rick Perry , Chris Christie , and other would-be Republican saviors . Sure , immigration would have been a problem for him in the primary no matter what , but not an insurmountable problem ; Romney was the father of Obamacare , and he still became the nominee . And Rubio \u2019 s immigration flirtation could have helped him in the general ; even Tuesday , polls showed he could have beaten Hillary Clinton .\nUltimately , though , Republican voters didn \u2019 t want a conservative version of Obama , another fresh-faced minority first-term senator who gave a great speech . They wanted an anti-Obama , a bombastic billionaire who wasn \u2019 t a politician , wasn \u2019 t no-drama , wasn \u2019 t interested in public policy , wasn \u2019 t going to improve Republican outreach to minorities , and definitely wasn \u2019 t a law professor or a community organizer . They didn \u2019 t want a new rock star with broad appeal . They wanted a rock thrower who reflected their anger .\nIn retrospect , Republicans have reaped what they sowed . In the Obama era , they \u2019 ve been much more consistently anti-Obama than consistently conservative . And while their relentless obstructionism has been a policy failure\u2014Obama has gotten his way on health care , energy policy , Wall Street reform , tax hikes on the wealthy , and much more\u2014it has been a political bonanza , helping to put both houses of Congress and a slew of statehouses back in Republican hands . The GOP has been lousy at governing but quite adept at marketing itself and fighting Obama ; it makes sense that they \u2019 ve turned to a marketing genius who was best known in the political world for questioning Obama \u2019 s citizenship .\nOf course , Rubio embraced the strategy that came back to bite him . \u201c He \u2019 s part of a new generation of lean and hungry conservatives who grew up in the antigovernment Reagan era and entered politics after the scorched-earth Gingrich revolution , \u201d I wrote in 2013 . \u201c Bipartisan compromise is not usually his thing. \u201d His campaign mantra was that Obama was deliberately destroying what was unique about America . \u201c Barack Obama , \u201d he liked to say , \u201c knows exactly what he \u2019 s doing . \u201d\nThat line sounded better when Rubio said it in a stump speech than it sounded when Rubio repeated it four times on a debate stage , especially since Christie had just derided him as a mindless repeater of talking points . The Robo-Marco debacle was truly shocking , especially for those of us who thought highly of Rubio \u2019 s political skills ; it really was as cringeworthy as everyone said it was , and I never saw it coming . In fairness , nothing in the modern history of Republican politics should have led anyone to believe that mindlessly repeating talking points would be a dangerous strategy\u2014it \u2019 s the predominant strategy\u2014but it imploded along with Rubio at the worst possible time .\nRemember , Rubio \u2019 s debate malfunction happened right before the New Hampshire primary , and it might have dropped him from second to fifth . If he had finished second , he might have emerged as the dominant alternative to Trump and Cruz , knocking out Bush and John Kasich before South Carolina . And then , well , who knows ? It \u2019 s not crazy to think that he could have united the party . Politicians always look hapless after they lose , and their campaigns are inevitably portrayed as hopelessly misguided exercises in dysfunction , but 16 of the 17 Republican candidates had to lose , and Rubio almost didn \u2019 t . His strategy of mouthing platitudes about the future while letting his rivals challenge Trump , like a kid hiding in the back of a gym-class dodgeball game , would have seemed brilliant if it worked .\nOK , OK , it didn \u2019 t work . Republican non-elites didn \u2019 t want a personable conservative who could have made Clinton look like yesterday \u2019 s news ; they apparently want a xenophobic salesman who says he can make everything great again . Polls suggest that Trump would fare much worse than Rubio in a head-to-head matchup with Clinton , but his voters don \u2019 t believe polls any more than they believe Beltway establishment types .\nPeople often assume I \u2019 m a Rubio fan because of the Time cover , but I \u2019 ve never shared his right-wing domestic policies or neoconservative foreign policies ; I \u2019 ve written about how his party has lost touch with reality in the Obama era , and I think he reflects his party 's drift . I remember shortly after the profile ran , he invited me to talk to his class about my Everglades book ; as we walked back to the parking lot , he made it pretty clear that he was ignorant about climate change and intended to stay that way . ( He did ask me to put him in touch with some experts on energy efficiency , which felt a bit awkward , but maybe I should have done it . ) That said , I still think he \u2019 s a major political talent with genuinely humble roots and an incredibly compelling story . And if Trump loses to Clinton in a landslide , with overwhelming margins among Hispanics , it \u2019 s not implausible to think that Rubio \u2019 s name will resurface in 2020 .\nThis year , he wasn \u2019 t a savior . The larger question is whether Republicans even want to be saved .",
