    "content": "Trump motioned to the gallery of magazine covers on the wall next to him , which included an issue of Playboy from 1990 ( \u2018 \u2018 And that \u2019 s when it was really Playboy \u2019 \u2019 ) and another of Trump on the front of The New York Times Magazine in 1984 . \u2018 \u2018 I \u2019 ve had much more than 15 minutes of fame , that \u2019 s for sure , \u2019 \u2019 he said . Trump can be hyper-\u00adsolicitous of the press . His orbit is largely free of handlers and is very much his own production , down to his tweets \u2014 which he types or dictates himself . I asked Trump if his campaign conducted focus groups . I knew what his answer would be but asked anyway . \u2018 \u2018 I do focus groups , \u2019 \u2019 he said , pressing both thumbs against his forehead , \u2018 \u2018 right here . \u2019 \u2019\nGetting close to Trump is nothing like the teeth-\u00adpulling exercise that it can be to get any meaningful exposure to a candidate like , say , Hillary Clinton . This is a seductive departure in general for political reporters accustomed to being ignored , patronized and offered sound bites to a point of lobotomy by typical politicians and the human straitjackets that surround them . In general , Trump understands and appreciates that reporters like to be given the time of day . It \u2019 s symbiotic in his case because he does in fact pay obsessive attention to what is said and written and tweeted about him . Trump is always saying that so-and-so TV pundit \u2018 \u2018 spoke very nicely \u2019 \u2019 about him on some morning show and that some other writer \u2018 \u2018 who used to kill me \u2019 \u2019 has now come around to \u2018 \u2018 loving me. \u2019 \u2019 There is a \u2018 \u2018 Truman Show \u2019 \u2019 aspect to this , except Trump is the director \u2014 continually selling , narrating and spinning his story while he lives it .\nWith me , Trump toggled often between on and off the record , one of which seemed only marginally more sensitive than the other , but with enough difference to indicate that he is capable of calculating from word to word and knowing where certain lines are . At one point , Trump declared himself to be \u2018 \u2018 semi off the record \u2019 \u2019 ( it wasn \u2019 t that interesting , or even semi-\u00adinteresting ) . He kept browbeating me to \u2018 \u2018 write fairly \u2019 \u2019 about him , meaning that I should do a full and proper rendering of the Trump Phenomenon \u2014 the full degree to which it is , as he so often says , yooooge . Otherwise it would be \u2018 \u2018 disgusting , \u2019 \u2019 as it was recently when a reporter described a \u2018 \u2018 smattering of applause \u2019 \u2019 that he received at an event in Iowa , when in fact it was much more than a \u2018 \u2018 smattering \u2019 \u2019 \u2014 trust him . \u2018 \u2018 I don \u2019 t do smatterings , \u2019 \u2019 he said , spitting out the word .\nAs I surveyed the magazine covers on the wall and endured his running boasts , I wondered aloud whether Americans might not prefer a more humble brand of chief executive , feigned or otherwise . \u2018 \u2018 Nope , \u2019 \u2019 he sneered . \u2018 \u2018 They want success . They wanted humility in the past . They wanted a nice person \u2019 \u2019 ( for the record , he added , \u2018 \u2018 I am a nice person \u2019 \u2019 ) . But what they really want is someone who can win , as Trump always does . \u2018 \u2018 We \u2019 re going to have so many victories , you will be bored of winning . \u2019 \u2019\nI asked whether he had ever experienced self-doubt . The question seemed to catch Trump off guard , and he flashed a split second of , if not vulnerability , maybe non\u00adswagger . \u2018 \u2018 Yes , I think more than people would think , \u2019 \u2019 he told me . When ? \u2018 \u2018 I don \u2019 t want to talk about it. \u2019 \u2019 He shrug-\u00adsmirked . \u2018 \u2018 Because , you know \u2014 probably more than people would think . I understand how life can go . Things can happen. \u2019 \u2019 This was a rare moment when Trump \u2019 s voice trailed off , even slightly . He then handed me a sheet of new polling data that someone had put on his desk . \u2018 \u2018 Beautiful numbers , \u2019 \u2019 he said , inviting me to take them with me .\nA curious feature of the mob scene that has surrounded Trump at most public events since August is that people keep handing him money to sign .

One building security guard described the commotion to me as \u2018 \u2018 Justin Bieber level. \u2019 \u2019 It consisted heavily of tourists and foreign visitors , many of them young .
