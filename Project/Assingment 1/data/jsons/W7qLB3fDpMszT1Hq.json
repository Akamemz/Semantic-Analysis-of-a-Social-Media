    "content": "In Utah , the governor lifted a statewide lockdown on elective procedures before his medical supply team had finished estimating how quickly hospitals would exhaust their supply of personal protective equipment , according to members of the state \u2019 s response team .\nAnd plans to ease restrictions on economic activity and public assembly in Tennessee have been met by dread among emergency management officials , who are in \u201c complete disbelief that we are reopening the state , \u201d according to a person involved in the planning who , like others , spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional retribution .\nIn these states , among the fastest to jump-start their idle economies , plans are proceeding without the full approval of medical professionals and emergency response officials closest to the ground-level unfolding of the outbreak , which has claimed nearly 50,000 lives in the United States . The quest by certain governors to reopen by May 1 \u2014 the date favored by President Trump \u2014 has blindsided some of the officials advising them .\nKemp , for example , did not seek consensus among the doctors on his task force before proceeding with his reopening plan , according to one of its members , Andrew Reisman , who is president of the Medical Association of Georgia .\nKemp and other governors pursuing aggressive reopening plans say they are following data-driven strategies in line with White House guidelines that make a downward trajectory of new cases in a 14-day period a condition of a phased reopening .\n\u201c Our next measured step is driven by data and guided by state public health officials , \u201d Kemp said this week when Trump , after initially cheering efforts to end lockdowns before May 1 , second-guessed Georgia \u2019 s approach . The governor \u2019 s office did not respond to a request for comment .\nThe apparent rush in Georgia and other states has alarmed some local leaders , who fear political considerations are overriding detailed assessments of the data .\n\u201c I have great concerns about federal and some state pressure to reopen the economy without the guidance of the public-health data , \u201d said Erin Mendenhall , the Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City . \u201c No one doubts the gravity of this economic crisis , but the cost of human life is also grave . \u201d\nShe added : \u201c I think politics permeates crisis . And this crisis we are in is not exempt from that . \u201d\nReisman said Kemp \u2019 s physician task force had grown less active following an initial burst of activity about two weeks ago . Its chairman , Republican state Sen. Ben Watson , who is a physician , emphasized that the state \u2019 s stay-at-home order continues through the end of the month and until May 13 for vulnerable populations .\nEpidemiologists said the Trump administration \u2019 s guidelines are so vague as to sanction potentially any strategy , no matter how hasty .\nIn Tennessee , Republican Gov . Bill Lee this week hailed a \u201c steady decline in the growth rate \u201d of new cases , explaining why he would begin a phased reopening May 1 .\nBut arriving at the state \u2019 s growth rate by dividing new cases by total cases is off the mark , said Joshua M. Epstein , an epidemiologist at New York University . And the calculation has also raised eyebrows internally , according to an official familiar with the state \u2019 s planning .\nAlong with metrics such as hospitalizations , states should simply be tracking new cases per day , Epstein said , and looking to see whether they are rising or falling .

Health officials in Shelby County , which includes Memphis , said the area would not be ready to reopen \u00adMay 1 . That view was shared by Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland ( D ) , whose city is home to the state \u2019 s largest African American community , which has been disproportionately affected by \u00adcovid-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus .\nSome local orders will also still stand in Colorado , where the governor , Jared Polis , is among the Democrats moving fastest to end statewide orders , saying Thursday he was counting on \u201c personal responsibility \u201d when businesses gain permission to reopen at limited capacity Monday .\nPolis also contradicted his own \u00adcovid-19 incident commander , Scott Bookman , who just days earlier had told reporters the state would not reopen \u201c until we have the capacity to make everyone safe. \u201d By that metric , Polis said , \u201c we would have to be closed forever . \u201d\nAsked for input on the governor \u2019 s plan last week , Colorado \u2019 s association of local public health agencies drafted guidance that the reopening should not start until all symptomatic people can be tested and all cases monitored .\nDenver Mayor Michael Hancock ( D ) said restrictions in his city could last longer , warning , \u201c This will be a different summer for those of us here in Denver . \u201d\nIn Georgia and South Carolina , by contrast , statewide directives lifting restrictions on businesses preempt local orders , incensing mayors of some hard-hit cities .
