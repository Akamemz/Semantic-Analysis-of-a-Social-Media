Giacalone , 55 , says Donahue molested him at the age of 12 at his East Boston parish . ( Kayana Szymczak for \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nUntil recently , only a few dozen bishops had released lists of priests with credible allegations against them . Many did so only when compelled by courts , as a condition of bankruptcy proceedings .\nThat changed after August 2018 , when the Pennsylvania attorney general , Josh Shapiro , published a 900-page grand jury report detailing not only abuse but a systematic cover-up by church leaders throughout the state . The report came just weeks after the resignation of then- Cardinal Theodore McCarrick , the former archbishop of Washington , D.C. , and one of the highest ranking Catholic leaders ever felled by abuse allegations .\n\u201c The overall feel was like 2002 happening all over again , \u201d Kevin Eckery , a Diocese of San Diego senior administrator , said , referring to the intense scrutiny that followed a Pulitzer Prize-winning Boston Globe investigation into sexual abuse by priests . \u201c You could see that there was a need for a response that was about action and not a response that was about more words . \u201d\nMany of the 178 dioceses that have released new or updated lists of accused clergy since last year have cited the Pennsylvania grand jury report as a reason for doing so .\nStill , without a consensus among church leaders on what constitutes a credible accusation , bishops have used vastly different standards to determine who should be named .\nThe Archdiocese of Seattle , which released its list prior to the grand jury report , began by dividing allegations into three categories : cases in which priests admitted the allegations or where allegations were \u201c established \u201d by reports from multiple victims ; cases that clearly could not have happened ; and cases that fell into a gray area , like those that were never fully investigated at the time they were reported . The archdiocese decided it would name priests whose cases fell into the first category and leave out the second group , but it sought additional guidance on the third set of cases .\n\u201c There \u2019 s the question of who determines it to be credible , \u201d said Mary Santi , the chancellor and chief of staff for the Archdiocese of Seattle . \u201c We decided that we couldn \u2019 t be the determiners of that . \u201d\nThe Seattle Archdiocese brought in McChesney to help choose which names to disclose . Dozens of dioceses have turned to outside advisers , hiring former judges , former local law enforcement agents and law firms while others relied on internal review boards , composed of mostly non-clergy members .\nUltimately , dioceses have set different limits on what to publish . The Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas disclosed the names of priests even in cases in which officials could not substantiate the allegations themselves . In New Hampshire , the Diocese of Manchester \u2019 s bishop also opted for greater transparency than most , disclosing clergy members who were currently under investigation and who had died before an inquiry was complete .\nOther jurisdictions , however , drew tighter lines , sometimes based on idiosyncratic criteria . In Nebraska , the Archdiocese of Omaha leaves out names of seminarians with \u201c substantiated \u201d allegations of abuse against minors . In Ohio , the Diocese of Toledo did not identify priests who died before a victim came forward because they \u201c posed no threat , \u201d the diocese \u2019 s website explained .\nSNAP leaders have pushed the diocese to publish those names , so far to no avail . \u201c Their lack of transparency is devastating to those left in their wake , \u201d Claudia Vercellotti , a SNAP leader in Toledo , said . \u201c It defies logic that even when the church leader is dead , they are still protecting them over offering healing and transparency to the victims . \u201d\nMany dioceses have chosen not to include members of religious orders , such as the Jesuits , who have been accused of abuse . Religious order members , who make up 30 % of U.S. priests , are taught and ordained within those orders , but they often spend much of their time working in the parishes and schools of local dioceses .\nThe Archdiocese of Milwaukee , at the direction of its court-appointed bankruptcy committee , discloses extensive information about each accused priest it names , including timelines of their careers and documentation of when and where they abused their victims .\nBut it leaves out religious order priests and priests who died before victims reported the abuse . Names of the deceased are only added if enough victims come forward to \u201c show a trend , \u201d though the archdiocese does not define how many allegations that would require .\nJerry Topczewski , chief of staff for Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki , said there \u2019 s room for debate over which accused clergy members should be named , but each diocese has to draw the line somewhere .\n\u201c At some point you have to make a decision , \u201d Topczewski said . \u201c Someone \u2019 s always going to say your list isn \u2019 t good enough , which we have people say , \u2018 Your list is incomplete. \u2019 Well , I only control the list I can control and that \u2019 s diocesan priests . \u201d\nJerry Topczewski , chief of staff for Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki . ( Darren Hauck , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nIt \u2019 s impossible to know how many accused clergy members dioceses have opted not to put on their lists .\nBishop Accountability applies different standards for inclusion on its list than church leaders , tracking public accusations against nuns and other clergy members often left off the official rolls .\nAs a result , there are sometimes substantial gaps between the group \u2019 s tallies and those of dioceses .\nThe Archdiocese of Boston currently lists 171 names . Bishop Accountability lists 279 , including dozens of religious order priests omitted from the official list as well as several priests who died before victims came forward .\n\u201c For every person who \u2019 s left off a list , bishops ought to be aware that they are retraumatizing survivors and doubling the insult and doubling the pain , \u201d Terence McKiernan , the founder of Bishop Accountability , said .\nOver his 40-year career , Alfredo Prado was accused of abusing children repeatedly , in nearly every corner of Texas where he was assigned by his order , the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate .\nToday , he \u2019 s named on six separate diocesan lists of credibly accused priests . Yet each jurisdiction gives different information about him , making it difficult to piece together the arc of his career , the totality of his wrongdoing or what became of him .\nThe year Prado was ordained is shown on one list as 1958 and on two lists as 1957 . The Diocese of San Angelo and the Diocese of Victoria refer to him as \u201c Alfred \u201d rather than \u201c Alfredo. \u201d San Antonio is the only diocese that discloses the total number of children he was accused of abusing within its jurisdiction , five .\nHis status is also characterized differently from one diocese to another . He \u2019 s described as suspended by the Diocese of Corpus Christi , dismissed from his religious order and the clerical state by the Archdiocese of San Antonio , and laicized ( or returned to the lay state ) by the Diocese of San Angelo . The Diocese of Amarillo adds that he fled to Costa Rica , but it doesn \u2019 t say when ( according to news reports , it was in the early 2000s ) . The Diocese of San Angelo says Prado died , but doesn \u2019 t list the year . Only the Diocese of Victoria provides a complete bio for Prado , noting each time his status changed , though the list does not confirm he \u2019 s dead .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 contacted Prado \u2019 s order , which has not released its own list ; an administrator said the order did not know if Prado was alive or dead .\nThe Several Variations of Alfredo Prado Details published by dioceses about Alfredo Prado , a former priest accused of sexual abuse , are inconsistent among the six that listed him . Loading ...\nPrado \u2019 s story is a striking example of inconsistencies in the information that bishops disclose about accused clergy members . Perhaps most remarkable is that it happened in Texas , where church leaders have made an effort to coordinate their releases . Nationally , the disparities in disclosures are even more pronounced .\nThe Range of Disclosure Lists posted by the Diocese of Sacramento , California , the Diocese of Ogdensburg , New York , and the Diocese of San Bernardino , California , show varied levels of information . Allen Tan/\u2588\u2588\u2588\nAt one end is the Diocese of Sacramento in California , which issues a release on each credibly accused clergy member , outlining identifying information that helps distinguish one priest from another such as their ordination dates , seminaries , birthdays and every place they served within the diocese . Leaders also disclose each accusation submitted against the clergy member , including the year it was reported , the nature of the abuse and the victim \u2019 s age and gender .\nThe Diocese of Ogdensburg in upstate New York is at the other end of the spectrum . Its list provides the first and last name of accused priests , with hardly any additional information .\nMost disclosures fall somewhere in between . The Diocese of San Bernardino in California , for example , outlines each clergy members \u2019 current status in the church , the assignments they held within the diocese , the dates of abuse and when the diocese reported the incident to law enforcement .\nDioceses consistently label clergy who have died as \u201c deceased , \u201d which accounts for about half of the priests in \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s database . Jurisdictions are far less uniform in giving information about living members \u2019 current locations or standing in the church . Over 700 clergy members \u2019 status isn \u2019 t given or is marked as \u201c unknown . \u201d\nDetails about credibly accused priests \u2019 abuse are scarce . Church leaders have disclosed the number of allegations made against roughly 10 % of the clergy members they \u2019 ve named , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 data analysis .\nIn the early 2000s , dioceses across the country filled out detailed surveys compiled by researchers at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice for the first-ever nationwide study of sexual abuse by clergy . The USCCB mandated the study as one of the new safety initiatives outlined in the 2002 Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People . Dioceses have continued reporting new allegations annually to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University .\nTwo John Jay researchers who helped diocesan employees fill out the initial surveys say that sometimes the lack of details about abuse by priests stems from sparse recordkeeping or different ways of defining abuse , especially when it comes to older allegations .\n\u201c It was thought about differently , so it was recorded differently than it would be today , \u201d one of the researchers , Karen Terry , said .\nStill , dioceses have other information that they often do not disclose , including schools or parishes clergy members were assigned to while serving in a diocese .\nA map at the headquarters of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee shows its 10 counties , churches and schools . ( Darren Hauck , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nMcChesney , whose firm , Kinsale Management Consulting , has worked with a few dozen dioceses and religious orders on their disclosures over more than a decade , says dioceses typically keep thorough records of who is serving and when .\n\u201c If you want to find out if somebody was baptized in 1889 in La Crosse , Wisconsin , you can find that , \u201d she said .\nDisclosing those details can help survivors , especially those who were young at the time of their abuse , to distinguish between clergy with common or similar names , McChesney said .\nOnly about 58 % of the clergy members listed have information about what parishes or schools they served in . Often , the assignment histories provided by dioceses list only a priest \u2019 s appointments within that diocese , not where they worked or what positions they held over the rest of their careers .\n\u201c It \u2019 s so simple , \u201d McChesney said . \u201c All it takes is a good research look and frankly , if you look sometimes at websites of dioceses and universities in the area , you can put that together . \u201d\nMary Gautier , a senior research associate at the Georgetown center , said smaller dioceses with limited budgets don \u2019 t always have the money or staff to dig through their archives .\n\u201c One thing that the church is very good at is recordkeeping ... but it \u2019 s very , very time consuming and labor intensive to really go through years and years and years of personnel records and track all this out , \u201d Gautier said . \u201c And I mean doing hand searches . There \u2019 s none of this computerized , of course . \u201d\nAfter his years in Boston , Donahue spent much of the last 20 years of his career serving in Honduras , where he established and ran schools funded by his organization , the Olancho Aid Foundation . He was back in the United States for medical care in 2015 when he was informed of the first of two abuse allegations made against him . The second accusation , by Giacalone , came in 2017 .\nIn the interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Donahue denied both men \u2019 s allegations and said he assumed his accusers had confused him with someone else or were looking for a payoff from the church . One accuser says he was abused for several years , up until 1981 , but Donahue noted that in 1980 , he moved to another assignment , elsewhere in Massachusetts .\n\u201c I never met either one of them , \u201d Donahue said in the interview at his house in Cape Cod . \u201c From a faith perspective , I \u2019 m trying to think there \u2019 s a reason I \u2019 ve gone through this cross , for the last three years , with these false allegations . Why me ? I don \u2019 t know . \u201d\nAfter the first abuse allegation , in 2015 , Donahue was prohibited by the archdiocese from participating in public ministry or entering parish or school property and was barred from returning to his work in Honduras .\nThe accuser who came forward in 2015 , also represented by Garabedian , has submitted a claim through the archdiocese \u2019 s compensation program and is waiting for the church to decide if the claim is credible , Garabedian said .\nGiacalone says the sexual abuse he endured as a child has colored his life . ( Kayana Szymczak for \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nGiacalone , now 55 , says Donahue \u2019 s abuse led to decades of rage , alcoholism and drug use . He said he started drinking the day Donahue touched him . \u201c What was I going to turn to ? \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I thought I \u2019 d get relief . The first couple times , yeah , it helped me forget . But getting stinking drunk doesn \u2019 t really do anything for you . \u201d\nGiacalone said that he was held back in school and dropped out at one point , and that he had trouble holding down work and had run-ins with the police from an early age . In December 2010 , he faced assault charges after his wife told police he had threatened and pushed her ; the charges were dropped after she refused to go forward with a case .\nHe doesn \u2019 t blame the dispute with his wife or other low points in his life directly on his sexual abuse , but says it colored everything that followed . \u201c It all stems , mostly , from that incident , \u201d he said .\nWhen a reporter told Giacalone that the Boston Archdiocese had found his accusation against Donahue to be \u201c unsubstantiated , \u201d even after the decision that Giacalone had to be compensated , he shook his head .\n\u201c I feel bad for their parishioners , \u201d he said . \u201c They are living a lie too . \u201d",

The organization\u2019s list includes more than 450 names connected to dioceses that have not released disclosures.\n\nThe Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, an advocacy organization for victims of clergy abuse, has pushed dioceses to identify known abusers and turn over records on them for decades. This process has finally begun, but the church\u2019s obdurate culture of concealment remains, said David Clohessy, who led the group for nearly 30 years.\n\n\u201cThey continue to be as secretive as possible, parceling out the least amount of information possible and only under great duress,\u201d Clohessy said. \u201cThey are absolute masters at hairsplitting \u2014 always have been and still are.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we now know the names of more predator priests than before? Yes, of course. Are we anywhere near full transparency? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nLarry Giacalone at his home. Giacalone, 55, says Donahue molested him at the age of 12 at his East Boston parish. (Kayana Szymczak for ProPublica)\n\nA Lack of Standards\n\nUntil recently, only a few dozen bishops had released lists of priests with credible allegations against them. Many did so only when compelled by courts, as a condition of bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThat changed after August 2018, when the Pennsylvania attorney general, Josh Shapiro, published a 900-page grand jury report detailing not only abuse but a systematic cover-up by church leaders throughout the state. The report came just weeks after the resignation of then- Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., and one of the highest ranking Catholic leaders ever felled by abuse allegations.\n\n\u201cThe overall feel was like 2002 happening all over again,\u201d Kevin Eckery, a Diocese of San Diego senior administrator, said, referring to the intense scrutiny that followed a Pulitzer Prize-winning Boston Globe investigation into sexual abuse by priests. \u201cYou could see that there was a need for a response that was about action and not a response that was about more words.\u201d\n\nMany of the 178 dioceses that have released new or updated lists of accused clergy since last year have cited the Pennsylvania grand jury report as a reason for doing so.\n\nPennsylvania Grand Jury Report Spurs New Disclosures Loading...\n\nStill, without a consensus among church leaders on what constitutes a credible accusation, bishops have used vastly different standards to determine who should be named.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Seattle, which released its list prior to the grand jury report, began by dividing allegations into three categories: cases in which priests admitted the allegations or where allegations were \u201cestablished\u201d by reports from multiple victims; cases that clearly could not have happened; and cases that fell into a gray area, like those that were never fully investigated at the time they were reported. The archdiocese decided it would name priests whose cases fell into the first category and leave out the second group, but it sought additional guidance on the third set of cases.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the question of who determines it to be credible,\u201d said Mary Santi, the chancellor and chief of staff for the Archdiocese of Seattle. \u201cWe decided that we couldn\u2019t be the determiners of that.\u201d\n\nThe Seattle Archdiocese brought in McChesney to help choose which names to disclose. Dozens of dioceses have turned to outside advisers, hiring former judges, former local law enforcement agents and law firms while others relied on internal review boards, composed of mostly non-clergy members.\n\nUltimately, dioceses have set different limits on what to publish. The Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas disclosed the names of priests even in cases in which officials could not substantiate the allegations themselves. In New Hampshire, the Diocese of Manchester\u2019s bishop also opted for greater transparency than most, disclosing clergy members who were currently under investigation and who had died before an inquiry was complete.\n\nOther jurisdictions, however, drew tighter lines, sometimes based on idiosyncratic criteria. In Nebraska, the Archdiocese of Omaha leaves out names of seminarians with \u201csubstantiated\u201d allegations of abuse against minors. In Ohio, the Diocese of Toledo did not identify priests who died before a victim came forward because they \u201cposed no threat,\u201d the diocese\u2019s website explained.\n\nSNAP leaders have pushed the diocese to publish those names, so far to no avail. \u201cTheir lack of transparency is devastating to those left in their wake,\u201d Claudia Vercellotti, a SNAP leader in Toledo, said. \u201cIt defies logic that even when the church leader is dead, they are still protecting them over offering healing and transparency to the victims.\u201d\n\nMany dioceses have chosen not to include members of religious orders, such as the Jesuits, who have been accused of abuse. Religious order members, who make up 30% of U.S. priests, are taught and ordained within those orders, but they often spend much of their time working in the parishes and schools of local dioceses.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Milwaukee, at the direction of its court-appointed bankruptcy committee, discloses extensive information about each accused priest it names, including timelines of their careers and documentation of when and where they abused their victims.\n\nBut it leaves out religious order priests and priests who died before victims reported the abuse. Names of the deceased are only added if enough victims come forward to \u201cshow a trend,\u201d though the archdiocese does not define how many allegations that would require.\n\nJerry Topczewski, chief of staff for Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki, said there\u2019s room for debate over which accused clergy members should be named, but each diocese has to draw the line somewhere.\n\n\u201cAt some point you have to make a decision,\u201d Topczewski said. \u201cSomeone\u2019s always going to say your list isn\u2019t good enough, which we have people say, \u2018Your list is incomplete.\u2019 Well, I only control the list I can control and that\u2019s diocesan priests.\u201d\n\nJerry Topczewski, chief of staff for Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki. (Darren Hauck, special to ProPublica)\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how many accused clergy members dioceses have opted not to put on their lists.\n\nBishop Accountability applies different standards for inclusion on its list than church leaders, tracking public accusations against nuns and other clergy members often left off the official rolls.\n\nAs a result, there are sometimes substantial gaps between the group\u2019s tallies and those of dioceses.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Boston currently lists 171 names. Bishop Accountability lists 279, including dozens of religious order priests omitted from the official list as well as several priests who died before victims came forward.\n\n\u201cFor every person who\u2019s left off a list, bishops ought to be aware that they are retraumatizing survivors and doubling the insult and doubling the pain,\u201d Terence McKiernan, the founder of Bishop Accountability, said.\n\nLost in the Archives\n\nOver his 40-year career, Alfredo Prado was accused of abusing children repeatedly, in nearly every corner of Texas where he was assigned by his order, the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate.\n\nToday, he\u2019s named on six separate diocesan lists of credibly accused priests. Yet each jurisdiction gives different information about him, making it difficult to piece together the arc of his career, the totality of his wrongdoing or what became of him.\n\nThe year Prado was ordained is shown on one list as 1958 and on two lists as 1957. The Diocese of San Angelo and the Diocese of Victoria refer to him as \u201cAlfred\u201d rather than \u201cAlfredo.\u201d San Antonio is the only diocese that discloses the total number of children he was accused of abusing within its jurisdiction, five.\n\nHis status is also characterized differently from one diocese to another. He\u2019s described as suspended by the Diocese of Corpus Christi, dismissed from his religious order and the clerical state by the Archdiocese of San Antonio, and laicized (or returned to the lay state) by the Diocese of San Angelo. The Diocese of Amarillo adds that he fled to Costa Rica, but it doesn\u2019t say when (according to news reports, it was in the early 2000s). The Diocese of San Angelo says Prado died, but doesn\u2019t list the year. Only the Diocese of Victoria provides a complete bio for Prado, noting each time his status changed, though the list does not confirm he\u2019s dead.\n\nProPublica contacted Prado\u2019s order, which has not released its own list; an administrator said the order did not know if Prado was alive or dead.\n\nThe Several Variations of Alfredo Prado Details published by dioceses about Alfredo Prado, a former priest accused of sexual abuse, are inconsistent among the six that listed him. Loading...\n\nPrado\u2019s story is a striking example of inconsistencies in the information that bishops disclose about accused clergy members. Perhaps most remarkable is that it happened in Texas, where church leaders have made an effort to coordinate their releases. Nationally, the disparities in disclosures are even more pronounced.\n\nThe Range of Disclosure Lists posted by the Diocese of Sacramento, California, the Diocese of Ogdensburg, New York, and the Diocese of San Bernardino, California, show varied levels of information. Allen Tan/ProPublica\n\nAt one end is the Diocese of Sacramento in California, which issues a release on each credibly accused clergy member, outlining identifying information that helps distinguish one priest from another such as their ordination dates, seminaries, birthdays and every place they served within the diocese. Leaders also disclose each accusation submitted against the clergy member, including the year it was reported, the nature of the abuse and the victim\u2019s age and gender.\n\nThe Diocese of Ogdensburg in upstate New York is at the other end of the spectrum. Its list provides the first and last name of accused priests, with hardly any additional information.\n\nMost disclosures fall somewhere in between. The Diocese of San Bernardino in California, for example, outlines each clergy members\u2019 current status in the church, the assignments they held within the diocese, the dates of abuse and when the diocese reported the incident to law enforcement.\n\nDioceses consistently label clergy who have died as \u201cdeceased,\u201d which accounts for about half of the priests in ProPublica\u2019s database. Jurisdictions are far less uniform in giving information about living members\u2019 current locations or standing in the church. Over 700 clergy members\u2019 status isn\u2019t given or is marked as \u201cunknown.\u201d\n\nDetails about credibly accused priests\u2019 abuse are scarce. Church leaders have disclosed the number of allegations made against roughly 10% of the clergy members they\u2019ve named, according to a ProPublica data analysis.\n\nIn the early 2000s, dioceses across the country filled out detailed surveys compiled by researchers at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice for the first-ever nationwide study of sexual abuse by clergy. The USCCB mandated the study as one of the new safety initiatives outlined in the 2002 Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People. Dioceses have continued reporting new allegations annually to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University.\n\nTwo John Jay researchers who helped diocesan employees fill out the initial surveys say that sometimes the lack of details about abuse by priests stems from sparse recordkeeping or different ways of defining abuse, especially when it comes to older allegations.\n\n\u201cIt was thought about differently, so it was recorded differently than it would be today,\u201d one of the researchers, Karen Terry, said.\n\nStill, dioceses have other information that they often do not disclose, including schools or parishes clergy members were assigned to while serving in a diocese.\n\nA map at the headquarters of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee shows its 10 counties, churches and schools. (Darren Hauck, special to ProPublica)\n\nMcChesney, whose firm, Kinsale Management Consulting, has worked with a few dozen dioceses and religious orders on their disclosures over more than a decade, says dioceses typically keep thorough records of who is serving and when.\n\n\u201cIf you want to find out if somebody was baptized in 1889 in La Crosse, Wisconsin, you can find that,\u201d she said.\n\nDisclosing those details can help survivors, especially those who were young at the time of their abuse, to distinguish between clergy with common or similar names, McChesney said.\n\nOnly about 58% of the clergy members listed have information about what parishes or schools they served in. Often, the assignment histories provided by dioceses list only a priest\u2019s appointments within that diocese, not where they worked or what positions they held over the rest of their careers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so simple,\u201d McChesney said. \u201cAll it takes is a good research look and frankly, if you look sometimes at websites of dioceses and universities in the area, you can put that together.\u201d\n\nMary Gautier, a senior research associate at the Georgetown center, said smaller dioceses with limited budgets don\u2019t always have the money or staff to dig through their archives.\n\n\u201cOne thing that the church is very good at is recordkeeping ... but it\u2019s very, very time consuming and labor intensive to really go through years and years and years of personnel records and track all this out,\u201d Gautier said. \u201cAnd I mean doing hand searches. There\u2019s none of this computerized, of course.\u201d\n\nDecades of Rage\n\nAfter his years in Boston, Donahue spent much of the last 20 years of his career serving in Honduras, where he established and ran schools funded by his organization, the Olancho Aid Foundation. He was back in the United States for medical care in 2015 when he was informed of the first of two abuse allegations made against him. The second accusation, by Giacalone, came in 2017.\n\nIn the interview with ProPublica, Donahue denied both men\u2019s allegations and said he assumed his accusers had confused him with someone else or were looking for a payoff from the church. One accuser says he was abused for several years, up until 1981, but Donahue noted that in 1980, he moved to another assignment, elsewhere in Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cI never met either one of them,\u201d Donahue said in the interview at his house in Cape Cod. \u201cFrom a faith perspective, I\u2019m trying to think there\u2019s a reason I\u2019ve gone through this cross, for the last three years, with these false allegations. Why me? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAfter the first abuse allegation, in 2015, Donahue was prohibited by the archdiocese from participating in public ministry or entering parish or school property and was barred from returning to his work in Honduras.\n\nThe accuser who came forward in 2015, also represented by Garabedian, has submitted a claim through the archdiocese\u2019s compensation program and is waiting for the church to decide if the claim is credible, Garabedian said.\n\nGiacalone says the sexual abuse he endured as a child has colored his life. (Kayana Szymczak for ProPublica)\n\nGiacalone, now 55, says Donahue\u2019s abuse led to decades of rage, alcoholism and drug use. He said he started drinking the day Donahue touched him. \u201cWhat was I going to turn to?\u201d he told ProPublica. \u201cI thought I\u2019d get relief. The first couple times, yeah, it helped me forget. But getting stinking drunk doesn\u2019t really do anything for you.\u201d\n\nGiacalone said that he was held back in school and dropped out at one point, and that he had trouble holding down work and had run-ins with the police from an early age. In December 2010, he faced assault charges after his wife told police he had threatened and pushed her; the charges were dropped after she refused to go forward with a case.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t blame the dispute with his wife or other low points in his life directly on his sexual abuse, but says it colored everything that followed. \u201cIt all stems, mostly, from that incident,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen a reporter told Giacalone that the Boston Archdiocese had found his accusation against Donahue to be \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d even after the decision that Giacalone had to be compensated, he shook his head.\n\n\u201cI feel bad for their parishioners,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are living a lie too.\u201d",
