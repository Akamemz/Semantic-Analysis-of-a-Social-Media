    "content": "President Obama assaulted the nation \u2019 s top court and seemed to criticize the U.S. legal system as a whole Monday , with the former constitutional law professor declaring that the Supreme Court was wrong to even accept a challenge to his signature health care reform law and deriding the fact that an \u201c individual district court judge \u201d was able to derail his deportation amnesty .\nThe president made the comments during a press conference in Krun , Germany , after the Group of Seven summit .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s legacy-building accomplishments are increasingly ending up in the federal court system .\nThe Supreme Court will decide by the end of next month whether the Affordable Care Act should be interpreted as prohibiting any tax credits for states that set up their own health care exchanges . If those credits are eliminated , many Obamacare customers will be unable to afford their coverage and the entire system could collapse .\nMr. Obama has long defended the legality of his namesake health care law , but he went further Monday by directly criticizing the Supreme Court for agreeing to hear the case .\n\u201c There is no reason why the existing exchanges should be overturned through a court case . It has been well-documented that those who passed this legislation never intended for folks who were going through the federal exchange not to have their citizens get subsidies , \u201d he said . \u201c This should be an easy case . Frankly , it shouldn \u2019 t have even been taken up .

He also scoffed at the notion that one ruling by one judge means his executive action is dead , and he vowed to press ahead to help illegal immigrants .\n\u201c Even if it \u2019 s an individual district court judge who is making this determination , we \u2019 ve got to go through the process to challenge it .
