    "content": "As he sensed the crowd flagging , Donald Trump switched gears to the all-important question of his re-election slogan . Should the insurgent turned incumbent stick with \u201c Make America great again \u201d ( Maga ) , which he characterised as \u201c probably and possibly the greatest theme in the history of politics \u201d ? Or should he switch to \u201c Keep America great \u201d ?\nTrump repeats contested claim he does not know latest sexual assault accuser Read more\nIt was the latter that that turned the stadium into a cauldron of noise .\n\u201c Ah , I \u2019 m sorry , Maga Country , but that wasn \u2019 t too close , \u201d the president said on Tuesday night . \u201c I thought you had it won , and then I heard this cheer . My eardrums will never been the same . Keep America great . \u201d\nThis week it will be the Democrats \u2019 turn to search for a magic sentence . Twenty candidates , each vying to make Trump the first one-term president since George HW Bush , will line up over two nights for the party \u2019 s first primary debates in Miami . All will be keen to avoid a campaign-ending gaffe ; all will be keen to deliver a \u201c zinger \u201d that goes viral and can rival the potency of \u201c Make America great again \u201d .\nAmong the oldest candidates in the field is Joe Biden , 76 , whose pitch has been described by sceptics as \u201c Make America 2016 again \u201d \u2013 a restoration of the Obama presidency , when Biden served as deputy . But the youngest contender , Pete Buttigieg , the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend , Indiana , has stressed the need to look forwardly , saying pointedly : \u201c There is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the word \u2018 again \u2019 . \u201d\nWith \u2018 Keep America great \u2019 the important point is silent : it means keep America great for straight white men Neil Sroka\nNeil Sroka , a spokesperson for the progressive group Democracy for America , said : \u201c \u2018 Make America great again \u2019 was clear and very much in line with the bigotry that underlay both the Trump campaign and administration . The slogan did something Trump is unable to to do : keep the loud part quiet and keep the quiet part loud . With \u2018 Keep America great \u2019 the important point is silent : it means keep America great for straight white men .\n\u201c The key for Democrats is to articulate a bold , inclusive people \u2019 s vision of the country that is easy for people to understand and is as effective as \u2018 Make America great again \u2019 in that is says something quietly \u2013 that is , it \u2019 s for all of us . We \u2019 re going to need everyone to beat the kind of hate-filled campaign Trump is going to run . \u201d\nThe first Democrat to enter the race was former congressman John Delaney , nearly two years ago . Other candidates have been campaigning and fundraising for months . But for millions of Americans , this week \u2019 s debates will fire the starting gun in earnest . The line-up is historically diverse , including six women , six people of colour and a gay man .\nDemocratic voters are wrestling with myriad push and pull factors . Is Trump such a uniquely awful singularity that the party should play safe and stay in the centre ? Can they contemplate nominating yet another ageing white male ? Is this election about turning out the base or reaching out to independents and disaffected Republicans ? Or has Trump changed everything ?\nThe candidates \u2019 podium positions will reflect their standings in polls as of 12 June . Elizabeth Warren and former congressman Beto O \u2019 Rourke of Texas will be centre stage on the first night , giving Warren , who has been surging , a real chance to shine . On night two , Biden and Bernie Sanders will be in the middle , flanked by rivals including Buttigieg and Kamala Harris .\nIt will be a particular test for Biden , whose runs for president in 1988 and 2008 crashed and burned and who has been described as a \u201c gaffe machine \u201d . Last week , for example , he recalled the \u201c civility \u201d of racial segregationists he worked with in the Senate . \u201c He never called me \u2018 boy , \u2019 he always called me \u2018 son \u2019 , \u201d he said of one of them , citing a racist term and earning a sharp rebuke from other candidates .\nJames Clyburn , who is African American and the majority whip in the House of Representatives , said on Friday : \u201c It was an unforced error that hopefully he won \u2019 t make too many of . But like in any tennis match , one unforced error , even two unforced errors , would not necessarily lose the match . Biden was just talking about his ability to go outside of his comfort zone and maybe get a little bit too comfortable saying that . \u201d\nClyburn has been described as the \u201c kingmaker \u201d in South Carolina , the first southern state to vote . \u201c Just from the reports I \u2019 m getting , people are telling me that Biden is performing exceptionally well , \u201d he said . \u201c He has a tremendous reservoir of goodwill here in the state. \u201d But Biden has to be \u201c at the top of his game \u201d in the debates , he added .\nIndeed , Biden will be the primary target for his fellow debaters . Henry Olsen , a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington , said : \u201c He \u2019 s a 76-year-old taking incoming from his left , right and centre for two hours under hot television lights . He \u2019 s not had that for 20 years . All it takes is one tired moment at 10.35pm and that \u2019 s the story . There \u2019 a s high possibility of it happening . \u201d\nA recent CBS News poll found that the ability to beat Trump is the most important consideration for Democratic voters ( 78 % ) , ahead of new policy ideas ( 40 % ) and changing Washington ( 31 % ) . During the debates , Trump will loom large .\nOlsen said : \u201c The ideal Democrat will have the personality where Trump \u2019 s attacks would seem crazy or just bounce off . Biden \u2019 s isn \u2019 t that . Amy Klobuchar would be that sort of person . Cory Booker could be .\n\u201c The Democratic base can only get you so far . To win , you have to do well among disaffected suburban Republicans and blue-collar former Democrats . Ideally , you would not want a strongly progressive platform because that gives Trump something to run against . You want something like the 2018 midterms campaign : House Democrats ran on bland , vanilla issues and won . But I don \u2019 t know if the progressive wing is willing to let them do that . \u201d\nEver since John F Kennedy outshone a clammy and unshaven Richard Nixon , whose pale suit fared poorly on black and white television in 1960 , election campaign debates have also been about charisma and dominating the small screen \u2013 a place where Trump feels at home .\nAaron Kall , director of debate at the University of Michigan , said : \u201c Viewers do think about that : who could hold their own on a debate stage with President Trump ? Biden , given his stature , gravitas and experience as vice-president , would be able to hold it , but he definitely doesn \u2019 t have the star quality . If there \u2019 s anyone with that \u2018 it factor \u2019 quality , I would say it \u2019 s Buttigieg . \u201d\nTrump 's not all that comfortable with good news . He is much happier on the attack with a clearly identified foe Bill Galston\nBut he added : \u201c None of them has the star power of Trump or is going to get 20,000 people at a rally . \u201d\nThat is what the president pulled off last week in Orlando , Florida . Democrats will also struggle to match the sheer razzamatazz of a Trump rally , a now familiar blend of rock concert , sports fixture , political pantomime and , in the view of critics , a bath in in rancid nostalgia .\nJust as the \u201c Make America great again \u201d slogan is widely seen as harking back to the 1950s \u2013 a nation of idyllic suburbia for white people and Jim Crow laws for African Americans \u2013 so the soundtrack of Trump rallies is full of booming golden oldies with resonant lines . On Tuesday there was the Rolling Stones , Luciano Pavarotti ( Nessun dorma , or \u201c None shall sleep \u201d ) , Frank Sinatra ( My Way ) , the musical Cats ( Memory ) and Queen , whose song We are the Champions contains the Trumpian lyric : \u201c No time for losers . \u201d\nEqually fitting , the rally was held in a sports stadium and served up a matchday blend of fun , menace and tribalism : fans wearing team colours , performing the Mexican wave , cheering their team and booing the opposition . When the crowd hollered \u201c Lock her up ! \u201d about Hillary Clinton , Trump \u2019 s 2016 opponent , it was like the muscle memory of football fans chanting about a long retired player . \u201c Build that wall ! \u201d is an evergreen favourite too .\nAnd Trump himself peddled nostalgia , not only for an America that never was , but for the alleged glories of 2016 . His rambling speech of nearly an hour and half recycled the same old populist themes , tropes and falsehoods , from Clinton-bashing to fearmongering about immigration , and offered few policy proposals .\nWhen Trump stayed on script and touted his accomplishments ( economic growth , low unemployment , conservative judges ) , he seemed a little flat and the crowd felt it , but when he aired grievances ( \u201c We went through the biggest witch hunt in political history \u201d ) and went on the attack against the media ( \u201c That is a lot of fake news back there \u201d ) , he became fired up , an ageing rocker playing his greatest hits .\nDemocrats are \u201c a radical leftwing mob \u201d , Trump said . \u201c A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism , and the destruction of the American dream \u2026 This election is not merely a verdict on the amazing progress we \u2019 ve made . It \u2019 s a verdict on the un-American conduct of those who try to undermine our great democracy and undermine you . \u201d\nHis base , which was overwhelmingly white , lapped it up as they wore T-shirts that included the legends \u201c Make liberals cry again \u201d and \u201c Fuck your feelings \u201d .\nBill Galston , a former adviser to President Bill Clinton , said : \u201c Trump \u2019 s not all that comfortable with good news . He is much happier on the attack with a clearly identified foe at the tip of his spear . That is his default mode . He defines himself against adversaries and gets strength from an oppositional stance . The core of his support are for him because he shares their antipathies . He \u2019 s the only leader in their lifetime who has given full , unabashed voice to those antipathies . \u201d\nPart of the Democratic base can only be satisfied by the most radical brand . They \u2019 re all leftwing loonies Tom Tancredo\nAsked how a Democrat can combat the upcoming tidal wave of hate and mendacity , Galston , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington , said : \u201c Mr Trump \u2019 s principal weakness is himself . The issue in 2020 is going to be at least as much his character and conduct as president as it will be about substantive differences . \u201d\nDemocrats \u2019 central theme , he suggested , could be an echo of George W Bush \u2019 s pledge to \u201c restore honor and dignity \u201d after the scandals of the Clinton years .\nThere is no doubt Trump faces an uphill struggle . He is the only president in the history of Gallup polling never to crack 50 % approval . Yet he made fools of the pundits and pollsters last time , in the electoral college at least , and last week \u2019 s rally was a formidable show of strength from his base . Trump raised $ 24.8m in less than 24 hours \u2013 far more than any Democrat .\nTom Tancredo , a former Republican congressman from Colorado , predicted : \u201c I believe he will win and he will win fairly handily . Part of the Democratic base can only be satisfied by the most radical brand . They \u2019 re all leftwing loonies but some are more loony than others . Biden is probably the least loony but , because of that , I think he \u2019 ll have almost no chance of making it . \u201d\nThe Orlando rally made clear that Trump will redouble his efforts to mobilise core support and make little effort to claim to govern for all Americans . All the signs point to 2020 being a repeat of 2016 but even more nasty , brutish and long , less \u201c Keep America great \u201d than \u201c Hello darkness , my old friend \u201d .\nDemocrats are anxious to go high and find a candidate who , like Bill Clinton or Obama , whips up huge enthusiasm . The debates will offer a glimpse of alternative futures .\nSroka said : \u201c You \u2019 ll see people ask not just for an alternative to Trump but what kind of country do we want to live in after Trump ? Do we want to live in a country that retains the policies that contributed to the rise of Trump or one that deals with the preconditions that allowed it to happen ? \u201d",
