They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter .\nThursday 's dam seizure was the latest in a string of victories by the Sunni radical group as it expands its hold in northern Iraq , driving back Kurdish forces , sending minority communities fleeing and unleashing bombings that have killed more than 90 people in the capital over the past two days .\nAfter a week of attempts , the radical Islamist gunmen successfully stormed the Mosul Dam Thursday and forced Kurdish forces to withdraw from the area , residents living near the dam told The Associated Press . They spoke on condition of anonymity due to safety concerns .\nThe Al Qaeda breakaway group posted a statement online Thursday , confirming it had taken control of the dam and vowing to continue `` the march in all directions , '' as it expands the Islamic state , or Caliphate , it has imposed over broad swathes of territory straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border . The group said it has seized a total of 17 Iraqi cities , towns and targets \u2014 including the dam and a military base \u2014 over the past five days . The statement could not be verified but it was posted on a site frequently used by the group .\nHalgurd Hekmat , a spokesman for the Kurdish fighters , told the AP that clashes around the dam were ongoing and he did n't know who currently had control over it .\nThe Sunni militant group has established its idea of an Islamic state in the territory it controls in Iraq and Syria , imposing its harsh interpretation of Islamic law .

On Monday , Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki ordered the Iraqi air force to provide aerial support for the Kurds , in a rare show of cooperation between Baghdad and the Kurdish regional government that underscored the serious nature of the crisis .\nThe seizing of dams and reservoirs gives the militants control over water and electricity that they can use to help build support in the territory they now rule by providing the scarce resources to residents .
