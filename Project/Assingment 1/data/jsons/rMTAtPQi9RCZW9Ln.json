    "content": "The big news in conservative media land over the past couple of weeks has been a series of undercover \u201c sting \u201d videos released by a shady antiabortion rights activist group claiming to show that Planned Parenthood sells tissues procured from aborted fetuses . As is nearly always the case with videos such as these , they \u2019 re edited to make them look far worse than they actually are . Planned Parenthood maintains that any money it receives for procuring those tissues \u2013 which have long been used in medical research \u2013 is just reimbursement for the costs associated with the procedures . None of the videos that have been released actually show Planned Parenthood doing anything illegal , but they do show representatives of the organization speaking somewhat cavalierly about a grim topic . Many of the people promoting these videos are hoping that the emotional reaction they elicit will stoke a public and political backlash against the nation \u2019 s leading provider of reproductive health services .\nConservatives in the media and some hard-line Republicans in Congress believe they \u2019 ve come up with a plan for dealing with Planned Parenthood : shut down the government again .\n\u201c Shut down the government . Now , \u201d demands Erick Erickson . \u201c The budget and appropriations fights are forthcoming , \u201d he writes . \u201c If Barack Obama is willing to risk a government shutdown because he demands our tax dollars continue funding an organization that kills our children and sells their organs , we should have that fight. \u201d This line of reasoning appeals to legislators like Sen.

Republicans went into the 2014 elections promising voters that they \u2019 d be effective stewards of power and competent agents of governance . They haven \u2019 t lived up to those promises yet ( a partial shutdown was narrowly averted just two months into their reign ) and picking a fight over government funding , even when it \u2019 s related to a controversial issue like abortion , promises to make them look even worse . They shut down the government over the Affordable Care Act \u2013 which was quite unpopular at the time \u2013 and they paid for it in the polls . So while the GOP leadership is certainly sympathetic to the complaints of the base over Planned Parenthood , they \u2019 re not willing to resort to extreme measures and risk serious political blowback .\nThis is now a familiar dynamic of the relationship between Republicans in Congress and activist conservatives . When it comes time to make new appropriations and keep the government \u2019 s lights on , hard-line conservatives in the media and elsewhere insist that Republicans go nuclear and threaten a government shutdown in pursuit of their preferred policy outcome , whether it be defunding Obamacare , defunding President Obama \u2019 s executive actions on deportations , or stripping Planned Parenthood \u2019 s federal funding .
