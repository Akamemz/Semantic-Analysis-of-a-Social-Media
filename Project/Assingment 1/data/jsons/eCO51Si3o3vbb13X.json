Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe House has passed a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government open through Dec. 15. It passed almost entirely along party lines: In addition to funding the government, it calls for defunding of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe White House has said President Obama would veto the bill, were it to come to his desk in this form. And it most likely won't. Democrats, who control the Senate, won't pass a bill that defunds Obamacare.\n\nWhich raises the question, now what?\n\nFriday's vote was designed to project unity. House Republicans went straight from voting to approve the bill to an indoor rally in a neighboring room in the Capitol.\n\n\"The American people don't want the government shut down, and they don't want Obamacare,\" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said at the event, declaring victory with a panorama of House Republicans standing behind him and cheering.\n\nBut that joy isn't likely to last. Senate Democrats intend to strip the Obamacare language out of the bill and send it back to the House. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says he'll take a stand and try to stop them \u2014 but the numbers, and Senate procedure, aren't on his side.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is convinced Democrats will win this one.\n\n\"I have never seen such an extreme group of people adopt such an insane policy,\" he says. \"There's a time and a place for everything, and Americans know they're way overreaching.\"\n\nIn all likelihood, sometime late next week, the House will have to decide between a government shutdown and a stopgap spending bill that funds Obamacare, right along with the rest of government operations.
