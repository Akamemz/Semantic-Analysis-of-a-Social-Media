Limbaugh had spewed things just as ugly or even uglier in the past at a wide pageant of liberal/feminist/minority targets . This was the man who made fun of Chelsea Clinton \u2019 s looks when she was 12 years old , then issued a mock apology . His supremacy on the AM dial remained unshaken . He had gotten away just about everything over the length of his huckstering career and was , like Fox News \u2018 s Roger Ailes , a man whom elected Republicans were afraid to cross . The rest of the public was irrelevant to his carnival franchise as long as his sponsor and fan base held steady .\nBut this was different . This controversy resonated and gathered force . Sandra Fluke was a civilian ( so was Chelsea , but right-wing loathing of the Clintons was so pervasive that the daughter was just considered collateral damage ) ; she conducted herself with dignity and assurance even after the ad hominem barrage began , refusing to be rattled ; and Limbaugh , so used to getting his way , didn \u2019 t have brains or grace enough to let up . He kept punching down in his merry , nasty manner ( conservative David Frum described it as \u201c a brutally sexualized accusation , against a specific person , prolonged over three days \u201d ) , relenting only when pushback and blowback from advertisers and affiliates compelled him to issue an apology . An apology that wasn \u2019 t as transparently phony as the one he made after the Chelsea Clinton slur but nevertheless weasel-worded with insincerity .\nLimbaugh \u2019 s reputation , his hold on the the Zeitgeist , was never the same . He would never be the big bopper again . He still makes waves , but they don \u2019 t carry the same high crest .\nThis cautionary tale of hubris has now been reenacted on a bigger stage with bigger stakes , demonstrating yet again George Santayana \u2019 s adage that those who do not learn from the past will louse up even worse the next time .
