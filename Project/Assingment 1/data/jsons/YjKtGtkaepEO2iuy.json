    "content": "Jerusalem ( CNN ) When Israel destroyed Iraq 's nuclear reactor in 1981 , then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin drew an important line in the sand : No enemy could be permitted to develop weapons of mass destruction .\nIsrael , he declared , would defend itself `` with all the means at our disposal . ''\nThese words still reverberate in Israel today , and they help explain why Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is flying to Washington next week to give a controversial speech before Congress on Iran .\nNetanyahu wants to thwart a nuclear deal world powers are hammering out with Tehran , a deal that his government believes will leave Iran with the means to potentially develop a nuclear weapon -- and leave him with the same choice Begin faced more than three decades ago .\n`` This is the primary Israeli fear , '' said Ronen Bergman , military and intelligence analyst for the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth . `` They are afraid at the end of the day , if negotiations fail , Israel would be left alone to make the call -- whether to contain an Iranian nuclear capability or to make the call on the strike . ''\nIn making the trip to Capitol Hill , Netanyahu is willing to risk the ire of the White House , which is chagrined that he is expected to rail against the administration 's deal-making and encourage Congress to push for an Iran sanctions package that President Barack Obama has threatened to veto .\nAnd Netanyahu is doing so even amidst recriminations -- over how Republican House Speaker John Boehner and the Israeli Embassy handled the invitation -- that have tainted the atmosphere between the prime minister and the White House . Administration officials charge that the invitation violated protocol and has partisan overtones .\nWhile the Israeli leader 's speech might only intensify those bad feelings , Netanyahu has said it 's worth the cost of stating his case before the American public . Advisers indicate that with a deal looming , he feels that he has less and less time to prevent what he sees as a catastrophic outcome .\nHis speech to Congress comes two weeks before the Israeli election , in which he is facing a tight race . His security credentials and rhetorical skills are two of his strongest assets , and being welcomed by U.S. senators and representatives could play well on television screens in Tel Aviv . The White House has used the proximity of the elections as its reason for denying Netanyahu an Oval Office meeting during the trip .\nJUST WATCHED Have U.S.-Israel relations ever been this bad ?

Yes . 02:48\nBut many confidants insist that Netanyahu has a strong ideological conviction on the need to block Iran and treats his roles as protector of Israel and the Jewish people with the utmost seriousness . For him , this is a chance to act before Israel is faced with choosing between an Iranian bomb and bombing Iran .\nInherent in that choice is the fear Israel can not count on the United States to stop Tehran .\nObama has famously said that he 's `` got Israel 's back '' when it comes to Iran . Yet Israeli officials say they have watched over the past several years as the Obama administration has backtracked from its firm stance on Iran 's nuclear program to a position that could potentially allow Iran to maintain a significant uranium enrichment program .\n`` What started with zero ( centrifuges ) , then went to a symbolic enrichment capacity of a few hundred . Now it is well known we are speaking about several thousands , '' Israeli Minister of Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said in an interview with CNN . `` We think that the overall goal of the negotiation should be to get rid of the Iranian nuclear threat and not just hold it or restrain it or freeze it . ''\nIsrael maintains that even an Iranian threshold nuclear state , leaving Iran with enough enriched uranium to give it `` break-out capacity '' to build a nuclear weapon , would position Tehran as a superpower in the region and enable it to threaten Israel with impunity .\nThat would challenge the so-called qualitative military edge that Israel has built up over decades to fend off its enemies . Israeli military leaders worry they may have to think twice about responding to say , a Hezbollah attack on Israeli troops , out of fear of Iranian reprisal .\n`` This is a severe strategic threat to the variety of options that the national security of Israel stands upon , '' Bergman said . `` They want to have the bomb in order not to use it . They want to position themselves as a regional superpower and this would give them a nuclear umbrella over their heads . ''\nIt 's a daily threat to their existence that many Israelis believe the United States -- half a world away -- ca n't possibly understand . And some Israelis are n't as sanguine as Bergman that Iran would n't want to use the bomb .\n`` I have no doubt about the seriousness and the good intentions of the Obama administration , '' said Steinitz , the intelligence minister . `` Maybe we are more concerned because we feel the threat because they are speaking about the elimination of the Jewish state . ''\nMoreover , Israel fears a nuclear Iran would spark an arms race in the Middle East , potentially surrounding them with a group of nuclear-armed enemies in a region in turmoil .\nJUST WATCHED Susan Rice : Netanyahu visit 'destructive ' Replay More Videos ...

And the U.S.-Iran thaw has come at the same time that tensions between Obama and Netanyahu have escalated .\n`` The sense in Israel , and it goes way beyond Netanyahu , is that the president underestimates Iran 's duplicity , underestimates Iran 's ruthlessness , the religious imperative behind its ideology , '' said David Horovitz , editor of the Times of Israel news website .\nIn addressing Congress next week , aides say that Prime Minister Netanyahu feels compelled to warn the U.S. and the world that , in his view , beneath its friendly new image , Iran is still intent on wiping Israel off the map .\n`` I think that he feels fated that he is leading the Jewish people when it potentially faces a genocidal threat , '' Horovitz said . `` That is the Netanyahu mindset -- that people are in peril , and he needs to stand firm and say what he wants to say and if necessary take the step that needs to be taken .
