Wade is ever overturned , which the 79-page legal complaint argues `` misleads residents of these cities as to whether individuals can in fact exercise their right to access abortion . ''\nThe lawsuit also contends that the cities ' ordinances have dubbed abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as `` criminal organizations , '' which keeps them from clearing up confusion and assisting people with aborting their unborn children .\n`` As a result of being designated criminal , Plaintiffs are prohibited from operating , speaking , and associating within these cities , '' the lawsuit contends . `` Consequently , Plaintiffs are hampered from countering or clarifying the confusion created by the ordinances as to the legality of abortion services . ''\n`` These ordinances are unconstitutional , '' said ACLU of Texas staff attorney Anjali Salvador in a statement . `` Abortion is legal in every state and city in the country .
