For politically inclined social media users or Redditers , the term denotes Trump-worshiping trolls who regularly harass women and people of color on Twitter and Tumblr , and who embrace the billionaire \u2019 s apparent stands against political correctness , feminism , and multiculturalism , as well as his strongman personality .\nBroadly speaking , the alt-right is a big tent movement characterized by an intense disdain for liberalism , egalitarianism and feminism , and a shared affinity for white supremacy , nationalism and authoritarianism . There are various ideologies and groups that fall into the alt-right classification , but for practical purposes the movement can be divided into two categories . First there are the bona fide far-right extremists one could call the true believers : white supremacists , neo-Nazis , \u201c neoreactionaries \u201d \u2014 who all genuinely believe that the white race is superior or that there is a conscious liberal plot to annihilate the white race and destroy Western Civilization ( i.e . \u201c white genocide \u201d ) . Then there are the trolls , who loathe political correctness and feminism but primarily post despicable racist and sexist comments online in order to provoke and offend the so-called \u201c Social Justice Warriors. \u201d These trolls may or may not be genuine racists or white supremacists , but they are cynical and amoral opportunists \u2014 much like their hero Mr. Trump .\nThe infamous Breitbart provocateur and alt-right darling Milo Yiannopoulos falls into the latter category , and in an article on the alt-right , he compared its trolls to \u201c kids of the 60s [ who ] shocked their parents with promiscuity , long hair and rock \u2019 n \u2019 roll. \u201d Like transgressive beatniks and hippies , the \u201c alt-right \u2019 s young meme brigades shock older generations with outrageous caricatures , from the Jewish \u2018 Shlomo Shekelburg \u2019 to \u2018 Remove Kebab , \u2019 an internet in-joke about the Bosnian genocide \u201d ( because anti-Semitism and white supremacy are so very original ! ) . These trolls who contaminate social media with racist bile are , according to Yiannopoulos , no more bigots \u201c than death metal devotees in the 80s were actually Satanists . \u201d\nOn the other hand , there are the alt-right \u2019 s true believers , like neo-Nazis and white supremacists at the Daily Stormer and StormFront ( sites that have become increasingly popular with the rise of Trump ) , or \u2014 perhaps the most bizarre alt-right faction \u2014 the cultish \u201c neoreactionary movement , \u201d also known as the \u201c Dark Enlightenment. \u201d These curious new arrivals are pro-monarchist futurists who identify as \u201c race realists \u201d ( i.e. , they promote pseudo-scientific theories used to justify racism ) , and seem to believe \u2014 like a classic Ayn Rand hero \u2014 that their genius has been unfairly overlooked in a society of parasites and underachievers . ( Hence their contempt for democracy and egalitarianism . )\nSo then , those are the trolls and the true believers\nBut where does Trump \u2019 s new campaign chief fall in the alt-right typology ? According to conservative writer and professor Ronald Radosh , who met Bannon at a book party in 2014 , the Breitbart chairman describes himself as a \u201c Leninist. \u201d What did he mean by that ? \u201c Lenin wanted to destroy the state , and that \u2019 s my goal too , \u201d Bannon reportedly told Radosh . \u201c I want to bring everything crashing down , and destroy all of today \u2019 s establishment. \u201d Bannon also described the conservative publications National Review and the Weekly Standard as \u201c left-wing magazines \u201d that he wanted \u201c to destroy \u201d as well .\nThis destructive attitude , which evokes the Russian nihilist movement of the late 19th century ( which , coincidentally or not , also influenced Vladimir Ilyich Lenin ) , has also been endorsed by Yiannopoulos .
