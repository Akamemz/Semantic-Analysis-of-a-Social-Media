    "content": "Roger Stone has long feared he would be slapped with a gag order if he got indicted \u2014 and he \u2019 s readied a plan to make sure he won \u2019 t have to stay silent .\nThe federal judge in Stone \u2019 s case , Amy Berman Jackson , has already hushed a coterie of others caught in special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s dragnet , including Paul Manafort , Rick Gates and their attorneys . They were quieted after one of the lawyers told reporters that Mueller \u2019 s case was \u201c ridiculous . \u201d\nJackson will have a much longer record of public commentary from Stone to work with when the longtime Donald Trump associate appears Friday afternoon for his first status hearing tied to the special counsel \u2019 s charges that he lied to Congress and obstructed the House investigation into Russian election meddling .\nIf Stone is gagged , his contingency plan is already in place . He \u2019 s got a well-known First Amendment attorney on his legal team who represented the rap group 2 Live Crew against obscenity charges in the early 1990s . And Stone has designated a pair of close friends as spokesmen in the event he and his lawyers are told to stop talking .\nSince his arrest last Friday , Stone has been on a media blitz . He gave his first interview to the conspiracy theory website InfoWars and then addressed reporters outside the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale . He \u2019 s discussed his legal defense plans during a series of interviews with the major television and cable networks , as well as in impromptu press conferences outside his South Florida home . Anyone on Stone \u2019 s email list got a message Monday with the subject line \u201c Let \u2019 s talk about my arrest \u201d and a plea for \u201c emergency \u201d contributions to help pay his mounting legal bills .\nOn Instagram , Stone as of Tuesday night had posted 30 times about the indictment , including a mock-up photograph of the special counsel in a waiter outfit holding up a tray topped with an empty hamburger bun . \u201c Here \u2019 s what Mueller has on me # nothingburger \u201d Stone wrote .\n\u201c It \u2019 s always been Roger \u2019 s intention to maintain his First Amendment rights throughout the process , \u201d said Michael Caputo , a longtime Stone associate and one of the people who is in position to step up as a spokesman if Stone gets gagged .\nDuring Stone \u2019 s arraignment hearing on Tuesday , magistrate judge Deborah Robinson opened with a warning that he \u2019 d be wise to not speak about the charges in the indictment . \u201c Any statements you make may be used against you , \u201d she said .\nBut Grant Smith , one of Stone \u2019 s attorneys , said in an interview that Robinson \u2019 s comments appeared to him to be pro forma . And on social media , Stone acted as though he is still free to speak out .\n\u201c No gag order ! I will fight and the deep state is in panic mode ! Onward , \u201d Stone wrote Tuesday afternoon in an Instagram post that featured a picture of him surrounded by police officers outside the Washington , D.C. , federal courthouse .\nTuesday night , Stone appeared on Fox News with host Laura Ingraham \u2014 his third interview on the conservative cable network since his arrest . Appearing Monday night with Sean Hannity , Stone argued that Mueller had charged him for \u201c errors of memory \u201d and later played the gag order card .\n\u201c They want to silence me because I stand up for Donald Trump , \u201d he said . \u201c That \u2019 s what this is really about . \u201d\nCome Friday , many legal experts expect that Stone will be in for a rude awakening with Jackson , a no-nonsense judge appointed by President Barack Obama who reacts harshly to what she perceives as showboating . From the very beginning of the Manafort case in the fall of 2017 , she chafed at statements his defense lawyer made , both inside and outside courtroom .\n\u201c This is a criminal trial , and it \u2019 s not a public relations campaign , \u201d the judge warned at the first hearing she held in the Manafort case , a little more than a week after his late October 2017 indictment . \u201c I expect counsel to do their talking in this courtroom and in their pleadings and not on the courthouse steps . \u201d\nJackson immediately floated the idea of a gag order under a court rule that permits them in \u201c widely publicized or sensational criminal cases. \u201d Neither side objected , so less than a week later she fired off such an order .\nOn its face , the edict Jackson issued in the Manafort case didn \u2019 t ban all public statements by the lawyers involved , but she made clear as the case progressed that she viewed it as barring any out-of-court remarks that could influence how a jury would view the case .\nSuch gag orders are often more of a burden on the defense than the prosecution , since prosecutors typically issue a news release or hold a news conference to announce the charges and then go mum about the case \u2014 at least officially . In addition , Justice Department policies discourage government attorneys from the kinds of statements most gag orders would rule out .\nFollowing the rules didn \u2019 t turn out to be easy for Manafort , who has since pleaded guilty to one set of Mueller \u2019 s charges and been convicted in a separate case on bank and tax fraud charges .
