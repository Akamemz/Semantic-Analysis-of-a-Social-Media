There are conservative media critics who have been cheering the prospect of the New York Times \u2019 demise for many years , but the more intelligent ones want a better New York Times rather than a crippled one . It is more obvious if you live in New York City , but in spite of the Times \u2019 ongoing bias problems and the partisan stupidity of its op-ed pages , the newspaper does irreplaceable work \u2014 work that RedStatePatriotAmericaFirstJesusGunsDerkaDerkaMAGA at Twitter dot com is not going to do in the absence of the New York Times .\nSpeak of which : The Times reports that Donald Trump tried to fire Robert S. Mueller III , the special counsel investigating Russia-related campaign shenanigans and other possible malfeasance in Trumpworld . That firing was prevented by Donald F. McGahn II , the White House counsel , who refused to forward the order to the Justice Department and vowed that he would resign before he did so . ( One assumes he did not have a quiet resignation in mind . ) Peter Beinart , writing in The Atlantic , argued that the move showed that \u201c the Establishment \u201d maintains some power . He is correct , but another term for \u201c the Establishment \u201d is functioning institutions . Beinart writes that , more than almost anybody else in the Trump administration , McGahn is a member of \u201c the Republican establishment , \u201d which he describes in this way :\nOnce upon a time , that establishment was an insurgency . Before Ronald Reagan , the Washington establishment consisted largely of people , in both parties , who believed in the legitimacy of federal oversight of the economy . But as the Republican Party began moving right in the 1970s , it grew more and more influenced by what Sidney Blumenthal in 1986 called \u201c the counter-establishment \u201d : a network of think tanks , publications , and business groups that sought to free capitalism from the government \u2019 s yoke . By the late 1990s , when McGahn joined this world \u2014 after Reagan had been president and Newt Gingrich had been speaker of the House \u2014 the adjective \u201c counter \u201d was no longer necessary . Anti-government forces wielded at least as much power in Washington as the pro-government forces that had preceded them .\nThe binate nomenclature here \u2014 \u201c anti-government \u201d vs. \u201c pro-government \u201d \u2014 is clunky , inasmuch as Newt Gingrich is not and was not an anarchist ; while the Republican party is home to many libertarian elements , including some radical tendencies , there is practically no one in the mainstream of American public life who can be accurately described as \u201c anti-government. \u201d There are many who believe that the federal government is too large , too intrusive , too busy , too arrogant , etc . But that isn \u2019 t quite the same thing . To be opposed to the current configuration of government is not to be opposed to government as such . Similarly , to be a critic of American institutions is not to be opposed to those institutions per se . Many of us have spent years boring the world to death with our claims about media bias precisely because we think what the news media do is important \u2014 necessary \u2014 to the functioning of our republic .\nPresident Trump often is accused of being at war with fundamental American institutions , and that criticism is not without some merit . Trump is not what one would call a nuanced critic . The press that is critical of him is horrible , in his view , and might reasonably be suppressed by various official means , including gutting the libel laws in such a way as to make it easier for the powerful to sue their critics . On the other hand , the president loves the press that is friendly to him , though here \u201c friendly \u201d must necessarily be read \u201c obsequious , \u201d as Breitbart , Fox & Friends , et al . have been . President Trump does not think very much about institutions at all . He thinks of friends and enemies . One of the problems with his bitter , often excessive criticism of American institutions is that such abuse , coming from the president , can have the effect of corroding faith in our institutions .
