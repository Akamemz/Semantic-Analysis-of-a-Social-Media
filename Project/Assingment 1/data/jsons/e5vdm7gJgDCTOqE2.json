The swastika is a totally different symbol from the Confederate flag . Skinheads shave off all of their hair , whereas white nationalists only like theirs long on top , short on the sides . While their core values might be the same , Trump was right to point out the subtle differences .\nIn his defense of terrorist extremist factions , the president also lumped in the anti-fascist ( or \u201c antifa \u201d ) movement . While many are familiar with the various segments of white supremacy , few people have taken the time to explain the origins and motivations of the antifa movement that recently stepped into the spotlight , so we thought we \u2019 d offer this explainer .\nHold up , bruh . Pump your brakes ; you \u2019 re going too fast . Don \u2019 t you think we should talk about fascism first ? You can \u2019 t talk about a thing without explaining its origin story . It \u2019 s like explaining Spider-Man to someone who \u2019 s never seen a spider .\nActually , we don \u2019 t have enough space or time to get into the political history and subtleties of ...\nI know . I know . Let me break it down for you :\nMerriam-Webster \u2019 s dictionary defines fascism as \u201c a political philosophy , movement , or regime ( such as that of the Fascisti ) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader , severe economic and social regimentation , and forcible suppression of opposition . \u201d\nWhen most people refer to fascism , they are talking about the political ideology of Benito Mussolini , which in turn inspired a little-known up-and-comer named Adolf Hitler , who modeled his Nazi regime after the fascist movement .\nAt the core of fascism is \u201c nationalism \u201d \u2014the belief that a country is a single unit bound together by a common ancestry . I know it sounds antithetical to the entire idea of America , but you know how \u201c they \u201d do : They will talk about freedom and liberty while screaming for the Jews to go home . They will talk about their constitutional right to free speech while ignoring the part about equal protection under the law . They can write \u201c all men are created equal \u201d while they keep slaves shackled on their plantations .\nI understand . Now get to the anti-fascist part , bruh . I ain \u2019 t got all day .\nAs the Nazis were taking over Germany , groups like the \u201c Antifaschistische Komittees \u201d and \u201c Antifaschistische Aktionen \u201d rose in opposition . If you took eighth-grade history , you know they failed . But the groups didn \u2019 t die out . Instead , these \u201c antifa \u201d organizations started hunting down Nazis , because ... well ... they were motherfucking Nazis .\nBut that was in Germany , right ? What about here in America ?\nYou know how there \u2019 s one aunt or uncle who you let come to the cookout , but you let everyone know not to give them a drink because they \u2019 ll start fighting ... or stripping ... or stripping while they \u2019 re fighting ? But someone always does , and you \u2019 re not as mad at Auntie for throwing punches in her bra and panties as you are at the cousin who gave her a cup of Hennessy ?\nWell , the antifa movement saw what happened at the last Hitler cookout in Germany and said , \u201c Before we allow fascism to seep into America and start a naked nationalist strip-fight at America \u2019 s cookout , we \u2019 ll just punch the motherfucker in the mouth who \u2019 s handing out racism in cups of Henny . \u201d\nBasically , they believe ( and rightly so ) that there is nothing worse than fascism . They saw what happened in Germany , and they have pledged to do anything to stop it before it gets going\u2014even if that means violence .\nOK , I get it . It \u2019 s like Malcolm X said : \u201c By any means necessary . \u201d\nExactly ! ( Except that phrase actually comes from a play by Jean-Paul Sartre called Dirty Hands , written right after World War II , about whether it is ethical to kill one person to stop fascism . ) Yes , el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz got some of his militant ideas from French political drama .\nIt is hard to say for sure . One of the distinguishing characteristics of wypipo is their infallible ability to lump people into groups and project their notions onto said group . If you speak above a whisper about oppression , Fox News and Caucasians , in general , will label you \u201c a member of Black Lives Matter . \u201d\nThe problem with the antifa movement is that many of them are anarchists who don \u2019 t believe in organized institutions , so it is hard to tell what their beliefs are . Some of them believe that if the public sees that there are more anti-fascists than there are white supremacists , regular , fence-riding citizens won \u2019 t feel pressured to join the fascist movements out of popularity . Some of them believe in fighting fascism with education . And some of them believe that the only way to fight tyranny is with force .\nAnd by \u201c force , \u201d you mean violence ? Isn \u2019 t that stooping down to their level ?\nMaybe . Or maybe the only way to fight bullies is to stand up to them . Remember all the groups we talked about earlier ? Nazis , the Klan , neo-Confederates , skinheads and white nationalists all have one thing in common : a desire to \u201c make America great again \u201d by slowly ridding the county of ethnic diversity . Whether it is anti-immigration laws , lynching , marginalization or radical Caucasian terrorism , they all advocate some version of ethnic cleansing that is , at its base , violent .\nIt is impossible to stop this kind of violence with signs , freedom songs and nonviolent resistance . Anti-fascists know that tactic has never worked in the history of the world .\nBut what about the civil rights struggle ? Wasn \u2019 t that nonviolent ?\nNope . The civil rights movement was extremely violent . Ask the people in Birmingham , Ala. , who had their skin ripped away by police dogs and fire hoses . Ask the Freedom Riders who were firebombed . Ask the children beaten with police batons on the Edmund Pettus Bridge . Ask the crack in John Lewis \u2019 skull . Ask the bits of Martin Luther King Jr. \u2019 s brain and blood splattered on the balcony of a Memphis , Tenn. , hotel .\nThe hypocrisy of America is that black people are the only ones who are ever asked to donate their lives for justice and equality . The Sons of Liberty rioted on the British , threw tea overboard and then grabbed their muskets . The Southern states shot cannons for their \u201c right \u201d to own slaves . The Native Americans attacked American troops even though they were outnumbered . Black people are the only group asked to wait quietly in the corner for their freedom while they are slaughtered .\nDamn . When you put it like that , I see what you \u2019 re talking about . But isn \u2019 t there a danger that Trump and his faction will end up painting the antifa movement with the same \u201c violent , radical \u201d brush that they did Black Lives Matter ?\nYes , they probably will . But there has never been a movement for the equality of African Americans that white America has approved . They disagreed with the abolitionist movement . They called civil rights workers troublemaking rabble-rousers . They referred to the Black Power movement as \u201c radical . \u201d\nThere is , however , one difference between the violent white supremacist movement and everyone else : As long as there is one Jew , black person or non-Christian with any power in America , white nationalists will continue their hate .\nBut If America really wanted to , she could end the Black Lives Matter and the anti-fascist movement in one fell swoop .",
