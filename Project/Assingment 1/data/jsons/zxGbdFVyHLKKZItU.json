    "content": "When Hillary Clinton held a seemingly insurmountable lead in most national and state polls , she didn \u2019 t need to worry about the health insurance sticker shock that much of the electorate is about to experience . Her edge was large enough to ensure victory even if she lost a couple of points due to voter anger over skyrocketing premiums caused by Obamacare . Those halcyon days are gone . Her national lead has all but evaporated , and she is behind Donald Trump or clinging to tenuous leads in crucial swing states whose voters will learn of huge rate hikes one week before Election Day .\nTo secure a majority in the Electoral College , Clinton must prevent Trump from winning several swing states that Obama carried in 2012 . If Trump hangs on to all the states Romney won and beats Hillary in a few of these battleground states , he will be the next President . And Obamacare may well help him accomplish this feat . Trump has pledged to repeal the unpopular \u201c reform \u201d law while Clinton still defends it . This distinction will become particularly poignant to swing state voters whose double-digit premium hikes hit just as they are deciding for whom to cast their November ballots .\nIn Ohio , for example , Obama easily won in 2012 but Trump has led Clinton in 4 of the last 5 surveys of likely voters listed by RealClearPolitics . It \u2019 s probably not a coincidence that Ohio is one of the battleground states in which Obamacare has driven up out-of-pocket health care expenses .

This year , as Election Day draws nigh , Floridians will discover what \u201c affordable \u201d means when Clinton uses the term . As the Miami Herald puts it , \u201c Floridians who buy their own health insurance in 2017 are likely to see their premiums rise by an average of 19 percent over the current year. \u201d As in Ohio , Trump has already erased Clinton \u2019 s Florida lead , and these Obamacare-induced rate hikes aren \u2019 t likely to send Sunshine State voters running back into her arms in November .\nIn addition to pulling ahead of Clinton in Ohio and Florida , Trump appears likely to pick off yet another state easily won by President Obama in 2008 and 2012 .
