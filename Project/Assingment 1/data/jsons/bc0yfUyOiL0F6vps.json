But they \u2019 ll ask the Board of State Canvassers to approve the form of their petition before beginning circulation . That means they \u2019 ll likely start later this month in the heart of winter , which will likely complicate outdoor signature gathering efforts .\nState lawmakers will still have \u201c a chance to lead , \u201d Thomas told Bridge Magazine in a phone interview .\nIf his group obtains enough signatures to initiate the legislation , lawmakers would have 40 days to adopt it or allow it to go to the ballot . That \u201c keeps the power in their hands to do the right thing , \u201d he said .\nAs of October , the Michigan Department of Civil Rights had opened 44 investigations into LGBT discrimination complaints since 2018 . Fourteen had been resolved , including nine dismissed for insufficient evidence , two that resulted in a settlement agreement and others that were withdrawn or adjusted .\nWhile business groups have pushed similar anti-discrimination proposals since at least 2014 , GOP leaders in the state Legislature have not acted on their calls .

CEO Jim Fitterling .\n\u201c Advancing the fair treatment of all people - regardless of their race , religion , disability , ethnicity , age , gender , sexual orientation , or gender identity - is a key component of retaining and growing a world-class , talented workforce , \u201d Poppe said in a statement .\n\u201c To stay competitive in today 's economy , we need to be bold in our efforts to make our communities more welcoming to all .

Joe Schwarz , a moderate who left the Republican Party after serving in Congress and now identifies as a political independent .\nRepublican former Gov . Rick Snyder in 2014 urged the Legislature to consider updating the state \u2019 s civil rights law . His successor , Democratic Gov .
