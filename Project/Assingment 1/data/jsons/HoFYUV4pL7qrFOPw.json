    "content": "Members of Congress who are dismayed by Donald Trump 's invocation of emergency powers to build his border wall are like the dog owner who leaves the gate open and is then surprised to find his Labradoodle bounding around the neighborhood . He might have hoped the dog would stay in the yard without external restraint , but it was not a reasonable expectation .\nA lawsuit filed by California and 15 other states on Monday argues that there is `` no objective basis for President Trump 's Emergency Declaration '' and that `` by the President 's own admission , an emergency declaration is not necessary . '' Even while declaring a border-related national emergency on Friday , the complaint notes , Trump conceded that `` I did n't need to do this , '' since `` I could do the wall over a longer period of time . '' But he added that `` I 'd rather do it much faster . ''\nAlthough an emergency that is not urgent may seem like a contradiction in terms , that does not mean it is illegal . Under the National Emergencies Act , a 1976 law that was supposed to constrain the president 's exercise of extraordinary powers , an emergency is whatever the president says it is . It need not be sudden , pressing , harmful , or of limited duration .\nThe fact that the president can create an emergency by the stroke of a pen , without regard to objective circumstances , is rather alarming in light of all the legal provisions that give him or his appointees special powers once he has done that . The Brennan Center for Justice has cataloged 123 of them , including the power to freeze bank accounts , to take control of the internet , and to `` suspend a law that prohibits the testing of chemical and biological weapons on unwitting human subjects . ''\nIn this case , Trump is relying on 10 USC 2808 , which authorizes the secretary of defense , in the event of a national emergency `` that requires use of the armed forces , '' to `` undertake military construction projects '' that are `` not otherwise authorized by law '' when they `` are necessary to support such use of the armed forces . '' While it 's debatable whether Trump 's desire for border wall money that Congress denied him meets those criteria , it is not clear that anyone but the president gets to make that call .\nCalifornia et al . argue that Trump 's end run around the legislative branch 's exclusive authority to appropriate taxpayers ' money `` violates the separation of powers doctrine .
