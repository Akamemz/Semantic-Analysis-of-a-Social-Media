    "content": "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , called on President Trump to `` abandon the wall '' Saturday if he wants to reopen the government , saying Trump does not have the votes in the Senate to get it funded -- hours after the government shut down over an impasse over funding for Trump 's signature 2016 campaign promise .\n`` It will never pass the Senate , not today , not next week , not next year . So President Trump , if you want to open the government , you must abandon the wall , plain and simple , '' Schumer said on the Senate floor .\nThe partial shutdown began at midnight Saturday , a few hours after the House and Senate adjourned without getting a funding agreement to the president 's desk . The shutdown was expected to last at least a few days , with sources on both sides of the aisle telling \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Washington could be in for a prolonged shutdown .\nThe Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon and was not due to meet for a scheduled session until Thursday . Early Saturday evening , the House also concluded for the day .\nVice President Mike Pence and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney arrived at the Capitol Saturday afternoon to meet with Schumer to continue negotiations for an end to the stalemate . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , said that `` productive discussions are continuing . ''\n`` When those negotiations produce a solution that is acceptable to all parties -- which means 60 votes in the Senate , a majority in the House , and a presidential signature -- at that point , we will take it up here on the Senate floor , '' he said .\nLate Saturday afternoon , a Schumer spokesman said that `` the vice president came in for a discussion and made an offer . Unfortunately , we 're still very far apart . ''\nIn a letter addressed to fellow Democratic colleagues on Saturday , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , wrote that `` Last night , Republicans shut down the government . '' She added that barring any developments , making `` progress to end the Trump Shutdown in the next several days '' was not anticipated .\n`` Until President Trump can publicly commit to a bipartisan resolution , there will be no agreement before January when the new House Democratic Majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government , '' Pelosi wrote , before expressing her wishes for a happy holiday .\nWith the standoff grinding on , the White House revealed on Saturday that the president planned to stay in the nation 's capital over the holiday .\n\u201c Due to the shutdown , President Trump will remain in Washington , D.C. and the First Lady will return from Florida so they can spend Christmas together , \u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement .\nThe main sticking point for negotiations was funding for Trump 's signature 2016 campaign promise of a wall on the southern border . Trump had demanded $ 5.7 billion for wall funding , and a bill with that funding attached passed the House on Friday . But efforts have derailed in the Senate , where 60 votes were required for passage , and therefore Democrat votes are needed in conjunction with support by the GOP .\nDemocrats have poured cold water on the idea that they would support anything close to that .
