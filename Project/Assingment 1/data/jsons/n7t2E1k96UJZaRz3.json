This is new , and the valorization of bipartisan compromise has been similarly flipped on its head : Mitch McConnell has made the idea of governing by reaching across the aisle not just unworkable but fantastic ; no serious person can entertain the possibility that Democratic priorities can be achieved with Republican cooperation .\nIn short , the moderate positions , the hoary , respectable \u201c sensible \u201d positions , have been evacuated of the pragmatism that once gave them force . And so , while Biden \u2019 s back-to-Obama positions ( rejoin the Paris agreement that is now clearly insufficient , keep the Affordable Care Act ) have enough appeal to put him in the lead , the positions staked out by the 20 presidential candidates\u2014most of whom are to Obama \u2019 s left\u2014suggest a new center of gravity .\nThis shift is clear enough from the candidacies of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , but it \u2019 s been crystallized in a different way by the ostensible no-chancers on the debate stage . No party \u2019 s political terrain is defined by its most idiosyncratic members , but minor players offer an interesting lens into how the distribution of political energy has shifted since 2016 . Issues championed by movements that were once considered outside the political mainstream , especially concerning criminal justice reform , climate change , and drastic inequality , are now central tenets of the Democratic contest .\nOne result is that the top-tier candidates with more moderate records\u2014not progressives\u2014struggled with defending their positions ( Kamala Harris on her history as a prosecutor , Joe Biden on the crime bill ) . But this was also true of the low-polling moderates who found themselves in a \u201c heel \u201d position , like Johns Delaney and Hickenlooper , who failed to connect or win applause with their defenses of private industry .\nThe presidential nominee is likely to emerge from the front-runners . But the way the rest of the field performed and was received during these debates says something too about where the party is today . And as much as someone like Delaney conveyed one lesson , another was imparted by fringe candidates like Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang\u2014folks with no government experience at all\u2014or current officials with minuscule polling like Tulsi Gabbard and Jay Inslee . All four were on the winner \u2019 s side of a \u201c viral \u201d moment or two , and it \u2019 s worth thinking about why .\nIn some cases\u2014like Yang and Inslee\u2014what the candidate offers , through their commitment to a single issue , is an intensified expression of a need whose urgency gets buried among the heaps of policy positions the front-runners have to lay out . Yang \u2019 s pet issue is universal basic income , which he sees as a step toward addressing income inequality and lost jobs through automation . It \u2019 s a little out there , but he turned almost every answer on seemingly different issues into an account of why it matters , and framed the idea as deeply American ( supported by Martin Luther King Jr. ) and grounded in the challenges facing the working class today : \u201c Raise your hand in the crowd if you \u2019 ve seen stores closing where you live . It is not just you . Amazon is closing 30 percent of America \u2019 s stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it. \u201d Yang connected with humor\u2014 \u201c We need to do the opposite of much of what we \u2019 re doing right now , and the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math \u201d \u2014and with a weary realism about the gap between the \u201c great \u201d economy Trump keeps bragging about and people \u2019 s experience on the ground : \u201c It \u2019 s gotten so bad that American life expectancy had declined for the last three years . \u201d\nInslee sees climate change as a true national and global emergency , and unlike most of the other candidates , he treats it that way . It \u2019 s the subject he keeps going back to ; he does not hand-wave or move past it to address other questions , because it is , in his view , not just an emergency but the emergency of the moment . ( He \u2019 s probably right , and yet no front-runner can afford that kind of laser-focused vision . )\nOther fringe candidates aren \u2019 t so much focused on a pet issue as they are nimble \u201c pinball agents \u201d who gather speed and momentum by striking a familiar subject differently . I wouldn \u2019 t have guessed , for instance , that Marianne Williamson , a wealthy white \u201c spiritual leader , \u201d would be the candidate to most effectively argue for reparations on Tuesday night . ( This might have worked differently had she appeared on Wednesday , where the candidates were not all white . ) Still , Williamson \u2019 s unexpected angle of approach works in saturated terrain . As Shannon Palus wrote in Slate , she combines an American appetite for \u201c hard truths \u201d with an equally American preference for appealingly vague scientific metaphors over the dreary wonkiness of scientific facts .\nGabbard \u2019 s primary identity as a candidate is as an anti-war veteran , but she also put some unexpected spin into the discussion by tackling Harris \u2019 record as part of her condemnation of the criminal justice system . Condemning it as \u201c disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today , \u201d Gabbard accused Harris of putting \u201c over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. \u201d She also accused Harris of blocking evidence that would exonerate innocent men and fighting to keep the bail system \u201c that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way. \u201d She connected\u2014because the challenge had some merit and deserved a response .\nThe lower-tier candidates have a function and an incentive to keep smashing the frame of conventional politics in order to make that frame visible . They \u2019 re also exposing the utter ( even suicidal , according to some ) inadequacy of positions that in politics have typically been regarded as sensible and moderate . Against Biden \u2019 s jovial reassurances that we can all return to the Obama years and everything will be fine , Williamson , Yang , and Gabbard embraced apocalypticisms that echo the real panic a lot of Americans are feeling . Williamson spoke of \u201c dark psychic forces \u201d in need of countering and injustice forming \u201c a toxicity beneath the surface. \u201d She connected this to racism and American history , but also to Trump . Here \u2019 s Yang :\nThis is going to be a tough truth , but we are too late . We are 10 years too late . We need to do everything we can to start moving the climate in the right direction , but we also need to start moving our people to higher ground . And the best way to do that is to put economic resources into your hands so you can protect yourself and your families .\nContrast this with Inslee \u2019 s opening statement , which , while dire , still operated in the register of hope : \u201c I am running for president because the people in this room and the Democrats watching tonight are the last best hope for humanity on this planet. \u201d Gabbard \u2019 s world-ending appeal was perhaps the most dramatic\u2014and quite effective , as this was , indeed , what the people of Hawaii went through , even though most of Americans have forgotten Hawaii \u2019 s nuclear false alarm :\nNow , as we stand here tonight , there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us .

This is not a drill. \u201d And you would see as we did , as my loved ones in Hawaii did , there is no shelter . This is the warmonger \u2019 s hoax . There is no shelter .
