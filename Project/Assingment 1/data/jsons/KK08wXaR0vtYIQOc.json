' `` Christie said .\n`` Let me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight : Under this government , our first job is to get the job done , and as long as I 'm governor , that job will always , always be finished , '' he told supporters at a victory gathering in Asbury Park .\nWhile much of Christie 's speech was directed at a New Jersey audience , it may also have been meant as a message for the nation , two top Republicans said .\n`` It was n't an acceptance speech , that was an announcement speech , '' said CNN contributor Alex Castellanos , a veteran of numerous GOP campaigns .\n`` I think it was an introductory speech , '' added former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , the co-host of CNN 's `` Crossfire .

This is a bad omen for Democrats in 2014 . ''\n3 . Good news , bad news for the tea party in Alabama\nIf there was any district that Dean Young could have won in 2013 , it was Alabama 's 1st District . The southern Alabama district is not only reliably Republican , but political handicappers list it as one of the most conservative in the country .\nAnd Young is a conservative Republican who asked other Republican candidates to take an anti-same-sex marriage pledge , believes President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and said he would n't vote for his opponent in the general election should he win .\nBut he still lost his primary runoff to the better-funded , more-establishment Bradley Byrne , a former state senator .\nIn total , Byrne raised almost three times as much money as Young , with substantial donations from business community political action groups and individual business donors .\nThat could signal the coming of a more active Republican business community .\nAlready , the Chamber of Commerce has said it would be more involved in primary fights next year because of the negative effects of the partial government shutdown this year .\nThe bad news for the tea party is obvious and twofold .\nIn a very conservative district , a tea party candidate lost in a race widely seen as a precursor to more fights inside the GOP ahead of 2014 primary elections that will affect the makeup of Congress . What 's more , an involved business community willing to throw its money behind candidates that wo n't shut down the government could be bad for the conservative movement .\nBut the news is n't all bad for the tea party .\nEven though Young ran to the right of Byrne , groups that have backed tea party candidates largely ignored him during the race . Tea Party Express , Club for Growth and FreedomWorks -- three of the largest national groups that have backed tea party candidates -- all sat on the sidelines of the family feud .\nSo , if you are n't involved , is it really a loss ?\nBill de Blasio 's sizable victory was no surprise , and it was clear Tuesday night that the soon-to-be-mayor wants to shake things up in New York City .\n`` Today you spoke out loudly ... for a new direction for our city , united by a belief that our city should leave no New Yorker behind , '' he said in his victory speech , with his campaign sign on the podium shouting out `` PROGRESS '' in red and white .\nThe towering figure with populist appeal stepped on stage to a raucous audience and the lyrics of a popular song , Lorde 's `` Royals . '' The tune is quite fitting for his campaign to combat inequality : `` We 'll never be royals . It do n't run in our blood . That kind of lux just ai n't for us . ''\nDe Blasio campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than $ 500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten , and he was n't shy in declaring his mission to level the playing field in New York .\n`` Make no mistake : The people of this city have chosen a progressive path , and tonight we set forth on it , together , as one city , '' he said .\nThe first Democrat elected New York City mayor since 1989 , de Blasio has painted himself as the herald of a new era in city government .\nHis predecessors -- Republican Rudy Giuliani and Republican-turned-independent Michael Bloomberg -- were known for their tough-on-crime and big business reputations .\nDe Blasio , the city 's public advocate , has gone to no end to highlight his biracial family and portray himself as a man of the people and a unifier in the most diverse city in the country . The Democrat also spoke part of his speech in Spanish on Tuesday night and talked at length about his Italian background .\nFurther showcasing his unusual-for-a-candidate style , he also has n't been afraid to boast of his love for the Boston Red Sox on the campaign trail .\nWhether he actually raises taxes on the city 's upper class as he promised is yet to be known , but after following two decades of only two mayors , he 'll probably bring a different feel to the city .\nCuccinelli was heavily outspent in Virginia by McAuliffe and Democratic outside groups like Planned Parenthood , NextGen Climate Action and Independence USA PAC , an anti-gun group funded by Bloomberg .\nThe money was n't the sole reason McAuliffe held a lead for most of the year : Cuccinelli was an unabashedly conservative candidate running in a swing state , his campaign made some strategic errors , and outside forces like the ethics scandal surrounding Gov . Bob McDonnell consumed the spring and summer news cycle .\nMcAuliffe led the race in every poll since May , back when TV ad spending was mostly at parity .\nBut the Democratic spending assault , especially after Labor Day , locked in the contours of the race . Heading into Election Day , Democrats had a roughly 4-1 spending edge over Republicans on the TV airwaves , and Republicans could n't punch through .\nWith Cuccinelli steadily trailing throughout the fall , it became harder and harder for him to raise money and enlist outside support .\nAs the race came down to just 40,000 or so votes Tuesday night , Cuccinelli supporters in Richmond were livid that Republicans did n't do more to help .\nThe Republican Governors Association spent about $ 8 million on the race , but stopped running television ads weeks ago . At the time , they pumped $ 1.7 million into a cakewalk of a governor 's race in New Jersey -- precious money that could have boosted Cuccinelli down the stretch .\nThe Republican National Committee spent $ 3 million in Virginia -- a worthy commitment , $ 6 million less than it did in 2009 .\n`` A number of people in the party establishment are going to need to take a hard look in the mirror and think about how they stranded their Republican nominee in Virginia , and with their help we would have had a Republican governor of Virginia , '' vented one Republican strategist close to the campaign .\nIndeed , Cuccinelli kept it surprisingly close in the end , losing by just two points even while running as an unabashed `` first principles '' conservative in a state dominated by an increasingly moderate electorate .\n`` This guy ran and stuck to his guns and almost pulled it off , '' said Pete Snyder , a businessman and former Republican candidate for lieutenant governor . `` Ken ran an unbelievable race , stuck to his principles . He had tons of drama in the party , and he was almost able to overcome that . ''\nAsked about the criticism from Cuccinelli supporters , RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said the party committee boosted get-out-the-vote efforts .\n`` The RNC spent millions of dollars to fund the ground game efforts in both New Jersey and Virginia , working in coordination with both campaigns to identify and turn out voters , '' she said .",

Time for change in New York\n\nBill de Blasio's sizable victory was no surprise, and it was clear Tuesday night that the soon-to-be-mayor wants to shake things up in New York City.\n\n\"Today you spoke out loudly ... for a new direction for our city, united by a belief that our city should leave no New Yorker behind,\" he said in his victory speech, with his campaign sign on the podium shouting out \"PROGRESS\" in red and white.\n\nThe towering figure with populist appeal stepped on stage to a raucous audience and the lyrics of a popular song, Lorde's \"Royals.\" The tune is quite fitting for his campaign to combat inequality: \"We'll never be royals.

Cuccinelli backers furious at GOP\n\nCuccinelli was heavily outspent in Virginia by McAuliffe and Democratic outside groups like Planned Parenthood, NextGen Climate Action and Independence USA PAC, an anti-gun group funded by Bloomberg.\n\nThe money wasn't the sole reason McAuliffe held a lead for most of the year: Cuccinelli was an unabashedly conservative candidate running in a swing state, his campaign made some strategic errors, and outside forces like the ethics scandal surrounding Gov.
