    "content": "\u201c I think we have very good reason to believe that there is an investigation that has been conducted , which has produced evidence that tells us that this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice . I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment. \u201d \u201c If any other human being in this country had done what \u2019 s documented in the Mueller report , they would be arrested and put in jail . If there is going to be any accountability , that accountability has to come from the Congress , and the tool that we are given for that accountability is the impeachment process. \u201d \u201c I think it would be perfectly reasonable for Congress to open up those proceedings and it \u2019 s clear that Bob Mueller , in his report , left that in the hands of Congress. \u201d \u201c I think the American people are going to have a chance to decide this at the ballot box in November 2020 , and perhaps that \u2019 s the best way for us to resolve these outstanding questions. \u201d Reporter : \u201c Do you think there should be a conversation about impeachment , right now ? \u201d \u201c No. \u201d Reporter : \u201c Why not ? \u201d \u201c I think right now , we should continue this investigation . I think Mueller should come before and testify . I don \u2019 t think we should be having that conversation. \u201d \u201c Congress has got to take a hard look at that , and do a hard investigation and ask \u2014 subpoena the people who were mentioned in that report and bring them forward so to get to the truth . Did Trump actually obstruct justice ? \u201d \u201c I think he \u2019 s made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment . I \u2019 ll leave it to the \u2014 [ applause ] but I \u2019 m also going to leave it to the House and Senate to figure that out because my role in the process is trying to relegate Trumpism to the dustbin of history . And I think there \u2019 s no more decisive way to do that , especially to get Republicans to abandon this kind of deal with the devil they made , than to have just an absolute thumping at the ballot box. \u201d \u201c The impeachment proceedings are up to the House . They \u2019 re going to have to make that decision . I am in the Senate , and I believe that we are the jury . So , if the House brings the impeachment proceedings before us , we will deal with them . \u201d",
