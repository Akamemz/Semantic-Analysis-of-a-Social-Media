In addition to premiums going up , copayments going up , deductibles going up .

According to a Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimate released this afternoon , the Senate health care bill , the Better Care Reconciliation Act ( BCRA ) , would make every single one of the issues that McConnell mentioned worse .\nEssentially , the CBO 's report concludes that the Senate GOP 's health care bill would not solve any of the problems that Mitch McConnell said he wanted to solve .

But the Senate health plan would not halt those increases either . CBO estimates that if the plan were to become law , premiums would be about 20 percent higher next year than under Obamacare . To be clear , that 's a 20 percent increase above and beyond what is already projected . In 2019 , premiums would be 10 percent higher than under current law .

According to CBO , the biggest \u2588\u2588\u2588 why premiums would be lower , relatively speaking , in the next decade is because , on average , health plans would cover significantly less than they do now .\nThe Senate bill pegs its subsidies to health plans with lower actuarial values than Obamacare does ; these plans are known as benchmark plans . The actuarial value is the percentage of expected health costs that a plan must pay . What this means is that the Senate legislation is built around standard plans that offer less generous coverage than under Obamacare . At the same time , it leaves many of Obamacare 's insurance regulations in place . So in order for health insurers to offer standard plans that also comply with Obamacare 's regulations , they end up having to include high deductibles . Under Obamacare , plans that resemble the Senate bill 's standard plans typically have deductibles of about $ 6,000 , meaning that beneficiaries have to pay that amount before using their coverage .\nIn some cases , the deductibles would be high enough that they would limit the value of plans , according to the CBO , especially to low-income individuals . `` As a result , '' the report states , `` despite being eligible for premium tax credits , few low-income people would purchase any plan .
