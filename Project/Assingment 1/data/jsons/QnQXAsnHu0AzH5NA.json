What I would do, is I\u2019d make sure that by coming into office I would work with Congress to put in place a long-term solution for the children of those that have come here illegally.\u201d\n\nPressed whether that meant he would reverse Obama\u2019s decision, Romney said only that the directive would be rendered void by new, longer-term rules.\n\n\u201cIt would be overtaken by events if you will, by virtue of my putting in place a long-term solution, with legislation which creates law that relates to these individuals such that they know what their setting is going to be, not just for the term of a president but on a permanent basis,\u201d Romney said.\n\nThe GOP candidate added that he would assess whether or not to repeal Obama\u2019s rule while new his new law was moving through the legislative process.\n\n\u201cMy anticipation is I\u2019d come into office and say we need to get this done, on a long-term basis, not this kind of stop-gap measure,\u201d Romney said.\n\nThe rule change, which came during a Rose Garden announcement Friday, will allow people younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military to apply for a two-year deferral from deportation.\n\nRomney said the timing of the shift, coming less than five months ahead of November\u2019s general election, pointed to political motives on the part of the president.\n\n\u201cI think the timing is pretty clear, if he really wanted to make a solution that dealt with these kids or with illegal immigration in America, then this is something he would have taken up in his first three-and-a-half years, not in his last few months,\u201d Romney said.\n\nAsked by host Bob Schieffer if he made the change \u201cfor politics,\u201d Romney said, \u201cThat's certainly a big part of the equation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, White House Senior Adviser David Plouffe said the immigration rule change was \u201cnot a political move.\u201d\n\nAlso see:\n\nGolfer-in-chief hits 100th round as president\n\nLawmakers mum on health care contingency plans\n\nRomney sees bright side of rain-soaked campaign event",
