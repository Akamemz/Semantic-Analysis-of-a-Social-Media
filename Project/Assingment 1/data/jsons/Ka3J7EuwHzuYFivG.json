What they do n't have is the ability to do is expect me to stand by with a broken system in perpetuity , '' Obama said at a joint news conference with Myanmar dissident leader Aung San Suu Kyi , according to Politico . `` It 's way overdue . We 've been talking about it for 10 years now and it 's been consistently stalled . `` The president insisted that unless Congress issues legislation first , he is determined to act before the end of the year on proposals that are expected to include extending amnesty and work permits to possibly millions of illegal immigrants . `` I gave the House over a year to at least give a vote on the Senate bill . They failed to do so , '' Obama said , according to Politico . `` I indicated to Speaker [ John ] Boehner several months ago that if Congress failed to act , I would use all lawful authority that I possess \u2026 That 's going to happen . And that 's going to happen before the end of the year . `` Republicans have been ratcheting up their threats that Obama 's decision to act will set off an adversarial relationship with Congress so soon after both sides had pledged to move forward constructively following the shake-up from the midterm elections . `` We 're going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path , '' Boehner told reporters Thursday , according to The Washington Post . `` This is the wrong way to govern . This is exactly what the American people said on Election Day they did n't want . `` During his news conference , the president appeared to respond with his own warning to Republicans , saying he is against any approach to governance where `` having a disagreement on a single issue suddenly [ becomes ] a deal-breaker on every issue . `` `` Democracy can not work that way , '' he added , according to Politico . `` There will always be some differences . `` Obama also reiterated a previous promise that if congressional Republicans put forward a reform proposal , he will revoke any executive actions that he put into effect , Politico reported.The president 's comments come as Republicans grapple with a strategy to derail the president 's plans . A rift is developing within the party about the best way forward , threatening to undermine the party 's post-election pledges to proceed with unity.At least 50 conservative lawmakers are pushing to leverage the upcoming spending bill to force Obama to stand down . Their plan is to stipulate in the legislation that the president can not act unilaterally , an approach that would likely trigger a government shutdown when the president refuses to capitulate.The leadership has not yet developed a clear alternative other than ruling out the possibility of a shutdown .
