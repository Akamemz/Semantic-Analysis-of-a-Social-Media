    "content": "More than 45 million Americans live under the poverty line , and roughly 30 million more are near-poor ( defined as 1 to 1.5 times the poverty line ) , according to the latest Census Bureau data .\nthinking about poverty as being only about income levels obscures the important dimension of income uncertainty\nPoverty , of course , is determined simply by figuring out who earns below a certain threshold . Leaving aside the obvious problems with how we calculate that threshold , thinking about poverty in this way also obscures an important dimension of what it means to be low-income : uncertainty .\nAs author Linda Tirado explained to \u2588\u2588\u2588 last week , being poor is n't just about money being tight ; it 's about an inability to plan for the future . Volatile income wreaks havoc on finances as workers hope each month goes perfectly , both when it comes to money inflows and outflows .
