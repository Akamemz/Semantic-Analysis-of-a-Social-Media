    "content": "After staging his big kickoff rally in Philadelphia on May 18 , the former vice president had no public events on his schedule for May 19 \u2014 or for the rest of the week . He did a couple of fundraisers in Florida on May 20 and 21 , but there was nothing on the books for the next two days , according to the daily updates his campaign sends to journalists .\nHe spent a few days in New Hampshire in May , but he had nothing planned in the three days before his official announcement . ( And , as his campaign reminded us , \u201c from Friday , May 10 to Sunday , May 12 , 2019 , Joe Biden has no public events scheduled . \u201d )\nThe pace of the Biden campaign has even become a bit of a joke among journalists covering the 2020 race .\n`` No one 's going to work harder in Iowa than Joe Biden , '' said Joe Biden . pic.twitter.com/2iSO0DNKbD \u2014 David S. Bernstein ( @ dbernstein ) May 24 , 2019\nWhile other candidates have been criss-crossing the country at a frenetic pace and desperately clamoring for media attention , Biden is mostly sitting tight \u2014 doing relatively few public events and mostly doing interviews with local press rather than seeking the national spotlight . He \u2019 s done the fewest public events in Iowa and New Hampshire of anyone in the race . In part , of course , that reflects the fact that he got in later than the vast majority of the other candidates . And he did make sure to follow his announcement with a lightning tour of the first four states that made him quicker to hit all four than any other candidate . But while some politicians would have tried to compensate for the late start with a frenetic pace of activity , Biden \u2019 s approach is decidedly more measured .\nBiden is far better known than the vast majority of other Democratic contenders and has no particular need to attract attention to himself . Meanwhile , he \u2019 s jumped out to an early and seemingly robust lead in the polls that \u2019 s only further bolstered by Morning Consult \u2019 s finding that he \u2019 s currently the second-choice of Bernie Sanders voters , Kamala Harris voters , and Pete Buttigieg voters .\nBut as much as this approach has a solid tactical logic , it also intersects with two of Biden \u2019 s biggest potential campaign problems . Progressive activists hold a dyspeptic attitude toward him , and there are broader concerns among Democrats about his age and tendency to make gaffes . The best way for Biden to dispel both worries is to get out there in the day-in , day-out work of full-time campaigning \u2014 something that Biden \u2019 s camp says is coming but that we haven \u2019 t seen yet .\nThe \u201c less is more \u201d strategy makes sense from one point of view . Not only do polls give him a healthy lead over his Democratic rivals , they pretty consistently show him beating Donald Trump in general election matchups .\nThe predictive power of such early polling is questionable , but you \u2019 d rather be ahead than behind . And the fact that Biden is consistently ahead \u2014 and ahead by more than any other Democrat in head-to-head polling against Trump \u2014 offers a powerful statement about electability . This , in turn , helps drive Biden \u2019 s support in the primary .\nBut most of the other well-known Democrats running for president are also liked by the rank-and-file . There \u2019 s no particular upside to Biden criticizing them or to getting into big fights with progressive activists who \u2019 ve inspired a lot of the more ambitious policy ideas that his rivals are running on .\nFor many of the lesser-known candidates , wading into controversies about impeachment and other hot-button news topics can be a good way to get attention . Biden doesn \u2019 t need it . He is , instead , doing some old-school high dollar fundraising events ( some of which are open to a press pool , though not cameras or video ) and working with staff on the next phase of his campaign . Biden \u2019 s team views the launch video , a series of brief visits to early primary states , and the kickoff rally in Philadelphia as essentially completing a successful launch .\nA campaign official told me that the candidate has been \u201c engaged with advisers and policy experts ahead of releasing the first series of plans \u201d to showcase a \u201c new phase of the campaign centered on policy proposals . \u201d\nBut Biden \u2019 s Philadelphia speech underscored his belief that policy specifics play a secondary role . After briefly discussing environmental policy and calling for a \u201c clean energy revolution , \u201d the candidate explained that \u201c as long as Donald Trump is in the White House , none of these critical things are going to get done .

Trump \u2019 s effort to dub him \u201c sleepy \u201d speaks to the same vulnerability .\nThe start of Biden \u2019 s campaign pretty conclusively debunked the idea \u2014 widely circulated among extremely online progressives \u2014 that he is simply ideologically unacceptable to the modern Democratic Party .\nBut the only real way to address lingering concern about his age and stump skills is to go out there and hit the hustings . It does seem like his team is planning to pick up the pace soon , having already announced a coming swing up to New Hampshire , then down to Boston and Atlanta for June 4-5 in advance of the planned policy rollout . Still , the most-popular Democrat in the field remains by and large one of the least seen , and it \u2019 s not clear that \u2019 s really going to change soon .",
