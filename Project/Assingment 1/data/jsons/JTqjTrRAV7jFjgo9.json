Here \u2019 s what she said :\nMegyn Kelly wonders what the big deal is about blackface pic.twitter.com/07yvYDuAYe \u2014 Tommy Christopher ( @ tommyxtopher ) October 23 , 2018\nKelly was talking about Real Housewives of New York star Luann de Lesseps , who was called racist for darkening her skin to dress as Diana Ross . \u201c And people said that that was racist . And I don \u2019 t know ! \u201d she said about de Lesseps . \u201c I thought like , who doesn \u2019 t love Diana Ross ? She wants to look like Diana Ross for one day , and I don \u2019 t know how that got racist on Halloween . \u201d\n\u201c I want to begin with two words , I \u2019 m sorry .. The country feels so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and offense . I believe this is a time for more understanding , more love , more sensitivity and honor .. Thank you for listening and for helping me listen too. \u201d Megyn Kelly pic.twitter.com/6hHrvZLNvK \u2014 Megyn Kelly TODAY ( @ MegynTODAY ) October 24 , 2018\nHer comments drew heavy fire from other media members , who suggested that Kelly was racist for failing to take the problem of dressing in darkening makeup seriously enough . Al Roker of NBC \u2019 s Today said , \u201c The fact is , while she apologized to the staff , she owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country . This is a history going right back to the 1830s minstrel shows to demean and denigrate a race . It wasn \u2019 t right . \u201d\n1 . Blackface Was Horrific . The practice of racist white people donning black makeup to mock black people was a disgusting part of our history . The video of such activities makes the skin crawl . I \u2019 ve embedded such a video here to demonstrate that sensitivity toward blackface isn \u2019 t overstated in the slightest . This stuff is just the worst on every level .\nThere \u2019 s no question that blackface was intended to demean black people as stupid and ignorant and lesser ; blackface was evil . That history is relevant to discussions of whether it is appropriate to darken one \u2019 s skin today \u2013 and it \u2019 s perfectly understandable and justifiable why black Americans say no .\n2 . Ignorance Is Not Racism . Kelly \u2019 s comments were ignorant , by her own admission . But that doesn \u2019 t mean they were racist . If you knew nothing about the despicable history of blackface , and you donned black makeup to dress up as Michelle Obama , that might make you ignorant , but it certainly wouldn \u2019 t make you racist or anything close to it . In fact , we could fairly say that you were making a statement against racism by dressing up as a black person you admire . The question is whether you knew about the history of blackface and chose to ignore it anyway . If so , that \u2019 s at least racially insensitive , and perhaps racist . If not , ignorance does not equate to racism .\n3 . Ascribing Racist Motives To Non-Racists Is Wrong . Has anyone actually accused Megyn Kelly of being a racist ? Of thinking that black people are lesser , or that they ought to be mocked for their skin color ? To my understanding , not a single such accusation has been levelled at Kelly \u2013 which makes sense , since any such accusation would be unsupportable . There \u2019 s no evidence Kelly is a racist , and her comments were meant to point out that dressing up as Diana Ross in admiration for black Americans isn \u2019 t inherently racist . That \u2019 s correct . But activity doesn \u2019 t have to be racist in order for it to be racially insensitive .\nHere \u2019 s the bottom line : black Americans have every right to be suspicious of people darkening their skin for costumes , given the history of blackface . But immediately ascribing racism to people who have no history of racism , and who are simply ignorant of that history \u2013 people who are , in the costumes they choose , attempting to pay tribute to particular black Americans \u2013 is both counterproductive and nasty .",

This is a history going right back to the 1830s minstrel shows to demean and denigrate a race. It wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nNow, a few things can be true simultaneously.\n\n1. Blackface Was Horrific. The practice of racist white people donning black makeup to mock black people was a disgusting part of our history. The video of such activities makes the skin crawl. I\u2019ve embedded such a video here to demonstrate that sensitivity toward blackface isn\u2019t overstated in the slightest. This stuff is just the worst on every level.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that blackface was intended to demean black people as stupid and ignorant and lesser; blackface was evil. That history is relevant to discussions of whether it is appropriate to darken one\u2019s skin today \u2013 and it\u2019s perfectly understandable and justifiable why black Americans say no.\n\n2. Ignorance Is Not Racism. Kelly\u2019s comments were ignorant, by her own admission. But that doesn\u2019t mean they were racist. If you knew nothing about the despicable history of blackface, and you donned black makeup to dress up as Michelle Obama, that might make you ignorant, but it certainly wouldn\u2019t make you racist or anything close to it. In fact, we could fairly say that you were making a statement against racism by dressing up as a black person you admire. The question is whether you knew about the history of blackface and chose to ignore it anyway. If so, that\u2019s at least racially insensitive, and perhaps racist. If not, ignorance does not equate to racism.\n\n3. Ascribing Racist Motives To Non-Racists Is Wrong. Has anyone actually accused Megyn Kelly of being a racist? Of thinking that black people are lesser, or that they ought to be mocked for their skin color? To my understanding, not a single such accusation has been levelled at Kelly \u2013 which makes sense, since any such accusation would be unsupportable. There\u2019s no evidence Kelly is a racist, and her comments were meant to point out that dressing up as Diana Ross in admiration for black Americans isn\u2019t inherently racist.

But immediately ascribing racism to people who have no history of racism, and who are simply ignorant of that history \u2013 people who are, in the costumes they choose, attempting to pay tribute to particular black Americans \u2013 is both counterproductive and nasty.",
