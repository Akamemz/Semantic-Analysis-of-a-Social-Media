If , as some polls suggest , Hispanic voters are supporting Hillary Clinton by blowout margins , these numbers could sink Trump in a handful of states that are essential to his path to 270 electoral votes .\nIn Nevada , Latino turnout propelled Democrats in Clark County \u2014 the population center that 's home to Las Vegas \u2014 to a record-breaking close on Friday , driving up the Democratic lead in early ballots cast to 72,000 . That 's enough , according to veteran Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston , to essentially tie a bow on the state for Clinton .\nFour years earlier , when President Barack Obama won the state by 7 points , Democrats led Clark County in ballots cast by 71,000 at the end of early voting in 2012 .\nState GOP Chairman Michael McDonald responded to the sudden electoral tremors Saturday by suggesting there were shady dealings behind the surge , referring to \u201c a certain group . \u201d\n\u201c Last night , in Clark County , they kept a poll open till 10 o \u2019 clock at night so a certain group could vote , \u201d said McDonald at a Trump rally in Reno . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t in an area that normally has high transition . The polls are supposed to close at 7 . This was kept open till 10 . Yeah , you feel free right now ? Think this is a free or easy election ? \u201d\nIn his speech following those remarks , Trump suggested there might be wrongdoing at `` certain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County . ''\n`` Folks , it 's a rigged system . It 's a rigged system . And we 're going to beat it , '' he said .\nIn Florida , which tracks turnout by race and ethnicity , Hispanics have so far cast about 14 percent of the 5.7 million early and absentee ballots cast . That puts Hispanics far ahead of where they were in casting early ballots relative to 2012 .\nThat follows Florida Democratic strategist Steve Schale 's analysis , which notes that , through Wednesday alone , Hispanic turnout in 2016 had already exceeded \u2014 by 170,000 ballots \u2014 Hispanic early voting in the entire 2012 cycle .

In 2012 , 62 percent of all U.S. citizens voted in the presidential election \u2014 but only 48 percent of Hispanic citizens did . Meanwhile , higher percentages of white citizens ( 62 percent ) and black citizens ( 66 percent ) participated .\nThose numbers varied by state . In Florida , Hispanic turnout was actually a point higher than turnout overall .

How accurately are they portraying Hispanics and their voting intentions going into Election Day ?\nThe current range of the Hispanic vote breakdown in national polls underscores the difficulty in capturing the right mix of Latino voters .\nClinton \u2019 s leads in national polls among Hispanics range from just 15 points \u2014 which would represent a dramatic decline from 2012 , when exit polls suggested Obama won Hispanics 71 percent to 27 percent \u2014 to a 55-point lead in one poll that would represent a historic margin .\nVariances between polls among such a small subgroup are common ; Hispanics are expected to make up , at most , 1 in 10 voters nationally .
