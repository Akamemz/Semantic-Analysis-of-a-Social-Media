Scott Walker and Arizona \u2019 s new Republican governor are delaying big dreams of nixing the income tax as they face budget shortfalls . And Missouri Republicans , once jealous of their neighbor Kansas \u2019 massive cuts , are thankful they trimmed less .\nRepublicans once idolized Kansas Gov . Sam Brownback as a tax cutting superstar \u2014 now he \u2019 s a lesson in what not to do .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a cautionary tale on a national scale \u2026 Many of us felt that [ Kansas ] had been too aggressive , \u201d said Indiana Senate Majority Leader and tax committee chairman Brandt Hershman , who helped GOP Gov . Mike Pence cut corporate taxes last spring . \u201c We all like low taxes \u2026 but we have to ensure the stability of a revenue stream to provide basic services that our citizens expect . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a major turnaround from two years ago , when Brownback was considered a Republican trailblazer for conservatives around the nation who dreamed of phasing out their state income tax .\nNow , Republicans are rethinking how aggressive they can be on taxes in light of the projected $ 279 million revenue gap that \u2019 s plaguing Kansas this year \u2014 shortfalls that resulted in the state \u2019 s credit rating being downgraded and nearly booted the Republican from office in a state that bleeds red .\nOf course , Republicans aren \u2019 t ditching supply-side economic theory or tax cuts . But they \u2019 re considering ways to avoid Kansas \u2019 troubles . Their takeaways include smaller cuts over extended periods of time , stopgaps to protect revenues \u2014 and avoiding overpromising .\nIt \u2019 s making for an odd dynamic in which some Republicans now proudly say their tax plans will be \u201c incremental \u201d or \u201c evolutionary \u201d instead of \u201c revolutionary . \u201d\n\u201c Kansas did too much too fast , so at this point we \u2019 re continuing to look at our tax policy to make sure it \u2019 s competitive . But we \u2019 re not jumping \u2014 not following Kansas , \u201d said Missouri state Sen. Will Kraus , a GOP tax writer who in 2013 pointed to Kansas as the reason tax cuts were needed in the Show Me State .\nBrownback , in 2012 and 2013 , signed a two-part tax package exempting 191,000 businesses from income taxes and lowering the top income tax rate for individuals from 6.45 percent to 4.9 percent . It sinks to 3.9 percent by 2018 and even further toward zero each year if revenue grows .\nAlthough income taxes composed almost half of Kansas \u2019 general fund , Brownback said the cuts would grow the economy and attract new business , so that revenue would spring back quickly , essentially paying for the cuts . He had Reagan-era tax guru Arthur Laffer at his back supporting him .\nBut his plan didn \u2019 t pan out . Revenues are way down , and job growth remains below the national average . His own budget director says they may have to stop some of the tax cuts from going into effect , according to a New York Times interview .\nRepublican tax cutters in other states want to avoid that fate .\nIn Ohio , Kasich \u2014 a potential 2016 hopeful who has already cut $ 3 billion in taxes \u2014 is expected to roll out another income tax cut proposal in early 2015 . But two administration sources assured \u2588\u2588\u2588 they won \u2019 t have Brownback \u2019 s issue .\n\u201c The governor worked very , very hard in order to balance our budget and restore fiscal responsibility , and we \u2019 re going to be careful not to do anything to threaten that fiscal stability , \u201d said Kasich \u2019 s budget director , Keen , when asked about the upcoming tax plan and lessons learned from Kansas .\nUnlike Brownback , who slashed income taxes by about 25 percent right away then set up a system to reduce them more over time , Ohio has taken an incremental approach , giving taxpayers a 10 percent income tax cut over Kasich \u2019 s first three years .\nThey also have proposed to pay for additional cuts through a new oil severance tax increase . Brownback also proposed some offsets to his tax cuts \u2014 throwing out certain tax breaks \u2014 but legislators gutted those , making the cost of his tax plan soar .\nAnother difference : They won \u2019 t rely on optimist revenue growth assumptions , a major critique of Kansas \u2019 cuts .\n\u201c The governor [ has ] insisted on conservative \u2026 revenue forecasts , \u201d Keen said .\nOther states are looking at similar approaches . In Georgia , which is sandwiched by two states with no income taxes , Republicans want to lower the income tax rate . They don \u2019 t currently have the funds , said GOP state Senate Finance Committee Chairman Judson Hill , but when they do , they \u2019 ll protect against revenue shortfalls by taking things slowly to \u201c minimize near-term shortfalls . \u201d\nIn Iowa , state Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Tom Sands , also wants to eliminate income taxes but said they might have to go slow , starting with an optional flat tax .\n\u201c Instead of just flat-out rewriting Iowa \u2019 s income tax code and doing away with all nine brackets \u2026 by doing the option , you \u2019 re letting people move to the direction they want to head , taking a little , smaller step to where we need to go , [ which ] doesn \u2019 t create the huge swing you might see in a complete income tax rewrite , \u201d he said .\nIn Missouri , Republicans like Kraus proudly noted that while Kansas eliminated taxes on small businesses , they did only a 25 percent tax deduction to lower their taxes . And their income tax cuts were much smaller , he said : only half a percent , phased in over five years starting in 2017 .\n\u201c We \u2019 re trying to protect the core levels of funding so we don \u2019 t disturb \u2026 state government , \u201d he said .\nBy contrast , Kansas \u2019 cuts to education as a result of the revenue hit was a contentious issue in Brownback \u2019 s near defeat to Democrat Paul Davis last month .\nKraus also noted that Missouri tax rates would be drawn down further only if revenue hits a certain \u201c trigger \u201d threshold , protecting against big revenue losses .\nSeveral Washington-based Republican tax wonks said such triggers are something they expect to see more of to safeguard against what happened in Kansas .\nAnd their prediction seems to be on target . Hill in Georgia , for example , said a \u201c phased-in approach with certain milestones to be met before you trigger additional tax changes seems to be a wise and fiscally responsible way to do it . \u201d\nIn Indiana , Pence once pushed to ax the income tax , but now says the focus is streamlining tax laws and the state has \u201c no specific plans at this time \u201d to cut tax rates more , according to his budget chief .\n\u201c The governor right now is focused on simplification and reducing the complexity of the Tax Code , \u201d said Chris Atkins , the budget director .\nHershman of Indiana said they \u2019 re in an \u201c evolutionary phase rather than revolutionary \u201d phase on taxes .\nRepublicans say they learned another lesson from Brownback : Don \u2019 t overpromise that tax cuts are going to spur job and revenue growth right away \u2014 be realistic .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t promise that everything is going to change overnight , \u201d said Jonathan Williams , top tax adviser at the conservative policy group American Legislative Exchange Council , which lobbies states . Williams believes Brownback \u2019 s tax plan will pan out eventually , but he said messaging is key . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be a change of incentives over several months and years . \u201d\nHe said Republicans should tell constituents that \u201c not all tax cuts pay for themselves \u201d and warn about potential revenue shortfalls .\nAn Arizona Republican close to GOP Gov.-elect Doug Ducey , who wants to make serious changes to the state \u2019 s Tax Code , said they \u2019 ll communicate more realistically than Brownback : Though they think tax cuts grow the economy , \u201c we have never said decreasing taxes would increase state revenue . \u201d\nRepublicans have learned a budget lesson from Brownback , too : Make sure you have the money .\n\u201c What Republican generally learned about the Kansas experience was to make sure you have the budget handled before you embark upon the tax changes , \u201d said Stephen Slivinski , a senior economist at the conservative Goldwater Institute , who added that \u201c if tax cuts are ever going to be in the offing , you have to handle the budget and do so in an honest clear way to make sure there may not be traps that might have befallen the Kansas effort . \u201d\nAt least two big Republican tax reformers are already showing signs that they \u2019 re taking this advice .\nWalker has drastically scaled back his tax-cutting rhetoric since earlier this year and , according to two Wisconsin GOP sources , is putting his hopes to eliminate the income tax on the back burner .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to say the Laffer theory is disproven , but it \u2019 s a difficult time to advance that way in Wisconsin because our revenue numbers aren \u2019 t as robust as we need , \u201d said a senior Senate GOP leadership aide , adding that Republicans were disappointed that Walker tax cuts from earlier this year didn \u2019 t grow revenue as much as they predicted .\nEarlier this year , just before enacting the half-billion-dollar tax cut , Walker said it was just the beginning \u2014 that he wanted to eliminate income taxes . Now , a representative of Walker , asked about the elimination plan said the governor \u201c has only said that he would explore other areas of tax reform . \u201d\nThe state has a projected $ 2.2 billion deficit for the next biennium , 2015 to 2017 . There \u2019 s also a transportation funding problem .\nNow , not even his top allies in the House think new cuts aren \u2019 t possible .\n\u201c It \u2019 s more likely that we will not have an opportunity to do the same level of big bold tax cuts as we did in the past , \u201d said Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos , a key Walker ally . \u201c It \u2019 s unlikely we \u2019 ll be able to eliminate the income tax . \u201d\nElimination is also absent from Walker \u2019 s policy priorities document for his next term . He simply says he wants to \u201c reduce income taxes so that they are lower in 2018 than they are today . \u201d\nIn the meantime , Vos says they \u2019 re keeping an eye on Kansas : \u201c I definitely share the goals of the way \u2026 Kansas went , which is to say you want to reduce taxes on the people who create jobs so they reinvest by hiring more people . \u2026 But the jury is still out so I \u2019 d rather watch what happens for another year or two before we follow their lead . \u201d\nArizona \u2019 s new governor-elect is in a similar boat . Ducey ran on a platform of reducing income taxes as close to zero as possible , but his transition team is now facing a potential $ 500 million budget shortfall and court order mandating the state spend more on education .\nSo tax reform and tax cuts will likely have to wait .\n\u201c Because we \u2019 re facing such a large budget shortfall , I haven \u2019 t heard anyone speak of cutting taxes any more than we already have , \u201d said Jennifer Stielow , vice president of the Arizona Tax Research Association , who sits on Ducey \u2019 s budget study committee that will offer up recommendations for his first budget . \u201c It \u2019 s not the environment to propose something like that . \u201d",
