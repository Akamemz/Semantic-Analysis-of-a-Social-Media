But what are the real lessons to be taken from 2018 ?\nWhat the midterms can teach the Democrats about winning in 2020\nHow to beat Donald Trump ? As the final midterm results come in , it \u2019 s clear the elections were even better for Democrats than they at first seemed . Democrats won significant new legislative majorities , lured wayward voters home , reclaimed lost territory and broke new ground .\n'Democrats won the House but Trump won the election ' \u2013 and 2020 is next Read more\nYet anxiety is palpable among Democrats yearning to translate the 2018 blue wave into a 2020 White House washout . Is it possible the party might misplay what looks like a strong hand ?\nTrump is clearly vulnerable , with key pieces of his 2016 coalition \u2013 starting with educated women voters \u2013 calving off and his victory map in tatters . More than anything else , if suburban white women break against Trump in 2020 the way they broke in favor of Democrats in 2018 , analysts say Trump looks like a one-term president .\nBut interviews with pollsters and strategists from across the political spectrum reveal potential pitfalls for Democrats , too .\nVoter enthusiasm could slacken . A hollow economic message could squander the upper midwest . Inroads among educated voters could be reversed . And perhaps most chilling of all for Democrats : the party might nominate the wrong candidate .\nSo what are the real lessons to be taken from 2018 for voters looking ahead ? Here \u2019 s what some pollsters and strategists had to say .\nCelinda Lake , president of Lake Research Partners , a Democratic pollster and strategist , said \u201c a big story \u201d of the midterms was the role of women : candidates , donors , activists and voters .\n\u201c In all of these close races , to the extent the Democrats win , it will be because women took them over the top , \u201d Lake said , adding that Democrats \u201c won women by 19 points and lost men by three to four points , depending on the exit poll you \u2019 re looking at \u201d .\n\u201c The one group that have defected from Trump are college-educated white women , \u201d Lake said . \u201c Those Trump voters have gone Democratic and some have switched their party identification . That said , Democrats still lost white non-college-educated women by a pretty substantial margin . \u201d\nThe gender gap is insanely high , and it \u2019 s showing no signs of getting better Evan Siegfried , Republican strategist\nRepublican strategist Evan Siegfried said the party needed to find an answer to the exodus of women in the midterms .\n\u201c The gender gap is insanely high , and it \u2019 s showing no signs of getting better \u201d from the Republican perspective , he said . \u201c And yet the party itself is seemingly going to try and push more Trumpism . \u201d\nGoing state by state , the widening gender gap could spoil Trump \u2019 s map . Trump lost college-educated white women in 2016 by a 61 % -35 % margin , according to a voting records-based analysis by Pew Research . But Trump won enough of them to make the difference in large suburban blocks of Pennsylvania , Michigan and Wisconsin , and to come close in Minnesota .\n\u201c The gender gap expanded dramatically \u201d in Pennsylvania in 2018 , said Christopher Borick , director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College in Allentown .\n\u201c Throughout the south-east of the state , including the Lehigh Valley , you saw enormous turnout among women voters , \u201d Borick said . \u201c And the break [ toward Democrats ] , according to the exit polls , was just gigantic , and that made a lot of these races non-competitive in terms of Republicans \u2019 chances . \u201d\nStart with educated women , these pollsters and strategists say , and you have the first ingredient of what could be Trump \u2019 s downfall . But while women represent a majority of voters and are the most reliable voters in any election , other ingredients \u2013 other voting groups \u2013 will be needed for a Democrat to take the White House .\nNot every demographic showed erosion in support for Trump . Non-college-educated voters and rural voters , notably , did not show significant movement toward Democrats in the midterms .\nThe power of Trump \u2019 s base was reflected in the success of Republicans at knocking off Democratic Senate incumbents in states like Indiana ( which Trump won by 19 points ) , Missouri ( +18.5 Trump ) , North Dakota ( +36 ) and possibly Florida .\nBut Republican strategists worry that the Trump base is not big enough to win re-election , especially considering how tight his 2016 victory was .\n\u201c The base by itself can \u2019 t sustain this party , \u201d said Siegfried , who has urged Republicans to reach out more to millennial and non-white voters . \u201c We need to find things that are going to excite the base without alienating the rest of the country . \u201d\nThe Forgotten review : Ben Bradlee Jr delivers 2020 lessons for Democrats Read more\nOne reason Trump will not be able to replicate his 2016 victory \u2013 even if he repeats it \u2013 is that \u201c the electorate has changed already \u201d , with an influx of new , younger Democratic voters and a shrinkage of older Republicans , said Borick in Pennsylvania .\n\u201c Where you have seen declines in voters in the state are in Trump counties , because of age and other factors \u2013 that portion is modestly down already since 2016 , \u201d he said , \u201c with new voters coming in on the side of the Democrats . \u201d\nThe new voters drove Democrats to a national popular vote advantage in House races of more than 7 % , Dave Wasserman of the Cook Report has estimated , exceeding Republican margins in their huge wave years of 2010 ( +6.8 ) and 1994 ( +7.1 ) .\n\u201c There are some Republicans who have pointed to , \u2018 Oh , it wasn \u2019 t really a blue wave because we beat the historical average for seat losses , \u2019 \u201d said Siegfried . \u201c Um , we lost over 30 seats [ at least 32 and as many as 36 ] . It \u2019 s sort of like saying : \u2018 Yeah , the Titanic hit the iceberg , but all hands weren \u2019 t lost when it went down \u2019 . \u201d\nEducated women voters , young voters and some older voters , too \u2013 all those categories are on the move . But as Hillary Clinton found out the hard way , a popular majority does not always win the election . The map has to be right , too . So how does it look ?\nOne of the most painful losses for Democrats in 2016 was in Wisconsin , which had not gone for a Republican president since Ronald Reagan but which Trump won by less than 1 % .\nThe midterm result in Wisconsin potentially pointed to a better 2020 for Democrats . The Democratic Senate incumbent Tammy Baldwin beat her opponent by 11 points , winning generous margins throughout the state including the rural west . The Democrats finally threw out the Republican governor , Scott Walker , a top presidential prospect just two years ago .\nIn Michigan , the story was similar . Trump edged the narrowest of victories in 2016 , winning by 0.3 percentage points . But in 2018 , the state re-elected its Democratic senator by six points and Democrats picked off two House seats and grabbed the governorship .\nThese were major Democratic gains across levels of government Christopher Borick , Pennsylvania\nIn the upper midwest , turnout among non-white voters , especially African Americans , appeared to be robust , a line the Democrats will have to hold if they want to win in 2020 . Successful Democrats , meanwhile , managed to keep the margin with Trump \u2019 s base \u2013 non-college-educated , white , more rural voters \u2013 close .\nIn Pennsylvania , the story was similar . Borick said the state saw \u201c a really good night for Democrats \u201d that \u201c could have been even better \u201d from their perspective .\n\u201c There were Democratic blowouts at the gubernatorial and Senate levels , a pick-up of three seats in the House in addition to the one they picked up last year in the special election . They picked up seats in the state legislature , both the house and the senate . These were major Democratic gains across levels of government . \u201d\nBorick pointed out that the state delegation in Congress went from zero women to four overnight .\n\u201c In the state as a whole , compared to 2016 , you saw the counties that flipped from Barack Obama to Trump go really strongly for Democrats \u2013 Luzerne , Northampton , Erie \u2013 all Trump counties , were solidly blue across the races that were there . Turnout among Democrats was up . \u201d\nAnalysts say the Democrats are left with two basic map strategies for 2020 : take back the upper midwest , where Trump scored his surprise upset , or build on promising signs in the sun belt states across the south , stretching from Arizona , where Democrats grabbed their first Senate seat in 30 years and a majority of congressional seats , to Texas and Georgia , where the party proved it could compete .\nOlder parts of the Democratic map , however , appeared to be in trouble . States like Iowa , Missouri and Ohio , long a national bellwether , appeared to slide more decisively to the Republican column , despite the re-election of the Democratic senator Sherrod Brown in the Buckeye state . The Democrats appear to have suffered a double loss in Florida , in the gubernatorial and Senate races .\nNate Silver ( @ NateSilver538 ) So here 's an updated map showing House popular vote winners , mapped onto the Electoral College .
