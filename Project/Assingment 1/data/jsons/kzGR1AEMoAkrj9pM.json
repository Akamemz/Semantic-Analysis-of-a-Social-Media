    "content": "The United States has 328 million people . We have some of the most educated and creative minds in the world . But in 2020 , amid numerous crises , the two major political parties appear to be nominating for president , individuals so exceptionally flawed , that all one can ask is \u2013 can \u2019 t we find someone better than these two ?\nHas the U.S. transitioned into a Kakistocracy \u2013 rule by the least able or least principled citizens ?\nThe Democrats are about to nominate a man referred to as \u201c Sleepy Joe Biden. \u201d He is gaffe prone ; decades of gaffes insulting blacks , Indians , women , disabled\u2014to name a few . He also has a lifetime of plagiarism starting with law school papers and continuing on to Senate floor speeches and presidential campaigns .\nThe Republicans are about to re-nominate a man described by behavioral scientists as a perfect example of a \u201c narcissist \u201c . A grandiose self-image . An inflated ego . A continuous need for attention . A big urge to be admired . And if that admiration is lacking or the narcissist is criticized ( which is even worse ) , he lashes out recklessly .\nOnly 1 in 10 adults believe the two-party system works . Gallup finds 57 % of Americans say a new major political party is needed . The Pew Research Center report finds : \u201c Public trust in the government remains near historic lows . Only 17 % of Americans today say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right \u201c just about always \u201d ( 3 % ) or \u201c most of the time \u201d ( 14 % ) . \u201d\nA Real Clear average of polls for April 2020 finds only 35.1 % of Americans believe the country is on the \u201c right-track \u201d whereas 57.7 % believe it is on the \u201c wrong-track . \u201d\nHow did two political parties limit political competition to such an extent that they secured complete control of the government of the United States ?\nThe Republican and Democratic parties manipulate election laws to ensure one of their loyalists almost always wins the election . Controlling who wins directly translates into what laws are enacted , which citizens or corporations receive subsidies , who is taxed more or taxed less , how commerce is regulated and who will judge us should we violate any command .\nAccording to David Nir , in an article in the Daily Kos that references Becoming a Candidate , a book by Jennifer Lawless , there are 519,682 elected officeholders in the United States . Of this total the Libertarian Party , in 2017 , claims 168 of these officeholders ; the Green Party in 2016 held 143 offices , and the Constitution Party holds 12 offices . Many of these positions are non-partisan offices . There are also , at least 26 Independent office holders , including 2 U.S . Senators who caucus with the Democrats , and 26 Democratic Vermont Progressives . A basic calculation places the third-party competitors \u2019 share of the political market at 0.0007215 % .\nWhat makes the power of the two major parties so baffling is that political parties are not mentioned in our Constitution . In fact , for the first several years of our Republic , there were no political parties .\nA political party is merely a corporation designed to take control of government\nPolitical parties are nothing more than highly organized , demographically diverse , nonprofit associations of individuals , arranged in a corporate structure , for the sole purpose of controlling all government in the United States and by extension , us . This duopoly , through its many affiliates , has officers in every nook and cranny in the nation to ensure that a member of one of two major parties occupies every seat in government .\nBeyond excluding citizens , with different political viewpoints , from participating in the governing of the nation , Republicans and Democrats turn representative government on its head . Instead of allowing citizens to vote for a person who will serve as a fiduciary loyal to the Constitution and citizens ; the two major parties use their massive power to force us to vote for one of two individuals whose loyalty is primarily to a Republican or Democrat party .\nThis limiting of political ideas has led to decades of policy failures . On the most important issues , the two major parties are identical . Both parties have contributed to our massive national debt ; tolerate the abuse of war powers by the president ; and ignore a haphazard health system costing twice as much an any industrialized nation but leaving 30 million people uninsured or underinsured . These are only a few of government \u2019 s failed policies .\nProfessor Brian Porto , in his law review \u201c The Constitution and the Ballot Box \u201d explains that while political parties organized a few years after the founding of our country , it was not until the 1912 elections , when Teddy Roosevelt \u2019 s Bull Moose party received more votes than the Republican , and the Socialist Party received six percent of the presidential vote and won several congressional seats , 79 mayoralties and over 1,200 local offices , that the two major parties feared they needed protection .\nAs fear gripped the Republican & Democratic parties ; state legislatures began making access to the ballot more difficult for third-party candidates than for Republican & Democratic candidates , by :\nRequiring a significant number of signatures , e.g . 3 % of the vote in the last Gubernatorial race , while waving or substantially reducing the number of signatures needed by Republican & Democratic candidates ;\nProviding shorter time periods for third-party candidates to gather signatures than for Republican & Democratic party candidates ;\nRequiring third-party presidential nominees to file nominating petitions 8 months before the election and months before the Republican & Democratic candidates had to file ;\nImposing signature distribution requirements on third-party candidates , e.g . a certain number of signatures from each county or congressional district ; and\nRequiring new third-parties to nominate candidates for each office up for election in that cycle .\nEach obstacle acted to limit political competition and to ensure perpetual control of government in the U.S. by the two major parties .\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates \u2013 the ultimate slap in democracy \u2019 s face\nAn October 11 , 2019 press release from the Commission on Presidential Debates ( \u201c CPD \u201d ) announcing its 2020 debate schedule , and a March , 2019 court opinion , provide a glimpse into who controls our government ?\nThe CPD , a private organization , operating under FEC regulations , has government authorization to set standards that prevent third-party candidates from participating in presidential debates . The CPD has this power as long it does not directly endorse , support , or oppose a candidate , and selects at least two debate candidates . Moreover , those with the most to gain from the major parties , corporations and media , can fund the debates with tax-deductible contributions .\nNotwithstanding assertions of \u201c impartiality , \u201d CPD officials wear many hats , e.g . CPD board member and Chair of a political party . These officials can also take positions contrary to CPD when speaking in their \u201c individual capacity. \u201d Such looseness of structure allows the CPD to satisfy FEC requirements while setting \u201c objective \u201d standards not achievable by third-parties .\nThis controversy started immediately after the major parties formed the CPD in 1987 . Prior to the CPD , The League of Women Voters ( \u201c The League \u201d ) , sponsored the debates . When The League discovered the two major political parties secretly gave the campaigns control over questioners , composition of audience , and press access , it withdrew its support .\nThe League president , Nancy Neuman , characterized these actions as \u201c campaign-trail charades devoid of substance\u2026that would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter . \u201d\nFrom the inception of the CPD , only one candidate , not a Republican or Democrat , was invited to debate , Ross Perot , in 1992 ; at the request of the other participants . His debate performance helpd him garner 18.91 % of the popular vote .\nBefore the 2000 election , the CPD amended its criteria to require participants to secure at least 15 % support in selected polls . This requirement is rarely achieved by a third-party candidate , and is much higher than required for state ballot qualification or public financing . Ralph Nader , Green party candidate on the ballot in 43 states , was so angry , the CPD had to physically bar him from the debates .\nThe real action however , was in the courts . Level the Playing Field and Gary Johnson , Libertarian Party , litigated against the 15 % poll criteria alleging FEC and CPD regulatory non-compliance and violations of First Amendment rights and the anti-trust laws . The FEC and the federal courts , in derogatory fashion , dismissed all complaints leaving the two major parties in complete control of the debates .\nAn appeals court noted : \u201c Every four years , we suffer through the celebration of democracy ( and national nightmare ) that is a presidential election . \u201d\nThe trial court dismissed as \u201c old news \u201d statements by the Republican chair of the CPD , that the Commission \u201c was not likely to look with favor on including third-party candidates in the debates \u201d and the Democratic chair saying he \u201c personally believed the panel should exclude third-party candidates from the debates. \u201d Also , the \u201c CPD director asserted CPD officials are \u201c permitted to wear multiple hats and can speak freely \u2026 in [ their ] \u2026 personal capacity . \u201d\nThe two major parties rig the system , so they win !
