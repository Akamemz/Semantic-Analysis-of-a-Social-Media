    "content": "To become the 45th president of the United States , Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump has to win 270 electoral college votes . The candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal combat , but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor . ( Well , probably . If there \u2019 s a 269-vote tie , or a mandatory recount , prepare for constitutional chaos . )\nEach state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes , ultimately based on its population . California has the most , with 55 . Seven states \u2013 Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont and Wyoming \u2013 have just three electoral votes . Washington DC gets three too .\nWhile there are 50 states in the US , most of these are \u201c safely \u201d Republican or Democrat . They vote the same way every time going back at least six elections . So the presidential election boils down to just a handful of \u201c swing states \u201d \u2013 the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both Republicans and Democrats .\nThis is why voters in places such as Ohio , Florida , Iowa , North Carolina , Virginia , Nevada , Colorado and New Hampshire are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops . It \u2019 s also why you have not seen Clinton and Trump holding rallies in Louisiana ( safely Republican ) or Washington ( safely Democratic ) .\nTrump faces a much more difficult path to victory . He needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next president , whereas if Clinton wins two or three , she wins the race .\nThis is because Democrats start from a stronger position . There are 18 states plus DC that have voted for a Democrat for president in every election since 1992 . That batch amounts to 242 electoral votes . There are only 13 states that have voted for a Republican in every election since 1992 . Those states carry just 102 electoral votes .\nIf Clinton simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent past , then adds Florida ( which has 29 electoral votes ) , she is the next president . If she loses Florida but wins , say , Virginia and North Carolina , she will be the next president .\nTrump needs to hold on to all the historically Republican states , win states such as Georgia and Arizona \u2013 which are usually Republican but where he has struggled in the polls \u2013 and then win enough swing states to tip him over 270 .\n( For our international readers following along across Europe and beyond , a little light math for you ... in the UK , Ireland , Iceland and Portugal , add five hours to ET ; anywhere else from Poland west , add six hours ; in eastern Europe , add seven hours ; Australia add 16 hours ; and so on . )\n6pm ET ( 5pm CT , 4pm MT , 3pm PT , 11pm GMT ) \u2013 let \u2019 s go !\nBuckle in because now the real fun begins : polls close in eastern Kentucky and most of Indiana . ( Parts of each state are on central time , so the polls there close at 7pm ET . )\nMike Pence , Trump \u2019 s running mate , is the governor of Indiana . In the past 50 years the state has voted Democrat only once \u2013 for Barack Obama in 2008 .\nIn some states we will know the winner almost immediately after the polls close . Most news outlets , including \u2588\u2588\u2588 , rely on the Associated Press to \u201c call \u201d races .\nAP is able to announce the winners so quickly because it deploys thousands of people on election night to collect results from states , counties and locales as they are announced . It also uses exit polls and voting history .\nSolidly Democratic or Republican states are likely to be called quickly . Swing states are likely to take longer .\nElection drinking : Donald Trump doesn \u2019 t drink . But Donald Trump doesn \u2019 t have to worry about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency . A nice way to toast \u2013 and mock , if you were minded to do so \u2013 the 70-year-old builder might be to mix up a \u201c The Donald \u201d cocktail as you settle in for the night . It \u2019 s got vodka , Goldschl\u00e4ger gold-leaf cinnamon schnapps and orange juice . But the most fun bit is the cotton candy on top . Doesn \u2019 t it look just like his hair ?\nElection fuel : It could be a long night , or a short one . But at this stage we likely do not yet know , so our advice is to fuel yourself for a marathon , not a sprint . And you can feed yourself and honour Ohio \u2019 s prominent role in US elections by preparing a Cincinnati chili . It \u2019 s a more Mediterranean take on your traditional chili , brought to Cincinnati by Macedonians in the 1920s . If you \u2019 re drinking more than one of \u201c The Donald \u201d cocktails , you will want to line your stomach !\nElection soundtrack : Rolling Stones , You Can \u2019 t Always Get What You Want . A perfect kick-off to election night , given that both candidates are incredibly unpopular with the American public . Trump likes the Rolling Stones and played this song at his rallies . The Rolling Stones do not like Donald Trump , and asked him to stop . He didn \u2019 t .\n7pm ET ( 6pm CT , 5pm MT , 4pm PT , 12am GMT )\nVoting ends in three key swing states : Virginia , Florida and New Hampshire ( where a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 8pm ET ) .\nFlorida \u2019 s 29 electoral college votes have proved crucial in the recent past . Al Gore can tell you that . He narrowly lost the state \u2013 some still believe he actually won \u2013 and the election to George W Bush , despite winning the national popular vote .\nAway from the top of the ticket , Florida senator and one-time Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio is up for re-election . He has been running a bit ahead of Democrat Patrick Murphy in the polls . Debbie Wasserman-Schultz , who resigned as chair of the Democratic National Committee in July after leaked emails showed the party favoring Clinton \u2019 s campaign , is expected to comfortably win re-election to Congress .\nVirginia was a reliably Republican state until Obama won there in 2008 and again in 2012 . The state \u2019 s mix of less-educated , rural voters ; wealthy suburbanites ; federal government employees and military families ; academics ; jet-setters and so on make it difficult to read , but Clinton has been decisively ahead this year .\nNew Hampshire has been won by a Democrat in five of the past six presidential elections . But the Granite State gave Trump his first big primary win , and recent polling here has shown a tight race .\nOther states closing at 7pm ET include South Carolina and Vermont \u2013 Bernie Sanders \u2019 home state . Sanders won the Democratic primary in Vermont by an amazing 73 points . But now he \u2019 s with her .\nElection drinking : Supercall.com has a cocktail called \u201c Hillary \u2019 s Dirty Little Secret \u201d . It \u2019 s a vodka martini with hot sauce in it , a reference to an interview in April where Clinton said she always carried a bottle of hot sauce . You could quip to your friends that it \u2019 s a perfect choice , as the race is \u201c beginning to heat up ! \u201d\n7.30pm ET ( 6.30pm CT , 5.30pm MT , 4.30pm PT , 12.30am GMT )\nPolls close in West Virginia , North Carolina and Ohio . Expect the result from West Virginia very quickly \u2013 Trump should win easily .\nNorth Carolina and Ohio are swing states and will take longer . Ohio has been seen as a reliable bellwether state , voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964 . That run might be coming to an end , however , either because of the state \u2019 s changing demographics or because of the strangeness of the current contest , in terms of the unfavorability of both candidates .\nWhile its demographics are complicated \u2013 a mix of Rust Belt , big cities , Appalachia , farmland and more \u2013 the Ohio electorate has grown more white and less educated than the national mean . That trend appears to account in part for Trump \u2019 s strength in the Buckeye State this year .\nElection soundtrack : The Pretenders , Message of Love . Because Chrissie Hynde is was born in Akron , Ohio . You could also make a point about spreading a message of love . Or of someone pretending to spread a message of love . Not that we \u2019 re questioning , in any way at all , how much politicians love the voters .\n8pm ET ( 7pm CT , 6pm MT , 5pm PT , 1am GMT )\nIn 2012 , the Associated Press called the Indiana result just before 8pm . Vigo County , which borders Illinois in west Indiana , is seen as the ultimate bellwether . It has voted for the winner of every presidential election in 30 of the past 32 elections \u2013 dating back to 1888 . Keep an eye out for its result .\nA big swing state closes its polls at 8pm : Pennsylvania .\nRepublicans have long dreamed of winning Pennsylvania \u2019 s 20 electoral college votes , based on growing support among once flourishing manufacturing and mining sectors in the south-western and north-eastern corners of the state . But Clinton has been creaming Trump in polls in Philadelphia and its suburbs , which is where most of the people live , and she has been comfortably ahead in statewide polls for months .\nPennsylvania will also be under scrutiny on election day because of Trump \u2019 s controversial claims that there has been voter fraud in Philadelphia in the past and his calls for \u201c volunteer election monitors \u201d .\nThe results in non-swing states will start to come in thick and fast . Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Maryland , Massachusetts , Mississippi , Missouri , New Jersey and Rhode Island all close at 8pm ET , and we can expect AP to call all these states pretty much immediately .\nMaine \u2019 s polls also close at 8pm . It is one of only two states \u2013 the other is Nebraska , where voting finishes at 9pm \u2013 that splits its electoral votes according to congressional district .\nThe state as a whole is likely to vote Democrat , but Trump may steal an electoral vote in Maine \u2019 s second district , which is made up of more rural voters .\nElection fuel : There \u2019 s a whole \u201c Chefs for Hillary \u201d page on Pinterest , a tribute to Clinton \u2019 s attempts to win the foodie vote . One of the recipes is provided by John Podesta , the chairman of Clinton \u2019 s campaign . It \u2019 s called Salsa di Noci and is basically nuts and pasta , but arranged into a large \u201c H \u201d shape .\n8.30pm ET ( 7.30pm CT , 6.30pm MT , 5.30pm PT , 1.30am GMT )\nThe polls in Georgia close at 7pm or 8pm , depending on location . In the 2012 election , Mitt Romney was declared the winner just before 8.30pm . A Democratic candidate hasn \u2019 t won in Georgia since proper southern boy Bill Clinton in 1992 , but strong support for Hillary Clinton in Georgia counties with a high African American population , and in Atlanta , have made her a threat to Trump .\nIf Clinton wins Georgia , Trump might as well concede . ( Don \u2019 t hold your breath . )\nElection tunes : Marvin Gaye , Inner City Blues ( Make Me Wan na Holler ) . The African American vote is in , and Trump gets a big 1 % .\n9pm ET ( 8pm CT , 7pm MT , 6pm PT , 2am GMT )\nPolls close in two traditional swing states : Wisconsin and Colorado , and in Arizona , which is usually firmly Republican but is swingy this year .\nAn increasingly influential Hispanic bloc and Mormons who can \u2019 t stand Trump \u2013 not to mention a superior Democratic ground game \u2013 mean that Clinton has a decent chance of becoming the first Democrat to win Arizona since her husband in 1996 .\nWhen the polls close in New York , at 9pm ET , they will have been open for 15 hours \u2013 the longest polling window of any state . Barring an almighty upset , Clinton will quickly be declared the winner .\nWyoming , Louisiana , North and South Dakota , Kansas and Texas all close at 9pm too . The networks should swiftly call these for Trump \u2026 unless loose talk of Clinton taking Texas , which last went Democratic in the Watergate era , comes true ? If it \u2019 s that kind of night , water the horses and go to town .\nNebraska , which like Maine splits its electoral votes by congressional district , shuts its polls at 9pm ET . Barack Obama won Nebraska \u2019 s second district \u2013 Omaha \u2013 in 2008 . Clinton could do the same this year , thanks to a well-financed get-out-the-vote effort spearheaded by Susan Buffett , daughter of Warren .\nElection fuel : New York cheesecake . Hillary Clinton was born in Chicago but was a senator from New York for eight years . Donald Trump was born in Queens , New York , before inheriting his father \u2019 s successful real estate business . In January , Trump claimed his popularity was such that he could \u201c stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue [ in New York City ] and shoot somebody \u201d without losing voters . Trump has been trailing Clinton by 20 % in New York .\nElection soundtrack : Fleetwood Mac , Silver Springs . \u201c I know I could \u2019 ve loved you , but you would not let me , \u201d laments Arizona \u2019 s Stevie Nicks . Might Trump be thinking the same thing when the Grand Canyon State \u2019 s results come in ?\n10pm ET ( 9pm CT , 8pm MT , 7pm PT , 3am GMT )\nGiven Clinton \u2019 s apparent strength in Pennsylvania , we may see the state called for her by 10pm ( or , in a deeply troubling upset for her , Trump may win ) . The New Hampshire result should also come in around this time . They will offer one of the first concrete indications of how the night is going .\nNevada and Iowa are the final swing states to close their polls . In the past two elections , Iowa was called quickly for Obama . Montana and Utah also close at 10pm ; both are traditionally safe Republican states , but Trump \u2019 s unpopularity means independent Evan McMullin , who \u2019 s from Utah , has a strong chance of becoming the first non-Republican or Democrat to win electoral college votes since 1968 .\nUtah has been called soon after the polls close in the recent past . If McMullin is declared the winner , it \u2019 s a good sign that the night is truly in uncharted territory , terra incognita , in the most exciting way . Former congressional staffer Evan McMullin : buckle up , America .\nMore election drinking : Yuengling brewery \u2013 the oldest brewery in the US \u2013 is based in Pennsylvania . Its owner came out in support of Trump in October , a move which has seen some drinkers boycotting the beer . You could however source some craft ale from the Victory Brewing Company , also based in Pennsylvania . We might be getting an idea of who will be victorious around this time .\nElection soundtrack : Neon Trees , Your Surrender . It \u2019 s almost definitely not about conceding a presidential election , but if Trump fails to win Utah , Neon Trees \u2019 home state , then he might want to think about surrendering to Clinton .\n11pm ET ( 10pm CT , 9pm MT , 8pm PT , 4am GMT ) ... and beyond\nPolls in California , Hawaii , Oregon and Washington close at 11pm ET . These are all safe Democrat states that are unlikely to unexpectedly impact the outcome .\nBack in 2012 , the Associated Press called the swing states of Colorado , Iowa , North Carolina and Ohio \u2013 worth a combined 48 electoral votes \u2013 in the space of 30 minutes at around 11pm , then declared Obama \u2019 s re-election at 11.38pm .\nIn 2008 , networks announced Obama had won just after 11pm .\nWe might know the outcome sooner this time . Or we might not know for a while .\nIf Clinton \u2019 s lead in opinion polls translates to the actual polls , then we may see states called for her earlier , on the back of strong early voting results . If enough swing states are called quickly , we could find out the result before 11pm ET . Or , if Trump proves the polls wrong , the race could as quickly run to him .\nSeparately , there are some individual states to look out for .\nOhio is one . Some polling experts believe that if Trump doesn \u2019 t win there , it is effectively game over . Fivethirtyeight.com gave him less than a 1 % chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the Buckeye State .\nLikewise , if Trump loses North Carolina or Pennsylvania or Florida , it also becomes very difficult for him to win .\nAnd beyond that , if Clinton can win Georgia \u2013 remember , these are usually solidly Republican \u2013 it would suggest she is in for a blowout victory that could see the election called for her very early .\nIn 2012 , Virginia was only called for Obama after midnight and Florida was not called for four days . Clinton is polling well ahead of Trump in Virginia , and strong early voting results might see her announced the winner early .\nElection soundtrack : Queen Latifah , U-N-I-T-Y . We may see the first female president , following a campaign marked by sexism and inappropriate behaviour towards women . Queen Latifah called out the disrespectful treatment of women in this 1994 hit .\nElection fuel : Cuban sandwich . Florida \u2019 s signature dish is said to have originated in Cuba or in Key West , part of the Florida Keys archipelago . It \u2019 s got ham , swiss cheese , mustard and pickles in it , and might be a good way to soak up the booze .\nIn the early hours , we would expect a victory speech and a concession speech \u2013though Trump has spoken of a threat that the election could be rigged and refused to say that if he loses he will accept the result .\nIf elected , Clinton would be the first woman to be elected US president . She has repeatedly spoken about breaking the \u201c glass ceiling \u201d in politics , and has chosen to hold her election night party at New York City \u2019 s Javits Center , which actually has a glass ceiling .\nIf Trump is elected , he will be the first person with his own vodka line to be elected president , and only the fifth president to have never held elected office .\nThe winner will have 73 days to set up a new government before they are sworn into office on 20 January 2017 .\nBut if you \u2019 re concerned about post-election withdrawal symptoms , don \u2019 t worry : the midterm elections , sometimes seen as a referendum on the president , will take place in November 2018 . All 435 members of the House of Representatives will be up for re-election , along with a third of the Senate and more than half the governors .\nAnd then , in summer 2019 , a whole new cast of hopefuls will announce their presidential campaigns , and the whole thing starts over again . Great !\nOn theguardian.com , obviously . We \u2019 ve got reporters and videographers stationed around the country . We \u2019 re liveblogging all day and night .\nNBC \u2019 s coverage of the 2012 election night was the the most watched of all channels , with an average of 12.1m viewers .

A perfect kick-off to election night, given that both candidates are incredibly unpopular with the American public. Trump likes the Rolling Stones and played this song at his rallies. The Rolling Stones do not like Donald Trump, and asked him to stop. He didn\u2019t.\n\n7pm ET (6pm CT, 5pm MT, 4pm PT, 12am GMT)\n\nVoting ends in three key swing states: Virginia, Florida and New Hampshire (where a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 8pm ET).\n\n\n\nFlorida\u2019s 29 electoral college votes have proved crucial in the recent past.

He narrowly lost the state \u2013 some still believe he actually won \u2013 and the election to George W Bush, despite winning the national popular vote.\n\nAway from the top of the ticket, Florida senator and one-time Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio is up for re-election.

The state\u2019s mix of less-educated, rural voters; wealthy suburbanites; federal government employees and military families; academics; jet-setters and so on make it difficult to read, but Clinton has been decisively ahead this year.\n\nNew Hampshire has been won by a Democrat in five of the past six presidential elections. But the Granite State gave Trump his first big primary win, and recent polling here has shown a tight race.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Spice things up Photograph: Erickson Photography/Getty Images\n\nOther states closing at 7pm ET include South Carolina and Vermont \u2013 Bernie Sanders\u2019 home state. Sanders won the Democratic primary in Vermont by an amazing 73 points. But now he\u2019s with her.\n\nElection drinking: Supercall.com has a cocktail called \u201cHillary\u2019s Dirty Little Secret\u201d. It\u2019s a vodka martini with hot sauce in it, a reference to an interview in April where Clinton said she always carried a bottle of hot sauce. You could quip to your friends that it\u2019s a perfect choice, as the race is \u201cbeginning to heat up!\u201d\n\n7.30pm ET (6.30pm CT, 5.30pm MT, 4.30pm PT, 12.30am GMT)\n\nPolls close in West Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio. Expect the result from West Virginia very quickly \u2013 Trump should win easily.\n\nNorth Carolina and Ohio are swing states and will take longer. Ohio has been seen as a reliable bellwether state, voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964. That run might be coming to an end, however, either because of the state\u2019s changing demographics or because of the strangeness of the current contest, in terms of the unfavorability of both candidates.\n\nWhile its demographics are complicated \u2013 a mix of Rust Belt, big cities, Appalachia, farmland and more \u2013 the Ohio electorate has grown more white and less educated than the national mean. That trend appears to account in part for Trump\u2019s strength in the Buckeye State this year.\n\nElection soundtrack: The Pretenders, Message of Love. Because Chrissie Hynde is was born in Akron, Ohio. You could also make a point about spreading a message of love. Or of someone pretending to spread a message of love. Not that we\u2019re questioning, in any way at all, how much politicians love the voters.\n\n\n\n8pm ET (7pm CT, 6pm MT, 5pm PT, 1am GMT)\n\nIn 2012, the Associated Press called the Indiana result just before 8pm. Vigo County, which borders Illinois in west Indiana, is seen as the ultimate bellwether. It has voted for the winner of every presidential election in 30 of the past 32 elections \u2013 dating back to 1888. Keep an eye out for its result.\n\nA big swing state closes its polls at 8pm: Pennsylvania.\n\nRepublicans have long dreamed of winning Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral college votes, based on growing support among once flourishing manufacturing and mining sectors in the south-western and north-eastern corners of the state. But Clinton has been creaming Trump in polls in Philadelphia and its suburbs, which is where most of the people live, and she has been comfortably ahead in statewide polls for months.\n\nPennsylvania will also be under scrutiny on election day because of Trump\u2019s controversial claims that there has been voter fraud in Philadelphia in the past and his calls for \u201cvolunteer election monitors\u201d.\n\nThe results in non-swing states will start to come in thick and fast. Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey and Rhode Island all close at 8pm ET, and we can expect AP to call all these states pretty much immediately.\n\nMaine\u2019s polls also close at 8pm. It is one of only two states \u2013 the other is Nebraska, where voting finishes at 9pm \u2013 that splits its electoral votes according to congressional district.\n\nThe state as a whole is likely to vote Democrat, but Trump may steal an electoral vote in Maine\u2019s second district, which is made up of more rural voters.\n\nElection fuel: There\u2019s a whole \u201cChefs for Hillary\u201d page on Pinterest, a tribute to Clinton\u2019s attempts to win the foodie vote. One of the recipes is provided by John Podesta, the chairman of Clinton\u2019s campaign. It\u2019s called Salsa di Noci and is basically nuts and pasta, but arranged into a large \u201cH\u201d shape.\n\nPodesta\u2019s Salsa di Noci Composite: Pinterest\n\n8.30pm ET (7.30pm CT, 6.30pm MT, 5.30pm PT, 1.30am GMT)\n\nThe polls in Georgia close at 7pm or 8pm, depending on location. In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney was declared the winner just before 8.30pm. A Democratic candidate hasn\u2019t won in Georgia since proper southern boy Bill Clinton in 1992, but strong support for Hillary Clinton in Georgia counties with a high African American population, and in Atlanta, have made her a threat to Trump.\n\nIf Clinton wins Georgia, Trump might as well concede. (Don\u2019t hold your breath.)\n\nElection tunes: Marvin Gaye, Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler). The African American vote is in, and Trump gets a big 1%.\n\n9pm ET (8pm CT, 7pm MT, 6pm PT, 2am GMT)\n\nPolls close in two traditional swing states: Wisconsin and Colorado, and in Arizona, which is usually firmly Republican but is swingy this year.\n\n\n\nAn increasingly influential Hispanic bloc and Mormons who can\u2019t stand Trump \u2013 not to mention a superior Democratic ground game \u2013 mean that Clinton has a decent chance of becoming the first Democrat to win Arizona since her husband in 1996.\n\nWhen the polls close in New York, at 9pm ET, they will have been open for 15 hours \u2013 the longest polling window of any state. Barring an almighty upset, Clinton will quickly be declared the winner.\n\nWyoming, Louisiana, North and South Dakota, Kansas and Texas all close at 9pm too. The networks should swiftly call these for Trump \u2026 unless loose talk of Clinton taking Texas, which last went Democratic in the Watergate era, comes true? If it\u2019s that kind of night, water the horses and go to town.\n\nNebraska, which like Maine splits its electoral votes by congressional district, shuts its polls at 9pm ET. Barack Obama won Nebraska\u2019s second district \u2013 Omaha \u2013 in 2008. Clinton could do the same this year, thanks to a well-financed get-out-the-vote effort spearheaded by Susan Buffett, daughter of Warren.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Brian Leatart/Getty Images\n\nElection fuel: New York cheesecake. Hillary Clinton was born in Chicago but was a senator from New York for eight years. Donald Trump was born in Queens, New York, before inheriting his father\u2019s successful real estate business. In January, Trump claimed his popularity was such that he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue [in New York City] and shoot somebody\u201d without losing voters. Trump has been trailing Clinton by 20% in New York.\n\nElection soundtrack: Fleetwood Mac, Silver Springs. \u201cI know I could\u2019ve loved you, but you would not let me,\u201d laments Arizona\u2019s Stevie Nicks. Might Trump be thinking the same thing when the Grand Canyon State\u2019s results come in?\n\n10pm ET (9pm CT, 8pm MT, 7pm PT, 3am GMT)\n\nGiven Clinton\u2019s apparent strength in Pennsylvania, we may see the state called for her by 10pm (or, in a deeply troubling upset for her, Trump may win). The New Hampshire result should also come in around this time. They will offer one of the first concrete indications of how the night is going.\n\nNevada and Iowa are the final swing states to close their polls. In the past two elections, Iowa was called quickly for Obama. Montana and Utah also close at 10pm; both are traditionally safe Republican states, but Trump\u2019s unpopularity means independent Evan McMullin, who\u2019s from Utah, has a strong chance of becoming the first non-Republican or Democrat to win electoral college votes since 1968.\n\nUtah has been called soon after the polls close in the recent past. If McMullin is declared the winner, it\u2019s a good sign that the night is truly in uncharted territory, terra incognita, in the most exciting way. Former congressional staffer Evan McMullin: buckle up, America.\n\nMore election drinking: Yuengling brewery \u2013 the oldest brewery in the US \u2013 is based in Pennsylvania. Its owner came out in support of Trump in October, a move which has seen some drinkers boycotting the beer. You could however source some craft ale from the Victory Brewing Company, also based in Pennsylvania. We might be getting an idea of who will be victorious around this time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Neon Trees Photograph: ddp USA/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nElection soundtrack: Neon Trees, Your Surrender. It\u2019s almost definitely not about conceding a presidential election, but if Trump fails to win Utah, Neon Trees\u2019 home state, then he might want to think about surrendering to Clinton.\n\n11pm ET (10pm CT, 9pm MT, 8pm PT, 4am GMT) ... and beyond\n\nPolls in California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington close at 11pm ET. These are all safe Democrat states that are unlikely to unexpectedly impact the outcome.\n\nBack in 2012, the Associated Press called the swing states of Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio \u2013 worth a combined 48 electoral votes \u2013 in the space of 30 minutes at around 11pm, then declared Obama\u2019s re-election at 11.38pm.\n\nIn 2008, networks announced Obama had won just after 11pm.\n\nWe might know the outcome sooner this time. Or we might not know for a while.\n\nIf Clinton\u2019s lead in opinion polls translates to the actual polls, then we may see states called for her earlier, on the back of strong early voting results. If enough swing states are called quickly, we could find out the result before 11pm ET. Or, if Trump proves the polls wrong, the race could as quickly run to him.\n\nSeparately, there are some individual states to look out for.\n\nOhio is one. Some polling experts believe that if Trump doesn\u2019t win there, it is effectively game over. Fivethirtyeight.com gave him less than a 1% chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the Buckeye State.\n\nLikewise, if Trump loses North Carolina or Pennsylvania or Florida, it also becomes very difficult for him to win.\n\nAnd beyond that, if Clinton can win Georgia \u2013 remember, these are usually solidly Republican \u2013 it would suggest she is in for a blowout victory that could see the election called for her very early.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Queen Latifah Photograph: Andrew Toth/FilmMagic\n\nIn 2012, Virginia was only called for Obama after midnight and Florida was not called for four days. Clinton is polling well ahead of Trump in Virginia, and strong early voting results might see her announced the winner early.\n\nElection soundtrack: Queen Latifah, U-N-I-T-Y. We may see the first female president, following a campaign marked by sexism and inappropriate behaviour towards women. Queen Latifah called out the disrespectful treatment of women in this 1994 hit.\n\nElection fuel: Cuban sandwich. Florida\u2019s signature dish is said to have originated in Cuba or in Key West, part of the Florida Keys archipelago. It\u2019s got ham, swiss cheese, mustard and pickles in it, and might be a good way to soak up the booze.\n\nTime for the the speeches?\n\nIn the early hours, we would expect a victory speech and a concession speech \u2013though Trump has spoken of a threat that the election could be rigged and refused to say that if he loses he will accept the result.\n\nIf elected, Clinton would be the first woman to be elected US president. She has repeatedly spoken about breaking the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d in politics, and has chosen to hold her election night party at New York City\u2019s Javits Center, which actually has a glass ceiling.\n\nIf Trump is elected, he will be the first person with his own vodka line to be elected president, and only the fifth president to have never held elected office.\n\nThe winner will have 73 days to set up a new government before they are sworn into office on 20 January 2017.\n\nBut if you\u2019re concerned about post-election withdrawal symptoms, don\u2019t worry: the midterm elections, sometimes seen as a referendum on the president, will take place in November 2018. All 435 members of the House of Representatives will be up for re-election, along with a third of the Senate and more than half the governors.\n\nAnd then, in summer 2019, a whole new cast of hopefuls will announce their presidential campaigns, and the whole thing starts over again. Great!\n\nWhere to follow\n\nOn theguardian.com, obviously. We\u2019ve got reporters and videographers stationed around the country. We\u2019re liveblogging all day and night.\n\nNBC\u2019s coverage of the 2012 election night was the the most watched of all channels, with an average of 12.1m viewers.

NBC will be superimposing a map of the United States onto the Rockefeller Center ice rink.\n\nFox News has Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier lined up to anchor its coverage of the night. They\u2019ll have Karl Rove and Charles Krauthammer on hand to dissect the results. Rove didn\u2019t have such a good time of it in 2012, when he refused to accept that Ohio had voted for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney. Let\u2019s see how he gets on this time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Megyn Kelly Photograph: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Hollywood Reporter\n\nABC will have George Stephanopoulos anchoring from New York City.

As well as Clinton v Trump, they\u2019ll be following congressional and senate races around the country. NPR has also commissioned an artist to live-paint a mural of the electoral college map, filling in states as they are called. You\u2019ll be able to watch that on Facebook.\n\nThe BBC will have Andrew Neil and World News America host Katty Kay stationed in Times Square.
