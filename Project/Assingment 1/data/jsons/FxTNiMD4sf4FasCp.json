    "content": "A White House spokesperson referred questions to the National Security Council , which declined to comment .\nEarlier Thursday , Trump tweeted that he expected a deal soon between Saudis and Russians to sharply reduce their exports . That sent Brent crude prices surging as much as 45 percent , though the rally soon weakened . U.S. prices were trading up more than 25 percent near $ 25 a barrel by mid-afternoon .\n\u201c Just spoke to my friend MBS ( Crown Prince ) of Saudi Arabia , who spoke with President Putin of Russia , & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels , and maybe substantially more which , if it happens , will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry ! \u201c Trump tweeted . `` ..... Could be as high as 15 Million Barrels . Good ( GREAT ) news for everyone ! '' he tweeted minutes later .\nBut it quickly became clear that Trump \u2019 s tweet may have been aspirational . Saudi Arabia in its own statement was more circumspect , only saying it sought a meeting of OPEC and other oil producing countries to discuss \u201c a desired balance to the oil market . \u201d\nOther sources said despite Trump 's statement , they hadn \u2019 t yet heard much about how the administration intended to press the two countries to reduce their oil output .\n\u201c The conversations are not aggressive , \u201d said one industry official who was recently briefed by administration officials . \u201c We don \u2019 t have a plan to force their hand in any way . This is serious enough that they want to have an agreement with the Saudis , but don \u2019 t expect them to hammer out a deal . \u201d\nIndustry sources said they did not expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to put aside their differences right away , however . Even if the two countries agree to cut their output , oil prices , brought low by the coronavirus pandemic \u2019 s throttling of travel and fuel demand are n't likely to rise enough to save U.S. shale producers , said Andy Lipow , head of oil consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates .\n\u201c Even if oil prices rally $ 5 to $ 10 a barrel from this morning , it \u2019 s not enough to put most shale oil producers back in the black , \u201d Lipow said . \u201c And one has to wonder what Trump promised in order to cut production .
