Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens , which the president declined to characterize at the time as an act of terrorism .\nRomney , 63 , clad in a red dress and gold jewelry , was initially scheduled to appear with her husband , who backed out citing a scheduling conflict , according to host Barbara Walters . But his wife deftly deflected her husband 's description of the female klatch as `` sharp-tongued , '' saying the candidate called the women `` sharp and young . '' Moments later , Goldberg asked Romney if her husband 's Mormon faith precluded him or their five sons from serving in the military and whether the Romneys would be prepared to console relatives of fallen U.S. soldiers . Many Mormons serve in the military and the faith does not bar them from doing so .\n\u201c He was serving his mission and my five sons also served [ on ] missions , \u201d Ann Romney replied . \u201c We find different ways of serving . \u201d\nAsked how she would explain to relatives of the fallen soldiers that her sons did not serve in the U.S. military , she continued , `` I would say it \u2019 s the hardest thing that a president and a first lady can do . We have the most extraordinary fighting men and women and we have to be grateful for them . \u201d\nWalters grilled Romney on abortion , and stem cell research , but noted she is not the one running for office .\n\u201c I am pro-life and I \u2019 m happy to say that , \u201d said Ann Romney when asked by Walters if her thoughts on the issue changed like her husband of 43 years . \u201c When a decision came across his desk to use embryos for experimentation , he could not have , on his conscience , created human life for experimentation .\n\u201c The most important thing we can do is have respect for each other in this dialogue . This is a tender , tender issue . \u201d\nFollowing Walters \u2019 initial question on abortion , co-host Joy Behar asked Ann Romney about women \u2019 s access to contraception , prompting Romney to say : \u201c I would love if you could get my husband on the couch , Joy . \u201d\nRomney continued : \u201c What I know is I am here to reflect the character of the person I know . Every decision he will make \u2026 [ will be based on ] is this is the best thing for America to go forward ? I think I know where his heart is . \u201d\nRomney \u2019 s appearance was part of the show \u2019 s \u201c Red , White and View \u201d campaign , which highlights political topics and has made the show into an unexpected daytime battleground with the election less than three weeks away .\nThe interview then took a lighter turn , as co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck asked Romney \u2019 s son , Josh , who was sitting in the studio audience , if he had any political aspirations .

I assure you [ Tagg ] didn \u2019 t mean it . \u201d\nAlong with first lady Michelle Obama , President Obama appeared on \u201c The View \u201d last month , saying the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya \u201c wasn \u2019 t just a mob action \u201d and warned people to ignore the \u201c terribly offensive \u201d anti-Islamic video that sparked unrest throughout the Middle East .\n\u201c That 's why we ca n't let down our guard when it comes to the intelligence work that we do and staying on top of not just Al Qaeda , the traditional Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan , but all these various fringe groups that have started to develop , \u201d Obama said in an interview that aired on Sept. 25 . \u201c You know , the tragedy is that Chris Stevens , the ambassador who was killed there , was actually somebody who was beloved by many Libyans . He 's one of the people who helped to guide our policy as we liberated Libya and got rid of Qaddafi , who had murdered not only Libyans , but also Americans . \u201d\nThat remark followed some lighter moments in the interview , including questions about the couple \u2019 s 20th wedding anniversary and whether the commander-in-chief is a \u201c romantic \u201d husband .\n\u201c He 's really good , \u201d Michelle Obama said . \u201c Actually , our \u2014 he tells this story , so I 'm going to tell it .
