    "content": "( CNN ) Calls to eliminate the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency , for years relegated to the far-left corners of progressive activism , have been thrust this week into the mainstream of Democratic politics .\nCracks in the dam became visible 10 days ago , when a group of demonstrators confronted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at a Mexican restaurant in Washington . They called for an end to the Trump administration policy that resulted in separating migrant families at the border and , as the viral protest heated up , began to chant : `` Abolish ICE ! ''\nLess than two weeks on , the demand -- a favored meme on the left -- has gone from a progressive fringe cause , mostly ignored even by some of the most liberal lawmakers , to a political message being embraced by a growing roster of influential national Democrats .\nFueling its sudden ascent have been a series of recent shocks to the system . On Tuesday , US House candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez delivered a stunning Democratic primary upset in New York after campaigning on abolishing the agency , which was formed in 2003 as part of a post-9/11 federal overhaul that created the Department of Homeland Security .\nTwo days after Ocasio-Cortez 's primary , New York 's Kirsten Gillibrand became the first senator and potential 2020 candidate to announce her support for the agency 's elimination . Less than 12 hours later , on Friday morning , New York Mayor Bill de Blasio joined the chorus , telling WNYC 's Brian Lehrer , `` ICE 's time has come and gone . ''\n`` I do n't think ICE today is working as intended , '' Gillibrand said Thursday night on CNN 's `` Cuomo PrimeTime . '' `` I believe that it has become a deportation force , and I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues . ''\nThank you , @ NYCMayor , for joining the call that seems the separation of children and violation of human rights as an inexcusable bright red line in the United States of America . https : //t.co/5Dwxq0XJ9T \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( @ Ocasio2018 ) June 29 , 2018\nIn a Facebook post on Saturday , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote , `` The President 's deeply immoral actions have made it obvious that we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom , starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our values , '' a line that mirrored her statements in a speech at a protest in Boston .\nProgressive immigration rights activists -- during both Republican and Democratic administrations -- have come to view ICE as a rogue agency that terrorized immigrant communities . Calls for its dissolution , once rare , are spreading .\nA group of 19 agents with its Homeland Security Investigations unit , which deals with complex investigations including transnational crime , recently wrote a letter to Nielsen asking her to break up the agency amid what they described as a debilitating conflation of their work with ICE 's deportation activities . Concerns over the public backlash to actions by the Enforcement and Removal Operations division were , they wrote , making HSI 's work impossible .\nIn their message -- first reported by The Texas Observer -- the agents reported that some jurisdictions had agreed only to `` partner with HSI as long the 'ICE ' name is excluded from any public-facing information . ''\nOn Capitol Hill , Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin is now working with fellow Democratic Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state and Adriano Espaillat of New York on legislation to eliminate the agency .\nIn an interview , Pocan said a recent series of aggressive actions by ICE had led him to conclude that it was effectively serving as President Donald Trump 's `` own political police force '' -- a tool for creating a sense of crisis to help build support for a border wall and other hardline immigration policies .\nFor Pocan , Trump 's call on Sunday to return immigrants who enter the country illegally without judicial proceedings was the last straw .\n`` The culmination of all those things , going to the border and then when the President started talking about getting rid of due process , was it , '' he said . `` You 're just kind of like , all right , this has gone way astray , and we need to start over . ''\nLeading progressives , like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and -- until Saturday -- Warren , have stopped short of calling for ICE to be terminated outright and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has circulated talking points advising caution -- arguing in a memo obtained by CNN that `` abolishing ICE without changing President Trump 's disastrous immigration policy will not solve the problem . '' They 're not alone . Some progressives on the Hill worry that wielding the `` Abolish ICE '' banner would be a political gift to Trump and his allies , and that Democrats should consider a more nuanced approach .\nRepublicans are casting progressive calls to abolish the agency and the recent momentum in the Democratic Party as a move to the far left , evidence that Democrats are weak on border security and immigration enforcement .\n`` Recent calls to abolish ICE are dangerously misguided , '' agency spokeswoman Jennifer D. Elzea said in an email . `` Instead of being insulted with politically-motivated attacks , the men and women of ICE should be praised for risking life and limb every day in the name of national security and public safety . ''\nActivists and progressive leaders are pressing on , becoming more aggressive in their push to abolish the agency , an effort many in the movement view as both a way to open up the debate over decades of bipartisan US immigration policy and , crucially , win elections .\n`` The Democratic Party had a reckoning about the crime bill , financial deregulation and about welfare reform , but it never really had a reckoning about their complicity in creating both the intellectual framework for this sort of policy , '' said Sean McElwee , a leading activist in the anti-ICE movement and early supporter of Ocasio-Cortez 's campaign . He cited the 28-year-old Democratic socialist 's unapologetic embrace of the issue as a key factor in her Tuesday triumph .\n`` She had an actual campaign strategy that revolved around ICE , and it was very smart , because ( incumbent Rep.
