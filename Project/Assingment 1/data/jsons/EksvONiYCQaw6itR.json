    "content": "If media wants to challenge the context and politics of Republican arguments , that \u2019 s their prerogative . There are plenty of legitimately misleading statements worthy of fact-checkers \u2019 attention . Yet , with a veneer of impartiality , fact-checkers often engage in a uniquely dishonest style of partisanship . And State of Union coverage gave us an abundance of examples of how they do it :\nHyper-precision fact-checking that creates the impression that a Republican is misleading the public : For this , take Politico \u2019 s insinuation that Donald Trump was lying to the public about abuse of women at the border . During the State of the Union , Trump claimed : \u201c one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. \u201d This contention is only \u201c partly true , \u201d according to Politico , because a \u201c 2017 report by Doctors Without Borders \u201d found that only 31 percent of female migrants and 17 percent of male migrants said they had been actually abused while traveling through Mexico .\nWhether Doctors Without Borders \u2019 scary statistic is accurate is one thing . Trump , however , was being called out for asserting that \u201c one in every three \u201d illegal immigrants has been abused attempting to cross the border rather than \u201c 33.333 percent of women \u201d \u2014 probably a rounding error in the poll . It is almost surely the case that every past president and every politician has used \u201c one-third \u201d or \u201c one-half \u201d rather than a specific fraction , and walked away without being fact-checked .\nFact-checking subjective political assertions : The New York Times provided a masterclass in bad-faith fact-checking by taking political contentions offered by the president and subjecting them to a supposed impartial test of accuracy . In his speech , Trump called the illegal border crossing \u201c an urgent national crisis. \u201d The New York Times says \u201c this is false. \u201d Why ? Because illegal border crossings have been declining for two decades , they say . Customs and Border Protection agents , they go on to explain , had arrested around 50,000 people trying to illegally cross the southwestern border each of the last three months , which was only half of the arrests they had made in comparable months in the mid-2000s .\nEven if those numbers are correct , there is no way to fact-check urgency . After all , a lessening crisis doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean it isn \u2019 t a pressing one . We \u2019 ve seen a steep decline in gun violence over the past 30 years . Would the New York Times ever \u201c fact-check \u201d a Democrat who argued that gun violence was an \u201c urgent crisis \u201d of public safety ? Of course not . But this fluctuating standard allows journalists to \u201c fact-check \u201d any subjective political contention they desire .\nIf I claim that socialism is the greatest threat to American freedom and prosperity , I may well be right . I may have a lot of historical and economic evidence to back up my assertion . You can argue that I \u2019 m wrong . You can lay out statistics that attempt to prove me wrong . You can call me crazy . But you can \u2019 t produce an unbiased \u201c fact-check \u201d establishing that my opinion is conclusively false . You \u2019 re just writing an op-ed piece .\nPartisan talking point masquerading as a fact check : \u201c FACT CHECK : President Trump praised the record number of women in Congress , but that \u2019 s almost entirely because of Democrats , not Trump \u2019 s party , \u201d NPR tweeted , correcting the record on a statement that the president never made .\nHere \u2019 s what Trump said : \u201c And exactly one century after Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote , we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before . That \u2019 s great . Very great . And congratulations . That \u2019 s great . \u201d\nYou can \u2019 t produce an unbiased \u2018 fact-check \u2019 establishing that my opinion is conclusively false . You \u2019 re just writing an op-ed piece .\nTrump was offering his rundown on the state of the union , not the Republican Party . It \u2019 s true that presidents take credit for all the good things that happen under their watch . Trump is no exception . In this rare case , however , Trump didn \u2019 t even take credit for electing the female politicians . In fact , he congratulated them after they broke out into cheers over his comment . Some people have argued that NPR \u2019 s piece was providing context to the president \u2019 s comment . Perhaps . Still , their nitpicking created the impression that somehow Trump had misled the public . He did not .\nFact-checking meant to obscure actual facts : The Washington Post \u2019 s fact-checking page offered a number of egregious examples of outright misinformation . In one of them , reporter Meg Kelly claimed that \u201c Abortion legislation in New York wouldn \u2019 t do what Trump said. \u201d There are a number of words in her post intimating that Trump lied about the New York and Virginia late-term abortion bills , but none of her words debunk Trump \u2019 s core contention . Ramesh Ponnuru has a good rundown here .\nHere \u2019 s what Trump said : \u201c Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother \u2019 s womb moments before birth . These are living , feeling , beautiful , babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world . And then , we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth . \u201d\nAs I \u2019 ve noted before , the biggest clue that you \u2019 re about to read a deceptive fact check on the abortion issue is an author mentioning that \u201c only \u201d few abortions of viable babies take place . \u201c Indeed , \u201d Kelly writes , \u201c only 1.3 percent of abortions \u2014 or about 8,500 a year \u2014 take place at or after 21 weeks , according to 2014 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Guttmacher Institute. \u201d This number , as Ponnuru points out , is almost surely low . Whatever the case , Trump never claimed \u201c most \u201d abortions were post-20 weeks . Whether 8,500 or 15,000 , thousands of viable babies are being aborted . No fact-checker would ever point out that only .0001 percent of legal gun owners commit crimes when talking about more firearm restrictions ( and yes , that \u2019 s an approximation ) .\nAnd yes , the president used a bit of rhetorical flourish to say that babies can be \u201c ripped from the mother \u2019 s womb moments before birth \u201d because , actually , they can be poisoned or dismembered in the mother \u2019 s womb moments before birth . Both the Virginia bill , which was tabled , and the New York law allow , just as Trump says ( in his blunt language ) , for the termination of infants who survive the abortion procedure . Absolutely nothing in the Washington Post \u2019 s \u201c fact check \u201d debunks the president \u2019 s contention that in New York , and elsewhere , abortion on demand until crowning ( and after ) is now legal as long as the woman and a doctor decide that the baby is stressful in some way to the mother . How often it happens is up for debate . What the bill says is inarguable .\nFact-checking a truthful statement by demanding that Trump highlight information that has absolutely nothing to do with his contention : An astute reader points out this PBS fact-check of a Trump tweet from a couple of weeks ago . I \u2019 ve noticed this genre , as well .

After confirming that , yes , Trump had been precise in his assertion regarding their poll , PBS spends around 700 words taking Trump to task for failing to highlight other negative information in the poll .
