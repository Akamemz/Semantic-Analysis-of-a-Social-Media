    "content": "After being defeated by Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) in 2018 , Robert Francis O'Rourke announced his 2020 campaign for presidency today in another attempt for a DC politician to fail upwards . O'Rourke , touted by some as `` Tex Kennedy '' with a driving record to compliment the actual Ted Kennedy , was met with little applaud from far left media personalities due to a variety of reasons -- chief among them his lack of progressive accomplishments .\nBeto was criticized by Slate 's Josh Voorhees in a piece titled , `` Beto 2020 Has No Reason to Exist : Of all the major candidates , he brings the least to the Democratic primary . '' Voorhees writes that despite national support and name recognition , `` Beto is missing one important thing , though : an actual reason to run . O \u2019 Rourke would enter the race as a man without a clear political ideology , a signature legislative achievement , a major policy issue , or a concrete agenda for the country . ''\nLikewise , Salon notes that far left environmentalists question whether the candidate can truly grind it out with other liberal candidates when it comes to the issue of climate change .\n`` There \u2019 s a lot in O'Rourke 's record we \u2019 re wary of , '' Janet Redman , Climate Director at Greenpeace USA , told Slate . `` Most notably his comment during a Senate debate last year that it 's a false choice between fossil fuels and renewable energy . It \u2019 s easy for politicians to simply acknowledge the existence of climate change in public remarks , the same way it \u2019 s easy to talk up solar panels . What \u2019 s harder is a real plan that acknowledges the urgency of the crisis , including a detailed vision for how to stand up to the fossil fuel industry in transitioning to a 100 % clean energy economy . We hope to see that from Beto O'Rourke in the coming weeks . \u201d\nHowever , perhaps these critics can be assured that Beto is surrounded by comrades with the right collectivist credentials . Joe Simonson of the Washington Examiner reports that the newest Democratic candidate 's top advisor is `` an avowed socialist who blasted the leftist father of community organizing Saul Alinsky as a 'paternalistic ' moderate who 'disparaged the idea of revolutionary change ' . '' As Simonson notes , Bond 's hire `` sends a message to Democratic primary voters who have previously questioned O'Rourke 's left-wing credentials .
