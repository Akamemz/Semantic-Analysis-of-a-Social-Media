    "content": "The debate is raging over whether the latest immigration bill is an amnesty for illegal immigrants , but one part is clear : The legislation would forgive businesses that have employed those immigrants illegally .\nEmployers who have allowed illegal immigrants to work off the books can come forward safely and provide their work history without fear of prosecution , and businesses that knowingly employed someone using a bogus or stolen Social Security number likewise would get a pass , according to an analysis of the bill by the Center for Immigration Studies , a think tank that wants a crackdown on immigration .\n\u201c The illegal workers at least have to pay a token fine . The employers of illegal immigrants who violated a whole list of laws themselves don \u2019 t even have to pay , \u201d said Mark Krikorian , executive director of the center . \u201c It \u2019 s the business side of the amnesty that doesn \u2019 t get a lot of focus . \u201d\nBusiness groups \u2019 support is considered critical to getting a bill passed this year , but attention has been focused mostly on a guest worker program and requirements that all employers would have to meet , such as using an electronic verification system to check potential hires .\nIndeed , it wasn \u2019 t until business groups , led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , struck a deal with the AFL-CIO on a guest worker program that the final Senate bill came together .\nThe chamber said the provisions exempting businesses from penalties \u201c had nothing to do \u201d with earning their support. \u201d Our focus in assessing the bill was looking to the good faith compliance and safe harbor provisions and other terms of the E-Verify mandate , the revisions to the high-skilled worker program , and the creation of a workable low-skilled worker program , \u201d said Blair Holmes , a chamber spokeswoman .\nThe crux of the Senate bill , negotiated by four Republican senators and four Democrats , would legalize most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. , but withhold a full pathway to citizenship for most of them until after the Homeland Security Department takes more steps to secure the border and implements the electronic verification system for employers .\nAll sides are still combing through the 844-page bill , trying to figure out what it would do .
