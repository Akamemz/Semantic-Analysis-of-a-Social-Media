    "content": "President Obama made US justice history on Monday , when he issued 78 pardons and commuted the sentences of 153 prisoners , the most to ever receive clemency in a single day .\nWith only a few weeks left in office , Mr. Obama is evidently hoping to cement his presidential legacy of clemency with the historic move , bringing the total number of people who have received reduced sentences or pardons at his orders to a total of 1,324 during his eight years in office .\nBut while Monday 's commutation of sentences reflects Obama 's view of the United States as a `` nation of second chances '' for deserving individuals , the president has by far preferred commutations of sentences rather than full-on presidential pardons . As he prepares to leave office , his clemency will be weighed in comparison to other presidents , and the historical forces at play that shaped their decisions to show mercy for imprisoned individuals .\nAccording to the US Department of Justice ( DOJ ) website , Obama had pardoned only 70 prisoners before the Monday announcement . The mass pardoning brings the total presidential pardons to 148 , a figure that pales in comparison with the 1,176 commuted sentences under his tenure . In total , 1,324 individuals have been the beneficiaries of Obama 's presidential clemency , but a pardon and a commuted sentence are very different .\n`` A commutation of sentence reduces a sentence , either totally or partially , that is then being served , but it does not change the fact of conviction , imply innocence , or remove civil disabilities that apply to the convicted person as a result of the criminal conviction , '' reads a post from the DOJ . `` A commutation may include remission ( release ) of the financial obligations that are imposed as part of a sentence , such as payment of a fine or restitution . ''\nA commutation does not remove the civil disabilities created by a conviction like a presidential pardon would . The right to vote , for instance , would not be restored to a person who was released based on the commutation of a sentence , but would be restored to someone who received a full pardon . While a pardon indicates the president 's forgiveness of a crime , however , a pardon is not the same as being declared legally innocent , and Obama actually lags most modern presidents in terms of full pardons .\n`` For the pardon recipient , it is the story of an individual who has led a productive and law-abiding post-conviction life , including by contributing to the community in a meaningful way , '' writes Neil Eggleston , White House Counsel to the President , in the White House blog . `` For the commutation recipient , it is the story of an individual who has made the most of his or her time in prison , by participating in educational courses , vocational training , and drug treatment . These are the stories that demonstrate the successes that can be achieved \u2013 by both individuals and society \u2013 in a nation of second chances . ''\nLike the presidents before him , Obama 's views on presidential clemency reflect his political attitudes in office . As the first African-American president , he has shown particular concern for a judicial system that disproportionately jails minorities , generally young Hispanic or African-American men imprisoned for drug-related offenses .\n`` If we can show at the federal level that we can be smart on crime , more cost effective , more just , more proportionate , then we can set a trend for other states to follow as well , '' Obama said after commuting the sentences of 95 prisoners last year .\nThe first uses of a presidential pardon to overturn criminal convictions occurred in 1794 , when George Washington pardoned John Mitchell and Philip Weigel , leaders of the so-called Whiskey Rebellion , who had been convicted of treason . The rebellion was a violent , if short-lived , revolt against one of the earliest taxes imposed by the fledgling US government on the American populace .
