In 1670 , a London jury acquitted William Penn and William Meade after the men had been arrested for preaching to a group of Quakers . In 1735 , lawyer Andrew Hamilton convinced a New York jury to acquit newspaper printer John Peter Zenger of seditious libel charges for publishing criticisms of the province \u2019 s governor .\n\u201c It is not the cause of one poor printer , \u201d Mr. Hamilton told the jury . \u201c It is the best cause . It is the cause of liberty. \u201d After the acquittal , Hamilton was given \u201c freedom of the city \u201d status , and left to a salute of cannons .\nCritics of jury nullification also have striking examples they can call upon , particularly all-white juries acquitting white men of lynching charges during Reconstruction and Jim Crow in the South . An all-white , all-male jury in Sumner , Miss. , acquitted two white men of murdering 14-year-old Emmett Till despite compelling testimony from two witnesses .
