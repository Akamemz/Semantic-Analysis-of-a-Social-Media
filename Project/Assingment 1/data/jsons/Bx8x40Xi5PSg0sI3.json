    "content": "Christopher Obal used to be a Christian . He grew up in Queens , New York , and when he was 5 years old , his parents left Catholicism for a very different form of Christianity . While they didn \u2019 t claim a specific denomination , he said the churches they went to would probably be described as Pentecostal , evangelical and charismatic .\n\u201c We attended churches where people spoke in tongues , and believed in the gifts of the spirit as well as a God who spoke to his people frequently , \u201d he said .\nAs an adolescent Obal was obsessed with discovering God \u2019 s plan for his life and doing God \u2019 s will . At the age of 18 , he attended Oral Roberts University , a conservative Christian college in Tulsa , Oklahoma . But while at college , he began to question his beliefs . Now , while he \u2019 s open to the possibility of \u201c god , gods , goddesses , aliens , universal consciousness , or whatever , \u201d he \u2019 s not affiliated with any religion . The rest of his family remains devoutly religious .\nObal is one of only a small percentage of Americans who grew up in religious households and are now religion-free . A 2008 report by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life found that only 12.7 percent of people raised in a particular faith eventually become unaffiliated with any religious group . Why did Obal abandon Christianity , while his friends and family remained faithful ?\nAs with many things regarding human nature , the answer is complicated . But a good place to start is the nature of belief itself .\nIt \u2019 s no surprise that most Americans believe in God , according to science writer and skeptic Michael Shermer . In his book \u201c The Believing Brain , \u201d he explains how belief was beneficial to human evolution . He said that \u201c the tendency to find patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise \u201d -- or , as he calls it , `` patternicity '' -- developed as a way to keep humans alive .\nHe gives the example of an early human hearing a \u201c rustle in the grass. \u201d Is it a hungry predator or is it the wind ? If the person assumes it \u2019 s a hungry predator but it \u2019 s actually the wind , he or she will come to no harm . But if the person believes it \u2019 s the wind when it \u2019 s actually a hungry predator , it could mean death . So , the tendency to be overly cautious and falsely believe leads to being able to pass on those cautious , believing genes . Or , as Shermer puts it , \u201c we are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns . \u201d\nShermer adds that once humans see the patterns , they tend to infuse them with \u201c meaning , intention , and agency. \u201d He calls this `` agenticity . '' How does this lead to supernatural belief ?\n\u201c God is the ultimate pattern that explains everything that happens , \u201d he wrote , \u201c the ultimate intentional agent . \u201d\nShermer cites studies that show a heavy \u201c genetic influence on intentional belief. \u201d And he says that \u201c people who grow up in religious families and later become religious do so because they have inherited a disposition to resonate positively with religious sentiments . \u201d\nIn the popular book \u201c The God Gene , \u201d American geneticist Dean Hamer proposed something similar . He said that \u201c we have a genetic predisposition for spiritual belief that is expressed in response to , and shaped by , personal experience and the cultural environment . \u201d\nBelief was a positive development for the evolution of our species , and we haven \u2019 t evolved beyond it . According to a May Gallup poll , 86 percent of Americans believe in God . The question now becomes : Why doesn \u2019 t everyone believe in God ?\nMany researchers have asked this same question . Some studies suggest that a skeptical brain works differently than a believing brain . One example is a 2012 study titled \u201c Is it Just a Brick Wall or a Sign From the Universe : An fMRI Study of Supernatural Believers and Skeptics. \u201d In this experiment , the participants \u2019 brain activity was monitored while they read a scenario , then looked at a picture . They were asked what thoughts that image would evoke if they were in that scenario , then saw that picture on a poster as they were walking down the street .\nFor example , imagine you just had a job interview . You walk down the street , and see a poster of a business suit . How would that make you feel ? What does that poster mean ? The supernaturally inclined were more likely to see it as a meaningful omen , a sign that they would get the job . The skeptics in the group did not see any significance in the image .\nThe researchers found that one region of the brain ( the right inferior frontal gyrus ) \u201c was activated more strongly in skeptics than in supernatural believers. \u201d The more active that part of the brain , the less likely participants were to find supernatural meaning in the images . The researchers think this is because the active region of the brain is associated with cognitive inhibition .\nCognitive inhibition is the mind \u2019 s ability to stop or override a certain mental process -- the ability to stop unwanted thoughts , for example , or to weed out irrelevant information . One example of where cognitive inhibition is useful is in overcoming prejudice . If people want to avoid discriminating , they need to inhibit or suppress any negative stereotypes they might have toward a certain group of people .\nFor the people in the study , seeing a business suit in a poster was not logically connected to their chances of getting the job in any way . Still , supernatural believers found meaning there . They weren \u2019 t willing ( or able ) to suppress the thought that \u201c this is a sign I will get the job. \u201d The findings of this study supported the researchers \u2019 hypothesis that \u201c a skeptical attitude toward supernatural phenomena is associated with stronger cognitive inhibition. \u201d And , as many skeptics formerly held supernatural beliefs , the researchers propose that \u201c developmental increases in cognitive inhibition may be among the factors that contribute to the decline of these beliefs . \u201d\nIt may have been just this that led Elizabeth Cady , a former evangelical Christian currently living in San Francisco , to her current agnosticism . When asked what it was that made her change her beliefs , she had a quick response .\n\u201c I had some gay friends in high school , \u201d she said , \u201c that got me into the questioning thing . \u201d\nForming a positive relationship with people who were condemned by her religion required that she inhibit her religious belief that \u201c homosexuality is bad. \u201d This led her to question other beliefs as well . She wouldn \u2019 t be able to question those beliefs if she wasn \u2019 t able to suppress her church teachings in the first place .\nBritish blogger Jonny Scaramanga had a similar experience . Scaramanga grew up in in a fundamentalist Christian household in England and is now an atheist . His journey to atheism began with listening to secular music and being surprised at how he felt .\n\u201c That music made me feel happier than Christian music ever had , which contradicted what I 'd been taught , \u201d he said . \u201c It also made me comfortable with listening to ideas I did n't agree with , and it made me feel like non-Christians were n't so bad . \u201d\nThis is another example of strong cognitive inhibition . He was able to suppress the belief that secular music was evil , and that led to his being able to entertain other ideas that conflicted with his religious beliefs .\nOf course , one \u2019 s brain isn \u2019 t the only factor in whether or not someone is religious . The biggest factor in someone \u2019 s current religious belief is his or her parents \u2019 religious belief . As noted earlier , Shermer thinks this is mainly because of an inherited genetic predisposition . But Vern L. Bengtson and Norella M. Putney , the authors of the book \u201c Families and Faith : How Religion Is Passed Down Across Generations , \u201d have a different , more sociological approach . They looked at the progression of religious faith from parents to children in order to figure out \u201c what families should or should not do to be effective in sustaining religious continuity . \u201d\nNot surprisingly , the biggest factor in parents being able to successfully pass on their religion to their children was their relationship with their children . The authors found that \u201c parents who interact with their children during their formative years in a warm , affirming and respectful manner are more likely to pass on their religious tradition , beliefs , and practices. \u201d Other things that aid successful transmission include having parents of the same faith who do not divorce and having a strong relationship with grandparents of the same faith .\nOn the other hand , religious conflict between parents and children was one of the most common routes from religion to atheism . If resistant children were forced into religious activities , they often rebelled as soon as they had the chance .\nSo , a child with weak cognitive inhibition and a positive relationship with his married parents of the same faith is likely to carry on in the religious family tradition . A child with strong cognitive inhibition who is forced to go to church against his will is likely to rebel .\nWas the latter the case with Obal ? He shared his parents \u2019 belief as a child , but his parents \u201c bribed \u201d him into going to Oral Roberts University , so there was some religious conflict . As for cognitive inhibition ? Well , he did successfully inhibit his religious belief .\nWhen asked what led to his change in beliefs , Obal has a long list of items that led to his disillusionment with religion . He worked at the Oral Roberts University Television station and said this experience led him to see that \u201c this whole world of TV evangelism and [ religious network ] Trinity Broadcasting was just a scam. \u201d Also , he saw many friends and family blindly support the war in Iraq after 9/11 and began to think they were influenced by propaganda instead of following God . This led him to question Christianity as a whole .\nHe gave some credit to a certain plant as well .\n\u201c I started using marijuana , which opened my mind , \u201d he said . \u201c So my thought process became a bit more critical towards religion and the implausible cornerstones of faith . \u201d\nAlong with cognitive inhibition and familial transmission , this sounds like something that requires further research .\nLala Stone is a freelance writer currently living in Seattle .
