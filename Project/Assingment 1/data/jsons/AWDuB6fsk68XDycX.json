He surrounded himself with his national security team , including Vice President Mike Pence , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper , General Milley and Robert C. O \u2019 Brien , the national security adviser . They stood stoically around the president without commenting .\nThe administration \u2019 s messages have been conflicting and confusing . In recent days , the president was forced to walk back threats to target Iranian cultural sites after the defense secretary made clear that doing so would be a war crime . The American headquarters in Baghdad had written a letter indicating it was withdrawing from Iraq , only to have the Defense Department say it was a draft document with no authority .\nIn his statement on Wednesday , Mr. Trump sought to pin the current crisis on a predecessor , blaming former President Barack Obama for striking a \u201c foolish \u201d nuclear agreement with Iran in 2015 that unfroze billions of dollars of money for Tehran that could be used to finance ballistic missiles and terrorist activity . \u201c The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nThere was no way to know if that was literally true , because money is fungible , but some of the president \u2019 s claims about the nuclear agreement were false , exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims . He asserted , among other things , that Iran \u2019 s hostile acts against America and its allies increased after the deal , rather than after the Trump administration withdrew from it in 2018 , as statistics indicate .\nEither way , he urged Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China to recognize that it was effectively dead and called on those countries to join him in negotiating a replacement for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , as the agreement is officially known , that would go further to constrain Iran \u2019 s nuclear ambitions .",
