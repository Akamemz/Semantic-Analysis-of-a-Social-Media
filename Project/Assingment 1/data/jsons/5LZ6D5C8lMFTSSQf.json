Elizabeth Warren failed to stop a change in bank regulations last weekend , but she raised her profile yet again .\nThe Massachusetts Democrat tells NPR that her fight over a provision in a spending bill was a `` warning shot . '' She intends to continue her fight against what she describes as the power of Wall Street , even though that fight brought her to oppose leaders of her own party .\nIn recent weeks , Warren challenged one of President Obama 's nominees to a senior post at the Treasury Department , arguing that he was too close to powerful banks . Then , last week , she denounced a $ 1.1 trillion spending bill that had been passed by the House and approved by Senate leaders as well as Obama .\nWarren , a hero to many among her party 's liberals , objected to a provision that would undo a new financial regulation .\n`` Republicans slipped in a provision at the last minute that would let derivatives traders on Wall Street gamble with taxpayer money and then get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system , '' she told NPR .\nThe measure involves complex financial trades called derivatives that can be hugely profitable but also hugely risky .\nA provision of the Dodd-Frank law required banks to create subsidiary companies to do their trading \u2014 with their own money . The idea was to create a firewall between the banks ' trading and customers ' deposits , which are federally insured .\nThe spending bill that the Senate passed over the weekend eliminates the new rules , and keeps financial trading within the banks .\nNPR 's Steve Inskeep spoke with Warren about the financial provisions in the spending bill , challenging her party 's leadership and calls for her to run for president in 2016 .\nYou said they slipped it in , which is true \u2014 it did get tacked on to this much larger legislation about something else .

Because these are institutions regarded as too big to fail . We 're going to bail them out if they fail anyway .\nWell , you know , that is the risk we run right now , is that we have a handful of giant banks in this country that were too big to fail in 2008 , got bailed out by the taxpayer and are now bigger than they were then , and are again loading up on risks . But , you know , whichever way you think is the right answer here , I know for sure that this should n't be slipped into an omnibus spending bill \u2014 a bill that must pass in order to keep the government open . And what it means , if this works , is they can just kinda keep slipping grenades and attach them to , you know , must-pass spending bills , and pretty soon we have no financial regulations at all .\nSen.
