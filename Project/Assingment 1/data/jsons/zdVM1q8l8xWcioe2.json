Two-thirds of the money raised by Trump \u2019 s political machine came from small-dollar donors giving $ 200 or less . The remaining $ 5.3 million was raised from donors cutting checks of more than $ 200 . Trump \u2019 s campaign finished with $ 19 million in the bank to start 2019 .\nIn total , it raised $ 136.3 million between Jan. 2017 and Dec. 2018 , breaking previous records and outpacing past presidential campaigns , according to the campaign . The vast majority came from small contributions .\n`` Not only is the president the single largest force behind our joint , record-breaking fundraising , but he is also the reason we have welcomed nearly one million new small-dollar donors since his inauguration , '' said Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel .\nMuch of the worry about Trump has been about the lack of a big-picture strategist , a Karl Rove or David Axelrod-like figure .

Priorities USA Action , the Democratic super PAC that backed Hillary Clinton during her 2016 bid , raised $ 192 million during the 2016 election cycle .\nBut in the wake of the midterms , donors being courted by America First have questioned whether the group is the best place for their pro-Trump funds , according to one Republican fundraiser who speaks regularly with top donors .\nAmong other things they questioned is why the super PAC used $ 3 million of its $ 34 million in spending in 2018 to help Rep.
