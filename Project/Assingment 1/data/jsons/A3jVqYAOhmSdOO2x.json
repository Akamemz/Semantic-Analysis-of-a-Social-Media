Without getting too far into the weeds , I basically have two beefs with most of the analyses I see .\nBeef Numero Uno : These analyses tend to treat voter preferences as being frozen in time \u2014 they \u2019 re about who the voter supports now , and perhaps who the voter currently lists as their second choice . But to the extent that lanes are interesting , it \u2019 s because they tell us something about the route a voter took in coming to a decision . A voter who backed Bernie Sanders in 2016 but has since switched to Elizabeth Warren won \u2019 t show up as a Sanders supporter if you ask about her current preferences , for instance . But the evolution of this voter \u2019 s choice of candidates would actually be evidence of the existence of a left/liberal policy lane .\nSecond , these analyses are usually oriented around an effort to either prove or debunk the existence of a particular type of lane , usually the liberal or moderate lanes . But voters come around to their decisions for lots of different reasons . Some voters do vote on the basis of ideology or policy . Some vote on demographics or identity . Some factor in more abstract considerations like \u201c leadership \u201d or \u201c electability. \u201d And some just haven \u2019 t thought deeply about their choices yet . When candidates are aligned along several different dimensions \u2014 for instance , Pete Buttigieg and Beto O \u2019 Rourke have much in common in terms of their demographics and their policy platforms \u2014 you can see especially strong correlations in which voters support them , with one tending to rise or fall at the other \u2019 s expense . But most of the time , it \u2019 s messier , with different threads pulling in different directions .\nTo extend the lanes metaphor , you wouldn \u2019 t expect to see a single , parallel set of lanes connecting all voters in the Democratic primary . Instead , you \u2019 d expect something more like a complex , multi-modal transportation network , where some parts of the network are more robust than others , but there are a lot of somewhat redundant options . This doesn \u2019 t mean that paths between different candidates are irrational or random , any more than the choices of , say , Manhattan commuters are . But they might look chaotic in the aggregate if you don \u2019 t recognize that different voters have different priorities and take different routes to get there .\nLet \u2019 s think about voters who supported Sanders in 2016 , for instance , and which candidates they might be supporting now if they aren \u2019 t sticking with Bernie . Voters four years ago might have had several reasons to prefer Sanders to Hillary Clinton :\nSome voters \u2014 such as those who do choose candidates on the basis of ideology \u2014 liked Sanders because he was proud to wave the flag for democratic socialism . These voters would probably be inclined to back Warren , if they aren \u2019 t staying with Sanders .\nchoose candidates on the basis of ideology \u2014 liked Sanders because he was proud to wave the flag for democratic socialism . These voters would probably be inclined to back Warren , if they aren \u2019 t staying with Sanders . Some voters liked Sanders because he was an anti-establishment outsider . I \u2019 m not sure where these voters would go today . They certainly wouldn \u2019 t be inclined to go to Joe Biden or Kamala Harris , who have the most support from the party establishment . But they might also see Warren as too establishment-friendly . Maybe more eccentric candidates like Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang would work for this group . But I \u2019 d expect a lot of anti-establishment types to stick with Sanders . In fact , that seems to describe a lot of the voters he \u2019 s currently left with . If you look at donations , for example , a lot of Sanders donors don \u2019 t seem to be interested in donating to any of the other candidates , suggesting that he \u2019 s somewhat of an island unto himself .\nof the other candidates , suggesting that he \u2019 s somewhat of an island unto himself . Some voters liked Sanders because he is a white man . I \u2019 m not saying this is an especially large group of voters . But there are certainly some , and maybe quite a few . They have lots of other white guys to choose from if they want to move on from Sanders : Biden , O \u2019 Rourke , Buttigieg and so forth .\nRelatedly , voters who associated Sanders with the white working class and supported him on that basis , or who believe that a candidate who does well with white working-class voters is more \u201c electable , \u201d might be attracted to Biden this time around , in addition to Sanders .\nSome younger voters liked Sanders because of his emphasis on policies like free college tuition , and because he came to unexpectedly represent a break from the hegemony of Baby Boomer-dominated politics . It \u2019 s not totally clear who these young voters are supporting yet \u2014 they can be hard to pin down in polls , and they can sometimes be late to engage in the process . But Buttigieg , Yang and O \u2019 Rourke have the potential to overperform with young voters relative to the electorate overall .\nFinally , some voters just aren \u2019 t tuned in yet . The notion that Sanders and Biden \u2019 s support is just name recognition is mostly misguided , in my view . But it \u2019 s certainly true for some voters . These voters \u2019 preferences may simply reflect who they \u2019 ve been hearing about in the news lately , which recently has meant Biden , Warren and Harris in addition to Sanders .\nSo if you run through this list , you certainly do see some major highways that connect Sanders and Warren . But there are also a lot of ways to get from Sanders to Biden . And there are some byways that link Sanders to several of the second-tier or minor candidates , most notably Gabbard , Buttigieg , Yang and O \u2019 Rourke . The one major candidate who doesn \u2019 t have a lot of obvious connections with Sanders is probably Harris . It \u2019 s sort of like trying to get from the West Village to the Upper East Side . You can certainly do it , and they aren \u2019 t that far apart as the crow flies , but it requires an extra transfer or two .\nAll of that might sound good in theory , but is there any data on who Sanders \u2019 s 2016 voters are supporting now ? Actually , yes ! Emerson College , in its national polls , has broken out results based on who Democrats said they supported four years ago . Since the sample sizes are a bit small , I combined the last two Emerson national polls , which were conducted in early and late July , respectively .\nWho Sanders and Clinton voters from 2016 support now Combined results from a July 6-8 and a July 27-29 national poll Current pick for respondents who supported \u2026 Candidate Clinton in 2016 Sanders in 2016 Bernie Sanders 9 % 31 % Joe Biden 43 19 Elizabeth Warren 15 13 Kamala Harris 18 10 Pete Buttigieg 4 6 Andrew Yang 0 5 Beto O \u2019 Rourke 2 4 Tulsi Gabbard 0 3 Cory Booker 1 1 Others 7 8 Source : EMERSON COLLEGE\nThis data actually does a good job reflecting our \u201c predictions \u201d from above about how Sanders \u2019 s support from 2016 might map to the various candidates this year . ( Granted , it \u2019 s easy to make \u201c predictions \u201d when you get to see the data before making them , as I did in this case . ) Start with some of the lesser-known candidates . Gabbard and Yang might not have that many supporters , but the ones they do have are drawn disportionately from former Sanders voters . O \u2019 Rourke and Buttigieg also do better with former Sanders voters than with ex-Clinton ones .\nAmong the major candidates , there are quite a few Sanders 2016 \u2013 > Biden 2020 voters , although not nearly as many as there are Clinton 2016 \u2013 > Biden 2020 voters . Harris gets her support mostly from Clinton voters ; relatively little comes from 2016 Sanders voters , consistent with our hypothesis .\nWarren is , by contrast , drawing about equal shares of Clinton 2016 and Sanders 2016 voters . Maybe you \u2019 re surprised that Warren \u2019 s numbers aren \u2019 t more slanted to former Sanders supporters , but keep in mind that ( i ) there are plenty of connections between Clinton and Warren too , e.g . in their appeal to college-educated women ; ( ii ) whereas Clinton \u2019 s voters need to look around for a new candidate , Sanders 2016 voters have the option of picking Sanders again . One way to look at it is that 44 percent of Sanders 2016 voters are voting for either Sanders or Warren this time around , while just 24 percent of Clinton 2016 voters are .\nSo there almost certainly is a robust left policy/ideology lane in the Democratic primary . It \u2019 s probably even one of the more well-traveled routes . It \u2019 s just far from the only road in town .",
