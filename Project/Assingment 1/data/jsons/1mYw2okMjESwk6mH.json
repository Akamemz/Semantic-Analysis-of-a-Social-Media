The 61 delegates Kentucky had on the line and Oregon's 74 will be divided proportionally among the two candidates based on results in those states -- and that's the bad news for Sanders. He needs to win by overwhelming margins the rest of the way to stand a chance at catching Clinton.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Tuesday's primaries:\n\nClinton finally wins a state\n\nWith an all-but-insurmountable delegate lead, Clinton didn't need to win Kentucky.\n\nBut she's surely glad she did, however narrow her victory.\n\nHer triumph -- particularly in a largely white, working-class state -- will prevent Clinton from limping into California's June 7 primary on a string of May losses.\n\nIn Kentucky, Clinton learned the lessons of Indiana, where Sanders outspent her on television, nearly $2 million to $0.

The changes of the Obama era are still not secured in Kentucky -- so Sanders' big-picture liberalism feels much less feasible there.\n\nBut Sanders wins Oregon\n\nSanders' win in Oregon wasn't nearly enough to put him in a realistic place to overtake Clinton in the number of pledged delegates -- but it did mean he'll close Tuesday's contests with more delegates that day than Clinton, and it'll keep his campaign chugging along.\n\nThe largely white, liberal, homogenous state was the perfect place for a Sanders victory.
