    "content": "Megyn Kelly , avenger , swooped in to get an interview with the victims in the Duggar family molestation case . The victims being parents Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar , of course . In the span of an hour Wednesday night , Fox News transformed the disturbing Duggar family into culture war martyrs , targets of the most vicious liberal attacks since the War on Christmas .\nThe Duggars delivered a stunning display of deflection , the longest exercise in self-absolution since Gov . Chris Christie \u2019 s two-hour pity party when Bridgegate was revealed . The right wing Christian activists and LGBT antagonists found unbelievably creative ways to minimize what son Josh did when he molested four of his sisters , and a baby sitter , in seven separate incidents .\nWhat Josh did \u201c was not rape , \u201d Jim Bob said . `` None of [ the girls who were molested ] were aware of Josh \u2019 s wrongdoing , \u201d Michelle added . In fact , \u201c they probably didn \u2019 t even understand it was an improper touch. \u201d The improper touching mostly took place \u201c over clothes ; \u201d oh , and the few times it was under clothes ? \u201c It was like a few seconds . \u201d\nAnd when he molested his babysitter ? \u201c It was more just like a fondling , a touch while they were asleep\u2014for most of them .

He and Michelle did what every parent would do : Nothing , really , the first couple of times Josh himself confessed the abuse . Well , not exactly nothing : They prayed , and then they took him to a state trooper , who gave him a stern lecture .
