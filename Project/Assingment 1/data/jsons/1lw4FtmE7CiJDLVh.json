The Clinton campaign , in an effort to pressure Donald Trump into releasing his taxes , released the Clintons ' 2015 numbers . The Clintons made $ 10.6 million combined , mostly from speeches , and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent . Clinton 's vice presidential candidate , Tim Kaine , also released 10 years ' returns . In 2015 , Kaine made about $ 313,000 and paid a 16.1 percent tax rate . ( Here are all the tax returns released by the Clinton campaign . )\nClinton and her husband , former President Bill Clinton , have already released tax returns dating to the 1970s given their long history in public life . The Clintons , in June of last year , released the previous eight years of returns . Here 's some of what we found out from those , as reported by NPR 's Scott Horsley :\nIncome : The Clintons `` earned $ 139 million since 2007 . They paid nearly $ 44 million in federal taxes during that period . '' Much of that income came from paid speeches .\nThe Clintons `` earned $ 139 million since 2007 .

In fact , every major-party nominee in recent history has done so . Trump , though , has declined to follow suit . Why ? Trump says he is being audited by the IRS and wo n't release his taxes until that audit is done . But there 's nothing preventing Trump from releasing his taxes while under audit , a point the Clinton campaign and its supporters have pressed , arguing that Trump must be hiding something .\nIt 's possible Trump pays $ 0 in taxes , or close to it , the New York Times reported , because of deductions for real estate developers . There 's some history of that for Trump , who `` reported losses and paid no federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 and paid only modest sums \u2014 a total of less than $ 75,000 \u2014 for the prior three years , '' the Times wrote .\nTrump himself fueled that speculation when he told ABC 's George Stephanopoulos in May , `` I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible .

Candidates are also required under federal law to release financial disclosures that show ranges of the worth of assets and debts . )\nBelow are three reasons we care about what 's in those tax returns \u2014 and a little history of where this tradition came from .\nIt 's a political cliche to say that if you want a friend in Washington get a dog .\nAnd the origin of politicians releasing their tax returns goes back to Richard Nixon \u2014 and his cocker spaniel .\nNixon , running as Eisenhower 's vice president in 1952 , was accused of financial wrongdoing `` related to a fund established by political backers to pay for campaign expenses , '' Joseph J. Thorndike of the Tax History Project wrote in 2012 .\nNixon admitted to taking one gift \u2014 Checkers , the family dog \u2014 from a donor . `` [ T ] he kids , like all kids , love the dog , '' Nixon said , `` and I just want to say this , right now , that regardless of what they say about it , we 're gon na keep it . ''\nWhat 's become known as Nixon 's `` Checkers speech '' was all an attempt to clear his name . He challenged the Democratic Party ticket , headed by Adlai Stevenson , to `` make a complete financial statement as to their financial history , '' as he believed he had .\nIf they did n't , Nixon alleged , it would be proof `` they have something to hide . '' So Stevenson and his running mate , Alabama Sen. John Sparkman , released a decade of their tax returns . Eisenhower , the guy at the top of the ticket with Nixon , even released a summary of his own taxes .\nThe practice of releasing taxes did n't become tradition until 21 years later \u2014 again involving Nixon . PolitiFact wrote :\n`` The IRS audited Nixon in 1973 , when questions bubbled up about a fishy charitable donation and speculation that Nixon had tried to game the tax system , according to a paper prepared for the United States Capitol Historical Society . ( This happened around the same time as the Watergate investigation but was a separate issue . ) Nixon said one of his most well-known lines amid this scandal : 'People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook . Well , I am not a crook ' . `` Nixon eventually released a slew of financial information to the public in December 1973 , including the previous four years of tax returns , to try to quell the criticism . He asked a congressional committee to examine them , too . However , the congressional investigation ultimately found that Nixon owed $ 476,431 ( approximately $ 2.3 million in today 's dollars ) in unpaid taxes and accrued interest . Oops . ''\nFrom that point on , tax-return disclosure became the norm for people wanting to be president .\n1 . Conflicts of interest : Almost every candidate who runs for public office is fairly wealthy . ( Even the candidates who have the government pay their salary , like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden , make far more money than the average American . ) Because of that wealth , how they made their money ( we 'll get to heart in a second ) can tell you whether they have potential conflicts of interest \u2014 who they made that money from .\nTrump 's business interests all over the world could become entangled with presidential politics . Just look at his response to Brexit \u2014 that the dropping euro could be good for tourism to places like his Scottish golf course . For the Clintons , the Clinton foundation could also raise the issue of conflicts of interest as it raises gobs of money from foreign entities . Would some of those governments expect special treatment from a second President Clinton ? A look at recently released emails from her time at the State Department \u2014 and what aides did for big Clinton foundation donors \u2014 gives people reason to question .\n2 . Do they have heart ? Tax returns tell us how much candidates give to charity . The Clintons , as noted above , gave between 8 and 15 percent \u2014 or about $ 15 million total \u2014 during that eight-year period . Most of that went through the Clinton Family Foundation , as The Atlantic reported . They also contributed to the Nelson Mandela Foundation , First United Methodist Church and the Humana Challenge golf tournament .\nPeople could have questions about why so much of their money went to their own foundation \u2014 and whether that 's really in the spirit of giving . For Trump , on the other hand , it took a Washington Post investigation to unearth that he had n't given $ 1 million to veterans ' charities , as he had promised after a fundraiser he held earlier this year ( an event he held in competition with a debate he decided not to attend because he was upset that Fox News ' Megyn Kelly was moderating ) . Trump eventually laid out how much was raised and allocated in a testy news conference . So is criticism of Trump unfair ? Is he really quietly a very charitable person \u2014 or not ? Tax returns would reveal that .\n3 . Are they like us ? Again , these candidates are much wealthier than the average American . Median household income in this country is $ 53,482 , according to the census . The Clintons made $ 28 million in 2014 ( mostly from speeches ) . They also live in a posh New York suburb , Chappaqua , where they bought their home for $ 1.7 million in 1999 just before leaving the White House . ( In 2016 money , that appreciates to about $ 2.5 million . ) The average home price in the U.S. in June 2016 was $ 358,000 ( median home price was $ 307,000 ) .\nTrump , of course , makes it a point to say he 's `` really rich , '' claiming he 's worth $ 9 billion . Trump 's net worth is something of a mystery . He says it fluctuates even based on his own `` feelings .

Trump , on the other hand , has boasted that , `` I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible '' and called his tax rate `` none of your business .

That was certainly the case in 2012 , when the Obama campaign and its outside group allies were able to paint Mitt Romney as someone who got away with paying less in taxes .
