    "content": "\u201c Mr . Zuckerberg , would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night ? \u201d \u201c Um \u2014 no. \u201d \u201c If you \u2019 ve messaged anybody this week , would you share with us the names of the people you \u2019 ve messaged ? \u201d \u201c Senator , no , I would probably not choose to do that publicly here. \u201d \u201c I think that may be what this is all about. \u201d \u201c In 2015 , we heard the report that this developer Aleksandr Kogan had sold data to Cambridge Analytica. \u201d \u201c Did you or senior leadership do an inquiry to find out who at Facebook had this information and did they not have a discussion about whether or not the users should be informed back in December of 2015 ? \u201d \u201c Senator , in retrospect , I think we clearly view it as a mistake that we didn \u2019 t inform people . And we did that based on false information that we thought that the case was closed , and that the data had been deleted. \u201d \u201c So there was a decision made on that basis not to inform the users . Is that correct ? \u201d \u201c That \u2019 s my understanding , yes. \u201d \u201c I assume Facebook \u2019 s been served with subpoenas from the special counsel Mueller \u2019 s office . Is that correct ? \u201d \u201c Yes . Actually , let me clarify that . I actually am not aware of a subpoena . I believe that there may be . But I know we \u2019 re working with them. \u201d \u201c Thank you. \u201d \u201c If I buy a Ford and it doesn \u2019 t work well and I don \u2019 t like it , I can buy a Chevy . If I \u2019 m upset with Facebook , what \u2019 s the equivalent product that I can go sign up for ? \u201d \u201c The average American uses eight different apps \u2014 \u201d \u201c O.K. \u201d \u201c \u2014 to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people \u2014 \u201d \u201c O.K. \u201d \u201c \u2014 ranging from text apps \u2014 \u201d \u201c \u2014 which is \u2014 \u201d \u2014 to email. \u201d \u201c Which is the same service you provide. \u201d \u201c Well , we provide a number of different services. \u201d \u201c Is Twitter the same as what you do ? \u201d \u201c It overlaps with a portion of what we do. \u201d \u201c You don \u2019 t think you have a monopoly ? \u201d \u201c It certainly doesn \u2019 t feel like that to me. \u201d \u201c O.K. \u201d [ audience laughs ] \u201c Do you need to look behind shell corporations in order to find out who is really behind the content that \u2019 s being posted ? And if you may need to look behind a shell corporation , how will you go about doing that ? How will you get back to the true , what lawyers would call \u2018 beneficial owner \u2019 of the site that is putting out the political material ? \u201d \u201c So what we \u2019 re going to do is require a valid government identity and we \u2019 re going to verify the location . So we \u2019 re going to do that , so that way someone sitting in Russia , for example , couldn \u2019 t say that they \u2019 re in America and therefore able to run an election ad. \u201d \u201c But if they were running through a corporation domiciled in Delaware , you wouldn \u2019 t know that they were actually a Russian owner. \u201d \u201c Senator , that \u2019 s\u2014 that \u2019 s correct . \u201d",
