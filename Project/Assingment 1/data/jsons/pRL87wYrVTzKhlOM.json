Six months from now marks the midterm elections , the unofficial start of the 2016 presidential campaign and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s long-delayed ride to inevitability .\nWhat does Hillary Clinton have to do with inequality in America ? She \u2019 s no robber baron , of course . But the core case against inequality isn \u2019 t about resentment of wealth\u2014it \u2019 s about the ways in which the concentration of wealth is making politics increasingly pointless , a game of access and not arguments . Anyone who fears that future should think twice before casting a ballot for a dynastic politician , because dynastic candidates turn politics pointless in essentially the same way . They trade on family capital to make elections less meaningful ; they are prone to be inflexible and indifferent to inequality ; and they have good reason to be even less accountable to the public than ordinary politicians . Concentrated economic power and concentrated political power are , in the end , two sides of a coin .\nThe prospect of a dynastic future should be especially disturbing to Democrats like me . Political life tolerates all sorts of little hypocrisies , but some gulfs between what a party wants to say\u2014and whom a party chooses to say it\u2014are too wide to be bridged . If we want to talk critically about the concentration of economic power in the United States , if we really believe that the rise and rise of the 1 percent is the signal issue of our time , we have to live by our words when it comes to the concentration of political power .
