    "content": "Speaking at the Al Smith dinner , which benefits Catholic humanitarian causes , Mitt Romney took on the press in a joking manner that struck many as truthful . \u201c Now I never suggest that the press is biased , \u201d he said . \u201c I recognize that they have their job to do , and I have my job to do . My job is to lay out a positive vision for the future of the country , and their job is to make sure no one else finds out about it . \u201d\nHe went on , \u201c Let \u2019 s just say that some in the media have a certain way of looking at things . When suddenly I pulled ahead in some of the major polls , what was the headline ? \u2018 Polls Show Obama Leading from Behind. \u2019 And I \u2019 ve already seen early reports from tonight \u2019 s dinner . Headline : \u2018 Obama Embraced by Catholics . Romney Dines with Rich People . \u2019 \u201d\nMeanwhile , Professor Paul Kengor was not joking when he told Breitbart News that the job of the major media \u201c is to protect Obama , not expose him. \u201d Kengor has experienced media bias first hand since his blockbuster book , The Communist , came out in July . It exposes Obama \u2019 s relationship with Communist Party operative Frank Marshall Davis .\nFrank was revealed to be Frank Marshall Davis in 2007 , when a Communist Party writer named Gerald Horne made the disclosure . Blogger Trevor Loudon wrote about the connection that same year and AIM confirmed the identification of \u201c Frank \u201d as Frank Marshall Davis on February 18 , 2008 , in a column , \u201c Obama \u2019 s Communist Mentor. \u201d Davis \u2019 s 600-page FBI file was released in August of that year\u2014before the election .\nAsked by Breitbart News if any mainstream media journalists have contacted him about his definitive and exhaustive analysis of Davis and his relationship to Obama , Kengor replied , \u201c Are you kidding ? No way . Not a chance . They \u2019 ll send a team of a dozen reporters to fact-check Sarah Palin \u2019 s memoirs or a Romney speech , but not to investigate the President they \u2019 ve committed to coddle and preserve . \u201d\nKengor said of the media , \u201c They aren \u2019 t real journalists . They \u2019 re political partisans first and journalists second . They \u2019 re not honest , or they delude themselves on a grand scale . They \u2019 ve sacrificed their noble profession to an ignoble political ideology . \u201d\nExcept for the jokes at the Al Smith dinner , the Romney campaign has decided not to attack media bias , even though liberal media strategies of distortion and omission can cost a Republican candidate critical voter support and in Romney \u2019 s case guarantee an Obama re-election victory on November 6 .\nTim Groseclose , author of Left Turn : How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind , told AIM in an interview with Roger Aronoff that the leftward bias of the media has shifted the political quotient of the average American by about 20 points on a scale of 100 , in terms of conditioning the public to accept the Democratic Party , its candidates and policies . This translates potentially into millions of votes . One of the many tactics , Groseclose said , is to cite liberal groups as reliable and reputable sources of information and identity conservative sources by their political leanings , thus reducing their appeal and attraction .\nAt the AIM \u201c ObamaNation \u201d conference on September 21 , pollster Pat Caddell urged Romney to openly run against \u201c two organizations \u201d \u2014the Democratic Party and the \u201c mainstream media. \u201d He said the media have \u201c made themselves a fundamental threat to the democracy , and , in my opinion , made themselves the enemy of the American people , \u201d because they hide information that is critical to making informed decisions in a democracy .\nHowever , Romney told CBS News that he had no plans to challenge media bias .\nThis approach reflects the influence of Romney adviser Ed Gillespie , who has said the campaign has a \u201c no whining rule \u201d about media coverage . \u201c We just deal with the facts , \u201d he said .\nGOP strategist and SuperPAC sponsor Karl Rove told a gathering of Republican donors that he has advised Romney and other Republicans not to attack Obama as a socialist or a left-winger because the charges would be met with denials . He urged a \u201c respectful tone \u201d toward the President .\nAlthough the media and the Republican Party establishment do not want to deal with Kengor \u2019 s book , The Communist , Frank Marshall Davis is the subject of the Joel Gilbert DVD , Dreams from My Real Father , being mailed to millions of households in the various swing states . The media are starting to take note of this . \u201c Radical Anti-Obama DVD floods Florida mailboxes \u201d is the headline over one story carried by a Florida television station .\nWhile Gilbert \u2019 s theory about Davis being Obama \u2019 s real father is subject to discussion and debate , his film does cite factual data about Davis \u2019 s relationship with Obama and notes the existence of the 600-page FBI file on Davis .\nIf there is nothing to hide in this relationship , Paul Kengor told Breitbart News , then why did Obama himself delete the references to \u201c Frank \u201d in the audio version of his book , Dreams from My Father ? \u201c Obama narrates the audio version , \u201d Kengor notes . \u201c The liberals feted him with a Grammy for his sterling narration .
