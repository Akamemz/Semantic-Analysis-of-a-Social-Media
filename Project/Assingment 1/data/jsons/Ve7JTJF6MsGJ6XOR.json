We were preparing the 9 a.m. hour of \u201c Fox News Live , \u201d as we called it then . I was to interview the author of a new book about the death penalty , as well as a musician launching a comeback tour .\nA STORY OF A FAITH TRANSFORMED IN THE MIDST OF THE 9/11 TERROR ATTACKS\nThe darkest rages of the human heart blotted out the bright September sun , first in New York City , then Washington , D.C. , and finally in Shanksville , Pennsylvania .\nIt was a little before nine that morning . I was opening the door to Studio E , already wearing the communications pack that allows colleagues in the control room to communicate through my earpiece . My producer \u2019 s voice suddenly shattered what had been a mundane Tuesday morning : \u201c Jon Scott , get to the studio\u2014NOW ! ! ! \u201d\nI told him I was already there and asked what was up . \u201c A plane just flew into the World Trade Center ! \u201d\nThe \u201c Fox & Friends \u201d team was already covering the story , what little we knew of it , but even though the North Tower was burning just a few miles south of our building , no media outlets had a video feed yet .\nThe anchors could only talk about the news flashes coming into their laptops : that a \u201c small plane \u201d had hit the World Trade Center and that the upper floors of the building were on fire .\nWe weren \u2019 t fighting with one another after 9/11 . We weren \u2019 t carping over little things . We weren \u2019 t Republicans and Democrats\u2014we were Americans .\nWithin moments , a news chopper arrived and began beaming a live video feed . \u201c Fox & Friends \u201d ended their program early , about five minutes before nine , and handed off to my team and me .\nIt would be the worst day to be in the news business . It would be the worst day any of us had ever seen .\nThe unimaginable happened . And it all unfolded on live television . Madmen deliberately flew jetliners loaded with people into office buildings\u2014before that day , who could have imagined such depravity ?\nIn the early minutes of our coverage , my team connected me by phone with a former National Transportation Safety Board investigator who \u2019 d handled many air crash investigations . How , I asked him , on a bright blue-sky day , could a pilot have flown into the World Trade Center ?\nThe idea that it was deliberate seemed unthinkable . He began to answer , explaining that pilots could have been blinded by the sun , distracted by workload or maybe punched the wrong coordinates into their flight computers\u2026 .\nThen came the real answer . A second jet swooped ominously low in the bottom right corner of the TV monitor I was watching as I spoke to the former-NTSB guest . It briefly disappeared behind the \u201c banner \u201d at the bottom of the screen . The helicopter providing the TV image was slowly circling the Trade Center , and at that moment , the two buildings were in perfect alignment so that the south tower was hidden behind the north . Suddenly , the huge fireball erupted from somewhere behind the north tower , but I couldn \u2019 t see where .\nMy mind couldn \u2019 t process the evils we all were seeing . For a split second , I thought our director had somehow located a video recording of the first strike on the north tower and was replaying it .\nThe south tower came into view , its shattered fa\u00e7ade now belching horrifying flame and smoke into the blue sky while pieces of the building and its contents fluttered to earth , glittering in the September sunshine .\n\u201c This has to be deliberate , folks , \u201d I said . And then , my voice shaking with emotion , swallowing hard to try to maintain composure , I spoke the name of the only suspect I could think of who might have planned something so horrifying : \u201c Usama bin Laden . \u201d\nI was about to write that \u201c you know what happened from that point on\u2026 \u201d but it \u2019 s not entirely true .\nThat horrific morning is now 18 years behind us ; there is now a generation of Americans who didn \u2019 t watch it unfold on live television .\nThey don \u2019 t have the memories that seared the mind as we watched them , together .\nHuge jetliners and their terrified passengers , obliterated in an instant .\nOffice workers leaning out broken windows , desperately gasping for the crisp September air that still wafted outside their 110-story hell . Some of them ultimately jumping , a few even holding hands as they leapt together , choosing a quick end over slow immolation .\nThat is why we at Fox do not randomly run images of that day . The events of 9/11 can not , should not , be reduced to what \u2019 s become known as \u201c wallpaper video . \u201d\nNearly 3,000 of our mothers , brothers , fathers , sisters , sons and daughters went to work or boarded planes that morning\u2026 and never came home .\nFirefighters , police officers and everyday citizens gave their own lives trying to save others .\nThe worst impulses of the human heart were met with their uplifting counterpart ; confronted with evils like we have never seen , Americans responded with courage , love\u2014and sacrifice .\nWe weren \u2019 t fighting with one another after 9/11 . We weren \u2019 t carping over little things . We weren \u2019 t Republicans and Democrats\u2014we were Americans .\nWe had work to do , and we joined hands together to get it done .\nI recall saying something on air late that day about how the terrorists had knocked a few buildings down , but that America would pick herself up , dust herself off and come back strong .\nMy hope and my prayer , as we mark another 9/11 , is that the memories of that awful day will spark in us a renewal of the spirit that came after it , that we treat each other with the kindness , respect and even love that we all saw in the aftermath of the attacks in 2001 .\nThe world was watching as America was attacked , and America responded with strength and determination . But -- in the less than two decades since , the civility of our discourse and the regard we shared for one another after that terror attack on our nation has largely disappeared .\nSo on 9/11 , watch the terrible video . Remember that day , if you lived it .\nIf you didn \u2019 t , watch the images that we ONLY replay on this day and try to comprehend how frightening , how painful , how terrible it truly was , and resolve to remember the victims through acts of kindness and compassion .\nThe terrorists tried to bring down the United States of America that day . Eighteen years later , let \u2019 s not let them win .",
