    "content": "\u201c I didn \u2019 t discover why I wrote really until later . At the very beginning , when I wrote the first book , \u2018 The Bluest Eye , \u2019 I came at it as not a writer , but a reader . And such a story didn \u2019 t exist . Every little homely , black girl was a joke or didn \u2019 t exist in literature . And I was eager to read about a story where racism really hurts and can destroy you. \u201d \u201c You don \u2019 t think you will ever change and write books that incorporate white \u2014 white lives into them substantially ? \u201d \u201c I have done. \u201d \u201c In a substantial way ? \u201d \u201c You can \u2019 t understand how powerfully racist that question is , can you ? As you could never ask a white author : \u2018 When are you going to write about black people ? \u2019 \u201d \u201c Toni Morrison \u2019 s prose brings us that kind of moral and emotional intensity that few writers ever attempt . From \u2018 Song of Solomon \u2019 to \u2018 Beloved , \u2019 Toni reaches us deeply , using a tone that is lyrical , precise , distinct and inclusive. \u201d \u201c There would never have been a book club had there not been you as an author. \u201d \u201c Really ? \u201d \u201c No . So I thank you , Ms. Morrison. \u201d \u201c This is fabulous. \u201d \u201c Yes \u2014 never would have been one without you . Never would have been. \u201d \u201c Well , you know , I \u2019 m trying not to write just because I can or just write more . I \u2019 m trying to write less that means more , that says more . For me it \u2019 s extremely important for the clarification not only of the past , but of who we are as human beings in this country. \u201d \u201c I was editing a book at Random House . And it was a kind of scrapbook of all sorts of things that emanated from African-American culture . And I came across this woman , Margaret Garner , and the story was that a slave woman had killed her children or tried to kill them all . What struck me was the theme was that she was not crazy . And they were stunned to find her A : articulate , B : sane and 3 : interested in doing it again. \u201d \u201c I know how to write forever . I don \u2019 t think I could have happily stayed here with the calamity that has occurred so often in the world if I did not have a way of thinking about it , past , present , future , which is what writing is for me . It \u2019 s control . Nobody tells me what to do . I am in control . It is my world . It \u2019 s sometimes wild , the process by which I arrive at something . But nevertheless , it \u2019 s mine , it \u2019 s free and it \u2019 s a way of thinking . It \u2019 s pure knowledge . You \u2019 re welcome . \u201d",
