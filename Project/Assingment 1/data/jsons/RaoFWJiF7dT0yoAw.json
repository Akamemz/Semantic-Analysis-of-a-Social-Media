Brett Kavanaugh is also likely to serve on the Court for decades , long outlasting Trump \u2019 s presidency no matter what happens in 2020 .\nFor anyone who doubts the importance of Kavanaugh \u2019 s appointment , now is a time to remember that a president \u2019 s Supreme Court a lifelong appointment to the Supreme Court is one of the most consequential decisions a president can make . And its impact is a lot more enduring than the manners \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 a president displays while in office .\nBush defended Clarence Thomas after he was accused of sexual harassment\nBush \u2019 s nomination of Thomas was controversial from the beginning . When Justice Thurgood Marshall , the first black justice on the Supreme Court , announced his retirement in 1991 , \u201c Bush could have honored his legacy by naming a respected African-American judge or legal scholar such as Amalya Kearse or Leon Higginbotham , \u201d wrote David Greenberg at Politico in a remembrance of Bush published after his death . \u201c But he selected a staunch conservative in Clarence Thomas\u2014served up with the implausible assertion that he was the most qualified person for the job . \u201d\nBush had previously appointed moderate David Souter to the Court , Greenberg notes , so he might have been expected to replace Marshall with a centrist . Instead , Bush picked Thomas , who today is known as the most conservative member of the Court , perhaps even to the right of the late Justice Antonin Scalia .\nAfter Thomas was nominated , news broke of Anita Hill \u2019 s allegations against him : She said that when the two worked together at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission he had repeatedly subjected her to unwanted sexual comments , including a joke about a pubic hair on a Coke can .\nBush was undeterred . On October 9 , 1991 , he declared that he had \u201c total confidence \u201d in his nominee , Politico reports . And on October 11 , after Hill and Thomas testified before the Senate , he called Thomas \u2019 s statement \u201c very powerful and convincing \u201d and said the nominee had been smeared , according to the Associated Press .\n\u201c In my view , he will be confirmed , \u201d Bush said . \u201c And in the end , he will get his good name back . \u201d\nHill , meanwhile , was mocked and criticized in the press and in the Senate , famously called \u201c a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty . \u201d\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Laura McGann writes , \u201c the Thomas confirmation battle could have been a turning point in American history , one where women \u2019 s rights in the workplace and in the public square vaulted forward . Instead , Bush chose to side with a man who multiple women described harassing them. \u201d Of course , Bush would later face sexual misconduct allegations of his own .\nThomas was confirmed on October 15 , 1991 . He went on to vote consistently against abortion rights , in such cases as Gonzales v. Carhart , which in 2007 upheld a ban on so-called \u201c partial-birth abortions. \u201d In a joint opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey , in 1992 , he wrote that Roe v.

FEC , leading to an explosion of Super PAC spending and dark money in elections , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Andrew Prokop has noted . And in 2000 \u2019 s Bush v.
