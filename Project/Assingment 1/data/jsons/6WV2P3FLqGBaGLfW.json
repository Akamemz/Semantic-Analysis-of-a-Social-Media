    "content": "A month ago , Vice President Joe Biden was sitting in his office in the West Wing , talking to an old friend who \u2019 d come to visit .\nMonday in Pittsburgh , when a man in a crowd of steelworkers called out to him to run , Biden called back , \u201c I \u2019 ve got to talk to my wife about that . \u201d\nFor Joe Biden , the decision whether to run for president pivots more than anything else on one person : Jill . People tight in the Biden circle were surprised how much he suddenly made it about her , even as an offhand joke .\nBoth Joe and Jill are working to detangle a mess of emotion and grief and dreams and very real sense of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s vulnerability . One minute he \u2019 s talking about how ridiculously he thinks Clinton \u2019 s handling her campaign , the next his voice is cracking , his eyes drifting off as he thinks about the death of his son earlier this summer .\nLess in the public eye , Jill Biden \u2019 s just as torn up . Some days , she \u2019 s the vice president \u2019 s rock ; some days she \u2019 s in even worse shape . Beau Biden was her adopted son , but he was her son as if she \u2019 d been there the day he was born and every day since .\nWhatever the final decision about running for president is , she \u2019 ll be the one to make it with the vice president \u2014 not be told about the decision , not direct the decision ; they 'll make it together . She \u2019 s been a no , but she \u2019 s also spent 40 years in love with a man who \u2019 s dreamed about being president every day they \u2019 ve been together . She knows how much this means to him .\nThis isn \u2019 t the usual reluctant spouse of a presidential candidate clich\u00e9 : Even most of the people who talk to the vice president regularly haven \u2019 t talked to Jill Biden for months , and they say they don \u2019 t know where her mind is \u2014 and wouldn \u2019 t dare guess . From their conversations with Biden , they don \u2019 t think the vice president has any kind of final decision from her himself , or that either is anywhere close to getting to one .\nAnyone saying they know what she \u2019 s thinking is speculating , said her communications director , James Gleeson . But he acknowledged that the potential run is very much on her mind .\n\u201c She has always believed that her husband would make an excellent president , \u201d Gleeson said . \u201c She will continue to support the vice president in his career as he has always supported Dr. Biden in hers . ''\nOn Wednesday in Michigan , she \u2019 ll get a taste of what running would be like . As the vice president continues his own flirtation-exploration trips around the country , she \u2019 ll get her own chance to test out her sea legs , traveling with President Barack Obama to Michigan for an event on her signature issue \u2014 community college \u2014 and a chance to be out on the stump in a state that just might prove critical in both a primary and general election race .\nShe \u2019 ll get a lot of time out and about with the president , touring the Michigan Technical Education Center and speaking ahead of him at Macomb Community College in the afternoon .\nThe trip \u2019 s been planned for weeks , part of a multiday messaging swing that the president \u2019 s doing around community colleges and workforce training . Jill Biden usually doesn \u2019 t come up much at the White House , but there \u2019 s some amusement in the building that this trip came together right in the middle of the Biden-maybe-for-president boomlet .\n\u201c Dr . Biden is a tremendous , tremendous asset to this effort , \u201d said White House domestic policy adviser Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz , in a call with reporters discussing the trip , just as an email to supporters went out from Obama in which he called Biden \u201c my favorite community college instructor . \u201d\nShe \u2019 s already started the new semester back teaching at Northern Virginia Community College .\nUnlike the vice president , who \u2019 s been feeling out a wide circle of advisers , political friends and potential supporters , Jill Biden \u2019 s barely talked to anyone about what she \u2019 s thinking . She \u2019 s had a few preliminary conversations with staff and close advisers about what a presidential run would mean for her , but that \u2019 s about it . She \u2019 s worried about making sure the vice president \u2019 s in good enough shape . She \u2019 s worried about making sure their grandchildren are all right .\nThat \u2019 s part of what \u2019 s been so hard for the vice president as he \u2019 s been trying to sort through his own mixed thoughts : If she says run , is she saying it because she knows he wants it ? If she says don \u2019 t run , is she saying it to be protective of him ? If she says she can handle it , can she really handle it ? Does she really think he can ?\nThey \u2019 re tap dancing around each other , feeling each other out , people who \u2019 ve talked to them say .\nShe got on the road after Beau Biden \u2019 s death more quickly than the vice president did , heading to Alabama to christen the USS Gabrielle Giffords and taking an eight-day trip through Asia to promote women \u2019 s empowerment in Korea , Vietnam and Laos . On that trip was her former chief of staff , Cathy Russell , now the State Department ambassador-at-large for global women \u2019 s issues , who in the super tight-knit Biden circle is married to former Obama national security adviser Tom Donilon \u2014 the brother-in-law of Mike Donilon , the Biden adviser most deeply involved in the presidential deliberations who \u2019 s the one most actively in favor of jumping in .\nThe Bidens are always talking about each other in public , and in private . He sees her as the cornerstone of the family , the one he respects for holding them all together while he was a U.S. senator riding Amtrak back and forth to Wilmington and running around the country campaigning . He \u2019 s deferential to her .\nWhen he talks about whether he can handle the race , he \u2019 s talking about that as a question that he \u2019 s not answering alone . They \u2019 re trying to find the answer together .\nWednesday isn \u2019 t the first time Jill Biden has done the community college tour with Obama . Most recently , she was with him and the vice president in Tennessee in January to announce the White House \u2019 s free tuition proposal , and she spent the 2012 reelection year doing a five-state \u201c Community College to Career \u201d bus tour .\nThis trip is different . And as soon as it was planned , with all the political chatter going , people involved knew it was going to be read for hints and tea leaves .\nSometimes a trip with the president to a swing state to talk up a base issue is just that , nothing more , Gleeson said .\n\u201c Dr . Biden is back in the classroom and back out on the road on behalf of the administration , \u201d he said , \u201c to lift up the importance of community colleges to America \u2019 s future . \u201d",
