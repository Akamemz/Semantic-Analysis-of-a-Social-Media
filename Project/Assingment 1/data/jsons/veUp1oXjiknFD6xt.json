VPC\n\nTommy Caldwell, top, raises his arms after reaching the summit of El Capitan as Kevin Jorgeson, bottom, watches. Caldwell and Jorgeson became the first to free-climb the rock formation's Dawn Wall. They used ropes and safety harnesses to catch them in case of a fall, but relied entirely on their own strength and dexterity to ascend by grasping cracks as thin as razor blades and as small as dimes. The effort took 19 days, as the two dealt with constant falls and injuries.

They used safety ropes and harnesses to prevent deadly falls, but did not using ropes or climbing aids to reach the top. The two climbed the wall in 32 rope-length sections that climbers call pitches, and they reached the summit around 3:30 p.m. PT.\n\nPatagonia, the clothing and gear maker, sponsored the climb.\n\nCaldwell was the first to finish. He waited on a ledge for Jorgeson, who caught up minutes later. The two embraced before Jorgeson pumped his arms in the air and clapped his hands above his head. Then they sat down for a few moments, gathered their gear, changed clothes and hiked to the nearby summit.\n\nIn the meadow below, a crowd broke into cheers. Caldwell's mother, Terry, said her son could have reached the top several days ago, but he waited for his friend to make sure they got there together.\n\n\"That's a deep, abiding, lifelong friendship, built over suffering on the wall together over six years,\" she said.\n\nPresident Obama sent his congratulations from the White House Twitter account, saying the men \"remind us that anything is possible.\"\n\nEach trained for more than five years, and they have battled bloodied fingers and unseasonably warm weather.
