    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments yesterday in Trump v. Mazars , a case which asks whether the House Committee on Oversight and Reform overstepped its legal authority in 2019 when it subpoenaed Mazars USA , Donald Trump 's longtime accounting firm , demanding eight years of financial records pertaining to Trump and several of his business entities .\nIn Barenblatt v. United States ( 1959 ) , the Supreme Court held that `` Congress may only investigate into those areas in which it may potentially legislate or appropriate . '' In Eastland v. U.S. Servicemen 's Fund ( 1975 ) , the Court said that the congressional subpoena power may only be used for a `` legitimate legislative purpose . ''\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Reform told the Supreme Court that its efforts to acquire Trump 's tax records easily satisfied the `` legitimate legislative purpose '' test . `` The election of a President who has decided to maintain his ties to a broad array of business ventures raises questions about the adequacy of existing legislation concerning financial disclosures , government contracts with federal officeholders , and government ethics , more generally , '' the committee argued . `` Whether new legislation on these subjects is needed is a natural subject of Congressional inquiry . ''\nTrump and his lawyers told the Court that if the committee prevailed in this case , future congressional committees would be empowered to go on countless fishing expeditions into the private records of future presidents . `` A congressional committee merely needs to say that it is considering legislation requiring presidents to disclose [ financial ] information of this type , '' Trump 's legal team argued . `` Given the temptation to investigate the personal lives of political rivals , legislative subpoenas targeting the private affairs of presidents will become routine in times of divided government . ''\nThe Trump team 's warning seemed to resonate with several members of the Court during the oral arguments . Perhaps most worrisome for the Democratic-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Reform , the warning seemed to find a particularly receptive audience in Justice Stephen Breyer , a Democratic appointee and senior figure on the Court 's so-called liberal wing .\n`` The subpoenas that I 've seen , '' Breyer told Douglas Letter , the general counsel for the House of Representatives , `` apply to 15 Trump-affiliated entities . They ask for all documents related to opening of accounts , due diligence , closing , requests for information by other parties , et cetera . Now that 's a lot of information , and some of it 's pretty vague . '' And `` my problem '' with all of that , Breyer continued , is `` the fact that what I hold today [ in this case ] will also apply to a future Senator McCarthy asking a future Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman exactly the same questions . '' That , Breyer told the House 's lawyer , `` bothers me . ''\nThese statements do not necessarily mean that Breyer is going to rule in favor of Trump in this case .
