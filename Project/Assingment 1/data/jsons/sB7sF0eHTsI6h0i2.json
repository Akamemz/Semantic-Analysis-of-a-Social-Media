Now comes the hard part : selling it .\nAt a meeting in the basement of the Capitol Tuesday morning , Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) and the GOP leadership team will face rank-and-file Republicans for the first time since President Barack Obama \u2019 s executive action on immigration . They will try to convince the troops to channel their anger at a mostly symbolic immigration bill , while agreeing to a separate funding package that would keep most of the government open for nine months , while funding immigration enforcement agencies for just a few months .\nThe meeting is the first big test of whether Boehner , Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) and Steve Scalise ( R-La . ) can accomplish what they have promised since a sweeping election victory this fall \u2014 that they can move beyond the days of ruling by crisis and prove they can govern responsibly .\nBy Monday night , leaders were beginning to gauge whether their colleagues would support a bill introduced by Rep. Ted Yoho ( R-Fla. ) that states the executive branch does not have the power to exempt some people from immigration laws \u2014 a direct affront to Obama \u2019 s moves . The Florida Republican \u2019 s bill is expected to garner widespread support in the House conference and give GOP lawmakers an outlet to vent some of their frustrations with Obama . The Senate is not likely to take up the measure .\nBoehner and other GOP leaders hope that by allowing them to vote for the Yoho bill they can get enough support from the rank and file to move forward with a funding deal , which will keep nearly all the government open until September 2015 , while funding immigration enforcement agencies on a short-term basis .\nIt won \u2019 t be an easy task . Not only is Boehner weighing the desires of his own rambunctious conference , his moves are part of a larger game of three-level chess with power centers on K Street , across Capitol Hill and in the White House competing to move their agenda forward in the next week and a half . Boehner and his allies say he has been hobbled by the White House , which unveiled a controversial proposal before government funding was set to expire .\nThe most pressing item Boehner has to deal with is the government-funding fight . The GOP leadership plans to move forward with a plan at some point next week .\nSome aides and lawmakers in the leadership think that the anger about the executive action is overstated , and Boehner and McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) will be able to credibly make the case that Yoho \u2019 s bill is a good option . And , leadership will argue that if the Senate ignores the language , they can return to the fight in early 2015 .\nOthers are less sanguine , and have been exploring options such as a split government funding bill , a short-term bill , language to prevent Obama from using government-collected fees to implement his policies and a lawsuit . Some have advocated action on a series of small-bore immigration bills .

A bill could come to the floor by Wednesday .\nThis flood of action is unexpected and unwanted . Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) wanted to have a quiet lame-duck session , where the leadership simply cleared legislation and potential funding cliffs to have a productive first quarter .
