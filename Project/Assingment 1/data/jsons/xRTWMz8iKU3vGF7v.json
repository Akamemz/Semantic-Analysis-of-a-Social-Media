    "content": "Matt Latimer is a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush . He is currently a co-partner in Javelin , a literary agency and communications firm based in Alexandria , and contributing editor at \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine .\nOne has to wonder : When Republicans gathered earlier this year to scheme the defeat of Hillary Clinton , who was the genius who stood up and said , \u201c I know . We \u2019 ll challenge the Clintons \u2019 pristine record on ethics . They \u2019 ll never see that one coming . \u201d\nA little newsflash about our past ( and probably future ) First Family , who pundits , long predicting the Clintons \u2019 coronation , are now suddenly beginning to count out : Scandal surfing is what they always do . They skip the top of the waves , sometimes even giving the impression they might succumb to them . But they never do .\nThe Clintons have been sent off to their certain doom more times than Tyrion Lannister . During their last sojourn on Pennsylvania Avenue , operators all but installed a new message on the White House switchboard , \u201c If you \u2019 re calling with a subpoena for the Clintons , please press 7 now . \u201d\nYet whatever the storm\u2014from blue dresses to funny money from China to an actual impeachment trial\u2014Bill and Hillary are this generation \u2019 s Six-Million Dollar Man ( and Woman ) . They always rebuild faster , stronger , and a hell of a lot richer than ever .\nMuch is now being made of a CNN poll finding that a majority of Americans\u201457 percent\u2014do not believe Hillary Clinton is honest or trustworthy . But is that really news ? Roughly half of the country has felt that way for a long time . Forty-three percent of Americans said that a year ago . And forty-six percent said that back in 2007 .\nUnder the headline , \u201c Hillary Clinton \u2019 s honesty problem , \u201d an earnest reporter for The Hill newspaper asks , \u201c Is it possible to win the White House if more than half the electorate thinks you \u2019 re dishonest ? \u201d Uh , of course , it is , people . The Clintons do this all the time .\nClinton \u2019 s margins against her potential Republican contenders is thin , to be sure , but not much different than they have been for months . And , by the way , even in purplish New Hampshire , she \u2019 s still beating them all\u2014from Bush to Walker to Rubio . Nationally , CNN has her beating Washington \u2019 s favorite Republican , Jeb Bush , by eight points .\nIf history is any guide , the latest series of Clinton scandals will only end to their advantage . Just like they always do . Indeed , it \u2019 s long past time for the GOP to learn this lesson before the Clintons whip them again . ( Spoiler alert : They won \u2019 t . )\nTime and again , it \u2019 s the Clintons \u2019 accusers who end up humiliated , run out of town , ruined by sex scandals , or left to write soft-porn memoirs about supposed romantic dalliances that read like a letter to a trashy magazine . ( \u201c Dear Penthouse , I can \u2019 t believe this happened to me\u2026 \u201d )\nFrom the day he announced his candidacy for the White House in 1992 , the litany of charges against Bill Clinton never stopped\u2014he was a liar , a draft dodger , an adulterer , he had an illegitimate African-American son . Then-President George H. W. Bush himself made a not-to-subtle claim that Clinton might have had pro-Soviet tendencies while a student at Oxford .\nHillary fared no better ; she was an alleged drug runner , a hater of marriage and family run amok , a co-conspirator in homicide . A list of the Clintons \u2019 supposed murder victims is still making the rounds on the Internet\u2014right next to other baffling mysteries , like the Loch Ness monster and the plot line of \u201c Revenge . \u201d\nLosing to the Clintons in 1996 , a frustrated Bob Dole yelled , \u201c Where \u2019 s the outrage ? \u201d Of course , he yelled that to the very voters who couldn \u2019 t care less about Clinton sleaze . They \u2019 d heard it all before\u2014again and again .\nThe Clintons are often fortunate in their opponents\u2014an assortment of professional prudes and ethical hypocrites who push too hard , who revel in it too much , and who focus not on one charge that might stick but a hundred that go in more directions than a Tolkien novel . Which scandal are we on now ? Benghazi ? Erased emails ? Clinton Cash ? The death of Vince Foster ? An outrage to be named later ?\nAnd have no doubt , lurking somewhere in some GOP strategy room at this very moment is a folder fat with new details on that Ny-Quil of Clinton political scandals , Whitewater .\nWell , back in 1993 , a man named David Hale claimed that back in 1978 , two other people named Jim and Susan McDougal and the Clintons got into a land deal in Arkansas and then in 1985 they\u2026 . ( you can \u2019 t possibly still be reading this sentence , can you ? ) . Fear not . Whitewater will be back to bore you to tears for at least one more election cycle . At least , we \u2019 ll have Caitlyn Jenner \u2019 s wardrobe to keep us otherwise occupied .\nI suppose it \u2019 s possible that this year voters will wipe their hands of the Clintons once and for all and move on to other candidates . Or that someone will finally have footage of Hillary Clinton setting an American flag on fire while smoking a crack pipe at a Nazi appreciation meeting with Kim Jong Un .\nBut just in case the Republicans actually decide to win an election for a change without waiting for the Clintons to totally implode , a few pointers :\nSuggestion # 1 . Pull a Costanza . In one of Seinfeld \u2019 s iconic episodes , George Costanza resolves to do the opposite of every impulse or instinct he \u2019 s ever had . As Jerry sagely advises him , `` If every instinct you have is wrong , then the opposite would have to be right . \u201d\nFor decades , the GOP has virtually knocked over people to run to a microphone with attacks on Bill or Hillary , only to see it blow up in their face . Imagine what independents or persuadable Democrats might think of a GOP nominee who says something completely unexpected about the latest Clinton scandal\u2014something that runs totally opposite of their every instinct . Something like , \u201c You know , it \u2019 s easy to pile on the Clintons , but I \u2019 m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that the media does its job . My focus is on my campaign and my message to the voters , which is blah blah blah. \u201d ( Note to candidates : You \u2019 ll have to fill in the blah , blah , blah yourselves . )\nSuggestion # 2 . Study Thy Enemy . Has anyone else noticed that Hillary Clinton is suddenly wearing a lot of green ? And no , not green like the color of money . Just a vivid , eye-popping , deep hue .\nShe wore green at her Benghazi hearing and when she went to Iowa right after announcing for president . As Secretary of State , she memorably wore green at a G-12 summit .\nI mention this because there is little that the Clintons do , at least in the presidential context , that is unplanned . These are people , after all , who infamously polled where they should vacation .\nHillary Clinton \u2019 s team is very proud of their efforts to portray their boss as confident , calm , and soothing\u2014like a pastoral green meadow , perhaps ? And Secretary Clinton has hired someone with that very task in mind . That the former diplomat has calmly weathered a deluge of scandals that would drown lesser men ( word choice intentional ) only bolsters that image . Even now , as her polls numbers droop , she still scores well as a strong leader , far ahead of her rivals . It \u2019 s as if the Clinton camp is telling voters , if Hillary has the steel to withstand all of this mess , you can trust her to take on whatever ISIS throws at her .\nMaybe GOP candidates might give similar thought to their own demeanor and even their wardrobe . Do they come across to voters as serious , future-oriented , or presidential ? Or do they instead favor weird turtlenecks or wear large round glasses that we last saw on our high school science teacher ?\nSuggestion # 3 . Out-Clinton the Clintons . Notice what the Clintons do when serious allegations surface . They go out and give speeches . About campaign finance reform . Or juvenile justice reform . The key word , of course , is \u201c reform. \u201d As in change . As in the future .\nThey don \u2019 t worry about Washington-manufactured crises\u2014 such as counting how many times Hillary Clinton has answered questions from the press .
