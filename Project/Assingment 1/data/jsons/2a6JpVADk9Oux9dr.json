    "content": "President Donald Trump has released what was being touted as a `` skinny '' budget , meaning that it would put federal spending on a diet . Would that that were true . The blueprint , which does n't engage with entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security and other forms of `` mandatory '' spending at all , simply balances cuts to various parts of the government with increases to the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security . In fiscal 2017 , the government plans to spend around $ 1.1 trillion in discretionary spending ( this is spending that is voted on every year ; the rest of the federal budget is essentially on autopilot ) . Under Trump 's plan , it will spend that much again in 2018 . Overall federal spending will still come in around $ 4 trillion .\nFederal spending remains at historically high levels both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP . Since 2008 , outlays have been higher than 20 percent of GDP , well above the post-war average and most of the 1990s . While revenues have soared to record levels in absolute dollars , they come nowhere close to matching outlays , the result being continuing deficits and growing national debt , which is already greater than annual GDP . Because of the automatic spending increases built into `` mandatory '' programs such as Medicare and Social Security , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) projects growing debt over the next decade . Given the well-established correlation between persistent , high levels of national debt and reduced economic growth\u2014 '' debt overhangs '' \u2014this is not simply bad news but ruinous . Left-wing economists affiliated with the University of Massachusetts found `` the average real GDP growth rate for countries carrying a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent is\u20262.2 percent . '' That 's the same sluggish growth found by more market-friendly economists Carmen Reinhart , Kenneth Rogoff , and Vincent Reinhart : `` On average , debt levels above 90 percent\nare associated with growth that is 1.2 percent lower than in other periods ( 2.3 percent versus 3.5 percent ) . '' Indeed , in 20 out of 26 debt-overhang cases studied by Reinhart , Rogoff , and Reinhart , the period of reduced growth lasted a quarter-century , substantially reducing GDP and living standards ( see chart to right ) .\nAs it stands , CBO is already projecting historically low rates of economic growth over the coming decade . Earlier this year , CBO said it expects the economy to grow by just 1.8 percent annually through 2027 , well behind post-war rates of 3 percent or higher . And that already meager growth comes after eight years of just 1.4 percent on average per year . In a conversation with Matt Welch and me at the 2016 International Students for Liberty Conference , George Will observed that the difference between 2 percent annual growth and 3 percent annual growth is the difference between a positive , forward-looking country in which politics recede from everyday life and a Hobbesian nightmare in which interest groups slug it out over a barely growing pie . Note that he was talking about 2 percent annual growth , which seems positively aspirational in the 21st century .\nThat 's not to say that Trump 's budget blueprint , which he has already signaled is merely the start of negotiations with Congress , does n't have some positives . Indeed , it 's bracing and good to see a plan that takes a hacksaw if not a chainsaw to various federal departments ( even as I suspect most cuts will be bargained away in order to secure the hikes he wants ) . Here 's Table 2 of his plan , which summarizes how departments and agencies would be affected :\nIn percentage terms , there are double-digit cuts to cabinet departments such as Agriculture , Commerce , Education , Interior , and Transportation . The EPA takes it on the chin , facing a 31.4 percent budget cut . The howls of indignation from supporters of the status quo are already sounding around the internet and cable news programs , but there 's every \u2588\u2588\u2588 to believe that such savings can be accomplished with little to no impact on public safety or essential government functions . Another way of saying this is that government is a lagging indicator in American society and just as every business , household , and individual has spent the last decade-plus becoming more efficient , productive , and economical , now it 's the feds ' turn .\nThe fact of the matter is that while discretionary government spending has been relatively flat over the past several years , there were major , across-the-board increases pushed through during the Bush years and the early Obama years . As Mercatus Center economist and \u2588\u2588\u2588 columnist Veronique de Rugy has documented , spending ballooned by 53 percent in real terms under George W. Bush and has never gone down to anything like pre-9/11 totals . And we need to underscore that , on balance , Trump spends exactly as much as last year 's discretionary budget . This is where he loses any credibility with libertarians . There is no \u2588\u2588\u2588 to think that the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security could not function with the same sort of double-digit cuts the president levies on other departments and agencies . If Trump were truly a foe of the administrative state in any sort of principled way , I 'd expect him to be abolishing Homeland Security , a widely criticized agglomeration of power that has few supporters outside of those drawing food from its trough . `` The President 's 2018 budget ends the arbitrary depletion of our strength and security , and begins to rebuild the U.S. Armed Forces , '' reads the blueprint . It 's good , I suppose , that the White House recognizes that all the wars of the past 15 years were in some way `` arbitrary , '' but the way to stop depleting our military is to stop sending it all over the globe in fruitless endeavors that have turned Libya , Syria , Iraq , Afghanistan , and other places into danger zones . In the same breath , Trump 's document brags that the $ 52 billion increase he seeks above current levels of defense spending `` exceeds the entire defense budgets of most countries . '' Do we really need it then ? Worse still : De Rugy and Harvard economist Robert Barro found that `` a dollar increase in federal defense spending results in a less-than-a-dollar increase in GDP when the spending increase is deficit financed . '' If government spending is rarely stimulative under the best of circumstances , the sort of defense hike Trump is pushing actually shrinks an already wizened economy .\nTo this point , we 've only been talking about discretionary spending , which accounts for only about one-third of the federal budget . The rest covers mandatory spending on Medicare , Social Security , and other entitlements along with interest on the debt . If Willie Sutton robbed banks because that 's where the money was , any plan to seriously reduce government spending and debt service and thus hack away at the administrative state must confront entitlements . Trump has been unambiguous in saying that he does n't want to touch Social Security or Medicare/Medicaid , which are already the two biggest-ticket items in the federal budget and will only grow over the coming years due to the aging of the baby boom generation .\nTo date , all of the baby boom presidents\u2014Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , Barack Obama\u2014punted on serious entitlement reform , stoking instead generational warfare between relatively young and poor Millennials and relatively old and wealthy boomers . Trump , who may well be the last boomer president ( here 's hoping ) , shows every indication of putting his cohort 's interests before those of his children and grandchildren . Although basic budgetary realities will sink old-age entitlements sometime around 2030 and inflict 25 percent or more cuts in benefits , the Democrats and Republicans writ large have refused to seriously address the iceberg on the horizon .\nMany of Donald Trump 's supporters evinced an interest in `` burning it down , '' in razing Washington figuratively as the British did during the War of 1812 . In his first budget blueprint , their champion has not only failed to do that , he has n't even really thrown a good first punch . Despite offering significant reductions to parts of the federal budget , he has n't even submitted a plan that would reduce overall outlays after a decades-long spending spree that has purchased little but debt , deficits , and economic malaise .",
