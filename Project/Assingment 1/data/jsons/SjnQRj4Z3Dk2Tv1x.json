According to US Central Command ( Centcom ) , the attacks involved support or participation from Bahrain , Jordan , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates . Reported targets included the IS stronghold of Raqqa , in northeast Syria , as well as training camps and checkpoints in at least four Syrian provinces .\nVox reports that airstrikes began about 2:30 am Tuesday morning , according to a Twitter user who live-tweeted the start of the bombing , just before the Pentagon 's confirmation of the campaign 's start .\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , a London-based monitoring group , said at least 20 IS militants were killed in the strikes , as well as 30 fighters for Jabat al-Nusra , Al Qaeda 's official arm in Syria and a rival of IS . At least eight civilians were also killed , the Observatory says .\nOne activist , known as Abu Khalil , told the Los Angeles Times that the strikes in Raqqa were focused on the provincial government offices , which serves as IS 's headquarters , and also struck former government military bases and a security building in the city .
