    "content": "I t \u2019 s been 10 months since someone set an office building on fire at Highlander Research and Education Center , a storied civil rights institution perched in the mountains of northeastern Tennessee , but the investigation into the fire seems to have gone nowhere . The charred remains of the collapsed structure are still untouched , and the yellow tape blocking access to them has only recently come off . In the parking lot next to the destroyed building , a symbol someone spray-painted in black on the concrete the night of the fire is also untouched : It looks like a hashtag , but with three intersecting lines instead of two . That symbol is one used by racist extremists in the U.S. and abroad . It was painted on one of the firearms used by an Australian white supremacist who massacred 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch , New Zealand , just two weeks before the fire at Highlander . The Anti-Defamation League traced the symbol \u2019 s origins to a Romanian fascist movement dating back to the 1930s and 1940s . But while the symbol is obscure to most , it has resurfaced in connection with the Traditionalist Worker Party , a neo-Nazi group that was active in the U.S. until recently . A year before it was sprayed in the parking lot at Highlander , the symbol was also painted on \u201c the Rock , \u201d a boulder at the University of Tennessee \u2019 s Knoxville campus , not far from Highlander , used by students as a message board . Yet if the symbol was a clue about who might have attacked Highlander , investigators \u2014 with the Jefferson County Sheriff \u2019 s Office ; the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation ; the Tennessee State Fire Marshal \u2019 s Office ; the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ; and the FBI \u2014 have not yet said so publicly .\nNobody was hurt in the March 29 fire in New Market , where Highlander sits on a hilly 200-acre campus with stunning views of the Great Smoky Mountains . But it \u2019 s not the first time the center has come under attack . For nearly nine decades , Highlander has offered sanctuary to an array of racial , social , and economic justice movements , hosting the likes of Rosa Parks , Ella Baker , Stokely Carmichael , and the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. , as well as the activists who wrote the Movement for Black Lives policy platform and immigrant rights and Palestinian solidarity groups . But the center also has a long history of being targeted for harassment and violence by government officials and racist groups . In 1961 , as anti-communist fearmongering gripped the country , the state of Tennessee seized Highlander \u2019 s land and buildings and revoked its charter ; in 1966 , the Ku Klux Klan firebombed its Knoxville location . After this most recent attack , Highlander staff had few expectations that law enforcement officials investigating the fire would give them answers about who caused it \u2014 but they were taken aback by their questions .\nWhen local police arrived on the day of the fire , the first thing they asked Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson , one of Highlander \u2019 s two co-directors , was \u201c Are you beefing ? \u201d \u201c It was very clear to us that that there was some feeling that we might have done something to instigate this , versus white supremacy instigated this , \u201d said Henderson , the first black woman to lead the center . \u201c At that point , I didn \u2019 t even know what the symbol was or meant , but even when we did realize that it was a symbol of the white power movement , it \u2019 s not like we \u2019 re out there doing a tit for tat with them . I \u2019 m literally in a position where my very existence as a human is the antithesis of what they believe in. \u201d Andr\u00e9 Canty , who works in development and communications at Highlander , compared the line of questioning from police after the fire to that following the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in 2012 \u2014 or that often applied to black victims of police violence . \u201c What did he do to cause his own death ? \u201d said Canty . \u201c You \u2019 re asking me , why did your abuser abuse you ? Why are racists doing racist things ? \u201d But as federal investigators joined local police in the months following the fire , the questions posed to Highlander staff grew only more pointed and bizarre , as if they , and not their presumed attackers , were under investigation . \u201c Who do you train ? \u201d they were asked . \u201c Who funds you ? Are you training protesters ? Do you know antifa ? \u201d \u201c It was totally an interrogation , \u201d said Henderson . \u201c Instead of an investigation that \u2019 s going to produce information that tells us how we can make ourselves more safe from white supremacist violence , what tends to be true , historically , is that these are opportunities for the state to gather more information about who \u2019 s coming to Highlander , what they \u2019 re talking about , what you train them on. \u201d Asked about those questions , Jason Pack , a special agent with the FBI \u2019 s field office in Knoxville , wrote to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he was not \u201c personally aware of those issues , \u201d but declined to comment further because the investigation is \u201c ongoing. \u201d A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney \u2019 s Office told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that it is the office \u2019 s policy \u201c to neither confirm or deny the existence of or status of investigations. \u201d Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Coffey did not respond to a request for comment . The Fire Marshal \u2019 s Office referred questions to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation , which has since taken over fire investigations . A spokesperson for the bureau wrote in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that \u201c the cause of the fire remains under investigation. \u201d The ATF did not respond to a request for comment .\nPolicing Violence vs. Policing Dissent As white supremacists have carried out a growing number of deadly attacks in recent years , the FBI has come under mounting criticism for its failure to address the threat posed by far-right extremist ideologies , whose adherents account for most of the politically motivated violence in the U.S. At the same time , the bureau has also been heavily criticized for devoting large resources to surveilling political dissent by groups and individuals , often of color , who pose no threat but are critical of the government because they oppose official immigration policies or demand police accountability . The FBI \u2019 s preoccupation with policing nonviolent critical ideologies while neglecting to investigate ideologies tied to real , and increasing , violence was perhaps best captured in an infamous 2017 threat assessment report warning law enforcement agencies of the supposed rise of a \u201c black identity extremist \u201d movement targeting police , which the FBI said had emerged on the heels of the Ferguson protests and in response to \u201c perceived racism and injustice in American society. \u201d Yet as \u2588\u2588\u2588 has reported , and as a number of legislators , activists , and even law enforcement officials have repeatedly pointed out , the black identity extremism category was a product of the FBI \u2019 s imagination , assembled by cobbling together disparate , isolated incidents with no connection between them other than the race of their perpetrators . For more than a year after the assessment was leaked , the FBI refused to disavow the categorization , even while failing to point to any evidence suggesting that such an ideology existed in reality . Then last year , as the backlash around the label persisted , and as ongoing white supremacist attacks underscored the FBI \u2019 s seeming double standards , bureau officials told legislators that they were doing away with a set of earlier domestic terrorism categories in favor of four larger ones . The FBI \u2019 s fictional black identity extremists would now be lumped together with white supremacists under a new \u201c racially motivated violent extremism \u201d category . An FBI spokesperson declined to comment for this story , referring \u2588\u2588\u2588 to two congressional hearings in which bureau officials testified on the issue . \u201c The term I \u2019 m using is racially motivated violent extremist for the very fact that we \u2019 re focused on the violence ; we \u2019 re not focused on the skin of anyone , \u201d Michael McGarrity , assistant director of the FBI \u2019 s Counterterrorism Division , said in response to a legislator \u2019 s question about the FBI \u2019 s focus on supposed black identity extremists as opposed to white supremacist extremists . \u201c \u2018 Black identity extremist , \u2019 since I \u2019 ve been here , we have not used that term , \u201d added McGarrity , who was appointed to his position in February 2018 . \u201c But also , you \u2019 re not hearing me use \u2018 white supremacists \u2019 as a group . I \u2019 m focused on the violence . \u2026 Ideology itself is a First Amendment right . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s egregious to compare black dissent to what white nationalists are doing in this country . \u201d\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 noted at the time , that false equivalence made it virtually impossible for the public to know whether the FBI was devoting resources to investigating real threats of racist violence or social and racial justice groups critical of government . And while the FBI \u2019 s reclassification has already been replicated at the local level \u2014 for example , by the New York City Police Department , which recently announced a \u201c Racially and Ethnically Motivated Extremism \u201d unit \u2014 civil rights advocates warn that collapsing real and imaginary extremist ideologies risks providing cover for the ongoing targeting of nonviolent activists and activists of color . \u201c It \u2019 s egregious to compare black dissent to what white nationalists are doing in this country and to what white supremacy is doing in this country , \u201d said Henderson . \u201c Let \u2019 s just be real : If there \u2019 s a fear about domestic terror , white men are killing lots of people . And we \u2019 ve got to figure out how to deal with that. \u201d Rachel Levinson-Waldman , a senior counsel at the Brennan Center \u2019 s Liberty & National Security Program , told me that using the \u201c racially motivated \u201d umbrella term without distinction \u201c is a way to both hide the fact that there isn \u2019 t really black motivated violent extremism and at the same time , to justify the continued investigation . \u201d\nIn fact , civil rights advocates have argued against using recent white supremacist attacks to call for more domestic terror laws and mass policing of any ideology , cautioning that trampling on constitutionally protected speech in the absence of criminality or national security threats risks strengthening authoritarian systems that will inevitably blow back on government critics and minorities . But there is a fundamental difference between policing ideas and policing crime and criminal intent . The fire at Highlander , where the investigation of a criminal , violent act appears to have morphed into a broad inquiry into the political work of the victims , offers a troubling example of the obfuscation enabled by the \u201c racially motivated extremism \u201d label . \u201c There was a criminal act and there was presumably criminal planning that led up to it , which is different from surveilling simply on the basis of speech and ideology , \u201d said Levinson-Waldman . \u201c The focus on the victims of that act and their political work and organizing is incredibly distressing . It \u2019 s so backwards , and it \u2019 s so counterproductive . \u201d\nThe Memphis Blacklist While the fire at Highlander remains unsolved almost a year after it occurred , 400 miles away , on the opposite side of the state , a recent lawsuit against the city of Memphis has exposed the lengths to which police will go to surveil the free speech activities of Black Lives Matter and other activists who have committed no crimes . In 2018 , a federal judge in Memphis ruled that the city \u2019 s police department was in violation of a decades-old federal consent decree prohibiting local law enforcement from gathering \u201c political intelligence. \u201d The ruling followed litigation that revealed that Memphis police \u2019 s Office of Homeland Security , a unit set up following the 9/11 attacks , had engaged in widespread and systemic surveillance of the constitutionally protected activities of individuals protesting , among other things , the killings of black men at the hands of police . The litigation strikingly revealed how the domestic political surveillance efforts ramped up after 9/11 evolved in the post-Ferguson era . It exposed a fake Facebook profile police had created to \u201c friend \u201d activists and monitor their discussions and plans . It showed that police had used software designed to comb social media chatter and map connections between individuals based on their digital interactions . It revealed that police had been compiling a series of \u201c joint intelligence briefs \u201d on local activists , including pictures , comments , and details about events they planned to attend , which they then distributed as often as three times a day to other law enforcement agencies , including the FBI , the military , and a number of large local businesses , such as FedEx . And the litigation revealed that police had also monitored church services , candlelight vigils , even a black-owned food truck festival and a school supplies giveaway .\nThe lawsuit itself followed the discovery by local activists of a \u201c blacklist \u201d of 84 individuals whom the city had secretly barred from entering City Hall without police escort . The list included some of the city \u2019 s most vocal organizers , but also some whom police had found to be merely \u201c associates \u201d of known protesters , as well as the mother and aunt of Darrius Stewart , a 19-year-old black man killed by Memphis police during a 2015 traffic stop . Keedran Franklin , a 33-year-old activist and organizer , and one of four named plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said he \u2019 s always suspected that police were keeping tabs on him , but first had those fears confirmed in early 2017 , when a friend who was working as a security contractor for the city told him that officials \u201c have a book on y \u2019 all , \u201d Franklin recalled . \u201c They have pictures , known associations , your picture is on the wall . \u201d\nFranklin had first become active in his community by working on violence interruption programs and collaborating with the former mayor \u2019 s \u201c guns down \u201d initiative , but he had become suspicious of the information the city kept on the youth he worked with and grew increasingly skeptical of what he now believes was a surveillance effort masked as community outreach . \u201c I felt like I was helping them prey on us , \u201d he told me . Franklin soon started organizing protests and direct actions , first with the Fight for $ 15 campaign to raise the minimum wage and then , after the Ferguson protests and the killing of Stewart in Memphis , against police violence . But Franklin never threatened police or anyone else , he stressed , and Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings even gave him his personal cellphone number after Franklin helped negotiate with police during a protest , offering to help disperse protesters if police promised not to arrest anyone . \u201c Why would he allow me to have his number if I \u2019 m this much of a threat ? \u201d said Franklin . \u201c It was all political , flat out political . They had no criminal investigations around any of us. \u201d When the lawsuit yielded dozens of joint intelligence briefs and other internal police documents , Franklin \u2019 s name , photo , and activities were all over them . \u201c Keedran Franklin has participated in several demonstrations/protests and is associated with a group called Memphis Coalition of Concerned Citizens , \u201d reads one of several police documents about Franklin , which also lists other individuals he is \u201c closely associated with \u201d and notes that they espouse several causes , such as \u201c Free Palestine , \u201d \u201c Fight for $ 15 , \u201d and \u201c Standing Rock . \u201d\nMemphis offers the most detailed picture we have of what domestic political surveillance looks like in practice .\nFranklin already knew he was being monitored ; he had been followed by unmarked cars for years , and he often confronted police and livestreamed the exchanges with his phone when he saw them watching him . But the extent of the surveillance revealed in the documents surprised even him : Some memos listed people \u2019 s height and weight , Social Security numbers , and in one case details of an individual \u2019 s mental health history . And Franklin realized when he learned of the joint intelligence briefs that a new neighbor who had told him that he looked familiar had been receiving the memos police had written on him and distributed widely . \u201c I \u2019 m not this terrorist they are painting me to be , \u201d he said . \u201c I got flaws , I \u2019 m not perfect , but I \u2019 m no damn terrorist. \u201d Police surveillance efforts seem to have picked up after Stewart \u2019 s killing in July 2015 . A year earlier , the protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , had kicked off nationwide rallies against police violence . And a couple of months before Stewart was killed , protests over the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore had reignited anger at police , while also putting local and federal law enforcement on high alert . In Memphis , a majority black city where distrust of police runs deep \u2014 \u201c and for good cause , \u201d as a local lawyer put it \u2014 tensions came to a peak on July 10 , 2016 , after the police killings of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota , when hundreds of peaceful protesters shut down the Hernando de Soto Bridge that crosses the Mississippi River to connect Tennessee to Arkansas .\nThat protest \u2014 the largest in Memphis \u2019 s recent history \u2014 kicked off a series of others in the following months , and the police department \u2019 s Homeland Security office , which had previously focused on domestic and international terrorism threats , \u201c shifted almost entirely to obtaining intelligence about planned large events with the potential for violence against large scale disruption of traffic or commerce , \u201d the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in court filings . In an internal slide made public through the litigation , police even called 2016 \u201c A Year of Social Unrest Reminiscent of the late 1960s and early 1970s , \u201d just as they resorted to the surveillance tactics of those years . Through 2016 , officers monitored activists as they protested racist coverage by the local paper , rallied outside Elvis Presley \u2019 s Graceland mansion , and staged a peaceful \u201c die-in \u201d outside the home of Mayor Jim Strickland in December 2016 . It \u2019 s that die-in in particular that prompted officials to add activists and protesters to the blacklist \u2014 or \u201c escort list , \u201d as they called it \u2014 which up to that point had mostly included former employees or individuals accused of threats or disorderly conduct . The mayor personally authorized the addition to the list of many of the protesters who had lain down in his front yard . Ursula Madden , the chief communications officer for the city of Memphis , challenged the description of the protest as \u201c peaceful , \u201d saying that protesters \u201c showed up at the mayor \u2019 s home with their faces covered , climbed in the trees on his private property , tried to open the doors to his house and peeked into the windows while his family was inside sleeping\u2014all while recording it on Facebook live and making threatening comments . \u201d\nBut both the blacklist and the police intelligence operation directed at protesters violated a 1978 consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department that Memphis had entered after it was found to have illegally compiled dossiers on anti-war and student activists through the 1960s and 1970s . While the Justice Department has entered into dozens of such agreements with police departments across the country in an effort to bring them in line with federal civil rights standards , most decrees have focused on excessive force or discriminatory policing . The Memphis consent decree is the only one nationwide that focuses on the issue of political surveillance . And because of the thousands of pages of documents and the public testimony produced by the recent lawsuit , Memphis also offers the most detailed picture we have of what domestic political surveillance looks like in practice . \u201c Memphis is a microcosm of what we assume is happening across the country , \u201d said Levinson-Waldman , who serves on a federal monitoring team a judge put in place after he found the city to be in violation of the decree . \u201c It \u2019 s the clearest window that we have into what kind of surveillance is going on. \u201d One Big Plantation In Memphis , no one can possibly forget that the police are watching . If across the country security cameras have become a ubiquitous reality of modern life , whose presence is easy to forget as they blend into the urban landscape , Memphis \u2019 s cameras light up the city with piercing blue flashes that flicker endlessly from utility poles like thousands of blinking eyes . Memphis \u2019 s distinctive \u201c SkyCop \u201d cameras \u2014 more than 2,000 in 500 locations across the city \u2014 feed millions of hours of footage a year into the city \u2019 s Real Time Crime Center . The cameras are another legacy of the war on terror , as officials in Memphis , a major commercial hub , first looked to boost video surveillance capabilities to protect critical infrastructure . In fact , the cameras have largely been used to deter crime , but the lawsuit revealed that they were also used to surveil protesters in violation of the decree . \u201c It \u2019 s a police state , for real , \u201d said Franklin , of the cameras . \u201c They started taking that equipment and technology and turned it inward , onto us. \u201d But there are other reminders of police surveillance . Antonio Cathey , another well-known Memphis activist and organizer with Fight for $ 15 , told me that at a turkey giveaway some friends and family had organized before Thanksgiving , police stood at a distance watching people with binoculars . And that \u2019 s nothing compared to what happened to Cathey in August 2018 , on the very first day of the consent decree trial . Cathey was in court watching the proceedings when his grandmother called to tell him that police had pushed their way into her house and , across the street , that of his uncle .\nWhen Cathey raced there , he found dozens of officers from various agencies , many in riot gear and face masks . The officers had raided the homes and issued his uncle a citation after they found a trace of marijuana in his car \u2019 s ashtray \u2014 not enough to justify an arrest . \u201c They tore the house completely up , \u201d said Cathey , adding that he had been terrified for his grandmother . \u201c I told her , Don \u2019 t open the door for them . Every guy with a badge and a gun is not a good cop. \u201d Cathey , who recognized one of the officers from protests he had attended , repeatedly asked police why they were there , but all they told him was , \u201c We know all about you \u201d and \u201c We know exactly who you are. \u201d A neighbor pointed to a light pole on the street that he said municipal workers had come to fix in the early hours of the morning , even though it didn \u2019 t appear to be broken . There was a box on the pole with black and yellow tape , and a sign warning , \u2018 Danger , don \u2019 t touch. \u2019 But Cathey could see a camera lens behind the tape .\nThat \u2019 s when it clicked for him that the raid was no coincidence . \u201c We just had court downtown , \u201d he said . \u201c I see what \u2019 s going on . If they can \u2019 t get to you , they \u2019 ll get to your family. \u201d Madden , the city spokesperson , said in a statement that the incident was \u201c unrelated \u201d to the lawsuit . Since then , relatives have told Cathey that they support him but wish he would stop going to protests . \u201c I \u2019 m not going to stop doing this , \u201d he said . \u201c I have the right to do this , and [ police ] are not going to stop me . If they \u2019 re looking for something , I \u2019 m open , it \u2019 s right on my Facebook page. \u201d But it \u2019 s not just activists who are learning to live with a surveillance apparatus they assume to be ubiquitous . Journalists and lawyers in Memphis whisper when they speak in public places . They get suspicious when a car remains behind them after a couple of turns . When I met in a cafe with Wendi C. Thomas , who for years wrote a column for Memphis \u2019 s largest newspaper before recently starting the independent news organization , MLK50 : Justice Through Journalism , she kept watching her back before asking if we could speak in a more private place . \u201c I know when I talk to people who aren \u2019 t from Memphis that I sound crazy , \u201d she told me . Then , citing a phrase others have used to describe Memphis , she added , \u201c This place is one big plantation . \u201d\nThomas , who as the Commercial Appeal \u2019 s first black female columnist endured years of threats of violence from readers , including death and rape threats , said she discovered the Memphis police had been tracking her social media pages in the middle of the consent decree trial , which she was covering . Thomas was looking down at her notebook when she heard an officer who was testifying about the fake identity he created to friend activists on Facebook read her name out loud , twice , from an exhibit page . \u201c I looked up and was like , Did he just say my name ? Why would they be monitoring me ? \u201d she said . Thomas immediately filed a public records request for her name and that of three other female journalists , including the photographer for this story , whose name had come up in testimony . It took the city 433 days to respond . Thomas believes that she and the other journalists came under surveillance because they were in contact with activists . \u201c I think it speaks to the trust that we have built , intentionally , with activists and organizers , \u201d she said . \u201c The fact that you have sources is proof that you \u2019 re a good journalist . For some of us who have a broad variety of sources , including those in communities that are marginalized , it \u2019 s proof that we are doing our jobs . But that also makes us a target . If more journalists here in Memphis saw that as part of their job , maybe it would be harder for the city to target all of us . \u201d\n\u201c The day before the 50th anniversary of King \u2019 s assassination , they \u2019 re out there arresting journalists and organizers . \u201d\nThere is little question that the targeting is real . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 has reported , Memphis police in 2018 arrested undocumented journalist Manuel Duran , who ran a local Spanish-language news site , while he covered a protest to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. \u2019 s assassination in the city . When the charges against Duran were quickly dismissed , instead of releasing him , police turned him over to officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement , who detained him for over a year . While a number of activists were also arrested at the protest , several other reporters who were there were not . And Duran , who was wearing a press badge , appeared to have been singled out . He was well known to local police , which he had covered critically , and in his own video of the incident , an officer can be heard saying , \u201c Get him , guys \u201d and pointing in Duran \u2019 s direction . Then officers grab him even as two activists try to shield him and scream , \u201c He \u2019 s a reporter. \u201d In a statement , the city \u2019 s spokesperson wrote that \u201c officers did not know Mr. Duran , or know that he was a member of the media , \u201d and that he was \u201c one of many people arrested for blocking traffic. \u201d \u201c History doesn \u2019 t rhyme , but it echoes , \u201d Thomas said about the episode . \u201c It \u2019 s disturbing : The day before the 50th anniversary of King \u2019 s assassination , they \u2019 re out there arresting journalists and organizers . \u201d\nPolice surveillance continued even in church . Rev . Earle Fisher , a pastor at the city \u2019 s Abyssinian Missionary Baptist Church and an outspoken community leader , said a meeting he hosted at the church after the 2016 bridge protest had also been monitored by police . Fisher said people there had joked about the church being bugged , but he was nonetheless shocked to learn from a local news outlet that his church was one of the spaces that law enforcement was watching after the Tennessee Department of Homeland Security had warned Memphis police that \u201c gangs , home grown extremists and criminals \u201d could use legal protests as cover to incite violence . Fisher said that if there was a real threat of violence at the church , police should have told him \u2014 but they never did . Fisher first realized how far the city would go to monitor critics when he noticed \u201c Tennessee Department of Homeland Security \u201d pop up on his listed Wi-Fi networks at home . Once , after he wrote a public letter to the city \u2019 s district attorney about the killing of Darrius Stewart , a friend in law enforcement warned him to \u201c keep his nose clean \u201d because the DA \u201c ran his profile to see if anything came up. \u201d \u201c If you know anything about history , these types of things are always going to happen , \u201d said Fisher . Now every time a phone call drops , he just thinks , It must be them . But Fisher added that he and most activists he knows have simply taken note of the surveillance and continued to do the work . \u201c When you are somebody who has been clearly committed to advocating against an unjust status quo , then you are going to find yourself at odds with any entity that \u2019 s been constructed to protect the status quo , \u201d he said . \u201c I know I \u2019 m on the right side of history , I know I \u2019 m doing this for the right reasons , and I know , based on my constitutional rights , that I \u2019 m doing this the right way . At some point , you just hope it breaks through . \u201d\nA City of Spies Memphis has a long history of both activism and government surveillance . The city was a focal point for the labor and anti-war movements , and it \u2019 s there that King marched for the last time in a rally in support of a sanitation workers \u2019 strike in 1968 . At the height of the civil rights movement , around 1965 , the Memphis Police Department established a Domestic Intelligence Unit that began to infiltrate and keep secret dossiers about citizens engaging in constitutionally protected political activities , from vigils against the Vietnam War to union efforts . Much like the FBI was doing at the same time under the now-infamous COINTELPRO program , the Memphis Police Department targeted the ACLU , the NAACP , the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , and various workers groups . Without warrants , it monitored their mail and phones and kept files on their activities , relationships , and sexual preferences , relying on a network of undercover agents and informants to gather intelligence on unsuspecting individuals . The extent of the DIU \u2019 s surveillance was finally exposed in the mid-1970s , when Memphis State student Eric Carter discovered his roommate had been an undercover officer . When Carter demanded to see the files police had kept on him , the city incinerated them . As it became clear that officials planned to destroy all evidence of the DIU \u2019 s work , the ACLU intervened , represented by Memphis civil rights attorney Bruce Kramer , and requested a federal court to stop the city from destroying more evidence . But before the order could be served , Mayor Wyeth Chandler ordered the DIU terminated and \u201c ten filing cabinets of photographs , reports and documents compiled over a nine-year period \u2026 stuffed into garbage bags by DIU staff , taken to city \u2019 s Scott Street incinerator , doused with fuel and burned , \u201d according to the ACLU \u2019 s retelling of the incident . That \u2019 s when the ACLU filed Kendrick v. Chandler , a class-action lawsuit that in 1978 led to a federal consent decree banning the city of Memphis from \u201c engaging in law enforcement activities which interfere with any person \u2019 s rights protected by the First Amendment. \u201d Even in connection to a criminal investigation , the order continued , \u201c the City of Memphis must appropriately limit all law enforcement activities so as not to infringe on any person \u2019 s First Amendment rights. \u201d Since then , Kramer has periodically checked to make sure that police were abiding by the ban , but it was in the aftermath of the Ferguson protests and the killing of Darrius Stewart that it became evident police were brazenly violating the decree . When activists learned of the blacklist \u2014 after one of them showed up at City Hall and was told that he couldn \u2019 t enter without a police escort \u2014 Kramer filed a new lawsuit on behalf of Franklin and three others , accusing the city of violating the Kendrick decree . The ACLU joined the suit after the judge in the case indicated that the four were not part of the original 1976 lawsuit and therefore couldn \u2019 t bring the claim , an interpretation Kramer vehemently contests .\nFor Kramer , there is little difference between today \u2019 s surveillance and what the city of Memphis engaged in half a century ago . \u201c The basic principles are the same : People have a First Amendment right to protest and a Fourth Amendment right not to have these dossiers kept on them , \u201d he told me . \u201c In the \u2019 70s , and even before then , in the \u2019 60s and \u2019 50s and \u2019 40s , they were worried about communists , and then they were worried about the Black Panthers , and then they were worried about the Weathermen , and then they were worried about the civil rights people . There is no doubt they fear the activist community \u2014 black and white. \u201d Despite being under federal court orders , the Memphis Police Department never put in place guidelines or training to make sure that officers wouldn \u2019 t conduct political surveillance . And when attorneys started deposing police as part of the recent litigation , they realized that \u201c there was a complete ignorance amongst the entire department about the existence of the decree , \u201d said Thomas Castelli , legal director of the ACLU of Tennessee .\n\u201c I should not have to live in fear of me and my son being surveilled . \u201d\nThe week before the trial started , the city also filed a motion to modify the terms of the decree , which it argued was written before the internet and surveillance technology and was inapplicable to today \u2019 s policing methods . After Judge Jon McCalla of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee found the city in contempt of the decree , he brought in a federal monitoring team that \u2019 s currently in the process of negotiating guidelines , trainings , and an auditing mechanism the police department must follow going forward . But the city has also continued to argue that the decree is obsolete and makes it harder for police to do their job \u2014 an argument that McCalla refuted in clear terms last November , when he denied a new request by the city \u2019 s lawyers to modify the terms of the decree . The decree , McCalla wrote , \u201c acts as a bulwark , ensuring that the City \u2019 s surveillance practices do not cross the line from being a powerful weapon in the fight against crime to becoming an intrusive tool that improperly interferes with its residents \u2019 First Amendment-protected activities . \u201d\nThe drawn-out process and the city \u2019 s apparent backpedaling have frustrated activists , and two recent community meetings held by the monitor have been heated . \u201c This is not like we \u2019 re two parties and we have to mediate a fight , \u201d said Franklin . \u201c The city administration and police force violated our constitutional rights . They \u2019 re in the wrong and need to be treated as such . \u2026 They still never apologized. \u201d Franklin , who became a father in November , said he fears that the judge \u2019 s ruling and the monitoring team won \u2019 t be enough to stop police from harassing him . \u201c I don \u2019 t want my son to be under the scope of Big Brother like a Fred Hampton Jr. , \u201d he said , referring to the son of Fred Hampton , the young leader of the Black Panthers killed by Chicago police in 1969 . \u201c I should not have to live in fear of me and my son being surveilled . My son should not have to live in fear of that. \u201d According to Madden , \u201c the City is complying with the consent decree . However the City has the right to seek modification of the consent decree , which is 40 years old , and is not consistent with best police practices to provide safety in the 21st century. \u201d In a recent interview about the decree with a local media outlet , Rallings , the police director , also argued that the decree is outdated . \u201c In 1978 , nobody wore seatbelts , \u201d said Rallings . \u201c Well , we learned that seatbelts save lives , so everybody knows it \u2019 s click it or ticket . So we found that something that was done in the \u2019 70s we probably need to go revisit and modify and make it apply to modern police work , and that \u2019 s all we \u2019 re asking. \u201d But Rallings also connected Memphis \u2019 s surveillance efforts to the warnings local police have been getting from federal law enforcement , particularly following the killings of eight police officers during protests in Dallas and Baton Rouge in 2016 . \u201c That was a peaceful protest , until a gunman opened fire , \u201d said Rallings . \u201c If we think about the number of threats that we are receiving , information from the FBI that individuals were infiltrating peaceful protests and had nefarious intents . \u2026 We had an obligation to protect our citizens. \u201d In fact , documents obtained in discovery show that police were regularly distributing intelligence briefings that compiled news coverage of incidents of violence against police officers in other cities with information gleaned from social media about rallies and actions planned in Memphis \u2014 even though there was no connection between them . Other documents show that round-the-clock social media monitoring of Memphis-based activists yielded no evidence that they posed any threat .\n\u201c There \u2019 s this kind of connotation here , whether they intended that connotation or not , and it \u2019 s going out to pretty much every cop in the city , \u201d Castelli said . \u201c I think it \u2019 s just indicative of what \u2019 s going on all over the country with this : law enforcement that is concerning itself more and more with what people are saying , and particularly with what they are saying about law enforcement . \u2026 There seems to be a theme , and it fits with the larger antagonism between activists for police reform and the police that are supposed to make sure they can say what they want to say. \u201d Some activists noted that police surveillance of police critics and protests against police violence was particularly frustrating when compared to police \u2019 s hands-off treatment of far-right groups that have also rallied in Memphis and across Tennessee . \u201c One of these is not like the other , \u201d said Fisher , the pastor . \u201c But here \u2019 s a basic thought : Treat us the same way you treat the white supremacists when they come to town . \u2026 This is a concrete choice , them saying , \u2018 No , we \u2019 re not going to provide you with the same constitutional rights and privileges as we would provide the Sons of the Confederate Veterans . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c Here \u2019 s a basic thought : Treat us the same way you treat the white supremacists when they come to town . \u201d\nAs it happens , Tennessee has long been a hotbed for the white nationalist movement . \u201c It seems to be viewed as a friendly place for white supremacists , \u201d said Castelli . Halfway between Highlander and Memphis is the town of Pulaski , the birthplace of the Klan , and in recent years the state hosted 20 percent of the country \u2019 s white supremacist gatherings and events , according to the Anti-Defamation League . And while Memphis and the Appalachian mountains where Highlander is located are very different demographically and politically , activists from both communities recognize their experiences as being part of the same criminalization of black dissent in a state that has a long history of both civil rights struggles and white supremacist backlash . \u201c What \u2019 s absurd is that they are spending so many resources on that sort of thing across the state in Memphis , a black city , when literally white supremacists are firebombing buildings over here , \u201d said Highlander \u2019 s Henderson . \u201c Why are you surveilling Keedran ? Why are you surveilling me ? What did I do ? If the only answer you have is that we are black and we disagree with the power structures that are harming our communities , then how is this any different than McCarthyism ? How is it different than COINTELPRO ? \u201d\nA History of Harassment Last summer , Henderson and Franklin joined activists from Philadelphia , Minneapolis , and across the country in a delegation to Capitol Hill organized by the racial justice group MediaJustice , which together with the ACLU has been lobbying lawmakers to demand more transparency from the FBI about its surveillance of activists of color . Myaisha Hayes , an organizer with MediaJustice who runs the group \u2019 s \u201c protect Black dissent \u201d campaign , told me that what was happening on opposite sides of Tennessee was exactly what she feared would continue to happen as the FBI collapsed real and imaginary extremist categories into the generic \u201c racially motivated extremism. \u201d \u201c On one side of the state , you \u2019 ve got people dealing with the police department clearly violating an agreement not to surveil activists , and then a few hours away , you have activists calling for help to investigate an act of hatred , an act of violence , and yet there \u2019 s no follow-up , \u201d she said . \u201c While the government and the police have such a long history of surveilling and criminalizing black folks , they \u2019 ve really left those same communities vulnerable to white supremacist violence and police violence. \u201d At Highlander , being targeted for state surveillance and harassment while also coming under threat of violence by white supremacist groups has a long history . At Highlander \u2019 s workshop center \u2014 a red two-story structure where visiting activists and organizers gather for meals and meetings \u2014 a series of panels line the walls , describing Highlander \u2019 s achievements over the decades along with the attacks on the center in those same years . The Highlander Folk School was founded by Myles Horton at Monteagle , Tennessee , in 1932 as a space to organize poor and working people in the South , and from its early days , the school served as a radical space for education , movement building , and desegregation . Through the 1930s and 1940s , Highlander was accused of being \u201c thoroughly communistic \u201d and a \u201c free love \u201d community . The center lost some of its union partners to the red-baiting and faced a series of bomb threats . The harassment continued through the 1950s as the school was infiltrated and accused of \u201c fomenting racial strife and disrupting values and institutions of the South. \u201d Highlander had always promoted interracial solidarity , but through the \u2019 50s and \u2019 60s , the center was pivotal to the black freedom movement : Highlander organized voter registration workshops and adult literacy programs to fight disenfranchisement . Parks trained at the school months before the Montgomery bus boycott . And it \u2019 s there that Pete Seeger taught King the reworked lyrics to \u201c We Shall Overcome. \u201d In 1961 , following an FBI investigation , Tennessee officials closed the school , took its land , and revoked its charter . The padlocked buildings were burned down shortly after . Highlander relocated to a house in Knoxville and changed its name to the current Highlander Research and Education Center . \u201c They literally just changed the name and kept doing what they were doing , \u201d said Henderson . In Knoxville , the harassment continued . In 1963 , an interracial training camp for activists organized by Highlander was raided by police , who arrested 29 people . Days later , someone burned the camp down . In 1966 , after the Klan marched against the center \u2019 s Knoxville location , someone threw a Molotov cocktail through its window . Highlander moved to its current location in 1972 . \u201c Highlander was attacked a lot , \u201d said Susan Williams , a coordinator at the center \u2019 s library who has been with the organization for more than 30 years . \u201c How it still exists is kind of a miracle . \u201d",
    "content_original": "I t\u2019s been 10 months since someone set an office building on fire at Highlander Research and Education Center, a storied civil rights institution perched in the mountains of northeastern Tennessee, but the investigation into the fire seems to have gone nowhere. The charred remains of the collapsed structure are still untouched, and the yellow tape blocking access to them has only recently come off. In the parking lot next to the destroyed building, a symbol someone spray-painted in black on the concrete the night of the fire is also untouched: It looks like a hashtag, but with three intersecting lines instead of two. That symbol is one used by racist extremists in the U.S. and abroad. It was painted on one of the firearms used by an Australian white supremacist who massacred 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, just two weeks before the fire at Highlander. The Anti-Defamation League traced the symbol\u2019s origins to a Romanian fascist movement dating back to the 1930s and 1940s. But while the symbol is obscure to most, it has resurfaced in connection with the Traditionalist Worker Party, a neo-Nazi group that was active in the U.S. until recently. A year before it was sprayed in the parking lot at Highlander, the symbol was also painted on \u201cthe Rock,\u201d a boulder at the University of Tennessee\u2019s Knoxville campus, not far from Highlander, used by students as a message board. Yet if the symbol was a clue about who might have attacked Highlander, investigators \u2014 with the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office; the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation; the Tennessee State Fire Marshal\u2019s Office; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the FBI \u2014 have not yet said so publicly.\n\nNobody was hurt in the March 29 fire in New Market, where Highlander sits on a hilly 200-acre campus with stunning views of the Great Smoky Mountains. But it\u2019s not the first time the center has come under attack. For nearly nine decades, Highlander has offered sanctuary to an array of racial, social, and economic justice movements, hosting the likes of Rosa Parks, Ella Baker, Stokely Carmichael, and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., as well as the activists who wrote the Movement for Black Lives policy platform and immigrant rights and Palestinian solidarity groups. But the center also has a long history of being targeted for harassment and violence by government officials and racist groups. In 1961, as anti-communist fearmongering gripped the country, the state of Tennessee seized Highlander\u2019s land and buildings and revoked its charter; in 1966, the Ku Klux Klan firebombed its Knoxville location. After this most recent attack, Highlander staff had few expectations that law enforcement officials investigating the fire would give them answers about who caused it \u2014 but they were taken aback by their questions.\n\nThe workshop space at the Highlander Research and Education Center.

Right/Bottom: Andr\u00e9 Canty, who works in development and communications at Highlander.Photos: Andrea Morales for The Intercept\n\nWhen local police arrived on the day of the fire, the first thing they asked Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, one of Highlander\u2019s two co-directors, was \u201cAre you beefing?\u201d \u201cIt was very clear to us that that there was some feeling that we might have done something to instigate this, versus white supremacy instigated this,\u201d said Henderson, the first black woman to lead the center. \u201cAt that point, I didn\u2019t even know what the symbol was or meant, but even when we did realize that it was a symbol of the white power movement, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re out there doing a tit for tat with them. I\u2019m literally in a position where my very existence as a human is the antithesis of what they believe in.\u201d Andr\u00e9 Canty, who works in development and communications at Highlander, compared the line of questioning from police after the fire to that following the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in 2012 \u2014 or that often applied to black victims of police violence. \u201cWhat did he do to cause his own death?\u201d said Canty. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me, why did your abuser abuse you? Why are racists doing racist things?\u201d But as federal investigators joined local police in the months following the fire, the questions posed to Highlander staff grew only more pointed and bizarre, as if they, and not their presumed attackers, were under investigation. \u201cWho do you train?\u201d they were asked. \u201cWho funds you? Are you training protesters? Do you know antifa?\u201d \u201cIt was totally an interrogation,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cInstead of an investigation that\u2019s going to produce information that tells us how we can make ourselves more safe from white supremacist violence, what tends to be true, historically, is that these are opportunities for the state to gather more information about who\u2019s coming to Highlander, what they\u2019re talking about, what you train them on.\u201d Asked about those questions, Jason Pack, a special agent with the FBI\u2019s field office in Knoxville, wrote to The Intercept that he was not \u201cpersonally aware of those issues,\u201d but declined to comment further because the investigation is \u201congoing.\u201d A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office told The Intercept that it is the office\u2019s policy \u201cto neither confirm or deny the existence of or status of investigations.\u201d Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Coffey did not respond to a request for comment. The Fire Marshal\u2019s Office referred questions to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which has since taken over fire investigations. A spokesperson for the bureau wrote in a statement to The Intercept that \u201cthe cause of the fire remains under investigation.\u201d The ATF did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA view of a mural at the Workshop Center at Highlander. Photo: Andrea Morales for The Intercept\n\nPolicing Violence vs. Policing Dissent As white supremacists have carried out a growing number of deadly attacks in recent years, the FBI has come under mounting criticism for its failure to address the threat posed by far-right extremist ideologies, whose adherents account for most of the politically motivated violence in the U.S. At the same time, the bureau has also been heavily criticized for devoting large resources to surveilling political dissent by groups and individuals, often of color, who pose no threat but are critical of the government because they oppose official immigration policies or demand police accountability. The FBI\u2019s preoccupation with policing nonviolent critical ideologies while neglecting to investigate ideologies tied to real, and increasing, violence was perhaps best captured in an infamous 2017 threat assessment report warning law enforcement agencies of the supposed rise of a \u201cblack identity extremist\u201d movement targeting police, which the FBI said had emerged on the heels of the Ferguson protests and in response to \u201cperceived racism and injustice in American society.\u201d Yet as The Intercept has reported, and as a number of legislators, activists, and even law enforcement officials have repeatedly pointed out, the black identity extremism category was a product of the FBI\u2019s imagination, assembled by cobbling together disparate, isolated incidents with no connection between them other than the race of their perpetrators. For more than a year after the assessment was leaked, the FBI refused to disavow the categorization, even while failing to point to any evidence suggesting that such an ideology existed in reality. Then last year, as the backlash around the label persisted, and as ongoing white supremacist attacks underscored the FBI\u2019s seeming double standards, bureau officials told legislators that they were doing away with a set of earlier domestic terrorism categories in favor of four larger ones. The FBI\u2019s fictional black identity extremists would now be lumped together with white supremacists under a new \u201cracially motivated violent extremism\u201d category. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment for this story, referring The Intercept to two congressional hearings in which bureau officials testified on the issue. \u201cThe term I\u2019m using is racially motivated violent extremist for the very fact that we\u2019re focused on the violence; we\u2019re not focused on the skin of anyone,\u201d Michael McGarrity, assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, said in response to a legislator\u2019s question about the FBI\u2019s focus on supposed black identity extremists as opposed to white supremacist extremists. \u201c\u2018Black identity extremist,\u2019 since I\u2019ve been here, we have not used that term,\u201d added McGarrity, who was appointed to his position in February 2018. \u201cBut also, you\u2019re not hearing me use \u2018white supremacists\u2019 as a group. I\u2019m focused on the violence. \u2026 Ideology itself is a First Amendment right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s egregious to compare black dissent to what white nationalists are doing in this country.\u201d\n\nAs The Intercept noted at the time, that false equivalence made it virtually impossible for the public to know whether the FBI was devoting resources to investigating real threats of racist violence or social and racial justice groups critical of government. And while the FBI\u2019s reclassification has already been replicated at the local level \u2014 for example, by the New York City Police Department, which recently announced a \u201cRacially and Ethnically Motivated Extremism\u201d unit \u2014 civil rights advocates warn that collapsing real and imaginary extremist ideologies risks providing cover for the ongoing targeting of nonviolent activists and activists of color. \u201cIt\u2019s egregious to compare black dissent to what white nationalists are doing in this country and to what white supremacy is doing in this country,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cLet\u2019s just be real: If there\u2019s a fear about domestic terror, white men are killing lots of people. And we\u2019ve got to figure out how to deal with that.\u201d Rachel Levinson-Waldman, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty & National Security Program, told me that using the \u201cracially motivated\u201d umbrella term without distinction \u201cis a way to both hide the fact that there isn\u2019t really black motivated violent extremism and at the same time, to justify the continued investigation.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Andrea Morales for The Intercept\n\nIn fact, civil rights advocates have argued against using recent white supremacist attacks to call for more domestic terror laws and mass policing of any ideology, cautioning that trampling on constitutionally protected speech in the absence of criminality or national security threats risks strengthening authoritarian systems that will inevitably blow back on government critics and minorities. But there is a fundamental difference between policing ideas and policing crime and criminal intent. The fire at Highlander, where the investigation of a criminal, violent act appears to have morphed into a broad inquiry into the political work of the victims, offers a troubling example of the obfuscation enabled by the \u201cracially motivated extremism\u201d label. \u201cThere was a criminal act and there was presumably criminal planning that led up to it, which is different from surveilling simply on the basis of speech and ideology,\u201d said Levinson-Waldman. \u201cThe focus on the victims of that act and their political work and organizing is incredibly distressing. It\u2019s so backwards, and it\u2019s so counterproductive.\u201d\n\nThe Hernando de Soto Bridge in Memphis on Nov. 21, 2019. Photo: Andrea Morales for The Intercept\n\nThe Memphis Blacklist While the fire at Highlander remains unsolved almost a year after it occurred, 400 miles away, on the opposite side of the state, a recent lawsuit against the city of Memphis has exposed the lengths to which police will go to surveil the free speech activities of Black Lives Matter and other activists who have committed no crimes. In 2018, a federal judge in Memphis ruled that the city\u2019s police department was in violation of a decades-old federal consent decree prohibiting local law enforcement from gathering \u201cpolitical intelligence.\u201d The ruling followed litigation that revealed that Memphis police\u2019s Office of Homeland Security, a unit set up following the 9/11 attacks, had engaged in widespread and systemic surveillance of the constitutionally protected activities of individuals protesting, among other things, the killings of black men at the hands of police. The litigation strikingly revealed how the domestic political surveillance efforts ramped up after 9/11 evolved in the post-Ferguson era. It exposed a fake Facebook profile police had created to \u201cfriend\u201d activists and monitor their discussions and plans. It showed that police had used software designed to comb social media chatter and map connections between individuals based on their digital interactions. It revealed that police had been compiling a series of \u201cjoint intelligence briefs\u201d on local activists, including pictures, comments, and details about events they planned to attend, which they then distributed as often as three times a day to other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the military, and a number of large local businesses, such as FedEx. And the litigation revealed that police had also monitored church services, candlelight vigils, even a black-owned food truck festival and a school supplies giveaway.\n\nThe lawsuit itself followed the discovery by local activists of a \u201cblacklist\u201d of 84 individuals whom the city had secretly barred from entering City Hall without police escort. The list included some of the city\u2019s most vocal organizers, but also some whom police had found to be merely \u201cassociates\u201d of known protesters, as well as the mother and aunt of Darrius Stewart, a 19-year-old black man killed by Memphis police during a 2015 traffic stop. Keedran Franklin, a 33-year-old activist and organizer, and one of four named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said he\u2019s always suspected that police were keeping tabs on him, but first had those fears confirmed in early 2017, when a friend who was working as a security contractor for the city told him that officials \u201chave a book on y\u2019all,\u201d Franklin recalled. \u201cThey have pictures, known associations, your picture is on the wall.\u201d\n\nActivist and organizer Keedran Franklin.

Right/Bottom: Keedran Franklin is arrested by the Memphis police department in front of the city's justice center while he was helping protestors cross the street during an action on April 3, 2018.Photos: Andrea Morales\n\nFranklin had first become active in his community by working on violence interruption programs and collaborating with the former mayor\u2019s \u201cguns down\u201d initiative, but he had become suspicious of the information the city kept on the youth he worked with and grew increasingly skeptical of what he now believes was a surveillance effort masked as community outreach. \u201cI felt like I was helping them prey on us,\u201d he told me. Franklin soon started organizing protests and direct actions, first with the Fight for $15 campaign to raise the minimum wage and then, after the Ferguson protests and the killing of Stewart in Memphis, against police violence. But Franklin never threatened police or anyone else, he stressed, and Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings even gave him his personal cellphone number after Franklin helped negotiate with police during a protest, offering to help disperse protesters if police promised not to arrest anyone. \u201cWhy would he allow me to have his number if I\u2019m this much of a threat?\u201d said Franklin. \u201cIt was all political, flat out political. They had no criminal investigations around any of us.\u201d When the lawsuit yielded dozens of joint intelligence briefs and other internal police documents, Franklin\u2019s name, photo, and activities were all over them. \u201cKeedran Franklin has participated in several demonstrations/protests and is associated with a group called Memphis Coalition of Concerned Citizens,\u201d reads one of several police documents about Franklin, which also lists other individuals he is \u201cclosely associated with\u201d and notes that they espouse several causes, such as \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d \u201cFight for $15,\u201d and \u201cStanding Rock.\u201d\n\nMemphis offers the most detailed picture we have of what domestic political surveillance looks like in practice.\n\nFranklin already knew he was being monitored; he had been followed by unmarked cars for years, and he often confronted police and livestreamed the exchanges with his phone when he saw them watching him. But the extent of the surveillance revealed in the documents surprised even him: Some memos listed people\u2019s height and weight, Social Security numbers, and in one case details of an individual\u2019s mental health history. And Franklin realized when he learned of the joint intelligence briefs that a new neighbor who had told him that he looked familiar had been receiving the memos police had written on him and distributed widely. \u201cI\u2019m not this terrorist they are painting me to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI got flaws, I\u2019m not perfect, but I\u2019m no damn terrorist.\u201d Police surveillance efforts seem to have picked up after Stewart\u2019s killing in July 2015. A year earlier, the protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, had kicked off nationwide rallies against police violence. And a couple of months before Stewart was killed, protests over the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore had reignited anger at police, while also putting local and federal law enforcement on high alert. In Memphis, a majority black city where distrust of police runs deep \u2014 \u201cand for good cause,\u201d as a local lawyer put it \u2014 tensions came to a peak on July 10, 2016, after the police killings of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, when hundreds of peaceful protesters shut down the Hernando de Soto Bridge that crosses the Mississippi River to connect Tennessee to Arkansas.\n\nIn July 2016, more than 1000 people marched and blocked traffic on the Hernando de Soto bridge in response to the police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. Photos: Andrea Morales\n\nThat protest \u2014 the largest in Memphis\u2019s recent history \u2014 kicked off a series of others in the following months, and the police department\u2019s Homeland Security office, which had previously focused on domestic and international terrorism threats, \u201cshifted almost entirely to obtaining intelligence about planned large events with the potential for violence against large scale disruption of traffic or commerce,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in court filings. In an internal slide made public through the litigation, police even called 2016 \u201cA Year of Social Unrest Reminiscent of the late 1960s and early 1970s,\u201d just as they resorted to the surveillance tactics of those years. Through 2016, officers monitored activists as they protested racist coverage by the local paper, rallied outside Elvis Presley\u2019s Graceland mansion, and staged a peaceful \u201cdie-in\u201d outside the home of Mayor Jim Strickland in December 2016. It\u2019s that die-in in particular that prompted officials to add activists and protesters to the blacklist \u2014 or \u201cescort list,\u201d as they called it \u2014 which up to that point had mostly included former employees or individuals accused of threats or disorderly conduct. The mayor personally authorized the addition to the list of many of the protesters who had lain down in his front yard. Ursula Madden, the chief communications officer for the city of Memphis, challenged the description of the protest as \u201cpeaceful,\u201d saying that protesters \u201cshowed up at the mayor\u2019s home with their faces covered, climbed in the trees on his private property, tried to open the doors to his house and peeked into the windows while his family was inside sleeping\u2014all while recording it on Facebook live and making threatening comments.\u201d\n\nDocument: Court exhibit by the ACLU of Tennessee.\n\nDocument: Court exhibit by the ACLU of Tennessee.\n\nBut both the blacklist and the police intelligence operation directed at protesters violated a 1978 consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department that Memphis had entered after it was found to have illegally compiled dossiers on anti-war and student activists through the 1960s and 1970s. While the Justice Department has entered into dozens of such agreements with police departments across the country in an effort to bring them in line with federal civil rights standards, most decrees have focused on excessive force or discriminatory policing. The Memphis consent decree is the only one nationwide that focuses on the issue of political surveillance. And because of the thousands of pages of documents and the public testimony produced by the recent lawsuit, Memphis also offers the most detailed picture we have of what domestic political surveillance looks like in practice. \u201cMemphis is a microcosm of what we assume is happening across the country,\u201d said Levinson-Waldman, who serves on a federal monitoring team a judge put in place after he found the city to be in violation of the decree. \u201cIt\u2019s the clearest window that we have into what kind of surveillance is going on.\u201d One Big Plantation In Memphis, no one can possibly forget that the police are watching. If across the country security cameras have become a ubiquitous reality of modern life, whose presence is easy to forget as they blend into the urban landscape, Memphis\u2019s cameras light up the city with piercing blue flashes that flicker endlessly from utility poles like thousands of blinking eyes. Memphis\u2019s distinctive \u201cSkyCop\u201d cameras \u2014 more than 2,000 in 500 locations across the city \u2014 feed millions of hours of footage a year into the city\u2019s Real Time Crime Center. The cameras are another legacy of the war on terror, as officials in Memphis, a major commercial hub, first looked to boost video surveillance capabilities to protect critical infrastructure. In fact, the cameras have largely been used to deter crime, but the lawsuit revealed that they were also used to surveil protesters in violation of the decree. \u201cIt\u2019s a police state, for real,\u201d said Franklin, of the cameras. \u201cThey started taking that equipment and technology and turned it inward, onto us.\u201d But there are other reminders of police surveillance. Antonio Cathey, another well-known Memphis activist and organizer with Fight for $15, told me that at a turkey giveaway some friends and family had organized before Thanksgiving, police stood at a distance watching people with binoculars. And that\u2019s nothing compared to what happened to Cathey in August 2018, on the very first day of the consent decree trial. Cathey was in court watching the proceedings when his grandmother called to tell him that police had pushed their way into her house and, across the street, that of his uncle.\n\nAntonio Cathey, a Memphis activist and organizer with Fight for $15.

Photo: Andrea Morales\n\nWhen Cathey raced there, he found dozens of officers from various agencies, many in riot gear and face masks. The officers had raided the homes and issued his uncle a citation after they found a trace of marijuana in his car\u2019s ashtray \u2014 not enough to justify an arrest. \u201cThey tore the house completely up,\u201d said Cathey, adding that he had been terrified for his grandmother. \u201cI told her, Don\u2019t open the door for them. Every guy with a badge and a gun is not a good cop.\u201d Cathey, who recognized one of the officers from protests he had attended, repeatedly asked police why they were there, but all they told him was, \u201cWe know all about you\u201d and \u201cWe know exactly who you are.\u201d A neighbor pointed to a light pole on the street that he said municipal workers had come to fix in the early hours of the morning, even though it didn\u2019t appear to be broken. There was a box on the pole with black and yellow tape, and a sign warning, \u2018Danger, don\u2019t touch.\u2019 But Cathey could see a camera lens behind the tape.\n\nThat\u2019s when it clicked for him that the raid was no coincidence. \u201cWe just had court downtown,\u201d he said. \u201cI see what\u2019s going on. If they can\u2019t get to you, they\u2019ll get to your family.\u201d Madden, the city spokesperson, said in a statement that the incident was \u201cunrelated\u201d to the lawsuit. Since then, relatives have told Cathey that they support him but wish he would stop going to protests. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cI have the right to do this, and [police] are not going to stop me. If they\u2019re looking for something, I\u2019m open, it\u2019s right on my Facebook page.\u201d But it\u2019s not just activists who are learning to live with a surveillance apparatus they assume to be ubiquitous. Journalists and lawyers in Memphis whisper when they speak in public places. They get suspicious when a car remains behind them after a couple of turns. When I met in a cafe with Wendi C. Thomas, who for years wrote a column for Memphis\u2019s largest newspaper before recently starting the independent news organization, MLK50: Justice Through Journalism, she kept watching her back before asking if we could speak in a more private place. \u201cI know when I talk to people who aren\u2019t from Memphis that I sound crazy,\u201d she told me. Then, citing a phrase others have used to describe Memphis, she added, \u201cThis place is one big plantation.\u201d\n\nWendi C. Thomas, a journalist who has been reporting on inequity in Memphis for years. Photo: Andrea Morales for The Intercept\n\nThomas, who as the Commercial Appeal\u2019s first black female columnist endured years of threats of violence from readers, including death and rape threats, said she discovered the Memphis police had been tracking her social media pages in the middle of the consent decree trial, which she was covering. Thomas was looking down at her notebook when she heard an officer who was testifying about the fake identity he created to friend activists on Facebook read her name out loud, twice, from an exhibit page. \u201cI looked up and was like, Did he just say my name? Why would they be monitoring me?\u201d she said. Thomas immediately filed a public records request for her name and that of three other female journalists, including the photographer for this story, whose name had come up in testimony. It took the city 433 days to respond. Thomas believes that she and the other journalists came under surveillance because they were in contact with activists. \u201cI think it speaks to the trust that we have built, intentionally, with activists and organizers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that you have sources is proof that you\u2019re a good journalist. For some of us who have a broad variety of sources, including those in communities that are marginalized, it\u2019s proof that we are doing our jobs. But that also makes us a target. If more journalists here in Memphis saw that as part of their job, maybe it would be harder for the city to target all of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe day before the 50th anniversary of King\u2019s assassination, they\u2019re out there arresting journalists and organizers.\u201d\n\nThere is little question that the targeting is real. As The Intercept has reported, Memphis police in 2018 arrested undocumented journalist Manuel Duran, who ran a local Spanish-language news site, while he covered a protest to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination in the city. When the charges against Duran were quickly dismissed, instead of releasing him, police turned him over to officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who detained him for over a year. While a number of activists were also arrested at the protest, several other reporters who were there were not. And Duran, who was wearing a press badge, appeared to have been singled out. He was well known to local police, which he had covered critically, and in his own video of the incident, an officer can be heard saying, \u201cGet him, guys\u201d and pointing in Duran\u2019s direction. Then officers grab him even as two activists try to shield him and scream, \u201cHe\u2019s a reporter.\u201d In a statement, the city\u2019s spokesperson wrote that \u201cofficers did not know Mr. Duran, or know that he was a member of the media,\u201d and that he was \u201cone of many people arrested for blocking traffic.\u201d \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t rhyme, but it echoes,\u201d Thomas said about the episode. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing: The day before the 50th anniversary of King\u2019s assassination, they\u2019re out there arresting journalists and organizers.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Andrea Morales for The Intercept\n\nPastor Fisher, center, stands with the family of Darrius Stewart, a 19-year-old-black man who was killed by a Memphis police officer during a traffic stop in July 2016. Photo: Andrea Morales\n\nPolice surveillance continued even in church. Rev. Earle Fisher, a pastor at the city\u2019s Abyssinian Missionary Baptist Church and an outspoken community leader, said a meeting he hosted at the church after the 2016 bridge protest had also been monitored by police. Fisher said people there had joked about the church being bugged, but he was nonetheless shocked to learn from a local news outlet that his church was one of the spaces that law enforcement was watching after the Tennessee Department of Homeland Security had warned Memphis police that \u201cgangs, home grown extremists and criminals\u201d could use legal protests as cover to incite violence. Fisher said that if there was a real threat of violence at the church, police should have told him \u2014 but they never did. Fisher first realized how far the city would go to monitor critics when he noticed \u201cTennessee Department of Homeland Security\u201d pop up on his listed Wi-Fi networks at home. Once, after he wrote a public letter to the city\u2019s district attorney about the killing of Darrius Stewart, a friend in law enforcement warned him to \u201ckeep his nose clean\u201d because the DA \u201cran his profile to see if anything came up.\u201d \u201cIf you know anything about history, these types of things are always going to happen,\u201d said Fisher. Now every time a phone call drops, he just thinks, It must be them. But Fisher added that he and most activists he knows have simply taken note of the surveillance and continued to do the work. \u201cWhen you are somebody who has been clearly committed to advocating against an unjust status quo, then you are going to find yourself at odds with any entity that\u2019s been constructed to protect the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I\u2019m on the right side of history, I know I\u2019m doing this for the right reasons, and I know, based on my constitutional rights, that I\u2019m doing this the right way. At some point, you just hope it breaks through.\u201d\n\nU.S. National Guard troops block off Beale Street in Memphis, Tenn., as civil rights marchers pass by on March 29, 1968. Photo: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nA City of Spies Memphis has a long history of both activism and government surveillance. The city was a focal point for the labor and anti-war movements, and it\u2019s there that King marched for the last time in a rally in support of a sanitation workers\u2019 strike in 1968. At the height of the civil rights movement, around 1965, the Memphis Police Department established a Domestic Intelligence Unit that began to infiltrate and keep secret dossiers about citizens engaging in constitutionally protected political activities, from vigils against the Vietnam War to union efforts. Much like the FBI was doing at the same time under the now-infamous COINTELPRO program, the Memphis Police Department targeted the ACLU, the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and various workers groups. Without warrants, it monitored their mail and phones and kept files on their activities, relationships, and sexual preferences, relying on a network of undercover agents and informants to gather intelligence on unsuspecting individuals. The extent of the DIU\u2019s surveillance was finally exposed in the mid-1970s, when Memphis State student Eric Carter discovered his roommate had been an undercover officer. When Carter demanded to see the files police had kept on him, the city incinerated them. As it became clear that officials planned to destroy all evidence of the DIU\u2019s work, the ACLU intervened, represented by Memphis civil rights attorney Bruce Kramer, and requested a federal court to stop the city from destroying more evidence. But before the order could be served, Mayor Wyeth Chandler ordered the DIU terminated and \u201cten filing cabinets of photographs, reports and documents compiled over a nine-year period \u2026 stuffed into garbage bags by DIU staff, taken to city\u2019s Scott Street incinerator, doused with fuel and burned,\u201d according to the ACLU\u2019s retelling of the incident. That\u2019s when the ACLU filed Kendrick v. Chandler, a class-action lawsuit that in 1978 led to a federal consent decree banning the city of Memphis from \u201cengaging in law enforcement activities which interfere with any person\u2019s rights protected by the First Amendment.\u201d Even in connection to a criminal investigation, the order continued, \u201cthe City of Memphis must appropriately limit all law enforcement activities so as not to infringe on any person\u2019s First Amendment rights.\u201d Since then, Kramer has periodically checked to make sure that police were abiding by the ban, but it was in the aftermath of the Ferguson protests and the killing of Darrius Stewart that it became evident police were brazenly violating the decree. When activists learned of the blacklist \u2014 after one of them showed up at City Hall and was told that he couldn\u2019t enter without a police escort \u2014 Kramer filed a new lawsuit on behalf of Franklin and three others, accusing the city of violating the Kendrick decree. The ACLU joined the suit after the judge in the case indicated that the four were not part of the original 1976 lawsuit and therefore couldn\u2019t bring the claim, an interpretation Kramer vehemently contests.\n\nA view of a blue light camera facing the former Lorraine Motel, now the National Civil Rights Museum, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. Photo: Andrea Morales for The Intercept\n\nFor Kramer, there is little difference between today\u2019s surveillance and what the city of Memphis engaged in half a century ago. \u201cThe basic principles are the same: People have a First Amendment right to protest and a Fourth Amendment right not to have these dossiers kept on them,\u201d he told me. \u201cIn the \u201970s, and even before then, in the \u201960s and \u201950s and \u201940s, they were worried about communists, and then they were worried about the Black Panthers, and then they were worried about the Weathermen, and then they were worried about the civil rights people. There is no doubt they fear the activist community \u2014 black and white.\u201d Despite being under federal court orders, the Memphis Police Department never put in place guidelines or training to make sure that officers wouldn\u2019t conduct political surveillance. And when attorneys started deposing police as part of the recent litigation, they realized that \u201cthere was a complete ignorance amongst the entire department about the existence of the decree,\u201d said Thomas Castelli, legal director of the ACLU of Tennessee.\n\n\u201cI should not have to live in fear of me and my son being surveilled.\u201d\n\nThe week before the trial started, the city also filed a motion to modify the terms of the decree, which it argued was written before the internet and surveillance technology and was inapplicable to today\u2019s policing methods. After Judge Jon McCalla of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee found the city in contempt of the decree, he brought in a federal monitoring team that\u2019s currently in the process of negotiating guidelines, trainings, and an auditing mechanism the police department must follow going forward. But the city has also continued to argue that the decree is obsolete and makes it harder for police to do their job \u2014 an argument that McCalla refuted in clear terms last November, when he denied a new request by the city\u2019s lawyers to modify the terms of the decree. The decree, McCalla wrote, \u201cacts as a bulwark, ensuring that the City\u2019s surveillance practices do not cross the line from being a powerful weapon in the fight against crime to becoming an intrusive tool that improperly interferes with its residents\u2019 First Amendment-protected activities.\u201d\n\nLeft/Top: Memphis civil rights attorney Bruce Kramer. Right/Bottom: Thomas Castelli, the legal director of the ACLU of Tennessee.Photos: Andrea Morales for The Intercept\n\nThe drawn-out process and the city\u2019s apparent backpedaling have frustrated activists, and two recent community meetings held by the monitor have been heated. \u201cThis is not like we\u2019re two parties and we have to mediate a fight,\u201d said Franklin. \u201cThe city administration and police force violated our constitutional rights. They\u2019re in the wrong and need to be treated as such. \u2026 They still never apologized.\u201d Franklin, who became a father in November, said he fears that the judge\u2019s ruling and the monitoring team won\u2019t be enough to stop police from harassing him. \u201cI don\u2019t want my son to be under the scope of Big Brother like a Fred Hampton Jr.,\u201d he said, referring to the son of Fred Hampton, the young leader of the Black Panthers killed by Chicago police in 1969. \u201cI should not have to live in fear of me and my son being surveilled. My son should not have to live in fear of that.\u201d According to Madden, \u201cthe City is complying with the consent decree. However the City has the right to seek modification of the consent decree, which is 40 years old, and is not consistent with best police practices to provide safety in the 21st century.\u201d In a recent interview about the decree with a local media outlet, Rallings, the police director, also argued that the decree is outdated. \u201cIn 1978, nobody wore seatbelts,\u201d said Rallings. \u201cWell, we learned that seatbelts save lives, so everybody knows it\u2019s click it or ticket. So we found that something that was done in the \u201970s we probably need to go revisit and modify and make it apply to modern police work, and that\u2019s all we\u2019re asking.\u201d But Rallings also connected Memphis\u2019s surveillance efforts to the warnings local police have been getting from federal law enforcement, particularly following the killings of eight police officers during protests in Dallas and Baton Rouge in 2016. \u201cThat was a peaceful protest, until a gunman opened fire,\u201d said Rallings. \u201cIf we think about the number of threats that we are receiving, information from the FBI that individuals were infiltrating peaceful protests and had nefarious intents. \u2026 We had an obligation to protect our citizens.\u201d In fact, documents obtained in discovery show that police were regularly distributing intelligence briefings that compiled news coverage of incidents of violence against police officers in other cities with information gleaned from social media about rallies and actions planned in Memphis \u2014 even though there was no connection between them. Other documents show that round-the-clock social media monitoring of Memphis-based activists yielded no evidence that they posed any threat.\n\nDocument: Court exhibit by the ACLU of Tennessee.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this kind of connotation here, whether they intended that connotation or not, and it\u2019s going out to pretty much every cop in the city,\u201d Castelli said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just indicative of what\u2019s going on all over the country with this: law enforcement that is concerning itself more and more with what people are saying, and particularly with what they are saying about law enforcement. \u2026 There seems to be a theme, and it fits with the larger antagonism between activists for police reform and the police that are supposed to make sure they can say what they want to say.\u201d Some activists noted that police surveillance of police critics and protests against police violence was particularly frustrating when compared to police\u2019s hands-off treatment of far-right groups that have also rallied in Memphis and across Tennessee. \u201cOne of these is not like the other,\u201d said Fisher, the pastor. \u201cBut here\u2019s a basic thought: Treat us the same way you treat the white supremacists when they come to town. \u2026 This is a concrete choice, them saying, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to provide you with the same constitutional rights and privileges as we would provide the Sons of the Confederate Veterans.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a basic thought: Treat us the same way you treat the white supremacists when they come to town.\u201d\n\nAs it happens, Tennessee has long been a hotbed for the white nationalist movement. \u201cIt seems to be viewed as a friendly place for white supremacists,\u201d said Castelli. Halfway between Highlander and Memphis is the town of Pulaski, the birthplace of the Klan, and in recent years the state hosted 20 percent of the country\u2019s white supremacist gatherings and events, according to the Anti-Defamation League. And while Memphis and the Appalachian mountains where Highlander is located are very different demographically and politically, activists from both communities recognize their experiences as being part of the same criminalization of black dissent in a state that has a long history of both civil rights struggles and white supremacist backlash. \u201cWhat\u2019s absurd is that they are spending so many resources on that sort of thing across the state in Memphis, a black city, when literally white supremacists are firebombing buildings over here,\u201d said Highlander\u2019s Henderson. \u201cWhy are you surveilling Keedran? Why are you surveilling me? What did I do? If the only answer you have is that we are black and we disagree with the power structures that are harming our communities, then how is this any different than McCarthyism? How is it different than COINTELPRO?\u201d\n\nThe Highlander Research and Education Center. Photo: Andrea Morales for The Intercept\n\nA History of Harassment Last summer, Henderson and Franklin joined activists from Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and across the country in a delegation to Capitol Hill organized by the racial justice group MediaJustice, which together with the ACLU has been lobbying lawmakers to demand more transparency from the FBI about its surveillance of activists of color. Myaisha Hayes, an organizer with MediaJustice who runs the group\u2019s \u201cprotect Black dissent\u201d campaign, told me that what was happening on opposite sides of Tennessee was exactly what she feared would continue to happen as the FBI collapsed real and imaginary extremist categories into the generic \u201cracially motivated extremism.\u201d \u201cOn one side of the state, you\u2019ve got people dealing with the police department clearly violating an agreement not to surveil activists, and then a few hours away, you have activists calling for help to investigate an act of hatred, an act of violence, and yet there\u2019s no follow-up,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile the government and the police have such a long history of surveilling and criminalizing black folks, they\u2019ve really left those same communities vulnerable to white supremacist violence and police violence.\u201d At Highlander, being targeted for state surveillance and harassment while also coming under threat of violence by white supremacist groups has a long history. At Highlander\u2019s workshop center \u2014 a red two-story structure where visiting activists and organizers gather for meals and meetings \u2014 a series of panels line the walls, describing Highlander\u2019s achievements over the decades along with the attacks on the center in those same years. The Highlander Folk School was founded by Myles Horton at Monteagle, Tennessee, in 1932 as a space to organize poor and working people in the South, and from its early days, the school served as a radical space for education, movement building, and desegregation. Through the 1930s and 1940s, Highlander was accused of being \u201cthoroughly communistic\u201d and a \u201cfree love\u201d community. The center lost some of its union partners to the red-baiting and faced a series of bomb threats. The harassment continued through the 1950s as the school was infiltrated and accused of \u201cfomenting racial strife and disrupting values and institutions of the South.\u201d Highlander had always promoted interracial solidarity, but through the \u201950s and \u201960s, the center was pivotal to the black freedom movement: Highlander organized voter registration workshops and adult literacy programs to fight disenfranchisement. Parks trained at the school months before the Montgomery bus boycott. And it\u2019s there that Pete Seeger taught King the reworked lyrics to \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d In 1961, following an FBI investigation, Tennessee officials closed the school, took its land, and revoked its charter. The padlocked buildings were burned down shortly after. Highlander relocated to a house in Knoxville and changed its name to the current Highlander Research and Education Center. \u201cThey literally just changed the name and kept doing what they were doing,\u201d said Henderson. In Knoxville, the harassment continued. In 1963, an interracial training camp for activists organized by Highlander was raided by police, who arrested 29 people. Days later, someone burned the camp down. In 1966, after the Klan marched against the center\u2019s Knoxville location, someone threw a Molotov cocktail through its window. Highlander moved to its current location in 1972. \u201cHighlander was attacked a lot,\u201d said Susan Williams, a coordinator at the center\u2019s library who has been with the organization for more than 30 years. \u201cHow it still exists is kind of a miracle.\u201d\n\nLeft/Top: Artworks created by folks who have passed through are displayed in the kitchen of the Highlander Research and Education Center.
