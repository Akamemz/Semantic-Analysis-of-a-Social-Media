    "content": "In an election many Mexicans hope will be a turning point for a country beset by decades of corruption , violence and enduring poverty , voters turned to a left-wing populist some supporters refer to as a \u201c messiah. \u201d A savior from the two major parties that have failed to deliver on promises of reform , in the eyes of many voters .\nFor months , polls predicted Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , a 64-year-old two-time presidential runner up , would win the election by a landslide . When the National Elections Institute announced preliminary results Sunday , authorities predicted he would win with between 53 percent and 53.8 percent of the vote , a remarkable margin not seen in the country for many years .\n\u201c My presidential vote went to AMLO , \u201d said voter Laura Rodriguez-Verdin outside a polling location in Mexico City . \u201c The reason I voted for him is because I believe he is the only person who has the interest at heart of people who most need help in this country . People with poor education and poor health services . \u201d\nEarly in his career , Obrador lived in a dirt-floor shack , built houses for the poor and marched for environmental protections against the giant state-owned , state-run oil company , PEMEX . As Mexico City 's mayor in 2005 , he drove an old Nissan Sentra . Today , he claims not to own a credit card or checking account and says he will sell the presidential plane , turn the presidential palace into a park and live in his tiny townhouse in Mexico City .\n\u201c I voted for Andres Manuel for president because I like his proposals , \u201d said Mexico City resident Diana Ortiz . \u201c He \u2019 s not promoting the a rich government , the powerful guys . Instead he wants to be empower as much to the people here . He wants a more democratic vote . \u201d\nWhy does the president of Mexico matter ? The U.S. shares a 2,000-mile border . Mexico has the second-largest economy in Latin America , it 's the third-largest trading partner of the U.S. and a major oil exporter , and it plays a key role in two of America \u2019 s most intractable problems , immigration and drugs . Militarily , the two countries share intelligence on terrorism and security and historically Mexico played a mediating influence and bulwark against Latin America \u2019 s more radical regimes . Its 6 million illegal workers and millions more immigrants provide the backbone of America \u2019 s agricultural and service industries , from the kitchens of New York City to hotel rooms in Chicago .\n\u201c Out of all the candidates , Andres Manuel is probably the least enthusiastic about the bilateral relationship with the U.S. , but he recognizes that the relationship with the U.S. is fundamentally important , \u201d said Duncan Wood with the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center . \u201c His election is going to make life more complicated for the United States , let 's put it like that . \u201d\nRoughly 88 million Mexicans are entitled to vote ; officials predicted a 90 percent turnout . One reason is Obrador . The other is Congress . Between the lower House of Deputies and Mexican Senate , 630 seats are up for grabs and nine out of 32 governorships are being voted on .\nIf Obrador and his party , Morena , perform as expected , some conservatives worry he will have a majority and a Congressional mandate to enact sweeping reforms , including free access to the Internet , a doubling of pensions for the elderly , educational grants for students , an increase in the minimum wage and subsidies for small farmers and single mothers .\n\u201c The only candidate who was truly successful positioning himself as an agent of change was AMLO , \u201d said former PAN party foreign minister Jorge Castaneda , who believes Obrador won the election based on three issues : violence , corruption and the economy .\n\u201c In the last twenty-odd years , this includes the government I served in , the economy has not grown more than two and a half percent per year , \u201d Castaneda said . \u201c Mexicans are not finding deep well-paying jobs , not seeing their living standards improved , not extracting people from poverty , we \u2019 re not reducing levels of inequality which are among the highest levels in the world . \u201d\nAlmost 44 percent of Mexicans live below the national poverty line , earning less than $ 5 per day , according to the World Bank . Poverty is most extreme in the rural south , where unemployment and violence remain highest . Because of those factors , many Mexicans continue to migrate to the U.S. in hopes of a better life . Last year , the border patrol apprehended about 110,000 Mexicans at the border . Obrador has no plans to curb or interfere with those heading to the U.S. illegally , but hopes U.S. aid and a new NAFTA treaty will improve the economy and alleviate poverty so Mexicans won \u2019 t have to migrate .\n\u201c The best way to cooperate , one country with another one , is to help redevelop the areas that are sending [ citizens who want to migrate ] out of Mexico because we are not having economic growth here and we are not having jobs here , \u201d said Obrador \u2019 s campaign manager , Tatiana Clouthier . \u201c In that way you will not be having a lot of people wanting to cross because we are able to give them an opportunity in our country . \u201d\nTo reduce immigration pressures , Obrador plans to offer amnesty to farmers who turned to opium and marijuana because they could not compete with industrial farms in northern Mexico and the U.S. under NAFTA , which Obrador hopes to renegotiate . Castaneda , who also teaches at New York University , says Mexico , as America \u2019 s third largest trading partner , doesn \u2019 t have much financial leverage -- but the country has other options .\n\u201c Trade over here , immigration here , drugs here , security and intelligence here - which is a big deal , \u201d he says . \u201c Mexico has few bargaining chips over trade , but a lot of bargaining chips on immigration , on drugs , and security . But we \u2019 re not using them . Trump is . For once in my life , I completely agree with him . \u201d\nPresident Trump was not a factor in the election , as each candidate seemed to resent him equally , as does much of the public . Instead , anger was directed at Mexico \u2019 s ruling elite , whom voters blamed for rising inequality , corruption and the never-ending drug war .\n\u201c This war on drugs is not working , \u201d said voter Hugo Stewart , an Obrador supporter . \u201c It \u2019 s causing a lot of deaths and needs to be looked at in a different way . \u201d\nViolence remains an acute problem in Mexico , with some 25,000 homicides this year , including 133 politicians and 48 candidates since campaigning began last September , according to one of Mexico \u2019 s leading political consulting agencies , Etellekt .\nTo reduce the violence , Obrador proposes a softening the military \u2019 s confrontational approach , saying Mexico will no longer fight America \u2019 s drug war since Mexico doesn \u2019 t have a consumption problem .\n\u201c The last 12 years , President [ Felipe ] Calderon and President Enrique Pena Nieto started a war towards smugglers or drug traffic and we \u2019 re not having good results , \u201d said Clouthier . \u201c We have to go from war to peace . And that means going to the root of the problem . We need development in areas where there is no work . \u201d\nFighting the drug war is just one point of contention in U.S.-Mexican relations . Another likely is the personality clash of President Trump and Obrador . Would they get along ?\nHere are two points of view . Obrador is considered warm , personable , and smart . He \u2019 s written more than 10 books on Mexican political history . On the other , he is a prominent nationalist , critics compare him to Venezuelan dictators Hugo Chavez and Nicholas Maduro , and the fear his moral superiority could turn Mexico into a leftist autocracy . Obrador wrote a book critical of President Trump , who often seems to base foreign relations on the personal likability or trust of a country \u2019 s leader . They could be friends or explosive enemies .\n\u201c I put the odds on the two abrasive personalities not getting along , \u201d argues David Shirk , an expert on Mexican affairs at the University of San Diego . \u201c What you will see is two men speaking their minds . There will be no bars between them . \u201d\n\u201c I completely think they are going to get along , \u201d counters Ana Quintana , at the Heritage Foundation 's Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies . \u201c I think AMLO is tapping into something in Mexico just like Trump tapped into the U.S. - that large pool of the population that has been disenfranchised by the political and economic elite . \u201d\nTrump , unlike previous U.S. presidents , did not visit Mexico in his first year in office . National Security Advisor John Bolton raised that possibility on \u201c Fox News Sunday , \u201d saying , \u201c I think in this kind of context , having the two leaders get together , may produce some surprising results . \u201d\nAnd while it could happen , prominent columnist Pancho Garfias with the newspaper Excelsior said it may not end well .\n\u201c Lopez Obrador is not stupid , so he will try to get along with Mr. Trump , \u201d he said . \u201c I think Mr. Trump knows that Mexico is better as a friend than hostile , but I don \u2019 t think Mr. Lopez Obrador will shake hands with Trump .
