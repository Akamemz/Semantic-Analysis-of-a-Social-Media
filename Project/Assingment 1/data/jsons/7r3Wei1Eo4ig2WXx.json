    "content": "( CNN ) Donald Trump 's wild weekend showed just how abnormal his presidency has become , even if his breaching of conventional decorum has lost the power to shock .\nThe President , ensconced at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida , spent Saturday and Sunday on Twitter venting at the FBI director he fired , and torching both The New York Times and his own estranged attorney general . He poured praise on his lawyer Michael Cohen amid speculation he could flip on his top client after an FBI raid on his offices carried off some of the closest-held secrets of the Trump Organization and the President 's own past .\nThe President also lashed out at an unidentified `` drunk/drugged up loser '' as he fulminated about his legal situation and , out of nowhere , when most Americans were enjoying their Sunday afternoon , tweeted , `` A total witch hunt ! ''\nThe weekend 's events were a snapshot of a frenzied social media presidency characterized by score settling and bitter attacks on enemies that would have been impossible to imagine before he won the White House .\nCementing that contrast , four of the five living ex-presidents , George H.W . Bush , Bill Clinton , George W. Bush and Barack Obama , gathered in Texas at the funeral of former first lady Barbara Bush on Saturday .\nThe latest , and somber , meeting of the President 's Club , the most exclusive political conclave in the world , seemed like a throwback to an earlier era of civility where former political foes buried differences in recognition of their common experience that seems out of step in the age of Trump .\nThe current President did not attend the funeral , saying he did n't want his presidential security footprint to detract from the occasion . Earlier presidents did not attend funerals of first ladies , and he did tweet a touching picture of Barbara Bush 's portrait from the White House . First lady Melania Trump attended and was pictured smiling alongside Obama .\nBut it was also difficult to imagine that at some future event , Trump would fit in so well with the Bushes , Clinton and Obama \u2014 not least because he has spent so much time personally attacking several of his predecessors .
