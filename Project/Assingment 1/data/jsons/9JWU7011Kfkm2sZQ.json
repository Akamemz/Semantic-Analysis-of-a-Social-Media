And he just defended some of those remarks in the past couple weeks \u2014 again insulting Rosie O \u2019 Donnell in his first debate against Hillary Clinton , and doubling down on a feud with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado over her weight .\nThen again , it is this long history that we \u2019 ve all known about for months and months that makes Republican elites \u2019 refusal to finally dump Trump so unsurprising . After all , consider just a fraction of what Trump has gotten away with so far in this campaign :\nHe characterized Mexican immigrants as \u201c rapists \u201d who are \u201c bringing crime \u201d and \u201c bringing drugs \u201d to the US .\nHe said Sen.
