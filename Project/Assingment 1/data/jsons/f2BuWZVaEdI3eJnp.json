It could do much more .\nShare All sharing options for : The Pentagon just offered ventilators for the coronavirus response . It could do much more .\nWith civilian hospitals increasingly overwhelmed and the coronavirus outbreak in America deepening , a question is coming up of whether there \u2019 s a bigger role the US military to play in responding .\n\u201c We \u2019 re starting the process . And it \u2019 s a process \u2014 we hope it \u2019 s not going to be necessary , but it could be necessary , \u201d he said during the White House briefing on Tuesday morning .\nHours later , Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Pentagon would at least offer some support . He told reporters that his department would be willing to offer up to 2,000 ventilators and 5 million respirators if asked , as well as offer labs to test civilians for the disease .\nBut , Esper made sure to say , he believes calling up military to help in the coronavirus response should be a \u201c last resort . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s not all . The US military will also be sending the US Army Corps of Engineers to New York state to assess how to build more medical centers , and it will deploy the USNS Comfort \u2014 a large medical ship with room for 1,000 patients \u2014 off the coast of New York .\nExperts tell me the Pentagon \u2019 s actions are a good start , but that defense officials could still do much , much more .\nFor over a century , America \u2019 s armed forces have dealt with medical crises across the globe . Many service members today have the expertise to assist with medical care ; build MASH hospitals ; provide shelter ; or transport food , medical equipment , and people to meet the needs of the public . That \u2019 s already happening in Georgia and Florida and New York , for example , where those states \u2019 National Guards were called to help combat Covid-19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus .\n\u201c The Department of Defense provides the ability to scale up like no other part of the US government can , \u201d Andrew Weber , the Pentagon \u2019 s top biological defense official from 2011 to 2014 , told me . \u201c Whatever is needed to mount an appropriate response , the military can do it at scale . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s important to note that America \u2019 s troops wouldn \u2019 t be leading efforts to combat Covid-19 . They \u2019 d be supporting civilian leaders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) or the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) with extra people , expertise , and technology .\nThat \u2019 s likely why , during the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday night , former Vice President Joe Biden called for the military to be deployed across America . \u201c It \u2019 s a national emergency , and I would call out the military , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 re at war with the virus . \u201d\nBut the military \u2019 s involvement isn \u2019 t a panacea , and it has strict limitations on what it can do . Laws prohibit most troops from performing law enforcement functions , for example , and its actions are curtailed to helping states with things like emergency medical treatment and evacuations .\nWhat \u2019 s more , the military only has a few small hospitals in the United States that are set up to treat military medical problems like bodily trauma , top Pentagon officials told reporters on Monday . Those facilities aren \u2019 t particularly ready to deal with the coronavirus outbreak or provide what civilian hospitals might need .\nIn other words , the military can help , but it can \u2019 t solve the government \u2019 s response problems . It also doesn \u2019 t help that the Army alone , for instance , is short $ 1 billion to respond to the outbreak . \u201c We \u2019 re trying to be very careful about not overpromising , \u201d Air Force Brig . Gen. Paul Friedrichs , the Joint Staff surgeon , told reporters on Monday . However , experts and some at the Pentagon believe the military can come up with the money to help if it wanted to .\nAs of now , there \u2019 s no real indication Trump wants to deploy the military . Most jarring is that he doesn \u2019 t have a senior Pentagon official on his Coronavirus Task Force . ( It \u2019 s possible the military doesn \u2019 t want to be involved \u2014 more on that later . )\nIt \u2019 s therefore not as easy a call for Trump to make as some might think , but the dozen current and former defense officials and medical experts I spoke with say he should still use his authority to put the military to work now .\n\u201c There \u2019 s just so much capacity in the Defense Department that \u2019 s completely untapped at the moment , and that \u2019 s a mistake , \u201d Kelly Magsamen , a former top Pentagon official in the Obama administration , told me .\nThe legality of using the US military in the coronavirus response\nBefore going into what the military could do to help with the coronavirus , it \u2019 s first important to know what it \u2019 s allowed to do at the president \u2019 s request .\nThe US military is barred from using its capabilities directly to enforce US domestic laws unless Congress specifically authorizes it to do so . This stipulation , known as \u201c posse comitatus , \u201d is why US troops can only support civilian agencies like FEMA but not take direct action themselves . Per FEMA \u2019 s own website , the military is prohibited from interdicting \u201c vehicles , conducting searches and seizures , making arrests or apprehensions , surveillance , investigation , or undercover work . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s no indication that long-standing statute is going to change anytime soon . However , this rule doesn \u2019 t apply to the National Guard and the Coast Guard \u2014 which means both services could perform law enforcement functions if asked by a state \u2019 s governor . That means they could conceivably block roads or keep people from visiting family and friends , though that would be a severe response and it \u2019 s unclear any governor wants to authorize that yet .\nThe president , or at least his lawyers , knows all this . On Friday , Trump issued two declarations to deal with the outbreak : one reliant on the Stafford Act , and one based on the National Emergencies Act .\nAs my colleague Ian Millhiser wrote , \u201c Title IV of the Stafford Act permits the president to declare that a particular crisis is a \u2018 major disaster , \u2019 and such a declaration does provide the president with new powers that he may use to combat such a disaster. \u201d Additionally , the statute says \u201c all requests for a declaration by the President that a major disaster exists shall be made by the Governor of the affected State . \u201d\nSo , as Millhiser notes , Trump \u201c can not simply issue a declaration and seize broad new powers . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s still plenty the US government can do under this act , including coordinating relief efforts , helping state governments , and handing out food and medicine as needed . If the military can be helpful in any of those endeavors , HHS , another agency , or a state \u2019 s governor can ask the Pentagon for assistance with them .\nAs for the National Emergencies Act , it gives the president more sweeping authorities , Elizabeth Goiten , the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center , wrote for the Atlantic on Monday . For Trump to use those authorities , though , he must \u201c specify which powers he intends to invoke , and he must issue updates if he adds new powers to the list , \u201d she explained .\nIt \u2019 s therefore possible that under this statute , Trump could order the military to do more than a state \u2019 s governor wants , but he \u2019 d have to notify everyone of those intentions .\nWhat \u2019 s most likely to happen , though , is that the military will abide by its long-standing process and doctrine of \u201c Defense Support for Civilian Authorities , \u201d or DSCA .\nFor emergencies in the homeland like the coronavirus outbreak , the military sees its role as providing \u201c support to prepare , prevent , protect , respond , and recover from domestic incidents. \u201d Such support is \u201c provided in response to requests from civil authorities and upon approval from appropriate authorities . \u201d\nUS troops , then , won \u2019 t start deploying to parts of the country without HHS or other government agencies asking them to , and even then the military will act strictly in support of what that agency wants .\nIn essence , Trump couldn \u2019 t use the military as his own personal coronavirus response force and law enforcement agency . It \u2019 ll be subordinate to the government agencies that request its assistance . How a National Guard unit acts , though , is highly dependent on a state \u2019 s governor .\nHHS has already asked the Pentagon for help with quarantining Americans coming back from Wuhan , China \u2014 where the outbreak started \u2014 as well as infected passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner . Military officials are also at the 11 feeder airports that passengers from abroad must go through for medical screenings before entering the US .\nBut so far , that \u2019 s it . \u201c We \u2019 ve not received any other [ requests ] at this time , \u201d Jonathan Hoffman , a top Pentagon spokesperson , told reporters on Monday .\nYet experts tell me that , if states and agencies would just request it , the Pentagon could be even more helpful .\nThere are four main ways the US military could assist in the country \u2019 s pandemic response : 1 ) provide care ; 2 ) assist with logistics ; 3 ) develop a vaccine or other treatment ; and 4 ) control crowds and provide other calming effects .\nEven as Americans aim to \u201c flatten the curve \u201d to keep coronavirus cases in the country low , hospitals find that they \u2019 re struggling to keep up with the number of patients that need medical care . A dearth of hospital beds , ventilators , and rested physicians means a spike in people requiring hospitalization could greatly overwhelm the civilian health system .\nShould those resources run low , the Defense Department \u201c could use authorities under the Defense Production Act to rapidly acquire a range of equipment such as N-95 respirators , gloves for medical personnel , and ventilators , \u201d James Miller , the top Pentagon policy official from 2012 to 2014 , told me .\nThe military also has thousands of physicians who could help treat patients . Dr. Angela Rasmussen , an infectious disease expert at Columbia University , told me the military could create new hospitals if needed \u2014 as New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo called on the Army Corps of Engineers to do \u2014 or repurpose current ones , for example by converting parts of hospitals into intensive care units .\nBut it should be noted that the military isn \u2019 t completely stocked up to help on all of this . As mentioned before , the Pentagon has fewer than 40 military hospitals , each of them small and geared toward healing troops in specific communities . \u201c Our fixed facilities are designed to the force that we have there \u2014 not 1,000-bed medical centers all over the United States , \u201d Friedrichs , the Joint Staff surgeon , told reporters on Monday .\nBy contrast , there are around 6,000 civilian hospitals in the country up and running today .\nAnd while the military also has 424 medical clinics , including the USNS Comfort , they \u2019 re not built to quarantine patients that have the disease . Still , if there are many patients who require care at one time , the military would surely look to house them on their military bases as a kind of overflow facility .\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) could also lend its doctors and facilities for the response if the VA secretary authorizes their use . \u201c The VA system was explicitly designed with the idea of not only treating veterans but providing redundancy for the civilian system , \u201d said Sasha Baker , a top aide to former Defense Secretary Ash Carter .\nAnd the VA says it \u2019 s ready to help if called upon . \u201c VA stands ready to surge capabilities into civilian health care systems in the event those systems encounter capacity issues , but at this time they are not encountering such issues , \u201d Christina Mandreucci , the VA \u2019 s press secretary , told me . \u201c Requests for such support would flow through the HHS , which is leading the federal government \u2019 s Covid-19 response efforts . \u201d\nBut should the National Disaster Medical System ( NDMS ) \u2014 a government program consisting of about 5,000 medical professionals \u2014 be called into action by a state or the federal government , the VA would play a huge role in making it work . \u201c The VA is the backbone for the NDMS , \u201d said Anthony Principi , the VA secretary from 2001 to 2005 .\nWhen I asked a current Marine officer how the military could best help if called upon , the officer \u2019 s response was short and to the point : \u201c We are good at logistics . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got trucks , warehouses , and people , \u201d the officer continued , \u201c plus a few cargo planes and helicopters. \u201d In other words , the military is full of highly trained professionals with top-of-the-line equipment that could be incredibly useful for transporting civilian officials and materials around the country .\nThat last part is key as doctors may need additional medical tools quickly to treat patients , or those in affected areas might require food and water to survive . Indeed , if so many people are sick that even grocery stores close down , they \u2019 ll need all the sustenance they can get . Only the military , really , has the trucks , helicopters , and planes necessary to deliver everything in an efficient manner . They \u2019 d also prove useful should someone require a medical evacuation .\nArmed forces could coordinate all this in command and control centers , Barry McCaffrey , a retired Army general , told me . That would help streamline all these efforts so the response isn \u2019 t so haphazard .\nExperts also noted that the armed forces have communications equipment allowing better coordination among several parts of the government . For example , if there needs to be a teleconference meeting , the military has the technology to set up such a meeting for personnel stationed in remote places .\nAnd troops can offer generators to provide electricity around the clock if needed . Generators are especially useful for field hospitals or if electrical workers in a particularly badly affected area have to stay home .\nBut , here again , there \u2019 s still a problem . The military is failing to come up with money for its own coronavirus response . Part of that comes from Trump administration efforts to cut the amount of military medical personnel the US can have by 18,000 , or 20 percent of the force .\n3 ) Help develop a vaccine or effective treatment for the virus\nThe Army leads the US military \u2019 s medical research , primarily at Fort Detrick in Maryland . Gen. James McConville , the Army \u2019 s chief , told Breaking Defense earlier this month that there are already researchers working on finding a vaccine for the novel coronavirus . \u201c They \u2019 ve been dealing with Ebola , they \u2019 ve been dealing with Zika , they \u2019 ve been dealing with MERS , and now they \u2019 re dealing with coronavirus , \u201d McConville said .\nWeber , now at the Council on Strategic Risks , told me that the only viable vaccine candidates and experimental drugs created during the 2014 Ebola crisis came from the Pentagon ( in partnership with the Canadian Ministry of Defense ) . Once it looked like that vaccine could work , the National Institutes of Health took it \u201c the last 10 yards , \u201d said Weber .\nBut that \u2019 s not all . Columbia \u2019 s Rasmussen told me that other Pentagon agencies , such as the Defense Threats Reduction Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , are working on tools that could potentially help fight the virus .\nIn DARPA \u2019 s case , it has a program called the Pandemic Prevention Platform that will \u201c temporarily protect someone from contracting the virus before a vaccine is ready , \u201d Amy Jenkins , the program \u2019 s director , told NPR in February .\nBasically , it \u2019 s a treatment that protects someone from the virus for about six months . It serves as a temporary fix while waiting for a vaccine that can take several weeks to kick in , and it consists of antibodies from people who \u2019 ve had Covid-19 and recovered . \u201c This technology could be used in this current coronavirus , \u201d she said , \u201c but this is still a very early technology . \u201d\nAt the time of the interview , Jenkins noted that the technology might be available within 90 days .\nThe military \u2019 s manpower could be helpful in managing large crowds , experts say . They could direct traffic at drive-through testing centers , for example , or control the flow of entries at medical facilities .\nThis would mostly be a job for the National Guard , the Marine officer told me , as people tend to freak out if they see other services trying to keep people calm within the US .\nAnd , as mentioned above , there are legal reasons why the National Guard would have to be the service doing the crowd control work and not the federal military .\nSo far there are about 670 National Guard members activated in 15 states .\nThe public \u2019 s trust in the military might help calm nerves that the US government has the situation under control . \u201c It would give the American public confidence , \u201d Weber told me .\nExperts told me it \u2019 s therefore surprising that Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley , the Joint Chiefs chair , haven \u2019 t been more visible so far in reassuring the nation that all will be well .\nThe risks of having the military involved in the coronavirus response\nWhile everyone I spoke with said the military had some role to play , many noted that deploying the armed forces also comes with very real risks .\nOne Air Force officer I talked to worried about exposing troops to sick people , which could increase the number of cases in the ranks . Having a large number of mostly young service members around crowds could also cause the virus to spread , since younger people may be infected without showing any symptoms . \u201c That hurts our ability to respond without endangering the very people we intend to protect , \u201d the officer said .\nPlus , the military is already reluctant to help with pandemic response .\nDuring the 2014 Ebola crisis , former defense officials told me , top military officials didn \u2019 t want 4,000 US troops going to West Africa to help . The feeling among some US uniformed leaders was that America \u2019 s service members should be focused on fighting wars , not curing diseases . Under immense White House pressure , though , the military did deploy and by most accounts proved instrumental in quelling the crisis .\nToday \u2019 s military brass seems to hold similar views , as the Defense Department is still mainly focused on the health of the force . From March 16 to May 11 , for example , troops aren \u2019 t allowed to travel domestically . It \u2019 s unclear that Pentagon leadership has turned its attention to a national response yet , experts tell me .\nThe Air Force officer has one theory as to why that may be : Surging military physicians to treat civilians means there \u2019 s a \u201c risk of no treatment for your defense force in an era where soldiers are still getting rocket attacked downrange and North Korea is firing missiles into the East Sea , \u201d the officer said . \u201c There \u2019 s still an argument for readiness \u201d \u2014 meaning the military \u2019 s ability to respond to any contingency \u2014 \u201c and our physicians and medical professionals help us maintain that posture . \u201d\nOther experts also noted that the Trump administration wants the armed forces focused on \u201c great power competition \u201d \u2014 preparing for fighting major wars in the future with the likes of China and Russia . If troops start spending months on the coronavirus crisis , they might be less prepared to engage in those conflicts .\nDespite those concerns , though , most I spoke with believe Trump will turn to the military sooner rather than later \u2014 though they wish he \u2019 d done so earlier .\n\u201c He downplayed the virus , and appeared not to understand what was happening , let alone what was coming , \u201d Miller told me . \u201c The price will be paid in American lives . \u201d",

As mentioned before, the Pentagon has fewer than 40 military hospitals, each of them small and geared toward healing troops in specific communities. \u201cOur fixed facilities are designed to the force that we have there \u2014 not 1,000-bed medical centers all over the United States,\u201d Friedrichs, the Joint Staff surgeon, told reporters on Monday.\n\nBy contrast, there are around 6,000 civilian hospitals in the country up and running today.\n\nAnd while the military also has 424 medical clinics, including the USNS Comfort, they\u2019re not built to quarantine patients that have the disease. Still, if there are many patients who require care at one time, the military would surely look to house them on their military bases as a kind of overflow facility.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) could also lend its doctors and facilities for the response if the VA secretary authorizes their use. \u201cThe VA system was explicitly designed with the idea of not only treating veterans but providing redundancy for the civilian system,\u201d said Sasha Baker, a top aide to former Defense Secretary Ash Carter.\n\nAnd the VA says it\u2019s ready to help if called upon. \u201cVA stands ready to surge capabilities into civilian health care systems in the event those systems encounter capacity issues, but at this time they are not encountering such issues,\u201d Christina Mandreucci, the VA\u2019s press secretary, told me. \u201cRequests for such support would flow through the HHS, which is leading the federal government\u2019s Covid-19 response efforts.\u201d\n\nBut should the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) \u2014 a government program consisting of about 5,000 medical professionals \u2014 be called into action by a state or the federal government, the VA would play a huge role in making it work. \u201cThe VA is the backbone for the NDMS,\u201d said Anthony Principi, the VA secretary from 2001 to 2005.\n\n2) Assist with logistics\n\nWhen I asked a current Marine officer how the military could best help if called upon, the officer\u2019s response was short and to the point: \u201cWe are good at logistics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got trucks, warehouses, and people,\u201d the officer continued, \u201cplus a few cargo planes and helicopters.\u201d In other words, the military is full of highly trained professionals with top-of-the-line equipment that could be incredibly useful for transporting civilian officials and materials around the country.\n\nThat last part is key as doctors may need additional medical tools quickly to treat patients, or those in affected areas might require food and water to survive. Indeed, if so many people are sick that even grocery stores close down, they\u2019ll need all the sustenance they can get. Only the military, really, has the trucks, helicopters, and planes necessary to deliver everything in an efficient manner. They\u2019d also prove useful should someone require a medical evacuation.\n\nArmed forces could coordinate all this in command and control centers, Barry McCaffrey, a retired Army general, told me. That would help streamline all these efforts so the response isn\u2019t so haphazard.\n\nExperts also noted that the armed forces have communications equipment allowing better coordination among several parts of the government. For example, if there needs to be a teleconference meeting, the military has the technology to set up such a meeting for personnel stationed in remote places.\n\nAnd troops can offer generators to provide electricity around the clock if needed. Generators are especially useful for field hospitals or if electrical workers in a particularly badly affected area have to stay home.\n\nBut, here again, there\u2019s still a problem. The military is failing to come up with money for its own coronavirus response. Part of that comes from Trump administration efforts to cut the amount of military medical personnel the US can have by 18,000, or 20 percent of the force.\n\n3) Help develop a vaccine or effective treatment for the virus\n\nThe Army leads the US military\u2019s medical research, primarily at Fort Detrick in Maryland. Gen. James McConville, the Army\u2019s chief, told Breaking Defense earlier this month that there are already researchers working on finding a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. \u201cThey\u2019ve been dealing with Ebola, they\u2019ve been dealing with Zika, they\u2019ve been dealing with MERS, and now they\u2019re dealing with coronavirus,\u201d McConville said.\n\nWeber, now at the Council on Strategic Risks, told me that the only viable vaccine candidates and experimental drugs created during the 2014 Ebola crisis came from the Pentagon (in partnership with the Canadian Ministry of Defense). Once it looked like that vaccine could work, the National Institutes of Health took it \u201cthe last 10 yards,\u201d said Weber.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Columbia\u2019s Rasmussen told me that other Pentagon agencies, such as the Defense Threats Reduction Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), are working on tools that could potentially help fight the virus.\n\nIn DARPA\u2019s case, it has a program called the Pandemic Prevention Platform that will \u201ctemporarily protect someone from contracting the virus before a vaccine is ready,\u201d Amy Jenkins, the program\u2019s director, told NPR in February.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s a treatment that protects someone from the virus for about six months. It serves as a temporary fix while waiting for a vaccine that can take several weeks to kick in, and it consists of antibodies from people who\u2019ve had Covid-19 and recovered. \u201cThis technology could be used in this current coronavirus,\u201d she said, \u201cbut this is still a very early technology.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the interview, Jenkins noted that the technology might be available within 90 days.\n\n4) Crowd control and calming effects\n\nThe military\u2019s manpower could be helpful in managing large crowds, experts say. They could direct traffic at drive-through testing centers, for example, or control the flow of entries at medical facilities.\n\nThis would mostly be a job for the National Guard, the Marine officer told me, as people tend to freak out if they see other services trying to keep people calm within the US.\n\nAnd, as mentioned above, there are legal reasons why the National Guard would have to be the service doing the crowd control work and not the federal military.\n\nSo far there are about 670 National Guard members activated in 15 states.\n\nThe public\u2019s trust in the military might help calm nerves that the US government has the situation under control. \u201cIt would give the American public confidence,\u201d Weber told me.\n\nExperts told me it\u2019s therefore surprising that Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the Joint Chiefs chair, haven\u2019t been more visible so far in reassuring the nation that all will be well.\n\nThe risks of having the military involved in the coronavirus response\n\nWhile everyone I spoke with said the military had some role to play, many noted that deploying the armed forces also comes with very real risks.\n\nOne Air Force officer I talked to worried about exposing troops to sick people, which could increase the number of cases in the ranks. Having a large number of mostly young service members around crowds could also cause the virus to spread, since younger people may be infected without showing any symptoms. \u201cThat hurts our ability to respond without endangering the very people we intend to protect,\u201d the officer said.\n\nPlus, the military is already reluctant to help with pandemic response.\n\nDuring the 2014 Ebola crisis, former defense officials told me, top military officials didn\u2019t want 4,000 US troops going to West Africa to help. The feeling among some US uniformed leaders was that America\u2019s service members should be focused on fighting wars, not curing diseases. Under immense White House pressure, though, the military did deploy and by most accounts proved instrumental in quelling the crisis.\n\nToday\u2019s military brass seems to hold similar views, as the Defense Department is still mainly focused on the health of the force. From March 16 to May 11, for example, troops aren\u2019t allowed to travel domestically. It\u2019s unclear that Pentagon leadership has turned its attention to a national response yet, experts tell me.\n\nThe Air Force officer has one theory as to why that may be: Surging military physicians to treat civilians means there\u2019s a \u201crisk of no treatment for your defense force in an era where soldiers are still getting rocket attacked downrange and North Korea is firing missiles into the East Sea,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThere\u2019s still an argument for readiness\u201d \u2014 meaning the military\u2019s ability to respond to any contingency \u2014 \u201cand our physicians and medical professionals help us maintain that posture.\u201d\n\nOther experts also noted that the Trump administration wants the armed forces focused on \u201cgreat power competition\u201d \u2014 preparing for fighting major wars in the future with the likes of China and Russia. If troops start spending months on the coronavirus crisis, they might be less prepared to engage in those conflicts.\n\nDespite those concerns, though, most I spoke with believe Trump will turn to the military sooner rather than later \u2014 though they wish he\u2019d done so earlier.\n\n\u201cHe downplayed the virus, and appeared not to understand what was happening, let alone what was coming,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cThe price will be paid in American lives.\u201d",
