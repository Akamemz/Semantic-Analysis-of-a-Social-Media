    "content": "President Donald Trump just dug himself in more deeply on the wrong side of history in the fast-changing consensus on the role and shame of racism in America . In a tweet Wednesday afternoon , Trump strongly opposed renaming the 10 U.S. Army bases that are named after Confederate officers . As he put it :\nThese Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage , and a history of Winning , Victory , and Freedom . The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds , and won two World Wars . Therefore , my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations . Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with . Respect our Military !\nTrump displayed no understanding of just who the namesakes of these bases were\u2014nor that these bases were given their names after World War I and , in some cases , after World War II .\nHe tweeted his objection in the wake of news that his acting secretary of the army , Ryan McCarthy , expressed a willingness to have a \u201c bipartisan conversation \u201d about renaming the bases . McCarthy \u2019 s statement came after retired Gen. David Petraeus , former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , wrote an article for the Atlantic late last week , headlined , \u201c Take the Confederate Names Off Our Army Bases . \u201d\nSince then , three retired Army colonels , who had notable careers in their time on active duty , Mike Jason , John Nagl , and Paul Yingling , made a similar argument in DefenseOne .\nIn short , 155 years after the end of the Civil War , the U.S. Army seems on the verge of accepting the full terms of the Union victory .\nMeanwhile , Trump is , as usual , clueless about the history of the country he supposedly leads . And rather than take the lead on a movement to redress the symbolism of white supremacy , a step that shouldn \u2019 t be so difficult , he once again prefers to bask in what he sees as the buzzwords of his base\u2014STRENGTH ! HEROES ! MILITARY ! \u2014even as decorated veterans , who embody those values more authentically than he ever will , are coming to terms with the sinful roots of certain aspects of their tradition .\nAll 10 of the Army bases are in former Confederate states in the South . Fort Benning , Georgia , home of several armored and infantry brigades , is named after Gen. Henry Benning , whose support for slavery was so avid that he proposed seceding from the Union and forming a Southern slavocracy more than a decade before the Civil War began . Fort Bragg , North Carolina , home of the 82nd Airborne Division , is named after Gen. Braxton Bragg , who wasn \u2019 t even a good officer ; he got into so many quarrels with superiors and subordinates that he once missed an opportunity to exploit a weakness in Union Gen. Ulysses Grant \u2019 s formation . Fort Gordon , Georgia , home of the Army Cyber Corps , is named after Gen. John Brown Gordon , a slave owner who rose quickly through the Confederate ranks and , after the war , joined the Ku Klux Klan . The list goes on .\nIn his Atlantic article , Petraeus wrote that , in his many years as an active-duty officer , often stationed at these bases ,\nI never thought much about these men\u2014about the nature of their service during the Civil War \u2026 the reasons they were honored , or the timing of the various forts \u2019 dedications . Nor did I think about the message those names sent to the many African Americans serving on these installations\u2014messages that should have been noted by all of us .\nNor , when he was a cadet at West Point , did he question the veneration shown toward Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee , who was a great commander but also\u2014like all the other Confederate officers\u2014guilty of treason . \u201c We were not encouraged to think deeply about the cause for which \u201d Lee had fought , Petraeus writes , \u201c at least not in our military history classes . \u201d\nPetraeus told me , in an email on Wednesday , that it was only after he retired from the Army , in 2011 , that he \u201c started thinking about how strange it was that the leaders of the fight against the Union were more widely honored\u2014with their names on federal forts , roads , barracks , gates , housing areas , etc.\u2014than were those who fought for the country . And , of course , those fighting to secede were doing so to preserve the rights of their states to enslave others , with those \u2018 others \u2019 now roughly 20 percent of the soldiers serving on those bases . \u201d\nThese thoughts deepened as he read several biographies of Gen. Ulysses Grant , the Union Army commander and later two-term president , who was honored hardly at all either at West Point or Army bases . Petraeus says he has \u201c been mulling for some time \u201d that the Army should publicly address this dishonor . \u201c The events of recent weeks , \u201d he said , \u201c were the catalyst to write the essay . \u201d\nJohn Nagl graduated from West Point in 1988\u201414 years after Petraeus\u2014but the treatment of Confederate heroes remained the same . He didn \u2019 t see the light until 2017 , when protests began over Confederate monuments in several Southern cities . Also in that year , Rep. Yvette Clarke introduced a bill in Congress to strip Army bases of Confederate names\u2014to the firm opposition of the Army and with little support from her colleagues in the House .\nThe controversy spurred Nagl , who is now the head of a boys \u2019 school in Pennsylvania , to read up on the history of the monuments . \u201c It was then , \u201d he wrote me in an email on Wednesday , \u201c that I learned that they had been erected long after the Civil War , as part of Jim Crow racial terror reinforcement , and learned as well that the Army had named posts and forts after Confederate generals in the same era . It \u2019 s been simmering inside me since , and the current moment seemed like an opportunity to help the service I love so well right a longstanding wrong . \u201d\nMike Jason graduated from West Point later still , in 1995 , as a military history major , and by then the academy was changing .
