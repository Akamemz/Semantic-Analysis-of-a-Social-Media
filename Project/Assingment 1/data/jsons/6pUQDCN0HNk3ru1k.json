( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )\nMore than any other single political event \u2014 including the Watergate scandal \u2014 the dishonest and morally indefensible attack on Robert Bork led by Teddy Kennedy and Joe Biden created the rancorous procedural and political maximalism that defines life in Washington today . Senators Kennedy and Biden \u2014 the guilty , sodden conscience of the Democratic party and its second-rate brain , respectively \u2014 did more than any two elected leaders in modern American history to cheapen consensus , render compromise unprofitable , and derail long-term cooperation between the major national political parties and , more important , between the two dominant American political tendencies for which they stand .
