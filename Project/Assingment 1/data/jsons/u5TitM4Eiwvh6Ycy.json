She left the White House in 2018 and moved to California to work as a top executive at the Fox Corporation , though she and Trump remained in touch .\nHicks \u2019 s move comes just one week after Trump was acquitted by the Senate on impeachment charges . Since then , he \u2019 s been on a tear to clear his administration of those he sees as insufficiently loyal , including ousting staffers at the national security council and state department and pulling the nomination of a top treasury department pick who had overseen cases involving Trump \u2019 s former aides as U.S. Attorney . More departures are expected in the coming days , including at the shrinking foreign policy arm of the White House , where Trump \u2019 s national security adviser has been pushing for months to cull staff .\nAt the same time , Trump has been working to surround himself with longtime aides he believes he can trust as he heads into what is expected to be a bruising general election campaign to remain in the White House .\nIn addition to Hicks , Trump recently brought back John McEntee , another longtime staffer who began on the 2016 campaign as an intern and rose to become one of Trump \u2019 s closest staffers , with an office adjacent to the Oval Office . McEntee had served as Trump \u2019 s personal aide until he was forced out of the White House in 2018 on the orders of former chief of staff John Kelly over issues with his security clearance .\nMcEntee has now been tapped to lead the White House Presidential Personnel Office , an influential posting that coordinates the screening and hiring of thousands of federal government workers .
