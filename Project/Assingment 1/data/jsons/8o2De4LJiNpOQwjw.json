His role is spelled out in the Constitution .\nIt says that the chief justice `` shall preside '' over the Senate trial of a president . Those who envision a powerful role for Roberts point to Senate rules that would allow him to make decisions on `` all questions of evidence .

They establish the procedures for the trial and can , by majority vote , overturn any of the chief justice 's rulings . The extent of the chief 's powerlessness was driven home to Chief Justice William Rehnquist at the beginning of President Bill Clinton 's Senate impeachment trial in 1999 .\nWhen Rehnquist asked Senate Sergeant at Arms James Ziglar how to turn on his microphone , Ziglar replied , `` You do n't .
