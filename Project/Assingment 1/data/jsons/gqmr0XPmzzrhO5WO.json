    "content": "Donald Trump is wrong about a lot of things .

Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) August 24 , 2017\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill like to complain that on health care , Trump didn \u2019 t really understand the issue , wasn \u2019 t engaged with the substance , and didn \u2019 t do a very good job of marketing their plans .

But the larger issue here is that Republican leaders \u2014 both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan , as well as Ryan \u2019 s predecessor John Boehner , and the chairs of all the relevant committees \u2014 spent years and years lying to everyone in sight about Republican health plans .\nRyan \u2019 s \u201c A Better Way for Health Care \u201d document promises as its very first chapter heading that it will offer \u201c High-Quality Health Care for All. \u201d And congressional Republicans claimed \u2014 over and over again \u2014 that they had ideas on the shelf to replace the Affordable Care Act with a new program that would address the public \u2019 s main concerns with the law .

McConnell and Ryan don \u2019 t go around advertising themselves as huge liars , after all . In my experience , their staffers tend to get pretty angry if you assert that they are huge liars . Consequently , they \u2019 ve done a pretty good job of getting most media outlets to report on their health care assertions as if those assertions are not huge lies .\nNot everybody believes them , of course .
