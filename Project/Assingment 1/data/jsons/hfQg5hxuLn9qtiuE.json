    "content": "Vindman , who became the first White House official to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry , also wrote that he reported Trump \u2019 s July 25 phone call with Zelensky to the NSC \u2019 s top lawyer after listening in on the conversation from the White House Situation Room alongside other national security officials .\nIt was the second time Vindman had raised concerns to the NSC \u2019 s lead counsel about a campaign by Trump , his associates and some U.S. officials to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations intended to benefit Trump politically .\n\u201c I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma , it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained , \u201d Vindman wrote . Burisma is a Ukrainian energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member .\n\u201c This would all undermine U.S. national security , \u201d Vindman added . \u201c Following the call , I again reported my concerns to NSC \u2019 s lead counsel . \u201d\nVindman , an Army combat veteran who served in Iraq , became the first official who listened in on Trump \u2019 s phone call with Zelensky to speak with investigators , providing a firsthand account of what House Democrats have said is a blatant abuse of power by the president . His opening statement leans heavily on his military service and a \u201c sense of duty \u201d to his country .\n\u201c I am a patriot , and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country , irrespective of party or politics , \u201d Vindman wrote in his opening statement , adding his family fled the Soviet Union when he was just 3\u00bd . Vindman was also wounded by a roadside bomb while serving in Iraq and received a Purple Heart .\n\u201c As an active duty military officer , the command structure is extremely important to me , \u201d Vindman wrote , defending his decisions to express his concerns about Trump to his higher-ups . \u201c On many occasions I have been told I should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities . \u201d\nAhead of Vindman \u2019 s testimony , Trump railed against the senior official on Twitter , calling the officer a \u201c Never Trumper \u201d and saying he had \u201c never even heard of \u201d Vindman .\nThe Trump-Zelensky phone call is at the center of House Democrats \u2019 impeachment inquiry . Investigators have gathered evidence that Trump sought to withhold nearly $ 400 million of critical military aid to Ukraine and refuse a White House meeting with Zelensky until the Ukrainian leader publicly stated his intention to launch Trump \u2019 s desired investigations .\nVindman also wrote that he would appear before investigators under subpoena \u2014 an indication the White House tried to prevent him from testifying . He also told investigators he is not the whistleblower who reported concerns about the White House handling of Ukraine to the intelligence community \u2019 s inspector general \u2014 though many of his concerns mirror the complaint that put the House on a path toward impeachment .\nDemocratic lawmakers have accused Republicans of using the closed-door depositions to learn the name of the whistleblower , who Trump \u2019 s GOP allies believe should be interviewed and publicly identified .\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan , the top Republican on the Oversight Committee , told reporters that Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) was preventing GOP lawmakers from pressing Vindman on whom he spoke with after Trump \u2019 s call with Zelensky .\n\u201c When there \u2019 s a subpoena from Congress , we all get to ask the questions . And Adam Schiff doesn \u2019 t get to say , \u2018 Oh , you can answer our questions , but you can \u2019 t answer the Republicans \u2019 questions , \u2019 \u201d Jordan said . \u201c If he \u2019 s so concerned about the rights of the Congress ... let us get our questions asked and answered . \u201d\nAfter Vindman \u2019 s deposition , Schiff accused Republicans of seeking to help Trump \u201c exact political revenge \u201d against the whistleblower , whose identity remains a secret .\n\u201c The president would love to punish the whistleblower . The president \u2019 s comments and actions have jeopardized the whistleblower \u2019 s safety , \u201d Schiff told reporters . \u201c The president 's allies would like nothing better than to out this whistleblower . Our committee will not be a part of that . We will not stand for that . \u201d\nVindman \u2019 s appearance before the three committees spearheading the impeachment inquiry marked the most significant crack yet in the White House blockade of witness testimony \u2014 and gave Democrats a long-sought first-person witness to the July 25 phone call .\n\u201c The criticism has been , \u2018 We have n't had first-person testimony. \u2019 We got first-person testimony , \u201d said Rep. Ami Bera ( D-Calif. ) , a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee . \u201c This is not someone who 's seeking the spotlight . \u201d\nAlready , a handful of State Department officials and diplomats have described alarm at Trump \u2019 s handling of Ukraine and expressed worrie he withheld military aid and a White House visit from Zelensky to pressure him to launch a probe of Biden and another based on a debunked conspiracy theory about Russian interference in the 2016 election .\nVindman planned to echo those concerns on Tuesday \u2014 in particular , efforts by \u201c outside influencers \u201d to promote \u201c a false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was at the helm of that shadow campaign , which led to the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine . Vindman did not name Giuliani in his opening statement but wrote he was alarmed that such efforts were inconsistent with American foreign policy and harming U.S.-Ukraine relations .\n\u201c This narrative was harmful to U.S. government policy , \u201d Vindman wrote in his statement . \u201c While my interagency colleagues and I were becoming increasingly optimistic on Ukraine \u2019 s prospects , this alternative narrative undermined U.S. government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine . \u201d\nVindman planned to testify that he first reported his Ukraine-related concerns to the NSC \u2019 s lead lawyer in early July after a meeting with Ukraine \u2019 s top national security official and a cadre of senior Trump administration officials , including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and diplomats Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland .\nVindman testified that when the Ukrainians raised the prospect of a Trump-Zelensky meeting \u2014 a crucial step for Ukraine as its newly elected leader sought to showcase a united front against Russia \u2014 Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union , interjected \u201c to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting. \u201d At that moment , Vindman wrote , then-national security adviser John Bolton \u201c cut the meeting short . \u201d\nAt a subsequent debriefing , Vindman wrote , Sondland \u201c emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election , the Bidens , and Burisma. \u201d Vindman wrote he confronted Sondland and called his statements \u201c inappropriate \u201d because \u201c the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security. \u201d Those concerns , he added , were echoed by Fiona Hill , who at the time served as the NSC \u2019 s top Russia policy official .\nGordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union , told lawmakers he did not remember discussing the Bidens with State Department or White House officials . | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo\n\u201c Following the debriefing meeting , I reported my concerns to the NSC \u2019 s lead counsel , \u201d Vindman wrote . \u201c Dr . Hill also reported the incident to the NSC \u2019 s lead counsel . \u201d\nSondland , for his part , told lawmakers earlier this month he did not remember discussing the Bidens with State Department or White House officials .\n\u201c I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son , nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens , \u201d Sondland said .\nHill testified earlier this month that she met with NSC lawyer John Eisenberg twice , at Bolton \u2019 s urging , to relay similar concerns . Both Vindman and Hill met with NSC lawyers on the same day , July 10 , after Bolton abruptly ended the meeting with Ukraine \u2019 s top national security official , Oleksandr Danylyuk .\nVindman \u2019 s testimony also appears to corroborate aspects of William Taylor \u2019 s testimony before impeachment investigators last week .
