    "content": "The FBI investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2019 s failure to protect state secrets contained in her emails has entered its penultimate phase , and it is a dangerous one for her and her aides .\nFederal law enforcement sources have let it be known that federal prosecutors and the FBI have completed their examination of raw data in the case . After the FBI acquires raw data -- for example , the nature and number of the state secrets in the emails Clinton failed to protect or the regular , consistent , systematic nature of that failure -- prosecutors and agents proceed to draw rational inferences from that data .\nThen they proceed to corroborate those inferences , looking for other sources to support or even to contradict them . With one exception , all of this work has been done with neutral sources of evidence -- documents , email metadata , government records and technical experts .\nThe exception is Bryan Pagliano , the one member of Clinton 's inner circle who , with either a written promise of non-prosecution or an order of immunity from a federal judge , began to cooperate with federal prosecutors last fall .\nPagliano has explained to federal prosecutors the who , what , when , how and why he migrated an open State Department email stream and a secret State Department email stream from government computers to Clinton 's secret server in her home in Chappaqua , New York . He has told them that Clinton paid him $ 5,000 to commit that likely criminal activity .\nHe has also told some of the 147 FBI agents assigned to this case that Clinton herself was repeatedly told by her own State Department information technology experts and their colleagues at the National Security Agency that her persistent use of her off-the-shelf BlackBerry was neither an effective nor an acceptable means of receiving , transmitting or safeguarding state secrets . Little did they know how reckless she was with government secrets , as none was apparently then aware of her use of her non-secure secret server in Chappaqua for all of her email uses .\nWe know that the acquisition and corroboration phase of the investigation has been completed because the prosecutors have begun to ask Clinton 's top aides during her time as secretary of state to come in for interviews . This is a delicate and dangerous phase for the aides , all of whom have engaged counsel to represent them .\nThe Department of Justice will not reveal to the aides or their lawyers what it knows about the case or what evidence of criminal wrongdoing , if any , it has acquired on each of them . Hence , if they submit to an FBI interview , they will go in `` blind . '' By going in blind , the aides run the risk of getting caught in a `` perjury trap .
