But she \u2019 s also one of the few with a credible primary challenger \u2014 who came within 6 points of securing the nomination at the California Democratic Party convention in February , where delegates handed Feinstein a startling rebuke by declining to endorse her .\nThe challenger , 51-year-old state Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n , stands out in a very crowded field of relatively unknown candidates in the June 5 Democratic primary . Still , his attempt to beat Feinstein is a race with David and Goliath-like odds , California political science experts say .\nFeinstein is an institution : She was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969 and became San Francisco mayor 10 years later . Now , she \u2019 s ranking member of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee , and at age 84 ( the oldest US senator ) , she \u2019 s seeking her sixth term .\nBut because of California \u2019 s \u201c top two \u201d primary system , as long as de L\u00e9on can slide into second place along Feinstein , he \u2019 ll be challenging her all the way until November \u2014 speaking for some California progressives who believe that a powerful senator from a deep-blue state should be a louder voice in opposition to Trump \u2019 s agenda .\nCalifornia has been the epicenter of the Trump resistance movement , and Feinstein is a frequent target among progressive groups for not taking a hard enough line against the president .\nHer comments that she believed Trump \u201c can be a good president \u201d if he was open to change caught plenty of flak , but progressives \u2019 disagreements with her go deeper . They run the gamut from her opposition to a single-payer health care bill to her support of the controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) and her past vote in favor of the Iraq war .\nAnd in some ways , Feinstein seems to be feeling the heat ; in recent months , she \u2019 s moved left on the death penalty , saying she now opposes capital punishment after supporting it for many years \u2014 and even running on the issue in early Senate campaigns .\nFeinstein is saddled with \u201c the perception of being out of date , \u201d said David Mermin , a longtime political strategist in California .\n\u201c People won \u2019 t say age , but she \u2019 s the oldest member of the Senate , \u201d he added . \u201c So when voters do think about people who have been in office for a long time , they don \u2019 t say they \u2019 re old ; they say they \u2019 re out of date . \u201d\nThe California Democratic Party convention showed at least some segment of state Democrats agreed .\n\u201c A lot of Democrats gave us a lot of wind behind our sails , with the belief that it is time for a change , \u201d de Le\u00f3n told me in his state Senate office in Sacramento recently . \u201c It \u2019 s time to have a voice that \u2019 s reflective of today \u2019 s California , not the California of a quarter-century ago . \u201d\nDe Le\u00f3n is presenting himself as that alternative : more progressive policy-wise , and more willing to openly be a thorn in Trump \u2019 s side .\nBut on the whole , Feinstein will be hard to beat .

Plus , despite whatever California Democratic Party delegates might be feeling , national Democrats have no interest in a primary defeat against Feinstein . She \u2019 s a safe , reliable seat and an important person in the national party .\nPlus , as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary , she \u2019 s an important part of protecting special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign .\n\u201c He \u2019 s got a real campaign , but ...

He worked in the state for years as a labor organizer before entering California state politics in 2006 .\nIn Sacramento , he started in the state assembly and then moved to the state Senate , becoming president pro tempore of the chamber in 2014 . Throughout the years , he helped advance a number of piece of legislation focused on combating climate change , cutting tax loopholes , and promoting gun control .
