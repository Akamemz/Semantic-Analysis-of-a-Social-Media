Their concerns fall in line with the narrative that Trump and his administration is anti-LGBT and anti-women . Consistently ignored by these same people is the fact that Trump is the first U.S. president to ever enter office supporting same-sex marriage . Also ignored is the fact that women make up a majority of the pro-life movement and that there is more to women \u2019 s rights than just abortion .\nAs expected , signers of the letter include Planned Parenthood , Amnesty International , and numerous former Obama administration officials .

It is also a public commission , meaning the public will be able to watch most of their meetings and submit information and questions .\nAll of this ignores the simple fact that the commission was set up to look into unalienable rights , which apply to every human being .
