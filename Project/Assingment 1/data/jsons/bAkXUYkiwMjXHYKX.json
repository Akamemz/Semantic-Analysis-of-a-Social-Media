    "content": "Rinat Akhmetshin is a Russian-American lobbyist who , by his own admission , worked as a military counterintelligence officer for the Soviet Union before its fall .\nHe also attended Donald Trump Jr. \u2019 s June 2016 meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya , before which Trump was promised dirt on Hillary Clinton that came from the Russian government . The Trump team had , until NBC News broke the story on Friday , never mentioned that there were any other Russian nationals at the meeting .\nAs a result , Akhmetshin is now the most speculated-about man in American politics . Veselnitskaya herself was a lawyer who had previously represented the Kremlin government but was not literally a Russian state employee . If an actual Russian spy was at the meeting , that would bring the Russian government \u2019 s ties to the Trump campaign one gigantic step closer .\nSo is Akhmetshin a Russian spy ? He denies the charge , of course \u2014 but that \u2019 s what any spy would do ( Akhmetshin did not respond to an emailed request for comment ) . So all we have to go on is what \u2019 s publicly available : reporting and documents on his roughly 20-year lobbying career in Washington .\nThat record is not conclusive either way . But it does suggest that there is , at least , a plausible case that Akhmetshin was involved in Russia \u2019 s election interference campaign . An April letter penned by Sen. Chuck Grassley , the Republican chair of the Judiciary Committee , accuses him of having \u201c ties to Russian intelligence. \u201d Rep. Dana Rohrabacher , a Russia-friendly California Republican , told CNN that Akhmetshin had `` international connections to different groups in Russia \u201d and that `` I would certainly not rule [ him being a spy ] out . ''\nAnd court documents uncovered by the Daily Beast allege that Akhmetshin masterminded the hack and dissemination of private documents belonging to a mining company in 2013 .\nSo while nothing is proven , the information that \u2019 s come to light since Akhmetshin \u2019 s attendance at the meeting was exposed on Friday morning only raises more questions about his background and motivation for being at the meeting . The furor over Akhmetshin may turn out to a tempest in teapot \u2014 or a Category Five hurricane .\nAkhmetshin \u2019 s time as an out-and-out intelligence officer was , by his account , brief . He told the Associated Press he was drafted into the Soviet army in 1986 and was sent to a unit \u201c loosely part of counterintelligence. \u201d He served there until 1988 , when he was discharged .\nSeveral years later , he moved to America \u2014 where he \u2019 s been working as a lobbyist since at least 1998 . Akhmetshin \u2019 s work centered on issues relating to the former Soviet Union , but he also developed a reputation as a flamboyant operator : a \u201c man about town , \u201d as the Atlantic \u2019 s Julia Ioffe puts it . He was known both for riding a bright orange bicycle around Washington and for orchestrating lobbying campaigns with heavy PR components aimed at discrediting his clients \u2019 enemies .\n\u201c In 2011 , Akhmetshin was accused of helping to organize a smear campaign against former Russian Duma deputy Ashot Egiazaryan , who had sought political asylum in the United States in the face of criminal charges in Russia related to a business dispute , \u201d Radio Free Europe \u2019 s Mike Eckel writes in an excellent profile of Akhmetshin .\nSometimes these campaigns got vicious . Court filings from the Egiazaryan case reviewed by Eckel allege that Akhmetshin placed an op-ed in a Jewish newspaper tarring the Russian lawmaker as an anti-Semite .\nThe allegations of hacking grew out of a 2013 dispute between two chemical companies \u2014 International Mineral Resources ( IMR ) and Eurochem Volgakaliy ( Eurochem for short ) , both of which were owned by Russian oligarchs . Eurochem alleged that a subsidiary of IMR had defrauded them in a mining deal . The lawyers representing Eurochem hired Akhmetshin to help them build their case .\nAccording to a lawsuit filed by IMR against Akhmetshin , he broke the law in doing so . According to a private investigator retained by IMR \u2019 s attorneys , Akhmetshin bragged in a London coffee shop that \u201c he [ had ] organized the hacking of IMR 's computer systems. \u201d IMR \u2019 s attorneys also produced a thumb drive containing their documents , which appeared to have been accessed by Akhmetshin and a colleague .\nAkhmetshin denied all the charges \u2014 but his phrasing was interesting . \u201c It is not possible that I was overheard saying that I was turning over documents that I had hacked from an IMR or ENRC computer , because I have never done so , nor do I have the skills to do so , \u201d he said , according to a 2015 court document . But no one was accusing him of doing the hacking , just of organizing it . You don \u2019 t need technical skills to pay a hacker to do your dirty work .\nPerhaps even more tellingly , he claimed he got the thumb drive full of stolen documents from the \u201c London Information Bazaar , \u201d which the court documents describe as an \u201c informal market for sensitive financial , political , and other information that exists in London. \u201d That means that even if Akhmetshin did not organize the hacking , he admits openly that he \u2019 s familiar with ways to get shady information .\nIMR ultimately withdrew its lawsuit against Akhmetshin . But the case , and the rest of his history , seems to establish that he \u2019 s a man who a ) spent time in the intelligence world , even if only briefly ; b ) has experience working in Washington on behalf of former Soviet states and oligarchs ; and c ) knows at least a little bit about how to acquire and distribute sensitive information .\nThese are certainly the sort of qualifications the Kremlin would look for when staffing a team to intervene in the US election .\nThe direct evidence of Akhmetshin \u2019 s involvement with the Kremlin is thin \u2014 but his explanation for the Trump meeting is questionable\nAs dubious as Akhmetshin \u2019 s past is , there \u2019 s no direct evidence showing that he \u2019 s in the Kremlin \u2019 s employ . There wouldn \u2019 t be , of course : It \u2019 s not like the Kremlin posts a list on the internet with all the names of its operatives in Washington .\nBut it \u2019 s his most recent lobbying campaign , a furious effort to undermine a US sanctions law against Russia called the Magnitsky Act , that is raising questions about his current ties to the Kremlin .\nOriginally passed in 2012 , the Magnitsky law empowers the US president to slap sanctions on anyone he or she believes to be involved in the death of Sergei Magnitsky \u2014 a Russian attorney who uncovered a $ 230 million money laundering scheme involving Russian government officials and then was killed while in Russian state custody . It also gives the president the ability to sanction any Russian officials who were involved in similar murder schemes in the future .\nBecause the law directly targets specific high-level Russian officials and businesspeople , its passage made the Kremlin absolutely furious . After it was passed , the Russian government retaliated with its own kind of sanctions \u2014 banning Americans from adopting Russian children .\nIn 2016 , Akhmetshin was hired by an organization called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation ( HRAGIF ) , essentially an anti-Magnitsky pressure group . And here \u2019 s where things get really tricky from a Trump Jr.-Russia perspective .\nHRAGIF was founded by a Russian businessman named Denis Katsyv . His father , Pyotr Katsyv , is a not-insignificant Russian state official , serving as both minister for transportation and vice premier of the Moscow region from 2004 to 2012 . The attorney who represented the Katsyv family , and served alongside Akhmetshin as one of HRAGIF \u2019 s leading lobbyists , was none other than Natalia Veselnitskaya .\nYes , that Natalia Veselnitskaya \u2014 the one who attended the Trump Jr. meeting .\nThe first is that Veselnitskaya really was trying to meet with Donald Trump Jr. just to talk about adoptions , as Don has long claimed . In that scenario , the meeting was essentially part of anti-Magnitsky lobbying : Veselnitskaya was trying to feel out if the Trump team would be willing to lift Magnitsky sanctions in exchange for the Kremlin lifting its adoption ban . Akhmetshin was brought along to help her make sense of the meeting .\nThis appears to basically be Akhmetshin \u2019 s story \u2014 and , if true , would suggest that he was merely lobbying on behalf of Russian interests , not working as a Russian spy .\n\u201c [ Akhmetshin ] said he had learned about the meeting only that day when Veselnitskaya asked him to attend , \u201d the Associated Press reports . \u201c He said he showed up in jeans and a T-shirt . \u201d\nThe second , darker interpretation is that the Magnitsky lobbying was only one of Akhmetshin \u2019 s goals . That Akhmetshin and perhaps also Veselnitskaya were being paid by the Russian government both to work against sanctions and to figure out if the Trump campaign would be interested in colluding with their campaign against Hillary Clinton . This is not a crazy scenario , at least according to one intelligence professional .\n\u201c In this case , the meeting is allegedly to discuss the Magnitsky Act , \u201d Glenn Carle , a former CIA covert operative , told my colleague Sean Illing . \u201c What do you do here if you 're the Russians ? You send someone who is a private lawyer into what might theoretically be a legitimate , aboveboard meeting , and you inject an intelligence officer or intelligence objectives into that meeting . That appears to be what happened in this case . \u201d\nAkhmetshin \u2019 s lobbying work against the Magnitsky Act is in itself fairly suggestive \u2014 after all , who else would want it lifted but the Russian government ? It \u2019 s the work that led both Sen. Grassley and Rep. Rohrabacher to wonder about Akhmetshin \u2019 s connection to the Russian government . Grassley , in his April 2017 letter , said the Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating claims that Akhmetshin was \u201c acting as an unregistered agent for Russian interests . \u201d\nThis theory also makes sense out of the fact Trump Jr. \u2019 s meeting with Veselnitskaya was billed as an opportunity to receive potentially damaging information about Hillary Clinton from a Russian government source . And there \u2019 s a part of Akhmetshin \u2019 s own story , as reported by the AP , that makes this seem more plausible :\nDuring the meeting , Akhmetshin said Veselnitskaya brought with her a plastic folder with printed-out documents that detailed what she believed was the flow of illicit funds to the Democratic National Committee . Veselnitskaya presented the contents of the documents to the Trump associates and suggested that making the information public could help the Trump campaign , he said .\nWhy would an anti-sanctions lobbyist have information on DNC finances ? Where did she get them if not the Russian government \u2014 more specifically , from emails stolen by Russian government hackers from the DNC servers ?\nWe don \u2019 t , right now , have enough information to determine which of the two scenarios is closer to accurate . We only have the word of the participants of the meeting to go on so far , and none of them have any incentive to tell the truth if it \u2019 s the worst-case scenario . Moreover , Trump Jr. has a repeated habit of lying and omitting the truth about this meeting \u2014 which is why we \u2019 re only just now finding out about Akhmetshin \u2019 s participation in the first place .\nBut what we do know about Akhmetshin suggests that , at a minimum , we can not rule out him working as a direct agent of the Russian government . Only more investigation \u2014 from reporters , Congress , and the FBI \u2014 will be able to get to the bottom of this , one way or another .",
