Did America \u2019 s free market economists help put a protectionist demagogue in the White House ? By Michael Hirsh\nPaul Krugman has never suffered fools gladly . The Nobel Prize-winning economist rose to international fame\u2014and a coveted space on the New York Times op-ed page\u2014by lacerating his intellectual opponents in the most withering way . In a series of books and articles beginning in the 1990s , Krugman branded just about everybody who questioned the rapid pace of globalization a fool who didn \u2019 t understand economics very well . \u201c Silly \u201d was a word Krugman used a lot to describe pundits who raised fears of economic competition from other nations , especially China . Don \u2019 t worry about it , he said : Free trade will have only minor impact on your prosperity . Now Krugman has come out and admitted , offhandedly , that his own understanding of economics has been seriously deficient as well . In a recent essay titled \u201c What Economists ( Including Me ) Got Wrong About Globalization , \u201d adapted from a forthcoming book on inequality , Krugman writes that he and other mainstream economists \u201c missed a crucial part of the story \u201d in failing to realize that globalization would lead to \u201c hyperglobalization \u201d and huge economic and social upheaval , particularly of the industrial middle class in America . And many of these working-class communities have been hit hard by Chinese competition , which economists made a \u201c major mistake \u201d in underestimating , Krugman says . ABOUT THE AUTHOR\nMichael Hirsh is a senior correspondent and deputy news editor at \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Twitter : @ michaelphirsh . It was quite a \u201c whoops \u201d moment , considering all the ruined American communities and displaced millions of workers we \u2019 ve seen in the interim . And a newly humbled Krugman must consider an even more disturbing idea : Did he and other mainstream economists help put a protectionist populist , Donald Trump , in the White House with a lot of bad advice about free markets ? To be fair , Krugman has been forthright in recent years in second-guessing his earlier assertions about the effects of open trade . He has also become a leading and sometimes harsh critic of his own profession , especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis and Great Recession , when he declared that much of the past 30 years of macroeconomics was \u201c spectacularly useless at best , and positively harmful at worst. \u201d He admirably held the Obama administration to account for its timid financial and economic reforms . He even had some kind things to say about proto-progressives such as Robert Reich , the former Clinton administration labor secretary who worried about global competition and sought better protections and retraining for American workers , and whom Krugman had once dismissed to me\u2014back in his lacerating days in the \u2019 90s\u2014as an \u201c offensive figure , a brilliant coiner of one-liners but not a serious thinker. \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m glad he \u2019 s finally seen the light on trade , \u201d Reich told me in an email . Krugman , in another email , wrote : \u201c I regret having said that about Reich , but if he foresaw hyperglobalization or the localized effects of the China shock , that \u2019 s news to me . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m glad he \u2019 s finally seen the light on trade , \u201d former Clinton administration labor secretary Robert Reich told me in an email .\nYet it has taken an awful long time for economists to admit that their profession has been far too sure of itself\u2014or , as a penitent Krugman put it himself in a 2009 article in the New York Times Magazine , that \u201c economists , as a group , mistook beauty , clad in impressive-looking mathematics , for truth. \u201d As the journalist Binyamin Appelbaum writes in his new book , The Economists \u2019 Hour : False Prophets , Free Markets , and the Fracture of Society , economists came to dominate policymaking in Washington in a way they never had before and , starting in the late 1960s , seriously misled the nation , helping to disrupt and divide it socially with a false sense of scientific certainty about the wonders of free markets . The economists pushed efficiency at all costs at the expense of social welfare and \u201c subsumed the interests of Americans as producers to the interests of Americans as consumers , trading well-paid jobs for low-cost electronics. \u201d David Autor , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) whose documentation of the surprising effects of China \u2019 s rapid rise on the U.S. labor market is cited by Krugman in his new essay , gives the Times columnist a lot of credit for admitting error . \u201c How rare is that ? ! \u201d Autor wrote via email . He said he doesn \u2019 t blame Krugman or other defenders of \u201c the prior consensus \u201d for making faulty predictions about trade . \u201c I honestly think that getting this one right ex ante would have been akin to accurately forecasting the date , time and location of an earthquake. \u201d The bigger problem was the pro-free trade zeitgeist , Autor said . \u201c I think that the received wisdom inhibited economists from closely evaluating the evidence of what was underway . \u2026 One could say that there was something of a guild orthodoxy : The key dictum was that policymakers should be told that trade was good for everyone in all places and times. \u201d Dani Rodrik , a Harvard University economist who in 1997 published a then-heretical book called Has Globalization Gone Too Far ? , said last week that he wrote it precisely because he believed that \u201c the profession was so blas\u00e9 about globalization. \u201d Now his views are mainstream , and Rodrik is president-elect of the International Economic Association . But the economists have barely begun to clean up the mess they left behind , as a conference on inequality at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , organized by Rodrik and former International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) chief economist Olivier Blanchard , made clear last week . And now in some ways it \u2019 s too late because , as Rodrik says , it \u2019 s not even possible to have a reasonable discussion under Trump . The U.S. president has effectively discarded modern economics , reembraced crude protectionism , and , like the mercantilists of the pre-Adam Smith era , appears to see trade as a zero-sum game in which surpluses are in effect profits and deficits are losses . His ignorance of basic economics \u201c is without parallel among modern American presidents , \u201d Appelbaum writes in The Economists \u2019 Hour .\nKrugman played a major part in attacking what he saw as economic ignorance by \u201c strategic traders \u201d who argued that U.S. jobs and wages might be seriously affected by cheap labor from the developing world .\nYet Trump has been able to launch an unprecedented trade war , exploiting the public \u2019 s mistrust and fear of China , thanks in part to the economists \u2019 early misreadings\u2014specifically of how swiftly China \u2019 s economic surge would displace so many U.S. industrial jobs . As Krugman now acknowledges , \u201c manufacturing employment fell off a cliff after 2000 , and this decline corresponded to a sharp increase \u201d in the U.S. trade deficit , especially with China . Those numbers , in turn , have tended to lend credence to Trump \u2019 s mercantilist notions , no matter how spurious . \u201c One of the most perverse effects of Trump was that it completely erased any reasonable discussion \u201d about how to address trade , inequality , and the right degree of protection for workers , Rodrik said . And this , too , is a downstream effect of the bad advice economists delivered about free trade going back to the \u2019 90s . Or as MIT \u2019 s Autor put it : \u201c Ultimately this policy boosterism blinded policymakers to the potentially grave consequences of trade shocks and likely lulled us into underpreparing for these shocks ( e.g. , we had a paltry safety net and retraining policies on hand ) . It led us somewhat blithely into a non-negligible policy disaster ( AKA the China Shock ) and provoked a public backlash that has rendered free trade toxic in the U.S. policy debate . There \u2019 s an irony for you : trade boosterism has ultimately hurt the cause of free trade. \u201d Asked whether the mistakes made by him and other economists helped lead to the rise of Trump , Krugman responded : \u201c We \u2019 re still debating this , but as far as I can tell Trump \u2019 s trade policy isn \u2019 t resonating with many people , even his blue-collar base . So it \u2019 s kind of hard to blame trade analysts for the phenomenon . \u201d\nOthers would disagree . Part of the problem is that , back in the \u2019 90s , when the post-Cold War consensus was just emerging , economists tended to take a simplistic either-or view of trade\u2014either you were a free trader or a protectionist\u2014and forced people to choose sides . Krugman was one of them , adopting by and large the free trade position , which was ironic considering that his Nobel-winning work in economics was far more nuanced than his books and columns ( and actually helped lay the intellectual foundations for smart strategic trade policy ) . Yet there were others in the policy debates\u2014such as Rodrik , Reich , and Laura D \u2019 Andrea Tyson , who led former President Bill Clinton \u2019 s Council of Economic Advisers\u2014who were far more worried about rapid globalization . They dared to question the pro-free trade consensus or at least , in Tyson \u2019 s case , to push for government-led industrial policy that would sharpen American competitiveness at a time when , after the Cold War , many newly liberalized nations were piling into the global economy at a great rate . This idea also was anathema to Krugman . \u201c Dani was way ahead of his time , \u201d Autor said . \u201c He was worried not about sudden shocks per se but about the way that globalization hemmed in the policy options of open economies ( options for financing social insurance , taxing increasingly mobile capital , etc ) . That was and is a deep point . \u2026 Meanwhile , Laura Tyson was advocating forward-looking industrial policy at a time when industrial policy was the Voldemort of policy tools. \u201d Those who have studied Krugman \u2019 s work closely , like Autor , say that of course he understood that just the right kind of industrial policy could help build competitive sectors . But Autor added : \u201c I suspect that economists feared that stating these points aloud to policymakers would be like handing a loaded weapon to a impetuous child . \u201d\nThose who advocated anything resembling government interference in markets and \u201c fair trade \u201d ( more tariffs , unemployment insurance , and worker protections ) over \u201c free trade \u201d were usually branded protectionists and excluded from the debate .\nKrugman maintains that his new mea culpa \u201c was a fairly narrow one \u201d about how trade would affect lower-wage workers and exacerbate inequality . That is true . But after the Cold War ended , the debate over trade ( Krugman \u2019 s Nobel-winning specialty ) became a proxy for a larger intellectual struggle over free markets versus government intervention . And Krugman played a major part in attacking what he saw as economic ignorance by \u201c strategic traders \u201d who argued that U.S. jobs and wages might be seriously affected by competition from cheap labor in the developing world . When William Greider , the former Washington Post journalist , warned in a deeply reported book called One World , Ready or Not : The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism that developing nations were gearing up for major industrial competition that would mean \u201c [ s ] ome sectors of Americans are triumphant and other sectors are devastated , \u201d Krugman called it a \u201c thoroughly silly book. \u201d When Michael Lind , another prominent public intellectual , suggested ( accurately ) that U.S. productivity growth might not be enough to offset \u201c the global sweatshop economy , \u201d Krugman declared Lind to be ignorant of economic \u201c facts \u201d and said that \u201c one should not expect someone who does not work in the field to be able to get it right without some guidance. \u201d Krugman was no less kind to fellow economists who dared to question the free trade consensus . When Tyson was chosen to head Clinton \u2019 s Council of Economic Advisers in 1993 , Krugman said she lacked the \u201c necessary analytical skills. \u201d It was all just bad economics , Krugman said . Don \u2019 t worry so much about what all the other countries are up to ; things will even out thanks to neoclassical concepts such as comparative advantage , which allows all nations to benefit from open trade . Indeed , those who advocated anything resembling government interference in markets and \u201c fair trade \u201d ( more tariffs , unemployment insurance , and worker protections ) over \u201c free trade \u201d were usually branded protectionists and excluded from the debate . Clinton , reveling in his reputation as the \u201c globalization \u201d president , barely held a meeting on the fate of the industrially displaced . When his old Rhodes Scholar pal from the University of Oxford , Labor Secretary Reich , openly advocated reinvestment in education , training , and infrastructure at a time when Clinton was keen on deficit-cutting , Reich was also edged out of the conversation and , eventually , the administration . Some ex-Clintonites such as Gene Sperling , the former head of the National Economic Council , argue that the debate was never so stark . \u201c Clinton cared about the middle class , \u201d he told me . And had the Democrats continued in power , they would have worked much harder to bring China into compliance with trade norms , for example by enforcing \u201c anti-surge \u201d protections\u2014required of China as part of its World Trade Organization membership negotiated by Clinton in 1999\u2014against the dumping of huge amounts of cheap product that undercut U.S. jobs , Sperling said . \u201c People think that the only difference with Al Gore [ in the 2000 presidential election ] was the Iraq War , but another huge difference would have been that Gore would have gone way beyond anything [ George W. ] Bush did to protect manufacturing , \u201d Sperling said . ( A new book by the former Washington Post economics reporter Paul Blustein , Schism : China , America , and the Fracturing of the Global Trading System , also concludes that the Bush administration let China get away with far too much , including artificially devaluing its currency to boost exports\u2014which led ultimately to Trump \u2019 s claim that China had committed \u201c rape \u201d of the U.S . economy . ) Other former Krugman victims still blame him for his misjudgments and are not so assuaged by his penitence . \u201c This is not bad as mea culpas go , but if you read through to the end , Krugman persists with the oversimplified dichotomy of free trade versus protectionism , ignoring such successful hybrids as East Asian neo-mercantilism , \u201d said Robert Kuttner , the co-editor of the American Prospect and a much-cited progressive thinker . \u201c This is all the more bizarre because the young Krugman came to prominence demonstrating that [ national ] competitive advantage could be created , something that any non-economist student of economic history could have told him. \u201d Krugman , in his defense , has always believed in protections for the middle class , including better health care and education ( his old Times blog was titled \u201c The Conscience of a Liberal \u201d ) , and he says now that just because he has admitted errors on trade doesn \u2019 t mean he ever endorsed the so-called Washington Consensus\u2014the neoliberal ( that is , pro-free trade ) view that regularly came down on the side of fiscal discipline , rapid privatization , and deregulation . \u201c I guess the point is that conceding that we got some things wrong doesn \u2019 t mean that every critic was right ; it depends on what they said , and as far as I know almost nobody foresaw the massive rise in trade or focused at all on localized regional impacts , \u201d Krugman told me last week . But there were deeper conceptual problems with the pro-globalization consensus as well . Another Nobel-winning economist , Joseph Stiglitz , who like Rodrik warned back in the \u2019 90s of the disruptive effects of too rapid lowering of trade and capital barriers , told me that the problem with \u201c standard neoclassical analysis \u201d was that it \u201c never paid any attention to adjustment . Labor market adjustment miraculously happened costlessly. \u201d Like Tyson and Reich , Stiglitz , who served as a chair of Clinton \u2019 s Council of Economic Advisers , was an outlier at the time , seeking ( but failing ) to slow the pace of international capital flows . He also argued that \u201c typically jobs were destroyed far faster than new jobs were created. \u201d Krugman , in his new essay , admits that the economists like him in favor of the \u2019 90s consensus behind free trade\u2014who thought that the effects on labor would be minimal\u2014 \u201c didn \u2019 t turn much to analytic methods that focus on workers in particular industries and communities , which would have given a better picture of short-run trends . This was , I now believe , a major mistake\u2014one in which I shared a hand . \u201d\nThe main loser , again , is the American worker . Whereas economists used to believe that workers , during boom times , could drive up their compensation ( thus leading to inflation ) , the emerging economic wisdom now suggests something different .",

And had the Democrats continued in power, they would have worked much harder to bring China into compliance with trade norms, for example by enforcing \u201canti-surge\u201d protections\u2014required of China as part of its World Trade Organization membership negotiated by Clinton in 1999\u2014against the dumping of huge amounts of cheap product that undercut U.S. jobs, Sperling said. \u201cPeople think that the only difference with Al Gore [in the 2000 presidential election] was the Iraq War, but another huge difference would have been that Gore would have gone way beyond anything [George W.] Bush did to protect manufacturing,\u201d Sperling said. (A new book by the former Washington Post economics reporter Paul Blustein, Schism: China, America, and the Fracturing of the Global Trading System, also concludes that the Bush administration let China get away with far too much, including artificially devaluing its currency to boost exports\u2014which led ultimately to Trump\u2019s claim that China had committed \u201crape\u201d of the U.S. economy.) Other former Krugman victims still blame him for his misjudgments and are not so assuaged by his penitence. \u201cThis is not bad as mea culpas go, but if you read through to the end, Krugman persists with the oversimplified dichotomy of free trade versus protectionism, ignoring such successful hybrids as East Asian neo-mercantilism,\u201d said Robert Kuttner, the co-editor of the American Prospect and a much-cited progressive thinker. \u201cThis is all the more bizarre because the young Krugman came to prominence demonstrating that [national] competitive advantage could be created, something that any non-economist student of economic history could have told him.\u201d Krugman, in his defense, has always believed in protections for the middle class, including better health care and education (his old Times blog was titled \u201cThe Conscience of a Liberal\u201d), and he says now that just because he has admitted errors on trade doesn\u2019t mean he ever endorsed the so-called Washington Consensus\u2014the neoliberal (that is, pro-free trade) view that regularly came down on the side of fiscal discipline, rapid privatization, and deregulation. \u201cI guess the point is that conceding that we got some things wrong doesn\u2019t mean that every critic was right; it depends on what they said, and as far as I know almost nobody foresaw the massive rise in trade or focused at all on localized regional impacts,\u201d Krugman told me last week. But there were deeper conceptual problems with the pro-globalization consensus as well. Another Nobel-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, who like Rodrik warned back in the \u201990s of the disruptive effects of too rapid lowering of trade and capital barriers, told me that the problem with \u201cstandard neoclassical analysis\u201d was that it \u201cnever paid any attention to adjustment. Labor market adjustment miraculously happened costlessly.\u201d Like Tyson and Reich, Stiglitz, who served as a chair of Clinton\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, was an outlier at the time, seeking (but failing) to slow the pace of international capital flows. He also argued that \u201ctypically jobs were destroyed far faster than new jobs were created.\u201d Krugman, in his new essay, admits that the economists like him in favor of the \u201990s consensus behind free trade\u2014who thought that the effects on labor would be minimal\u2014\u201cdidn\u2019t turn much to analytic methods that focus on workers in particular industries and communities, which would have given a better picture of short-run trends. This was, I now believe, a major mistake\u2014one in which I shared a hand.\u201d\n\nThe main loser, again, is the American worker. Whereas economists used to believe that workers, during boom times, could drive up their compensation (thus leading to inflation), the emerging economic wisdom now suggests something different.",
