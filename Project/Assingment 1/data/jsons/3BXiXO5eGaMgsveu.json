After four days , Yeefoon had to shut down again in the face of a COVID-19 resurgence in Texas and lay off two of the four workers he 'd brought back . ( AP Photo/LM Otero )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 The reopening of Tucson \u2019 s historic Hotel Congress lasted less than a month .\nGeneral manager Todd Hanley on June 4 ended a two-month coronavirus lockdown and reopened the 39-room hotel at half-capacity , along with an adjoining restaurant for outdoor dining . Yet with reported COVID-19 cases spiking across Arizona , Hanley made the painful decision last weekend to give up , for now .\n\u201c We are closing everything , \u201d he said . \u201c We are going to live to fight another day . \u2019 \u2019\nThe move means that once again , most of Hanley \u2019 s employees will lose their jobs , at least temporarily . Except for roughly a dozen who are needed to maintain the century-old property , more than 50 workers he had recalled will be laid off for a second time .\nA resurgence of confirmed COVID cases across the South and West \u2014 and the suspension or reversal of re-openings of bars , hotels , restaurants and other businesses \u2014 is endangering hopes for an economic rebound in the region and perhaps nationally . At stake are the jobs of millions of people who have clung to hopes that their layoffs from widespread business shutdowns this spring would prove short-lived .\nOn Thursday , the government is expected to issue another robust monthly jobs report . Economists have forecast that employers added 3 million jobs in June , on top of 2.5 million added in May , clawing back a portion of the record-high 21 million that vanished in April at the height of the viral shutdowns .\nYet any such news might already be outdated : The jobs report won \u2019 t fully capture the impact of the COVID upsurge in the South and West and the desperate steps being pursued to try to control it . The re-closings of restaurants and bars , and resulting job cuts , mark an about-face from what appear to have been premature efforts to restart the economy before the pandemic had been contained .\n\u201c We \u2019 re still in a very deep hole , \u201d said Diane Swonk , chief economist at the firm Grant Thornton . \u201c This makes the June employment report backward-looking instead of forward-looking . \u2019 \u2019\nEager to jump-start their economies , governors in several states across the Sun Belt had lifted their lockdowns before their states had met reopening guidelines that were set \u2014 yet largely shrugged off \u2014 by the White House .\nReported infections quickly spiked . From April 9 to June 8 , the five-day daily average of confirmed new cases had dropped from 32,150 to below 19,400 . Then it began rising again , surging past the April level to nearly 42,100 on Sunday before dipping to 41,000 on Monday . The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested , and studies suggest that people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick .\nThe governors began to backtrack . Texas Gov . Greg Abbott last week ordered all bars closed . Arizona Gov . Doug Ducey told residents to stay home and declared that the state was \u201c on pause \u201d as the COVID cases stacked up . Florida also banned alcohol consumption at its bars .\nKylie Davis , a 23-year-old bartender in Tampa , Florida , had returned to work May 23 after two months without a job , struggling to collect unemployment benefits from Florida \u2019 s backlogged system . The tips , she said , were good .\n\u201c People were so understanding , \u201d she said , \u201c that we had been out of work for a while and were extremely generous . \u201d\nYet after a few weeks , Davis was coughing and exhausted and had lost her sense of taste and smell . On June 12 , she tested positive for the virus and couldn \u2019 t return to work when Florida bars reopened . Neither , it turns out , could many others . As Florida \u2019 s reported cases spiked to record highs the past two weeks , with 9,000 cases recorded in one day last week , Gov . Ron DeSantis ordered bars to shut down again .\nAnd just like that , Davis and others found themselves unemployed for the second time this year .\nThe jarring reversal underscores what many economists had been stressing for months : That the economy and the job market can \u2019 t regain their health until business shutdowns have lasted long enough to reduce infections and most Americans feel confident enough to return to restaurants , bars , hotels , shopping malls and airports .\nIn the meantime , a resurgence of cases and re-closings of businesses is increasingly evident . The data firm Womply found that the proportion of bars that are closed in Texas , Florida , Tennessee and some other states started climbing last week after having declined fairly steadily since April or early May .\nIn many cases , it seems , customers themselves , rather than government edict , have driven that trend . A study by Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson of the University of Chicago found that Americans chose to stay home or avoid crowded stores this spring not so much because authorities told them to as out of fear stemming from reports of COVID deaths . Their study used cellphone data to track consumer traffic .\n\u201c It is the virus , not lockdowns , that dictates the course of the economy , \u201d said Yongseok Shin , an economist at Washington University and a research fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis . \u201c We can not have a full economic recovery without reining in the epidemic .\n\u201c We were worried about a second wave in the fall , but it now appears that we may have one very long wave . With the number of new cases high and rising , people will be slow to return to normal activities for fear of infection , and businesses will delay hiring and investment , lockdown or no lockdown . \u201d\nEven before Texas \u2019 s governor shut down bars in the states again last week , Michael Neff had decided to re-close his , the Cottonmouth Club in Houston . In March , Neff had initially closed the Cottonmouth and laid off his 10 employees . Late last month , he reopened . He brought back two employees with precautions \u2014 requiring customers to wear masks except when seated , eliminating bar seating , developing a contactless menu and erecting a barrier at the bar \u2019 s entrance .\nIt didn \u2019 t work . After being cooped up for months , bar-goers appeared in no mood for social distancing , especially when they could visit other bars with fewer restrictions . Employees at the Cottonmouth were spending most of their time monitoring customers \u2019 behavior .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t create an environment people want to be in if you are scolding them the whole time , \u201d Neff said .\nThen he began hearing of bars where the entire staff had tested positive for the coronavirus . Two weeks ago , Neff decided to shut down again on his own .\n\u201c We couldn \u2019 t just be a magical COVID-free zone , \u201d he said .\nFinancially , it has been difficult . But Neff said his landlord has allowed him to pay what he can so far .\nLikewise , Omar Yeefoon reopened his Dallas restaurant June 10 to \u201c a pretty good reception , \u201d after having been shuttered for three months . The comeback was fleeting . After four days , Yeefoon had to shut down again in the face of a COVID-19 resurgence in Texas and lay off two of the four workers he \u2019 d brought back .\n\u201c People \u2019 s minds \u2014 they still don \u2019 t feel comfortable , \u201d Yeefoon said . \u201c Psychologically , forcing this reopening and forcing everyone to go out -- I don \u2019 t know how it is playing out ... We in Texas have not been doing this right . \u201d\nSome business people have voiced frustration over the often contradictory and evolving directives from government authorities and by the impossible situation the virus has put them in .\n\u201c You open too soon , and people die , \u201d said Dawn Nielsen , chief operating officer at Kolache Factory , which has 27 bakeries mostly around Houston . \u201c You don \u2019 t open soon enough , and businesses die . \u2019 \u2019\nKolache Factory had reopened dining rooms for two weeks , then shut them back down on June 19 and returned to takeout and delivery only .\nThe re-closings are complicating prospects for a enduring economic recovery from the sudden and deep U.S. economic downturn . In a worst-case scenario , economists at IHS Markit warn , after a brief rebound , the economy could slip back into recession by the end of the year .\nEconomists Mark Vitner and Charlie Dougherty at Wells Fargo Securities note that the uptick in reported viral cases is occurring in cities like Dallas , Houston and Atlanta that have accounted for a disproportionate share of economic growth in recent years .\n\u201c The second-half economic recovery will be weaker and more sluggish than what we hoped for , \u201d Shin of Washington University said , \u201c precisely because we failed to contain the epidemic as effectively as we should have . \u2019 \u2019\nLoller reported from Nashville , Tennessee , and Kennedy from Fort Lauderdale , Florida .
