When it ended , the two men spoke warmly of each other , and Trump even said he was prepared to tweak NAFTA instead of withdrawing from it .\nBut on Thursday , Trudeau seemed particularly aggrieved by the national-security grounds on which the Trump administration imposed the tariffs . He said Canada was America \u2019 s \u201c most steadfast ally \u201d in war and peace , calling the tariffs \u201c an affront to the \u2026 thousands of Canadians who have fought and died alongside American comrades-in-arms. \u201d But what he said next perhaps illustrates just how poor relations between the two neighbors have become .\n\u201c In closing , I want to be very clear about one thing : Americans remain our partners , friends , and allies . This is not about the American people . We have to believe that at some point their common sense will prevail , \u201d he said in the type of language that successive U.S. administrations have used to describe recalcitrant regimes such as Iran . \u201c But we see no sign of that in this action today by the U.S. administration . \u201d\nTrump fired back in a statement late Thursday : \u201c The United States has been taken advantage of for many decades on trade .
