That night Cynthia informed Louie that because of this decision she had made , she would not divorce him .\nLouie was thrilled . Though he was skeptical of her religious experience , he began to see changes in her .\nCynthia begged Louie to go with her to the meetings but he refused . As Cynthia and her neighbors prayed , Louie relented and finally agreed to attend .\nSitting under the big tent , Louie shifted in his chair as my father said , \u201c There \u2019 s a drowning man , a drowning woman , a drowning boy or girl lost in the sea of life . \u201d\nLouie grew angry and bolted out of the tent vowing to never return .\nFor days Cynthia begged him to go back .

It was this life-changing moment that blotted out the nightmares and years of torment .\nJesus Christ has the power not only to save souls but to change lives . Louie Zamperini is an example of a life that changed instantly .\nWhen he returned home from the meeting he poured his liquor down the drain , dumped his girlie magazines in the trash , and crumpled up his cigarettes and disposed of them .\nHe found a Bible that had been issued by the air corps and began reading . For the first time God \u2019 s Word began to make sense to him .\nThis former prisoner of war had discovered the joy of freedom found in Christ and desired to pass it on to others .\nHe opened Victory Boys Camp to help troubled boys , many who were renewed and reformed , enabling them to live productive lives .\nWhile Jolie \u2019 s movie offers us a glimpse into much of Louie Zamperini \u2019 s life , only eternity will reveal \u201c the rest of the story . \u201d",
