The \u2588\u2588\u2588 has initiated a counter-notification requesting that the videos be reinstated on fair use grounds since the videos are the subject of a news report . The Free Beacon has moved the videos to another video platform and reinserted them into the original story while the dispute is settled by Youtube .\nThe videos feature two interviews from Fed Up where the producers of the film are accused of unethical editing techniques .
