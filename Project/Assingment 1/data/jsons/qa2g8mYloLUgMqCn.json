Many wore black , the unofficial uniform of these demonstrations . They carried signs and decorated the walls and floors with messages explaining why they \u2019 re rallying , disrupting the transit hub . Some taped bandages to their eyes , dripping with red ink to represent the injury to a female volunteer medic after she was hit with a beanbag round , allegedly fired by police during a protest earlier in August .\nThe airport protests encapsulated months of turmoil in Hong Kong . Weekly demonstrations and sit-ins have at times turned tense and violent when police arrive spraying tear gas and rubber bullets .\nWhat began as a targeted protest against a controversial extradition bill in June has transformed into what feels like a battle for the future of Hong Kong . Protesters are not just fighting their local government . They \u2019 re challenging one of the most powerful countries on earth : China .\n\u201c How this is going to play out is really hard to say , \u201d Victoria Hui , a professor of political science at University of Notre Dame , told me . \u201c But Hong Kong will definitely never be the same . \u201d\nProtesters have sustained the demonstrations for 12 weeks , making it hard to keep track of all the developments . Here \u2019 s a guide to the unrest in Hong Kong : how it started , what it \u2019 s all about , and why China is so worried about it .\nHong Kong is a special administrative region of the People \u2019 s Republic of China . It \u2019 s located on the southern coast and borders the Chinese province of Guangdong .\nThe British took over Hong Kong in the 1840s during the Opium Wars , and ruled the territory \u2014 with the exception of a brief occupation by the Japanese during World War II \u2014 for the next century and a half .\nThe British government , in 1898 , signed what was basically a 99-year lease for the territory , set to expire in 1997 . As that date started to move closer , both governments tried to work out a deal .\nIn 1984 , after lengthy negotiations , British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping signed a Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong . Britain agreed to return the territory to China on July 1 , 1997 , on the promise that China would give Hong Kong a \u201c high degree of autonomy \u201d for 50 years , until 2047 .\nFormally , Hong Kong became a \u201c special administration region \u201d of the People \u2019 s Republic of China . The deal : China wouldn \u2019 t impose its government on Hong Kong , and Hong Kong \u2019 s \u201c previous capitalist system and life-styles \u201d would remain unchanged for that 50-year period . The setup became known as the \u201c one country , two systems \u201d rule .\nUnder this arrangement , Hong Kong could maintain its economic and trade policies , designed to protect Hong Kong \u2019 s status as an international financial capital . It gave Hong Kong its own judicial , executive , and legislative powers . And , as Thatcher put it at the time , it \u201c preserves Hong Kong \u2019 s familiar legal system and the rights and freedoms enjoyed there. \u201d That included freedom of the press , assembly , and religious beliefs , among other rights .\nDespite the Joint Declaration \u2019 s guarantee of autonomy , which is also codified in Hong Kong \u2019 s Basic Law ( the closest thing it has to a constitution ) , in practice , the line between the two systems has become blurrier , with the Chinese government in Beijing attempting to exert more control .\nOne expert I spoke to called aspects of Hong Kong \u2019 s government \u201c hideously complicated , \u201d but to understand some of the protesters \u2019 demands , it \u2019 s worth going over the basics .\nThe Joint Declaration and Hong Kong \u2019 s Basic Law say that Hong Kong is supposed to administer itself . But the arrangement also gives China the power to appoint Hong Kong \u2019 s chief executive , \u201c on the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s how that works in practice : An election committee , currently of about 1,200 people , votes and selects the chief executive , who serves a five-year term . The catch ? The committee is stocked with Beijing loyalists , which means whoever wins is more or less the candidate Beijing wants to win .\nBut Hong Kong \u2019 s Basic Law goes a bit further , and says that the \u201c ultimate aim \u201d is to elect the chief executive through \u201c universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee . \u201d\nFor pro-democracy activists , this means one person , one vote . Beijing said in 2007 that it would grant universal suffrage in 2017 . But in 2014 , Beijing said , sure , you can have universal suffrage , but the candidates have to be chosen by a nominating committee . Oh , and China gets to pick who \u2019 s on that committee .\n\u201c Now you can sort of see where the problem is at this point , \u201d Alvin Y.H . Cheung , an affiliated scholar at NYU \u2019 s US-Asia Law Institute , told me . \u201c If Beijing can control who gets nominated that isn \u2019 t going to result in any meaningful choice . \u201d\nPro-democracy advocates were furious and took to the streets in what would become the 2014 Umbrella Revolution .\nThe Hong Kong legislature ultimately rejected Beijing \u2019 s version of voting reform . So in 2017 , for its chief executive elections , Hong Kong stuck with the electoral committee of about 1,200 members , most of whom are loyal to Beijing .\nCarrie Lam , the current chief executive , won . She was Beijing \u2019 s preferred candidate .\nThe pro-democracy uprising that has rocked Hong Kong for the past several months began as a protest against proposed amendments to Hong Kong \u2019 s extradition law .\nThe amendments were prompted by the gruesome case of a Hong Kong man who was accused of strangling his pregnant girlfriend and stuffing her body in a suitcase while they were in Taiwan in 2018 . The suspect , Chan Tong-kai , fled back to Hong Kong . And because Hong Kong doesn \u2019 t have a formal extradition treaty with Taiwan , he couldn \u2019 t be sent back to face trial .\nThe Hong Kong government seized on this case and used it as the rationale to propose amendments that would allow case-by-case extraditions to countries that lack formal extradition treaties with Hong Kong .\nNotably , that would include mainland China , a country that arbitrarily imprisons its citizens if they displease the government .\nCritics worried that China would take advantage of this law to arbitrarily detain Hongkongers \u2014 such as those who openly dissent against the Chinese government or advocate for human rights . One pro-democracy lawmaker called it a \u201c dragnet over all of Hong Kong . \u201d\nThe amendments would apply retroactively , meaning thousands of people who may have angered mainland China with a supposed past crime could be at risk of facing trial there .\nThe extradition rule changes were particularly fraught because China is accused of kidnapping people from outside its borders \u2014 including from Hong Kong , where it isn \u2019 t supposed to have jurisdiction \u2014 and essentially disappearing them to China . That would normally violate international law . But this bill would give China legal cover to do so .\nExperts say that \u2019 s what this extradition bill is really about : an attempt by Beijing to exert more control over Hong Kong . Jerome A. Cohen , an Asia expert at the Council on Foreign Relations , called the Taiwan murder case that prompted these amendments a \u201c phony excuse . \u201d\n\u201c Everybody knew \u2014 who paid attention to it \u2014 [ that ] this was a long-overdue effort to extradite people from Hong Kong to China , \u201d Cohen said on a conference call with reporters on August 14 .\nThe proposed extradition law changes first prompted protests in March and April , and in May , pro-democracy and pro-Beijing lawmakers literally came to blows over the bill on the floor of Hong Kong \u2019 s legislature . In response , the government added some concessions to the bill , such as limiting the extraditable offenses . Critics weren \u2019 t satisfied .\n\u201c This is the last stand in the sense that once the extradition bill is passed , there is no more protection of Hong Kong against mainland China \u2019 s criminal system , \u201d Hui , the Notre Dame professor , said . \u201c It is the last step \u2014 this is really the last step in a whole series of erosions of Hong Kong \u2019 s autonomy since 1997 . \u201d\nThe protest movement really took off in early June . On June 9 , as many as a million people in Hong Kong peacefully protested against the bill as Lam prepared to push it through Hong Kong \u2019 s legislature .\nThat huge show of opposition \u2014 as much as one-seventh of Hong Kong \u2019 s entire population demonstrated \u2014 did not persuade Lam to back down . She insisted on moving ahead .\nOn June 12 , protesters swarmed the area near Hong Kong \u2019 s legislature , delaying the debate that would have effectively allowed for the speedy passage of the proposed extradition law amendments . These protests were met with violence , with police firing tear gas , rubber bullets , and beanbags at the crowds .\nThe police \u2019 s use of force \u2014 and their decision to call the protesters \u201c rioters \u201d and arrest some on rioting charges , which carries severe penalties \u2014 created a rift between the people and the police .\nThat fracture helped transform the protests against the extradition bill into a larger movement against the Hong Kong government and police abuses , leading to calls for an independent police investigation and Lam \u2019 s resignation .\nAfter the huge protests on June 12 , Lam \u201c indefinitely suspended \u201d the bill that would have amended the extradition law .\nBut her decision to put the bill on pause didn \u2019 t satisfy many in Hong Kong who saw it as nothing more than a standard delay tactic . \u201c She is trying to delay and hope Hong Kong people forget , \u201d Tim , a 26-year-old finance professional in Hong Kong , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 via WhatsApp at the time . The move prompted another round of protests that drew an estimated 2 million people , the largest show of opposition yet .\nLam still has not formally withdrawn the extradition bill . Her stance led to a somewhat viral moment on August 13 when a Reuters reporter asked her if she actually had the power to withdraw the bill . \u201c In other words , have your hands been tied by Beijing in not allowing the bill to be withdrawn ? \u201d\nThe protests have continued since June ; last week , hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets of Hong Kong . The rallies continued for a 12th consecutive week , including with a demonstration on Sunday that veered into violence as police fired water cannons and tear gas at protesters . Demonstrators thew Molotov cocktails and bricks . One Hong Kong officer fired live ammunition , a warning shot likely to exacerbate tensions between protesters and police .\nA few of the protests have stood out . On July 1 , the anniversary of the British handover of Hong Kong , protesters stormed and vandalized the Legislative Council . On July 21 , men in white shirts armed with clubs and sticks attacked people wearing black ( the uniform of the protesters ) in a transit station ; activists accused police of being slow to respond and , in some instances , seeming a bit too chummy with the assailants . Many believed the attackers were affiliated with the notorious triads , Hong Kong \u2019 s mafia-like gangs that often do the bidding of Beijing .\nA city-wide strike shut down transportation in Hong Kong on August 6 . On August 8 , protesters put on a fun laser show after police arrested a student for purchasing threatening lasers .\nOn August 11 , a woman believed to be a volunteer medic was hit in the eye with a beanbag round fired by police ; she has since become a symbol of police brutality , and protesters started wearing gauze eye patches , often stained with blood-red ink , and chanting \u201c An eye for an eye ! \u201d\nPolice also have been accused of going undercover and disguising themselves as protesters , which many saw as an attempt to sow suspicion and distrust within the mostly leaderless movement , where demonstrators carefully guard their anonymity .\nOn August 12 and 13 , demonstrators took over the Hong Kong airport , occupying terminals and plastering signs on the walls and floors explaining why they were protesting to travelers ; some also apologized for disrupting flights . The action led to mass flight cancellations at the airport , gaining worldwide attention \u2014 and ended with yet more police clashes .\nThe Hong Kong protesters have five specific demands . The first one remains getting rid of the extradition bill for good .\nThe second is that the government retract its use of the word \u201c riot \u201d to classify the protests . Rioting carries specific penalties \u2014 up to 10 years in jail \u2014 and demonstrators reject the term because they say it gives police cover to use heavy-handed tactics against peaceful protesters .\nThat ties into their third demand , which is that the police release all protesters who have been arrested and drop any charges that have been brought against demonstrators .\nDemand number four calls on the government to convene a serious , independent inquiry into the Hong Kong police and their tactics .\nAnd fifth , protesters are demanding universal suffrage \u2014 not Beijing \u2019 s version , but a legitimate opportunity for Hongkongers to democratically choose their leaders .\n6 ) How much support do the protesters have in Hong Kong ?\nThis is not an easy question to answer . I \u2019 ve spoken to experts , activists , and protesters , and they say it \u2019 s difficult to fully gauge the level of support across the city .\nFamilies and friends are split on whether the protests are good or bad . Some are concerned about their impact on Hong Kong \u2019 s economy and believe disruptive protests may hurt its status as an attractive financial capital . Some sympathize with the aims of the protesters but not always with their tactics , such as defacing the legislative building .\nA substantial portion of the protesters are students and young professionals in their late teens and 20s who were born around the time of the 1997 handover . They \u2019 re afraid the Hong Kong they \u2019 ve grown up with , and its distinct culture and traditions and special freedoms , are slipping away . What \u2019 s more , they \u2019 re starting to realize that 2047 \u2014 the year Hong Kong \u2019 s special status is set to expire under the original agreement between China and Britain \u2014 is not as distant as it once seemed .\nBut the protests are not limited to just young people . At least 2 million people attended one protest in June , out of Hong Kong \u2019 s 7 million residents . Again , last weekend , nearly 2 million joined peaceful protests , despite a police ban and pouring rain . Trade unions have gone on strike in solidarity . After the volunteer medic was shot in the eye with a beanbag round by police , about 200 doctors , nurses , and paramedics gathered in protest , many wearing bandages in solidarity .\nIn August , bankers held a demonstration in Hong Kong \u2019 s central business district , which they called \u201c Freedom lose , market snooze . \u201d\nThat said , the movement certainly has its detractors . In late July , tens of thousands of demonstrators , \u201c mostly middle-aged or older , \u201d took to the streets of Hong Kong in a pro-police rally , calling for an end to the violence , according to Reuters . \u201c Some waved Chinese flags as others chanted \u2018 Hong Kong Cheer Up \u2019 and \u2018 Support Hong Kong Police \u2019 , \u201d Reuters reported .\nAdditional , sporadic pro-police protests have occurred in the weeks since , particularly in more conservative , pro-Beijing , working-class neighborhoods , but they typically only draw a few hundred people at most .\nSome of Hong Kong \u2019 s ultrarich business tycoons are also growing weary of the protests and the disruption ( read : loss of profits ) they \u2019 re causing . Hong Kong \u2019 s wealthiest man , a 91-year-old business magnate reportedly worth $ 27 billion , took out full front-page ads in several local newspapers calling on both the protesters and the authorities in Beijing to end the violence .\nCompanies are also coming under increased pressure from China to oppose the protests and side with the Hong Kong government \u2014 and with Beijing .\nIn one of the most visible cases , after employees of the Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways reportedly participated in pro-democracy demonstrations , Chinese government regulators demanded that the airline prohibit any of its employees who had taken part from doing any work involving flights to mainland China .\nRegulators also \u201c ordered that the airline begin submitting information about all crew members flying to \u2014 or above \u2014 the mainland to the Chinese authorities for prior approval , \u201d according to the New York Times . The company moved to comply , but it evidently wasn \u2019 t enough for Beijing , and pressure continued to mount \u2014 ultimately leading the company \u2019 s CEO to resign .\n7 ) Why does China care so much about these protests ?\nChina has taken an increasingly hard line against Hong Kong \u2019 s protests because it sees them as a threat to its growing influence in the territory .\nAfter 1997 , China mostly respected Hong Kong \u2019 s autonomy because Hong Kong contributed tremendously to China \u2019 s economy \u2014 about 27 percent of its GDP in the 1990s , and about 3 percent today . China is eager to invest in the mainland now , so Hong Kong has lost a bit of its shield to Beijing influence .\nSo China has tried to bring Hong Kong closer and closer into its orbit . It wants Hong Kong to embrace the country \u2019 s ruling Communist Party and not care so much about those pesky freedoms Hong Kong citizens love so much . It wants Hong Kong to speak mainland China \u2019 s official language , Mandarin , instead of Cantonese . And it doesn \u2019 t want Hong Kong to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre , which it does each year , as the only place in China allowed to do so .\nThe protests are proof that Beijing \u2019 s plan has fallen short . Not only is the territory fighting Beijing \u2019 s encroachment , but Hong Kong citizens \u2019 sense of connection to mainland China has diminished since the 1997 handover , according to public opinion polls .\nThe protests aren \u2019 t likely to convince China that it has overstepped in trying to curb Hong Kong \u2019 s autonomy ; instead , they \u2019 re taken as a sign that China hasn \u2019 t tried hard enough . The protests have also gained world attention and press that the Chinese government absolutely doesn \u2019 t want .\nChina also really doesn \u2019 t want such unrest to spread , or set a possible precedent for citizens in the mainland . Beijing has stepped up its disinformation campaign in response and closely censored what the rest of China sees and hears about the protests \u2014 which is that the demonstrators are disgruntled rioters and CIA props .\nThe leaders in Beijing may have initially hoped that the demonstrations would fizzle out , but now that they haven \u2019 t , they \u2019 re likely trying to figure out options for how to stop them .\nChina first responded to the protests by pretty much pretending that they didn \u2019 t exist . Instead of covering the storming of the Legislative Council in July , for instance , China \u2019 s state-controlled media showed propaganda celebrating the 1997 handover .\nBut that \u2019 s changed as the protests have gone on , and China \u2019 s rhetoric \u2014 and disinformation campaign \u2014 has been intensifying in recent weeks . Chinese state-run media is now actively promoting the idea that the protesters are rioters or \u201c paid provocateurs \u201d and actively misrepresenting footage to denigrate the protesters . Last week , both Facebook and Twitter said they found accounts originating in China spreading false news about the Hong Kong protests .\nAfter the protester was shot in the eye earlier this month , China showed a video of a protester accepting cash , trying to make the point that the entire incident was fake \u2014 when in fact it was the Chinese video that was fake .\nChina is also claiming that the West , specifically the US and the CIA , is trying to foment unrest in Hong Kong by paying protesters . ( It seems some in the Communist Party might actually believe that conspiracy theory . )\nEspecially troubling is China \u2019 s increasingly harsh rhetoric toward the protesters . After the airport protests , China called the protesters \u2019 actions \u201c near terrorism. \u201d China has also moved thousands of paramilitary police to the city of Shenzhen , just across the border with Hong Kong , and state-run media has released videos of tanks amassing there .\nThe message Beijing seems to be sending to protesters right now is \u201c Go home or else . \u201d\nChina may be choosing its language very carefully to lay the groundwork for a potential intervention .\nThere are two scenarios under which China can send its armed forces \u2014 the People \u2019 s Liberation Army , or PLA \u2014 into Hong Kong . ( China does have about 6,000 troops permanently stationed in Hong Kong . ) The Hong Kong government can request assistance from China to help maintain order , essentially admitting it has lost control of the city . The second is if China \u2019 s National People \u2019 s Congress standing committee \u2014 the powerful , permanent body of the National People \u2019 s Congress , the national legislature \u2014 either declares war or a state of emergency in Hong Kong .\n\u201c China \u2019 s rhetoric \u2014 calling what \u2019 s been going on in Hong Kong \u2018 riots , \u2019 \u2018 counterrevolution , \u2019 or \u2018 terrorism \u2019 \u2014 it \u2019 s essentially paving the way for it using that clause , \u201d Victoria Hui , the expert at the University of Notre Dame , said .\nChina has also amassed troops and tanks across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzen , and has released videos of the armed forces doing drills . Taken together , China may be signaling that it \u2019 s prepared to act .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean it will . Experts I spoke to cautioned that it \u2019 s impossible to say what China will do , but it would be a dramatic , unpredictable escalation if China intervene in Hong Kong . Just the idea of it has comparisons to China \u2019 s Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 .\nFor one , although Hong Kong may not be as economically influential as it once was , it \u2019 s still seen as the \u201c gateway to the China \u201d and a global commercial and financial capital . A forceful Chinese intervention would disrupt the city \u2019 s economy far more than the protests already have . China \u2019 s economy isn \u2019 t doing so well right now , either , which means its leaders are probably hesitant to cause serious financial harm , even if Hong Kong only accounts for about 3 percent of its total economy now .\nSuch action could potentially result in loss of life , which would likely anger Hongkongers even more . It would also immediately draw international condemnation ( although maybe not much more than that ) , and China , and specifically President Xi Jinping , isn \u2019 t totally immune to such things .\nIt \u2019 s also important to note that a key date is coming up : October 1 , 2019 , the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People \u2019 s Republic of China . It \u2019 s a bad look to crush a popular movement if you \u2019 re trying to celebrate the greatness of your country .\nOn the other hand , it doesn \u2019 t look good to have an entire city spending weeks leading up to your anniversary challenging your authority and risking their safety for democracy . Some analysts and protesters think China might want to go ahead and intervene before the October 1 date ; others think China may show restraint as the world watches .\nPresident Xi \u201c wants increasing prestige and [ to ] show the world he \u2019 s achieving the Chinese dream ; using force would show the Chinese dream is a nightmare , \u201d Cohen , at the Council on Foreign Relations , told reporters .\nThe response of the international community has been somewhat lackluster so far .\nThe United States , purported to be a supporter of democracy around the world , hasn \u2019 t taken a particularly strong stance . The State Department has called on China to honor the \u201c one country , two systems \u201d rule , and a State Department spokesperson in August called China a \u201c thuggish \u201d regime after it released personal information for a US consular official who met with Hong Kong protesters , which China used as propaganda to show foreign meddling .\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has dismissed such allegations of US interference as \u201c ludicrous. \u201d He also said in interviews last week that China should respect the rights of Hong Kong and that \u201c something like Tiananmen Square \u201d in Hong Kong could jeopardize a trade deal . National Security Adviser John Bolton has also warned against a \u201c new \u201d Tiananmen Square .\nSome Congress members , including Sen. Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) , have raised concerns about the extradition bill and China \u2019 s actions . Lawmakers have introduced the Hong Kong Freedom and Democracy Act , which would \u201c renew the United States \u2019 historical commitment to freedom and democracy in Hong Kong at a time when its autonomy is increasingly under assault . \u201d\nBut the more forceful condemnation doesn \u2019 t match up with the president \u2019 s rhetoric . President Trump has made some vague statements that he hopes the situation \u201c works out for everybody , including China , by the way , \u201d and he \u2019 s sent some alarmist tweets about military amassing at the Hong Kong border . But he \u2019 s mostly just made the whole thing about himself , complaining on Twitter that \u201c many are blaming me , and the United States , for the problems going on in Hong Kong . I can \u2019 t imagine why ? \u201d\nTrump did say earlier this month that he was concerned about Hong Kong , but then suggested that if Xi \u201c sat down with the protesters , he \u2019 d work it out in 15 minutes , \u201d seemingly unaware of how Xi , the Chinese government , authoritarianism , or protests work .\nPart of the president \u2019 s hands-off approach to the situation in Hong Kong almost certainly has to do with his desire to make a trade deal with China and end the trade war before the 2020 election . If that means he has to ignore sensitive subjects like Hong Kong ( and China \u2019 s repression of its Uighur Muslim minority ) to cut a deal with Xi , then so be it .\nThe United Kingdom also has a historic stake in Hong Kong , as it negotiated the joint declaration with Beijing that preserved Hong Kong \u2019 s autonomy in the first place . But the UK is dealing with its own political crisis right now in Brexit , and if the UK does break up with the European Union , it \u2019 s not going to want to totally risk isolating China and its economy .\nCanada and the European Union have also released statements condemning violence against protesters .\nHongkongers have also put their hopes on the international community getting involved . In June , during the G20 , activists took out full-page ads in newspapers in 10 countries , pleading for international backing . Hong Kong protesters have also waved American flags at protesters , and sung the US national anthem , part celebration of democratic ideals , part appeal to the United States .\nCalls for international support for Hong Kong \u2019 s democracy have been mostly met with silence . But the tens of thousands of protesters who continue to flood the streets of Hong Kong week after week refuse to be silent , even if no one else will stand up on their behalf .\nHong Kong ramped up its protests and China ramped up its propaganda machine .

    "content_original": "9 questions about the Hong Kong protests you were too embarrassed to ask\n\nShare All sharing options for: 9 questions about the Hong Kong protests you were too embarrassed to ask\n\nProtesters filled Hong Kong International airport two weeks ago. Many wore black, the unofficial uniform of these demonstrations. They carried signs and decorated the walls and floors with messages explaining why they\u2019re rallying, disrupting the transit hub. Some taped bandages to their eyes, dripping with red ink to represent the injury to a female volunteer medic after she was hit with a beanbag round, allegedly fired by police during a protest earlier in August.\n\nThe airport protests encapsulated months of turmoil in Hong Kong. Weekly demonstrations and sit-ins have at times turned tense and violent when police arrive spraying tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nWhat began as a targeted protest against a controversial extradition bill in June has transformed into what feels like a battle for the future of Hong Kong. Protesters are not just fighting their local government. They\u2019re challenging one of the most powerful countries on earth: China.\n\n\u201cHow this is going to play out is really hard to say,\u201d Victoria Hui, a professor of political science at University of Notre Dame, told me. \u201cBut Hong Kong will definitely never be the same.\u201d\n\nProtesters have sustained the demonstrations for 12 weeks, making it hard to keep track of all the developments. Here\u2019s a guide to the unrest in Hong Kong: how it started, what it\u2019s all about, and why China is so worried about it.\n\n1) What is Hong Kong?\n\nHong Kong is a special administrative region of the People\u2019s Republic of China. It\u2019s located on the southern coast and borders the Chinese province of Guangdong.\n\nThe British took over Hong Kong in the 1840s during the Opium Wars, and ruled the territory \u2014 with the exception of a brief occupation by the Japanese during World War II \u2014 for the next century and a half.\n\nThe British government, in 1898, signed what was basically a 99-year lease for the territory, set to expire in 1997. As that date started to move closer, both governments tried to work out a deal.\n\nIn 1984, after lengthy negotiations, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping signed a Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong. Britain agreed to return the territory to China on July 1, 1997, on the promise that China would give Hong Kong a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d for 50 years, until 2047.\n\nFormally, Hong Kong became a \u201cspecial administration region\u201d of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The deal: China wouldn\u2019t impose its government on Hong Kong, and Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cprevious capitalist system and life-styles\u201d would remain unchanged for that 50-year period. The setup became known as the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d rule.\n\nUnder this arrangement, Hong Kong could maintain its economic and trade policies, designed to protect Hong Kong\u2019s status as an international financial capital. It gave Hong Kong its own judicial, executive, and legislative powers. And, as Thatcher put it at the time, it \u201cpreserves Hong Kong\u2019s familiar legal system and the rights and freedoms enjoyed there.\u201d That included freedom of the press, assembly, and religious beliefs, among other rights.\n\nDespite the Joint Declaration\u2019s guarantee of autonomy, which is also codified in Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law (the closest thing it has to a constitution), in practice, the line between the two systems has become blurrier, with the Chinese government in Beijing attempting to exert more control.\n\n2) How does Hong Kong\u2019s government work?\n\nOne expert I spoke to called aspects of Hong Kong\u2019s government \u201chideously complicated,\u201d but to understand some of the protesters\u2019 demands, it\u2019s worth going over the basics.\n\nThe Joint Declaration and Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law say that Hong Kong is supposed to administer itself. But the arrangement also gives China the power to appoint Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, \u201con the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how that works in practice: An election committee, currently of about 1,200 people, votes and selects the chief executive, who serves a five-year term. The catch? The committee is stocked with Beijing loyalists, which means whoever wins is more or less the candidate Beijing wants to win.\n\nBut Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law goes a bit further, and says that the \u201cultimate aim\u201d is to elect the chief executive through \u201cuniversal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee.\u201d\n\nFor pro-democracy activists, this means one person, one vote. Beijing said in 2007 that it would grant universal suffrage in 2017. But in 2014, Beijing said, sure, you can have universal suffrage, but the candidates have to be chosen by a nominating committee. Oh, and China gets to pick who\u2019s on that committee.\n\n\u201cNow you can sort of see where the problem is at this point,\u201d Alvin Y.H. Cheung, an affiliated scholar at NYU\u2019s US-Asia Law Institute, told me. \u201cIf Beijing can control who gets nominated that isn\u2019t going to result in any meaningful choice.\u201d\n\nPro-democracy advocates were furious and took to the streets in what would become the 2014 Umbrella Revolution.\n\nThe Hong Kong legislature ultimately rejected Beijing\u2019s version of voting reform. So in 2017, for its chief executive elections, Hong Kong stuck with the electoral committee of about 1,200 members, most of whom are loyal to Beijing.\n\nCarrie Lam, the current chief executive, won. She was Beijing\u2019s preferred candidate.\n\n3) Why did the Hong Kong protests start?\n\nThe pro-democracy uprising that has rocked Hong Kong for the past several months began as a protest against proposed amendments to Hong Kong\u2019s extradition law.\n\nThe amendments were prompted by the gruesome case of a Hong Kong man who was accused of strangling his pregnant girlfriend and stuffing her body in a suitcase while they were in Taiwan in 2018. The suspect, Chan Tong-kai, fled back to Hong Kong. And because Hong Kong doesn\u2019t have a formal extradition treaty with Taiwan, he couldn\u2019t be sent back to face trial.\n\nThe Hong Kong government seized on this case and used it as the rationale to propose amendments that would allow case-by-case extraditions to countries that lack formal extradition treaties with Hong Kong.\n\nNotably, that would include mainland China, a country that arbitrarily imprisons its citizens if they displease the government.\n\nCritics worried that China would take advantage of this law to arbitrarily detain Hongkongers \u2014 such as those who openly dissent against the Chinese government or advocate for human rights. One pro-democracy lawmaker called it a \u201cdragnet over all of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe amendments would apply retroactively, meaning thousands of people who may have angered mainland China with a supposed past crime could be at risk of facing trial there.\n\nThe extradition rule changes were particularly fraught because China is accused of kidnapping people from outside its borders \u2014 including from Hong Kong, where it isn\u2019t supposed to have jurisdiction \u2014 and essentially disappearing them to China. That would normally violate international law. But this bill would give China legal cover to do so.\n\nExperts say that\u2019s what this extradition bill is really about: an attempt by Beijing to exert more control over Hong Kong. Jerome A. Cohen, an Asia expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, called the Taiwan murder case that prompted these amendments a \u201cphony excuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody knew \u2014 who paid attention to it \u2014 [that] this was a long-overdue effort to extradite people from Hong Kong to China,\u201d Cohen said on a conference call with reporters on August 14.\n\nThe proposed extradition law changes first prompted protests in March and April, and in May, pro-democracy and pro-Beijing lawmakers literally came to blows over the bill on the floor of Hong Kong\u2019s legislature. In response, the government added some concessions to the bill, such as limiting the extraditable offenses. Critics weren\u2019t satisfied.\n\n\u201cThis is the last stand in the sense that once the extradition bill is passed, there is no more protection of Hong Kong against mainland China\u2019s criminal system,\u201d Hui, the Notre Dame professor, said. \u201cIt is the last step \u2014 this is really the last step in a whole series of erosions of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy since 1997.\u201d\n\nThe protest movement really took off in early June. On June 9, as many as a million people in Hong Kong peacefully protested against the bill as Lam prepared to push it through Hong Kong\u2019s legislature.\n\nThat huge show of opposition \u2014 as much as one-seventh of Hong Kong\u2019s entire population demonstrated \u2014 did not persuade Lam to back down. She insisted on moving ahead.\n\nOn June 12, protesters swarmed the area near Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, delaying the debate that would have effectively allowed for the speedy passage of the proposed extradition law amendments. These protests were met with violence, with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets, and beanbags at the crowds.\n\nThe police\u2019s use of force \u2014 and their decision to call the protesters \u201crioters\u201d and arrest some on rioting charges, which carries severe penalties \u2014 created a rift between the people and the police.\n\nThat fracture helped transform the protests against the extradition bill into a larger movement against the Hong Kong government and police abuses, leading to calls for an independent police investigation and Lam\u2019s resignation.\n\n4) How has the Hong Kong government responded?\n\nAfter the huge protests on June 12, Lam \u201cindefinitely suspended\u201d the bill that would have amended the extradition law.\n\nBut her decision to put the bill on pause didn\u2019t satisfy many in Hong Kong who saw it as nothing more than a standard delay tactic. \u201cShe is trying to delay and hope Hong Kong people forget,\u201d Tim, a 26-year-old finance professional in Hong Kong, told Vox via WhatsApp at the time. The move prompted another round of protests that drew an estimated 2 million people, the largest show of opposition yet.\n\nLam still has not formally withdrawn the extradition bill. Her stance led to a somewhat viral moment on August 13 when a Reuters reporter asked her if she actually had the power to withdraw the bill. \u201cIn other words, have your hands been tied by Beijing in not allowing the bill to be withdrawn?\u201d\n\nLam did not answer the question.\n\nThe protests have continued since June; last week, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets of Hong Kong. The rallies continued for a 12th consecutive week, including with a demonstration on Sunday that veered into violence as police fired water cannons and tear gas at protesters. Demonstrators thew Molotov cocktails and bricks. One Hong Kong officer fired live ammunition, a warning shot likely to exacerbate tensions between protesters and police.\n\nA few of the protests have stood out. On July 1, the anniversary of the British handover of Hong Kong, protesters stormed and vandalized the Legislative Council. On July 21, men in white shirts armed with clubs and sticks attacked people wearing black (the uniform of the protesters) in a transit station; activists accused police of being slow to respond and, in some instances, seeming a bit too chummy with the assailants. Many believed the attackers were affiliated with the notorious triads, Hong Kong\u2019s mafia-like gangs that often do the bidding of Beijing.\n\nA city-wide strike shut down transportation in Hong Kong on August 6. On August 8, protesters put on a fun laser show after police arrested a student for purchasing threatening lasers.\n\nOn August 11, a woman believed to be a volunteer medic was hit in the eye with a beanbag round fired by police; she has since become a symbol of police brutality, and protesters started wearing gauze eye patches, often stained with blood-red ink, and chanting \u201cAn eye for an eye!\u201d\n\nPolice also have been accused of going undercover and disguising themselves as protesters, which many saw as an attempt to sow suspicion and distrust within the mostly leaderless movement, where demonstrators carefully guard their anonymity.\n\nOn August 12 and 13, demonstrators took over the Hong Kong airport, occupying terminals and plastering signs on the walls and floors explaining why they were protesting to travelers; some also apologized for disrupting flights. The action led to mass flight cancellations at the airport, gaining worldwide attention \u2014 and ended with yet more police clashes.\n\n5) What do the Hong Kong protesters want now?\n\nThe Hong Kong protesters have five specific demands. The first one remains getting rid of the extradition bill for good.\n\nThe second is that the government retract its use of the word \u201criot\u201d to classify the protests. Rioting carries specific penalties \u2014 up to 10 years in jail \u2014 and demonstrators reject the term because they say it gives police cover to use heavy-handed tactics against peaceful protesters.\n\nThat ties into their third demand, which is that the police release all protesters who have been arrested and drop any charges that have been brought against demonstrators.\n\nDemand number four calls on the government to convene a serious, independent inquiry into the Hong Kong police and their tactics.\n\nAnd fifth, protesters are demanding universal suffrage \u2014 not Beijing\u2019s version, but a legitimate opportunity for Hongkongers to democratically choose their leaders.\n\n6) How much support do the protesters have in Hong Kong?\n\nThis is not an easy question to answer. I\u2019ve spoken to experts, activists, and protesters, and they say it\u2019s difficult to fully gauge the level of support across the city.\n\nFamilies and friends are split on whether the protests are good or bad. Some are concerned about their impact on Hong Kong\u2019s economy and believe disruptive protests may hurt its status as an attractive financial capital. Some sympathize with the aims of the protesters but not always with their tactics, such as defacing the legislative building.\n\nA substantial portion of the protesters are students and young professionals in their late teens and 20s who were born around the time of the 1997 handover. They\u2019re afraid the Hong Kong they\u2019ve grown up with, and its distinct culture and traditions and special freedoms, are slipping away. What\u2019s more, they\u2019re starting to realize that 2047 \u2014 the year Hong Kong\u2019s special status is set to expire under the original agreement between China and Britain \u2014 is not as distant as it once seemed.\n\nBut the protests are not limited to just young people. At least 2 million people attended one protest in June, out of Hong Kong\u2019s 7 million residents. Again, last weekend, nearly 2 million joined peaceful protests, despite a police ban and pouring rain. Trade unions have gone on strike in solidarity. After the volunteer medic was shot in the eye with a beanbag round by police, about 200 doctors, nurses, and paramedics gathered in protest, many wearing bandages in solidarity.\n\nIn August, bankers held a demonstration in Hong Kong\u2019s central business district, which they called \u201cFreedom lose, market snooze.\u201d\n\nThat said, the movement certainly has its detractors. In late July, tens of thousands of demonstrators, \u201cmostly middle-aged or older,\u201d took to the streets of Hong Kong in a pro-police rally, calling for an end to the violence, according to Reuters. \u201cSome waved Chinese flags as others chanted \u2018Hong Kong Cheer Up\u2019 and \u2018Support Hong Kong Police\u2019,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nAdditional, sporadic pro-police protests have occurred in the weeks since, particularly in more conservative, pro-Beijing, working-class neighborhoods, but they typically only draw a few hundred people at most.\n\nSome of Hong Kong\u2019s ultrarich business tycoons are also growing weary of the protests and the disruption (read: loss of profits) they\u2019re causing. Hong Kong\u2019s wealthiest man, a 91-year-old business magnate reportedly worth $27 billion, took out full front-page ads in several local newspapers calling on both the protesters and the authorities in Beijing to end the violence.\n\nCompanies are also coming under increased pressure from China to oppose the protests and side with the Hong Kong government \u2014 and with Beijing.\n\nIn one of the most visible cases, after employees of the Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways reportedly participated in pro-democracy demonstrations, Chinese government regulators demanded that the airline prohibit any of its employees who had taken part from doing any work involving flights to mainland China.\n\nRegulators also \u201cordered that the airline begin submitting information about all crew members flying to \u2014 or above \u2014 the mainland to the Chinese authorities for prior approval,\u201d according to the New York Times. The company moved to comply, but it evidently wasn\u2019t enough for Beijing, and pressure continued to mount \u2014 ultimately leading the company\u2019s CEO to resign.\n\n7) Why does China care so much about these protests?\n\nChina has taken an increasingly hard line against Hong Kong\u2019s protests because it sees them as a threat to its growing influence in the territory.\n\nAfter 1997, China mostly respected Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy because Hong Kong contributed tremendously to China\u2019s economy \u2014 about 27 percent of its GDP in the 1990s, and about 3 percent today. China is eager to invest in the mainland now, so Hong Kong has lost a bit of its shield to Beijing influence.\n\nSo China has tried to bring Hong Kong closer and closer into its orbit. It wants Hong Kong to embrace the country\u2019s ruling Communist Party and not care so much about those pesky freedoms Hong Kong citizens love so much. It wants Hong Kong to speak mainland China\u2019s official language, Mandarin, instead of Cantonese. And it doesn\u2019t want Hong Kong to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre, which it does each year, as the only place in China allowed to do so.\n\nThe protests are proof that Beijing\u2019s plan has fallen short. Not only is the territory fighting Beijing\u2019s encroachment, but Hong Kong citizens\u2019 sense of connection to mainland China has diminished since the 1997 handover, according to public opinion polls.\n\nThe protests aren\u2019t likely to convince China that it has overstepped in trying to curb Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy; instead, they\u2019re taken as a sign that China hasn\u2019t tried hard enough. The protests have also gained world attention and press that the Chinese government absolutely doesn\u2019t want.\n\nChina also really doesn\u2019t want such unrest to spread, or set a possible precedent for citizens in the mainland. Beijing has stepped up its disinformation campaign in response and closely censored what the rest of China sees and hears about the protests \u2014 which is that the demonstrators are disgruntled rioters and CIA props.\n\nThe leaders in Beijing may have initially hoped that the demonstrations would fizzle out, but now that they haven\u2019t, they\u2019re likely trying to figure out options for how to stop them.\n\n8) What is China going to do?\n\nChina first responded to the protests by pretty much pretending that they didn\u2019t exist. Instead of covering the storming of the Legislative Council in July, for instance, China\u2019s state-controlled media showed propaganda celebrating the 1997 handover.\n\nBut that\u2019s changed as the protests have gone on, and China\u2019s rhetoric \u2014 and disinformation campaign \u2014 has been intensifying in recent weeks. Chinese state-run media is now actively promoting the idea that the protesters are rioters or \u201cpaid provocateurs\u201d and actively misrepresenting footage to denigrate the protesters. Last week, both Facebook and Twitter said they found accounts originating in China spreading false news about the Hong Kong protests.\n\nAfter the protester was shot in the eye earlier this month, China showed a video of a protester accepting cash, trying to make the point that the entire incident was fake \u2014 when in fact it was the Chinese video that was fake.\n\nChina is also claiming that the West, specifically the US and the CIA, is trying to foment unrest in Hong Kong by paying protesters. (It seems some in the Communist Party might actually believe that conspiracy theory.)\n\nEspecially troubling is China\u2019s increasingly harsh rhetoric toward the protesters. After the airport protests, China called the protesters\u2019 actions \u201cnear terrorism.\u201d China has also moved thousands of paramilitary police to the city of Shenzhen, just across the border with Hong Kong, and state-run media has released videos of tanks amassing there.\n\nThe message Beijing seems to be sending to protesters right now is \u201cGo home or else.\u201d\n\nChina may be choosing its language very carefully to lay the groundwork for a potential intervention.\n\nThere are two scenarios under which China can send its armed forces \u2014 the People\u2019s Liberation Army, or PLA \u2014 into Hong Kong. (China does have about 6,000 troops permanently stationed in Hong Kong.) The Hong Kong government can request assistance from China to help maintain order, essentially admitting it has lost control of the city. The second is if China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress standing committee \u2014 the powerful, permanent body of the National People\u2019s Congress, the national legislature \u2014 either declares war or a state of emergency in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s rhetoric \u2014 calling what\u2019s been going on in Hong Kong \u2018riots,\u2019 \u2018counterrevolution,\u2019 or \u2018terrorism\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s essentially paving the way for it using that clause,\u201d Victoria Hui, the expert at the University of Notre Dame, said.\n\nChina has also amassed troops and tanks across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzen, and has released videos of the armed forces doing drills. Taken together, China may be signaling that it\u2019s prepared to act.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it will. Experts I spoke to cautioned that it\u2019s impossible to say what China will do, but it would be a dramatic, unpredictable escalation if China intervene in Hong Kong. Just the idea of it has comparisons to China\u2019s Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.\n\nFor one, although Hong Kong may not be as economically influential as it once was, it\u2019s still seen as the \u201cgateway to the China\u201d and a global commercial and financial capital. A forceful Chinese intervention would disrupt the city\u2019s economy far more than the protests already have. China\u2019s economy isn\u2019t doing so well right now, either, which means its leaders are probably hesitant to cause serious financial harm, even if Hong Kong only accounts for about 3 percent of its total economy now.\n\nSuch action could potentially result in loss of life, which would likely anger Hongkongers even more. It would also immediately draw international condemnation (although maybe not much more than that), and China, and specifically President Xi Jinping, isn\u2019t totally immune to such things.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that a key date is coming up: October 1, 2019, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. It\u2019s a bad look to crush a popular movement if you\u2019re trying to celebrate the greatness of your country.\n\nOn the other hand, it doesn\u2019t look good to have an entire city spending weeks leading up to your anniversary challenging your authority and risking their safety for democracy. Some analysts and protesters think China might want to go ahead and intervene before the October 1 date; others think China may show restraint as the world watches.\n\nPresident Xi \u201cwants increasing prestige and [to] show the world he\u2019s achieving the Chinese dream; using force would show the Chinese dream is a nightmare,\u201d Cohen, at the Council on Foreign Relations, told reporters.\n\n9) How are other countries responding to all this?\n\nThe response of the international community has been somewhat lackluster so far.\n\nThe United States, purported to be a supporter of democracy around the world, hasn\u2019t taken a particularly strong stance. The State Department has called on China to honor the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d rule, and a State Department spokesperson in August called China a \u201cthuggish\u201d regime after it released personal information for a US consular official who met with Hong Kong protesters, which China used as propaganda to show foreign meddling.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has dismissed such allegations of US interference as \u201cludicrous.\u201d He also said in interviews last week that China should respect the rights of Hong Kong and that \u201csomething like Tiananmen Square\u201d in Hong Kong could jeopardize a trade deal. National Security Adviser John Bolton has also warned against a \u201cnew\u201d Tiananmen Square.\n\nSome Congress members, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), have raised concerns about the extradition bill and China\u2019s actions. Lawmakers have introduced the Hong Kong Freedom and Democracy Act, which would \u201crenew the United States\u2019 historical commitment to freedom and democracy in Hong Kong at a time when its autonomy is increasingly under assault.\u201d\n\nBut the more forceful condemnation doesn\u2019t match up with the president\u2019s rhetoric. President Trump has made some vague statements that he hopes the situation \u201cworks out for everybody, including China, by the way,\u201d and he\u2019s sent some alarmist tweets about military amassing at the Hong Kong border. But he\u2019s mostly just made the whole thing about himself, complaining on Twitter that \u201cmany are blaming me, and the United States, for the problems going on in Hong Kong. I can\u2019t imagine why?\u201d\n\nTrump did say earlier this month that he was concerned about Hong Kong, but then suggested that if Xi \u201csat down with the protesters, he\u2019d work it out in 15 minutes,\u201d seemingly unaware of how Xi, the Chinese government, authoritarianism, or protests work.\n\nPart of the president\u2019s hands-off approach to the situation in Hong Kong almost certainly has to do with his desire to make a trade deal with China and end the trade war before the 2020 election. If that means he has to ignore sensitive subjects like Hong Kong (and China\u2019s repression of its Uighur Muslim minority) to cut a deal with Xi, then so be it.\n\nThe United Kingdom also has a historic stake in Hong Kong, as it negotiated the joint declaration with Beijing that preserved Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy in the first place. But the UK is dealing with its own political crisis right now in Brexit, and if the UK does break up with the European Union, it\u2019s not going to want to totally risk isolating China and its economy.\n\nCanada and the European Union have also released statements condemning violence against protesters.\n\nHongkongers have also put their hopes on the international community getting involved. In June, during the G20, activists took out full-page ads in newspapers in 10 countries, pleading for international backing. Hong Kong protesters have also waved American flags at protesters, and sung the US national anthem, part celebration of democratic ideals, part appeal to the United States.\n\nCalls for international support for Hong Kong\u2019s democracy have been mostly met with silence. But the tens of thousands of protesters who continue to flood the streets of Hong Kong week after week refuse to be silent, even if no one else will stand up on their behalf.\n\nListen to Today, Explained\n\nHong Kong ramped up its protests and China ramped up its propaganda machine.
