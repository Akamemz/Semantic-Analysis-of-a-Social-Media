    "content": "Ever since Texas laws closed about half of the state 's abortion clinics in 2013 , researchers have been trying to understand just how much burden those laws place on women who are trying to access abortion . That 's important because the Supreme Court is now considering those laws as part of Whole Woman 's Health v. Hellerstedt , the court 's most consequential abortion case in decades . If it finds that the laws place an `` undue burden '' on women , they 'll likely be struck down .\nResearchers with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project ( TxPEP ) , looking into exactly that , have already found that some women had to wait as much as three weeks longer for an appointment . Some women they 've interviewed were n't able to secure an abortion at all , due to the logistical and financial barriers .\nNow , TxPEP has published a significant study , in the American Journal of Public Health , on the effects of HB2 , the omnibus anti-abortion bill that the Court could end up partially striking down . The study shows just how many burdens were placed on women as a result of the clinics closed by the law .\nWomen had to travel an average of four times as far to get to a clinic\nResearchers surveyed 398 Texas women , comparing women whose nearest abortion clinic was closed in mid-2014 with those whose nearest clinic was still open in April 2013 , shortly before the Texas legislature debated HB2 .\nThe results were striking . Of the women surveyed , 38 percent lived in a zip code where the closest clinic was open in 2013 but closed in 2014 .\nOne key finding : Women whose nearest clinic had n't closed had to travel an average of 22 miles , while women whose nearest clinic had closed traveled an average of 85 miles \u2014 almost four times as far .
