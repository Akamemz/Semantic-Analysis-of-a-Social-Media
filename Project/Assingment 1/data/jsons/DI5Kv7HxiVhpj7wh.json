VPC\n\nPresident Obama and Jay Leno (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP)\n\nIt may have been The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, but President Obama's interview Tuesday night did cover some serious subjects like terrorism.\n\nThe temporary closing of U.S. embassies in the Middle East and Africa is \"a reminder that for all the progress we've made -- getting (Osama) bin Laden, putting al-Qaeda between Afghanistan and Pakistan back on its heels -- that this radical, violent extremism is still out there,\" Obama told Leno at one point. \"And we've got to stay on top of it.\"\n\nHere are some other topics and comments:\n\nThe U.S. warnings to overseas travel\n\n\"I think the general rule is just show some common sense and some caution. So there are some countries where you're less likely to experience a terrorist attack. There are some where there are more dangers. And if people are paying attention, checking with the State Department or embassy, going on the website before you travel, find out what kind of precautions you should be taking, then I think it still makes sense for people to take vacations.\"\n\nThe National Security Agency surveillance programs\n\n\"We don't have a domestic spying program. What we do have are some mechanisms where we can track a phone number or an e-mail address that we know is connected to some sort of terrorist threat. And that information is useful.\"\n\nNational Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden\n\n\"Well, we don't know yet exactly what he did, other than what he's said on the Internet, and it's important for me not to prejudge something. ... Hopefully, at some point he'll go to trial and he will have a lawyer and due process, and we can make those decisions.\"\n\nRussia's decision to grant Snowden temporary asylum\n\n\"There have been times where they slip back into Cold War thinking and a Cold War mentality. And what I consistently say to them, and what I say to President (Vladimir) Putin, is that's the past and we've got to think about the future, and there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to cooperate more effectively than we do.\"\n\nRussia's threat to enforce anti-gay laws at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi\n\n\"I think Putin and Russia have a big stake in making sure the Olympics work, and I think they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics, we wouldn't tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently. They're athletes, they're there to compete.\"\n\nHis new friendship with John McCain\n\n\"John McCain and I have a number of philosophical differences, but he is a person of integrity. He is willing to say things regardless of the politics.\"\n\nThe president's recent lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton\n\n\"We had a great time. She had that post-administration glow ... You know, when folks leave the White House -- two weeks later, they look great.\"\n\nHis remarks on the Trayvon Martin case\n\n\"Well, I think all of us were troubled by what happened. And any of us who were parents can imagine the heart ache that those parents went through. ... And what I wanted to try to explain was why this was a particularly sensitive topic for African American families, because a lot of people who have sons know the experience they had of being followed or being viewed suspiciously.\"\n\nCLOSE President Barack Obama is no stranger to late night television.
