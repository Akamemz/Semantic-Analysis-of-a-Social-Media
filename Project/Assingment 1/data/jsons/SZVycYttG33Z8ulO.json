    "content": "Reports of escalating persecution and a crackdown on religious believers in China have been filtering to the outside world for months . In recent years nearly 6,000 underground churches have been shut down by Communist authorities , some leveled to the ground , and pastors and church members arrested for crimes such as `` inciting subversion of state power '' and `` illegal business operations . ''\nFor two years , Stephen ( not his real name ) attended one of those 6,000 now-shuttered underground churches . On the day authorities raided his church in 2018 , he was flying back from an overseas trip so he was not there when his pastor and other church members were arrested . He told his story of harassment from authorities and efforts to flee to the Christian Post last week .\nBefore Stephen could get home , authorities came to his apartment and knocked on the door . Frightened , his wife locked the door and turned off the lights . Oddly , the police did not knock down the door . But when he next spoke with his wife by phone , he learned the electricity had been turned off and that there was no heat in the place in the middle of a freezing winter . He called the property manager who was able to turn the power back on for a short while . But it was soon shut off again and he was told he had to meet with authorities to get it turned back on . He went to the local police station expecting to be arrested and thrown in prison . He described the experience to the Post :\n`` I wore a very heavy jacket and heavy pants , '' he said . `` I go there and told the police officer , 'Why you turn off the power ? You can just call me . You have my phone number . ' And he said , 'If we do not do that , you wo n't show up . ' ''\nStephen said he was ordered by a police officer to write his name and government identification number on a piece of paper in addition to the names and ID numbers of his wife and kids .\nAt that point , the police official introduced Stephen to three `` community officials '' who wanted to discuss issues related to the closure of the church and a school affiliated with the church that his children attended .\nThe officials offered his children free seats in a public school . Although some Chinese families desire the opportunity to send their children to a good public school , Stephen refused the offer .\n`` I said 'Oh , thank you so much . I know this is a very good opportunity but please give to other people , ' '' he recalled . `` My wife and I are Christians . We want to educate our children with God 's Word . ''\nThe officials did n't seem happy with his refusal and left the room .\nHe was then asked to sign a document saying he would no longer have any contact with church members . The document also contained a gag order , which would prohibit him from talking about church affairs or street preaching .\nStephen refused to sign , telling officials that `` friends and family need our support . ''\n`` They were scared about why we visit each other . That 's human beings doing natural things , '' Stephen told CP . `` I want the freedom to visit my brothers and sisters . I want to contact them . So I could not sign . ''\nStephen then said something that is often heard in report after report of Christians facing persecution . `` I understood they are doing their duties . They are under pressure , '' he added of the government officials . `` As Christians , we pray for them . They have to do whatever they do to earn money . So they kind of surprisingly let me go home . ''\nStephen says to this day he does n't know why officials did n't break down the door to his apartment that first day , or why he was let go after interrogation . He wanted to stay in China , but Christian leaders urged him to flee for fear authorities would again arrest him and force information from him about the church 's ministry in order to build a stronger case against the church 's pastor . He finally fled his home city , going from city to city for weeks , knowing police were monitoring his moves . A month later he and his family flew to America where they live with a relative .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 News has reported , attacks against Christians and other religious groups have been increasing in China in recent years , including bulldozing churches and mosques , barring Tibetan children from Buddhist religious studies , and incarcerating more than a million members of Islamic ethnic minorities in what are termed `` re-education centers . ''\nOne of the most obvious attacks on Christians happened last October when Chinese government authorities tore down a mega church 's building in the Funan , Anhui region , starting the demolition while the congregation was still in the church worshipping . The church 's pastors were arrested and detained , according to the international non-profit Christian human rights organization China Aid .\nGovernment officials did not show any documents ordering the 3,000-seat church building 's demolition . But they did produce arrest warrants for leaders Geng Yimin and Sun Yongyao . Both pastors were detained on the charge of suspicion of `` gathering a crowd to disturb social order . ''\nDespite all his smiles to the US and the West , President and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping is behind the increasing persecution in China , and has ordered that all religions must `` Sinicize '' to ensure they are loyal to the officially atheistic party . According to Open Doors 2020 Persecution Watch List , this means they must make beliefs , including Christianity , `` fall in line with [ the government 's ] interpretation of Communism ... [ and endure ] a steady drip of pressure , where the government increases surveillance , control , and restrictions of believers . ''\nChina ranks as the 23rd worst persecutor of Christians in the world , moving up from 27th last year , according to that 2020 Persecution Watch List .\nAs he released their newest report last week , Open Doors CEO David Curry warned that China , with its `` social scoring '' system where people get points for `` good '' behavior , and lose points for not strictly adhering to the government line , and with its increased facial recognition capability , it is creating a `` system of persecution for the future '' and is the `` greatest threat '' to human rights in the world today , according to CP .\n`` I saw with my own eyes the surveillance on the street but also in the churches , watching their congregation , '' Curry said . `` Facial scans when you come in and then tracking you and generating reports with assumptions built into their artificial intelligence system that is tracking Christian behavior . ''\nCurry believes in the future China 's system could be exported to other persecuting rulers around the world .\nAs for Stephen , after more than a year in America , he wants to go back home to China . But Christian leaders there say it 's not advisable at this time . He continues to live in America where he and his family of six share a room in a sibling 's home .",
