First problem : Weigel \u2019 s not particularly progressive . ( He says he voted for Jon Huntsman , and Gary Johnson . ) Unfortunately for Oliphant , Weigel just finished a flattering profile of Benghazi carnival barker Trey Gowdy .

Oliphant closes with an anecdote about that time I famously criticized Ezra Klein for his apocalyptic coverage of Healthcare.gov \u2019 s early troubles , I guess as an example of a \u201c progressive blogger \u201d delivering a beat-down to an apostate .

( Call me , Valerie Jarrett ! ) In fact , I \u2019 ve never so much as gotten an email from a top White House official .

So the idea that I \u2019 m a pro-Obama drone is also kind of funny , but we \u2019 ll set that aside for now .\nLet 's summarize : Klein , who has been assiduously courted by the White House , turned against the administration over the botched web site rollout , while a writer who \u2019 s never so much as had an email from a high White House source defended Obama \u2013 and was savaged by \u201c bloggers \u201d on both sides of the aisle .\nThere couldn \u2019 t be any principle involved here ? Any genuine conviction on one side or the other ? Nah , I didn \u2019 t think so .\nI last noticed Oliphant for this masterpiece a few weeks ago , cynically arguing that \u201c Democrats are giving Republicans a run for their money in practicing the politics of grievance. \u201d I wrote about it here ( where my editor subtly called Oliphant 's piece \u201c dopey \u201d in the headline ) . To Oliphant , the president \u2019 s pushing for a minimum wage hike was merely an example of `` grievance politics '' because \u201c it may animate minority voters. \u201d Traditionally low midterm election turnout by the Democratic base , he argued , was driving the party \u2019 s leaders to craven extremes :\n[ It ] has forced the party to find reasons for people to come out and vote , and they \u2019 ve selected issues that target slices of the electorate . Hence , equal pay , an issue that especially resonates with single women ; the minimum wage , which may animate minority voters ; and immigration reform , which galvanizes Hispanics .\nThus were genuine public policy positions advanced by Democrats equated with the sideshow of faux-scandal mongering and race baiting that the GOP uses to mobilize its base . I called it another example of lazy , false-equivalence journalism .\nFor the record , I \u2019 ve lost friends over my willingness to criticize Barack Obama , going back to the 2008 primary .
