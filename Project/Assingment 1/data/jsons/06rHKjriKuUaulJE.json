    "content": "When President Trump delivered his inaugural address in 2017 , it was in an unfamiliar style . Gone was the jokey off-handedness of Trump-on-the-trail . In a stilted , elegiac tone the freshly-minted president spoke of \u201c rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones \u201d and \u201c young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge. \u201d The content of the speech was familiar , though : Trump would bring America back from the brink . \u201c This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. \u201d President George W. Bush called it \u201c some weird shit . \u201d\nTrump ran on law and order \u2014 \u201c I am the law and order candidate \u201d he helpfully explained \u2014 even if empirical evidence suggested nothing was wrong with the law and order Americans were already living under . The country \u2019 s rates of violent crime were trending downward when he ran \u2014 falling 51 percent between 1993 and 2018 \u2014 and the economy was churning along , but Trump tapped into some Americans \u2019 dissatisfaction with the status quo . Law and order was about the restoration of a certain social configuration favorable to white Americans as much as it was a concern with crime .\nAs the strange election year that is 2020 marches on , Trump has returned to his 2016 rhetoric , but it may register differently . Late Thursday night , Minneapolis residents burned down a police station after the death of George Floyd , a black man in police custody . The president tweeted in response that , \u201c These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd , and I won \u2019 t let that happen . Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way . Any difficulty and we will assume control but , when the looting starts , the shooting starts . Thank you ! \u201d\nIt was a familiar law and order message from Trump . But he tweeted it into an unfamiliar America : Over 100,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 in the past few months . One out of every four workers has filed for unemployment . As the country lives through actual American carnage , will Trump \u2019 s law and order message resonate as it once did ? Or will the bleak realities of 2020 prove inhospitable to the man who once proclaimed , \u201c I alone can fix it \u201d ?\nIn 2016 , voters seemed excited by Trump \u2019 s verbal promiscuity , the lurid way that he painted the state of the nation . In his telling , America had descended into disarray thanks to porous borders that allowed in terrorists and job-stealing immigrants . He was engaging , if not accurate ( the economy was doing well in many parts of the country and President Obama had actually deported more immigrants who were living in the country illegally than previous administrations ) . Pew Research surveys show that 2016 Trump supporters ranked the economy , terrorism , and immigration , along with foreign policy , as the most pressing issues of the election . And according to another Pew survey , 78 percent of voters who supported Trump in 2016 felt crime had gotten worse since 2008 .\nTrump \u2019 s law and order framework was a sturdy way for him to talk about a more elusive idea \u2014 nostalgia for a mid century America with robust domestic manufacturing and a clearly-defined , if racist , social order . While Trump is no wonk and couldn \u2019 t talk particularly compellingly about globalization , the consolidation of industry and the widening gap between CEO and worker pay , he could talk about \u201c the good old days \u201d when you could smack someone around . It evoked something deep , that call for everything and everyone in their proper place .\nThe law and order message might not sit so well in 2020 . The country has now lived through years of controversies over video-taped killings by police , and the pandemic makes the world feel more chaotic day by day . We \u2019 ll have to wait to see the social and political reaction to the demonstrations in Minnesota , but there might be more sympathy for the turbulent feelings that make people riot or protest . While many will still roundly condemn looting , it \u2019 s perhaps easier for a greater number of us to imagine the kind of jagged anger \u2014 grief , if we \u2019 re being concise about it \u2014 that causes it than it was four years ago .\nUnderstanding the catharsis of looting \u2014 if not approving of the act \u2014 is something that has long eluded the understanding of white America , including liberal white America . \u201c Shoot to kill arsonists and shoot to maim looters \u201d was the order from Chicago \u2019 s white , Democratic Mayor Richard Daley during the 1968 riots following Dr. Martin Luther King \u2019 s assassination . King , for his part , called riots , \u201c the language of the unheard. \u201d Even Obama struggled with his reaction to the Ferguson , Missouri riots of 2014 , receiving criticism from voices on the black left when he said he had \u201c no sympathy at all for destroying your own communities. \u201d He later said he would have done some things differently in his response to the Ferguson crisis , writ large .\nMinnesota has also proven a difficult testing ground for Trump \u2019 s return to law and order rhetoric . Reaction to the violence in the state \u2014 and the killing of Floyd \u2014 has unfolded somewhat differently than past violent deaths in police custody . Police chiefs from around the country swiftly condemned the officer who killed Floyd . Even as police on the ground in Minneapolis arrested a black journalist on live TV , the mayor and governor \u2014 both Democrats \u2014 called for calm while saying they understood and were sympathetic to the anger behind the rioting . Fox News guests and analysts condemned the officer \u2019 s actions , though it remains to be seen how conservative media and the right will react to the ongoing protests and violence . In a YouGov poll , 78 percent of surveyed adults thought the officer in the Floyd case should be arrested ( he was on Friday afternoon ) .\nIt seems unlikely , though , that Trump will easily give up the race-baiting language of \u201c thugs \u201d and the like . For Trump , who is famously ideologically flexible , the idea of law and order is perhaps his deepest-held , most sincere political belief . In 1989 , in the midst of the Central Park Five controversy , when five black and Latino men were accused of the brutal rape of a white jogger , he took out full-page advertisements in New York City newspapers to decry waffling over the punishment of the men .
