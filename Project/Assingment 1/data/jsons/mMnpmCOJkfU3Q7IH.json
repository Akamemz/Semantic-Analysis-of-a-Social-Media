That \u2019 s where the rubber meets the road . \u201d\nAlready , ConnXus , a firm that helps companies find minority-owned suppliers , is seeing increased interest . The tech company Slack is helping Black and Latino technology professionals in their first two years on the job . Still , there \u2019 s plenty of skepticism about whether corporations can and will support federal policy changes .\nDespite many symbolic moves and contributions to minority organizations in recent days , corporations \u2019 record for supporting substantial racial change is inconsistent . Yet momentum could build , some workers for racial justice say , because of the massive scale of the protests , the proliferation of social media , and the rise of socially conscious consumers and business leaders .\nMany Americans are hoping to channel the anger and protests over the killing of George Floyd into a powerful movement for racial equity . And because equity involves economic disparity between Black and white Americans , the movement needs corporate allies .\nAfter George Floyd died at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer , corporations across the country spoke out against police brutality and systemic racism .\nMcDonald \u2019 s and Nike put out videos on social media . \u201c For once , don \u2019 t do it . Don \u2019 t pretend there \u2019 s not a problem in America , \u201d the athletic shoe company said in its message . NASCAR , the racing body , banned the Confederate battle flag from all its auto races . The Business Roundtable , an association of CEOs at America \u2019 s biggest companies , formed a new committee to find solutions to racial inequality .\nActivists are hoping to turn this moment of corporate attentiveness into a powerful movement for social change . Can it really happen ? American companies have an inconsistent record of pushing reforms for people of color \u2013 sometimes superficial ; sometimes , as one Black historian puts it , \u201c historically indispensable. \u201d Yet a number of business and technology trends , in play before Mr. Floyd \u2019 s death , suggest the activists have reason to be optimistic .\nOne of the indicators is the sheer mass of the protests generated this time . Previous killings of Black people by police have not sparked the number of domestic and even global demonstrations that have happened in the past three weeks .\n\u201c Historically , we \u2019 ve seen a similar playbook where a statement is issued , a few contributions are made , and then it \u2019 s back to business as usual , \u201d says Rod Robinson , founder and CEO of ConnXus , a firm that helps companies diversify their supply chains . \u201c But I \u2019 m seeing a lot more momentum around the issues now . \u201d\nHis own company , for one , has seen in recent days a significant increase in calls from companies \u2013 from existing clients wanting to increase their use of minority-owned suppliers and new firms wanting to start the process . Last month , ConnXus was bought out by Coupa , which aims to mainstream supplier diversification .\nAnother factor is the proliferation of media , including social media . If a company \u2019 s words aren \u2019 t matched by deeds , the disconnect can be called out almost instantly . Those speaking up include current and former employees , who are often feeling more willing and able to speak out than prior generations of workers . Such pressure is far from a guarantee that substantive change will occur , but it \u2019 s a shift in U.S. culture .\nIn the 1960s , \u201c there was no expectation that General Motors would have a position \u201d on civil rights protests by African Americans in the South , says Benjamin Waterhouse , a historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . Today \u201c companies respond to public pressure , which is something that can be mobilized much more effectively and quickly in a modern media environment . \u201d\nMany consumers , too , have grown more socially conscious . And the threat of even a small decline in customers \u201c puts pressure on managers not to be on the wrong side of these things , \u201d Mr. Waterhouse adds .\nPatrick T. Fallon/Reuters Protesters defend the Nike store from looting yelling `` peaceful protest '' during nationwide unrest following the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd , in Long Beach , California , on May 31 , 2020 .\nAnother shift , fueled by these wider societal trends , is the change in how corporations see themselves . In the 1980s , any timid notion of a corporation \u2019 s social obligations gave way to a narrower view that a company \u2019 s only real obligation was to its shareholders . But more recently , the corporate social responsibility movement has pushed back against this bottom-line notion , and gradually firms have begun to look at their responsibilities through a broader lens . Last August , the Business Roundtable reversed more than 20 years of support for shareholder primacy by issuing a new statement , saying the purpose of the corporation was to benefit \u201c all stakeholders \u2013 customers , employees , suppliers , communities and shareholders . \u201d\nThe confluence of these forces have combined to cause many corporations to issue statements of support for the Black Lives Matter movement , a position that would have seemed improbable only a couple of months ago .\nSome of the moves are symbolic . Besides NASCAR \u2019 s ban on the confederate flag , Pepsico announced Wednesday it was retiring its 130-year-old Aunt Jemima brand , long criticized for its stereotype of a Black female servant or slave . The same day , Mars Inc. said \u201c now is the right time to evolve the Uncle Ben \u2019 s brand , \u201d which depicts an elderly African American farmer . And Conagra said it would review its Mrs. Butterworth \u2019 s brand , another Black stereotype the company conceded \u201c may be interpreted in a way that is wholly inconsistent with our values . \u201d\nWhile such steps are important in their own right , activists say , real progress against systemic racism can \u2019 t be made without addressing the persistent income and wealth disparity between Black and white Americans .\n\u201c What we really need to see is corporations taking the next step , \u201d says Cynthia Muller , director of mission investment at the W.K . Kellogg Foundation in Battle Creek , Michigan , which has a long tradition of funding programs addressing racial economic disparity . \u201c It \u2019 s really going to require corporations to have legitimate and tangible skin in the game . And that means investment . \u201d\nShe points to companies like Slack , whose \u201c Slack for Good \u201d initiative is helping Black and Latino technology professionals in their first two years and training incarcerated people for skilled jobs in the tech industry once they \u2019 re released .\nBrendan McDermid/Reuters Bottles of Mrs. Butterworth 's branded syrup are seen along side Aunt Jemima branded syrup on a store shelf in New York City on June 17 , 2020 . Pepsico announced that day that it will retire the Aunt Jemima brand due to concerns about racism . Conagra says it will review the Mrs. Butterworth 's brand due to similar concerns .\nProcter & Gamble last week debuted a new social consciousness ad , \u201c The Choice , \u201d which implores white America to take a stand against racism , a followup to two acclaimed ads dramatizing the kinds of discrimination people of color endure . The consumer-product giant has also established and donated $ 5 million to a Take on Race fund to support groups fighting for more racial equality .\n\u201c The deep problems of systemic racism and inequality have been institutionalized over centuries and will not be solved unless the white community steps up to help , \u201d Marc Pritchard , the company \u2019 s chief brand officer , said in a statement to the Monitor . \u201c But many people are frozen , uncertain of what to do , having avoided the issues or never dealt with what is now inescapable .
