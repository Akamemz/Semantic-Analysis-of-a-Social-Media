    "content": "At Monday \u2019 s 2020 Iowa Brown & Black Presidential Forum in Des Moines , one question kept coming up : \u201c What do you all do to save our lives ? \u201d\nThat 's how Lastascia Coleman , a founding member of the Black Women 's Maternal Health Collective , put it . And other audience members and moderators also asked their own versions of it to the Democratic candidates at the minority-focused event .\nAcross the United States , black women are three to four times more likely than white women to die during pregnancy or childbirth . But in Iowa , where \u2588\u2588\u2588 News presented the forum , the danger facing black women is even more extreme . They may be as much as six times more likely to die while pregnant than white women , according to a recent study from the Iowa Department of Public Health .\nNot all of the candidates \u2019 answers were created equal ; some were far more eloquent and specific than others .\nColorado Sen. Mike Bennet , the first candidate to take the stage , was also the first to be asked about the crisis . He told an audience member that he wanted to expand health care in general , and initially tried to link the high rates of black maternal mortality to economic inequality . He told the audience , \u201c The poorest people always had the shortest end of the stick , and people of color have even the shorter end of the stick and women of color have an even shorter end of the stick . \u201d\nAmerican maternal mortality rates are more than three times higher than those in Canada or the United Kingdom . ( Those two countries also far spend less on health care . ) But no matter their social class or level of education , the risks of dying remain disproportionately high for black expectant and new moms . In 2016 , the New York City health department reported that college-educated black mothers are more likely to have severe complications from pregnancy or childbirth than white women who didn \u2019 t graduate from high school .\nResearch indicates that a constellation of factors contribute to these deaths . Some are explicitly related to the healthcare system , like the fact that black women are more likely to give birth in hospitals that have higher rates of complications . Others , however , are due to the daily and cumulative stress of racism and sexism , a phenomenon known as \u201c weathering \u201d that might even lead black women \u2019 s cells to age faster than white women \u2019 s .\nWhen the audience member reminded Bennet that the maternal mortality rates have been adjusted for socioeconomic status , Bennet pivoted to talking about how \u201c our whole system \u201d is shot through with racism .\nAt the beginning of the 2020 Democratic primary , more candidates had stronger records on the crisis . California Sen. Kamala Harris was the lead sponsor of the Maternal CARE Act , which devotes millions of dollars to fighting racial bias in health care ; New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker introduced the MOMMIES Act to expand Medicaid coverage for pregnant women . ( Neither bill has moved out of committee in the Senate . )\nBut Harris and Booker have since given up on their White House 2020 dreams . Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who co-sponsored both bills , remains in the race , as does Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , who lent his support to Harris \u2019 legislation .\nAt the Brown & Black forum , Sanders agreed that he would expand access to health care in general . When asked about why he doesn \u2019 t have a plan to solve the crisis , unlike his rival Warren , Sanders said he does have one : his signature piece of legislation , Medicare for All .\n\u201c We need a health care system which has a simple function , and that function is to provide healthcare to all people as a human right , not make billions of dollars in profit for the healthcare industry , \u201d Sanders went on . \u201c When you are running a nonprofit system designed to provide healthcare to all , you \u2019 re gon na focus on some of the major crises . \u201d\nMedicare for All , he added , would also empower more people of color to become health care providers .\n\u201c We do not have enough black doctors , we do not have enough black psychiatrists , psychologists , nurses , \u201d Sanders said . \u201c Under Medicare for All , what we will do is make sure that people can go to medical school and practice the kind of medicine that needs to be practiced without going deeply into debt . \u201d\nThroughout the forum , Yang kept bringing his answers back to his plan of giving all Americans a Universal Basic Income , or guaranteed monthly payments of $ 1,000 to everybody over 18 . Though he didn \u2019 t namecheck the \u201c UBI \u201d in his answer to questions about the deaths of black moms , Yang was clearly still thinking along the same lines .\n\u201c Unfortunately , it \u2019 s just more stressful being black in this country than it is being white , \u201d Yang told the crowd . \u201c We make it so that if you \u2019 re growing up brown and black in this country , you can still feel like you can make ends meet , your future is secure , you \u2019 re less stressed out day to day . And hopefully we can close the disparity between health outcomes of black and white people in this country . \u201d\nYang , Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar , and former South Bend , Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg also dove into the need to address racism among healthcare professionals , saying the next president should implement training and standards to fight implicit bias .\nSuch prejudice is also thought to contribute to the maternal mortality crisis among black moms . More than a third of black women surveyed by NPR , the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , and the Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health said that health care providers had discriminated against them because of their race .\nButtigieg , in particular , promised to enact policies that would force \u201c nakedly racist \u201d doctors out of work . He also mentioned many of the themes central to the black women-led \u201c reproductive justice \u201d movement , which pushes not only for access to abortion , but for the right of all people to choose when and how to parent in safe , prosperous communities .\n\u201c We got ta make sure that we \u2019 re dealing with stuff like environmental justice , \u201d Buttigieg said . \u201c Before you even get to the clinical environment , the fact that you may have been red-lined into a neighborhood where there \u2019 s more contamination or more air pollution \u2014 we \u2019 ve seen the statistics on things like asthma , and how much more of a threat that is to black and brown children \u2014 means that we got ta be acting literally on the safety of where you live . \u201d\nButtigieg went on , \u201c This is systemic .
