Attendees sat on the floor around the room \u2019 s perimeter , and a loud , dull chatter filled the room . When Sen. Kamala Harris , D-California , walked onto the stage , as \u201c California Love \u201d by Tupac played in the background , the room erupted into cheers . She was there to introduce herself to the American people through her autobiography The Truths We Hold . She leaned into her history as a prosecutor and recalled fond memories of her parents bringing her to protests\u2014including one story where Harris , apparently , fell out of a stroller during a march .\nHarris reminisced about moments from her races for district attorney and attorney general when others told her that she , specifically , wasn \u2019 t ready : \u201c Nobody like you has ever done this before .
