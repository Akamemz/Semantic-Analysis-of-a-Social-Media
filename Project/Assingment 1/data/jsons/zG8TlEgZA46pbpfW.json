He earned his M.A . and Ph.D. in rhetorical studies at the University of Iowa , and his undergraduate degree in political science at UAH . His research interests are judicial rhetoric , political rhetoric , Burkeian rhetorical theory , argument theory , rhetoric and race , and religious discourse .\nIn 2009 , when President Obama presented his health care plan to Congress , Representative Joe Wilson ( R-SC ) disturbed the House chamber and a nationally televised address by yelling out `` You lie ! '' when Obama said that illegal immigrants would not be covered by his health care proposal .\nAttendees at `` town hall '' rallies carried signs showing Obama as Hitler . Representative Alan Grayson ( D-FL ) claimed : `` If you get sick , America , the Republican health care plan is this : Die quickly . '' Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin claimed that the health care law included `` death panels '' that would decide who was worthy of living and who would be left to die . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-NV ) compared Republican resistance to health care reform to those who resisted the abolition of slavery .\nFor years , Obama detractors pushed the idea that the 44th president of the United States was born in Africa and ineligible to be our nation 's leader , including billionaire developer , television star , and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump , leading Obama to release his long-form birth certificate from Hawaii to prove his citizenship . Liberal MSNBC commentator Ed Schultz called conservative commentator Laura Ingraham a `` right-wing slut '' and California National Organization for Women President Patty Bellasalma called GOP gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman `` a political whore . '' More recently , Dr. Ben Carson , a GOP candidate for the 2016 presidential election , called President Obama a `` psychopath . ''\nMost Americans do n't need to hear examples like these to recognize that we live in an age of political incivility . Such incivility leads to political polarization , legislative gridlock , and cynicism about government . Although we have suffered through rancorous times before -- the Civil War era being the most notable -- today 's incivility is different . In a two-volume edited book I published in 2013 , Venomous Speech : Problems in American Political Discourse on the Right and Left ( Praeger ) , 23 scholars explored different facets of the problem of incivility today . I opened the book by explaining what I see as the key causes of our current political dysfunction . In this essay I will summarize those causes and explain why it may be difficult to change this situation in the short run . Three major causes of this incivility are the media revolution , the campaign finance revolution , and the reshuffling of political parties .\nThe media revolution started shortly after the Watergate scandal that toppled President Nixon and inspired journalists to be aggressive in rooting out corruption . That aggressiveness is reflected in a number of minor scandals that the media blew up into major news stories , often adding `` -gate '' to the end , such as Billygate ( Carter ) , Irangate ( Reagan ) , Troopergate ( Clinton ) , Plamegate ( Bush II ) , Bridgegate ( NJ Governor Christie ) , and many others .\nThe media became more interested in pursuing such stories with the advent of 24/7 television news after the launch of CNN in 1980 and several other news channels since then . The proliferation of cable channels led to `` narrowcasting , '' whereby smaller and smaller audiences were reached by each channel , and networks could adapt their programming to political tastes , with Fox addressing conservatives and MSNBC addressing liberals .\nInstead of serving a broad audience as a public service , these news stations are required to turn a profit and rely on cheap , talking heads rather than expensive investigative reports to fill the endless news cycle . Those talking heads often draw bigger audiences by taking controversial positions , vilifying their political opponents , and engaging in dramatic disputes .\nThe Internet revolution took this media revolution to its ultimate end , allowing anyone with a computer to become a webcaster to the world . Those with a political axe to grind could float unsubstantiated , scurrilous rumors about politicians and their proposals . If they had enough followers that could lead major news organizations , whose stories are otherwise limited by journalistic standards and ethics , to respond to the `` buzz '' created by popular bloggers as news that has to be covered .\nThis is how the ridiculous claims about Obama 's `` African '' birthplace got legs and how a Dallas minister was able to undermine GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney by publicly calling his Mormon religion `` a cult . '' Today 's news media are shaped by a circulation of ideas between fringe figures on the web and major news media whose ability to filter our scandalous and unsubstantiated claims has been seriously eroded .\nOf course , not all such incivility is propagated freely by the press ; much of it is in paid advertisements . While George W. Bush was the first president to raise $ 100 million for his presidential bid in 2000 , Obama 's first race raised about $ 1 billion . And that was before the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC released a tsunami of money into our political system . That decision gutted important parts of the 2007 McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Act . The result is that in 2012 , several wealthy donors contributed $ 10 million to favored campaigns .\nThe conservative Koch brothers have pledged almost $ 1 billion from their political organization to help elect a Republican president in 2016 . Third-party organizations spend a great deal of money on negative advertising , attacking candidates so their own preferred politicians can win . Because they are not supposed to coordinate with candidates -- though some undoubtedly do so tacitly or surreptitiously -- they can be more vitriolic , because the candidates can hold them at arms-length and worry less about the negativity reflecting on themselves .\nThe negativity seen in campaigns also has been increased by the polarization of the leading political parties . Before the 1980s , Northeastern moderates and liberal Democrats would have to compromise with more conservative Southern Democrats to get things done . Republicans would have to pull together liberals and moderates from the Northeast , West Coast , and Midwest . And both parties would reach across the aisle to get legislation passed . That all began to change with President Lyndon Johnson 's push for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , which alienated Southern Democrats and opened the door for Richard Nixon 's `` Southern strategy '' to peel off conservative Democrats by going soft on civil rights .\nPresident Reagan was the master of this strategy , combining an appeal to Christian evangelicals by allying with the Moral Majority , a newly active political group led by Reverend Jerry Falwell . Both Bushes followed suit , by allying with the Christian Coalition ( Bush I ) and Focus on the Family ( Bush II ) . Issues like abortion and school prayer helped solidify the divide . Gerrymandering -- both to ensure African-American equity at the voting booth and to ensure political advantage -- has become the primary means for consolidating political power . It also has given greater power to the fringes of both parties who turn out to primaries ( where only one-third of voters show up ) and choose party candidates . These candidates speak to their base , leading to more corrosive discourse than would be required if they addressed a more centrist audience .\nIt is clear that the economics and culture of our news media , campaign financing , and reshuffling of political parties have made our discourse less civil . Is there anything we can do to change this situation ? Unfortunately , there are few practicable solutions .\nWe could amend the Constitution to overturn the Citizens United decision and reduce the role of self-interested billionaires in our political process ; but passing such an amendment is nearly impossible for those with a vested interested in maintaining the status quo . More likely is that a conservative vacancy on the Supreme Court might lead to a more progressive replacement that could reverse that 5-4 decision .\nWe could reduce the election period , lessening the period of negative attacks -- Great Britain 's elections last only six weeks . However , political parties and states control this process now and states probably would not sacrifice the chance for politicians to woo them by visiting and learning about their concerns . Third parties might break up the tit-for-tat feud between the Democrats and Republicans , but our political system is decidedly unfriendly to third parties . And experience with the recently inaugurated Tea Party -- which has been among the most vitriolic sources of political discourse -- does not suggest that new parties will yield more civility .\nWe could move elections to the weekend to encourage greater participation of the electorate and reduce the influence of voters on the far right and left , but Republicans actually are moving toward making voting less convenient through new voter ID laws to `` crack down '' on nonexistent voter fraud , resulting in the disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of voters . The only realistic effort we can undertake will have minor consequences : ensuring that public broadcasting continues to be supported ( in the face of efforts to defund it ) , because it is one of the last bastions of political news that prefers substantive discussions over scandal , drama , and the `` horse race '' of elections .\nThis is a depressing situation for our republic and one that likely will get much worse before voters actually rise up and demand change .
