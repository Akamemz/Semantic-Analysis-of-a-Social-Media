Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) was none too pleased with his colleague Thomas Massie (R-KY) for threatening to demand a recorded vote on the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill on Friday. Because that meant he had to hop on a red eye flight last night and race back to Washington. The vote could fail if at least 216 members don\u2019t show up to vote on the floor. Gallego \"thanked\" the Kentucky Republican right before he hopped on the plane.\n\nI am jumping on the red eye tonight... thanks Massie. #coronavirus https://t.co/gkhaciDmPr \u2014 Ruben Gallego (@RubenGallego) March 27, 2020\n\nThat sentiment was shared by his fellow lawmakers.\n\nDear @RepThomasMassie: If you intend to delay passage of the #coronavirus relief bill tomorrow morning, please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~$200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt. #thankyou \u2014 Rep. Dean Phillips (@RepDeanPhillips) March 26, 2020\n\n\"Taking a red eye tonight,\" Rep. Gil Cisneros (D-CA) added. \"The American people, small businesses, and our healthcare workers need relief now.\"\n\nThe relief bill, Phase Three of Congress's coronavirus relief effort, passed the Senate on Thursday by a vote of 96-0, a pretty astounding accomplishment after several days of contentious debate. Much of the disagreement was regarding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's liberal wish list. The speaker came back to Washington last Sunday to demand new environmental measures be added into the bill, as well as millions of dollars in funding for D.C.'s John F.
