    "content": "Democrats have maintained a clear advantage over Republicans in political technology . Dems fight to maintain digital edge\nPresident Barack Obama \u2019 s team of 20-something data gurus gave him a major edge in 2008 and 2012 \u2014 and now they \u2019 re among the leading players in a quiet struggle for control of the Democratic data market in 2016 .\nThe biggest prize , both symbolically and financially , is a spot on the growing team surrounding Obama \u2019 s 2008 rival : Hillary Clinton .\nThe 2016 presidential campaign will be Big Data \u2019 s biggest proving ground yet . Expect the savviest campaigns and their techies to surpass Obama \u2019 s vaunted 2012 effort , where data and analytics influenced everything from which fundraising emails went where and which ads aired when on different cable stations , to which doors got knocked and what the volunteer said when they opened .\nThat the competition to take it to the next level is playing out a year before Clinton or any other serious candidate might enter the 2016 race underscores the increasing importance of the intersection of Big Data and Big Money in American politics . At stake are political clout , corporate branding opportunities and lucrative contracts from unions , super PACs , candidates and party committees planning ambitious new projects .\nSome of the biggest names and deepest pockets of the Clinton and Obama eras are involved in various digital efforts , including billionaire financier George Soros , Clinton insider Harold Ickes , Google \u2019 s Eric Schmidt and former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina .\nDemocrats have maintained a clear advantage over Republicans in political technology over the past few years , as Obama \u2019 s operation invested in and controlled the Party \u2019 s efforts . But the data operation was a major weakness of Clinton \u2019 s campaign in 2008 , which creates both uncertainty and opportunity .\nThe network of super PACs functioning as a sort of wink-and-nod Clinton campaign-in-waiting are at the center of the data tug of war . The hub , Ready for Hillary , is working on data initiatives that are unprecedented for a candidate-specific super PAC \u2014 let alone one planning for a presidential campaign that \u2019 s still two years off . Sources with knowledge of the initiatives describe them to \u2588\u2588\u2588 as :\n1 . A 50-state voter file that will merge granular historical data for every registered voter in the country with social media and email information being collected by Ready for Hillary . While the super PAC intends to deploy the new database as early as January to mobilize supporters , its real utility would come in building and executing a model of voter coalitions and messages to win a presidential campaign .\n2 . A direct mail program that would use Clinton \u2019 s likeness and testimonials from high-profile surrogates to raise cash and collect supporter data . It \u2019 s expected to launch sometime in the first quarter of 2014 , say sources in Democratic direct mail circles .\nClinton hasn \u2019 t endorsed Ready for Hillary , but it has at least the patina of a Clinton imprimatur , having won the backing of several high-profile Hillaryland insiders . It \u2019 s expected that any data it collects would be rented , swapped or sold to Clinton \u2019 s campaign , meaning contracts for the projects \u2014 especially the voter file work \u2014 are being closely watched as a symbolic foot in the door to the 2016 effort .\nReady for Hillary declined to comment on the new projects , but Clinton could use all the data help she can get , said Kevin Thurman , who served as Clinton \u2019 s deputy Internet director in 2008 .\n\u201c Obama took it to the next level and Hillary Clinton didn \u2019 t , \u201d Thurman said , noting the Clinton team resisted using her Senate campaign or leadership PAC to begin building a national voter file before she kicked off her presidential campaign . Then , after officially entering the race , her campaign headquarters failed to utilize data effectively in its decision-making process .\n\u201c She had the potential advantage , but her advisers didn \u2019 t take advantage of it , \u201d Thurman said . \u201c So the question for Hillary Clinton is not who do they hire to do data analytics , because I think the cream will rise to the top . The question will be how central data will be to their efforts , and I think they are going to make it a central point . The Clintons learn from their mistakes . \u201d\nReady for Hillary \u2019 s voter file project was awarded a couple months ago to NGP-VAN , the dominant Democratic data firm of the Obama era . It provided a national voter file aggregated from all 50 state Democratic parties and is in the process of merging it with information the super PAC has been collecting through social media and email campaigns . Those were run by a newer firm called Rising Tide Interactive that cut its teeth the last couple years doing online fundraising and advertising for congressional and gubernatorial campaigns .\nThe super PAC \u2019 s direct mail project \u2014 which also utilizes voter file data \u2014 went to the storied Democratic data outfit Catalist , according to sources with knowledge of the plans . Catalist had also sought the voter file project , sources say , and the fact it lost out to NGP-VAN raised eyebrows in tight-knit Democratic data circles , given Catalist \u2019 s deep connections to Hillaryland .\nCatalist is spearheaded by Ickes and financed by wealthy Democratic donors associated with the liberal Democracy Alliance financing network . When it was formed in 2005 , Catalist was seen as an effort to lay the groundwork for Clinton \u2019 s 2008 presidential campaign and to wrest control of Democratic voter data from the national party , which at the time was struggling to build its own voter file .\nCatalist did , in fact , win contracts during the 2008 campaign to provide data-related services to both the Obama and Clinton campaigns , as well as the Democratic National Committee . But , when Obama won the nomination and then the presidency , his political operation , amid bad blood with Ickes , mostly pushed Catalist to the sidelines . Obama \u2019 s team built up the DNC \u2019 s voter file and assembled reams of its own data and analytics within the Obama campaign , relying on firms like NGP-VAN and Blue State Digital .\nSome Democrats worried that Obama would be stingy with his data , but his team cast its work as for the good of Democrats as a whole . It also has undeniably benefited the firms that had a piece of it .\n\u201c There is a halo effect that , for example , we or Blue State Digital might have seen from having worked on the Obama campaigns , \u201d acknowledged NGP-VAN CEO Stu Trevelyan . And it \u2019 s more than just reputation , he said . \u201c Presidential campaigns have big budgets and so they can be a source of innovation and that innovation ends up trickling down through the entire market . \u201d\nTrevelyan declined to discuss his company \u2019 s work for Ready for Hillary or any other client . But NGP-VAN , which started as a fundraising compliance software company back in the late 1990s , has greatly expanded its offerings and market share during Obama \u2019 s presidency . It struck a deal in December 2011 with all 50 state Democratic parties to aggregate their voter files and enhance them with data from another firm called TargetSmart Communications . The resulting mega-database \u2014 which is marketed as SmartVAN to campaigns and the growing crop of super PACs and nonprofits seeking to use data analytics to target their efforts \u2014 is the one obtained by Ready for Hillary .\nShowing the range of groups interested in the data , other recently signed SmartVAN customers include New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2019 s Mayors Against Illegal Guns , Obama \u2019 s post-campaign nonprofit Organizing for Action and the nonprofit Obamacare facilitator Enroll America .\nAfter the 2012 election , NGP-VAN also snapped up a firm launched by Obama digital alums called NationalField that offers a dashboard interface allowing campaigns and their volunteers to easily access all manner of voter data on mobile devices . The acquisition allowed NGP-VAN to expand its offerings , but was also seen as an effort to preempt potential competition in the increasingly profitable industry .\nThe candidates , unions and super PACs are all willing to spend big for the latest in digital offerings .\nNGP-VAN has been paid $ 31 million by various campaigns and committees \u2014 including Ready for Hillary , which paid $ 34,000 for website development \u2014 since the beginning of 2007 , according to Federal Election Commission filings . In that same time , Catalist has reaped $ 3.2 million in payments , though neither tally includes the host of outside groups using political data that don \u2019 t regularly disclose their financial details to the FEC , such as labor unions , and 501 ( c ) 4 nonprofit groups like Organizing for Action or those affiliated with the Democracy Alliance .\nThat \u2019 s where Catalist does lots of its work , and it has developed something of a stranglehold on labor \u2019 s data contracts . Even that niche is poised to become more competitive , though , with at least one major union said to be considering issuing a request for proposal for a voter-file related contract .\nAs the field has advanced and become more lucrative , an increasing number of firms have rushed in \u2014 including Obama 2012 offshoots like Civis Analytics and BlueLabs and also nonpartisan outfits like NationBuilder \u2014 blurring the lines between once distinct niches in political technology . Increasingly , firms offer the data , along with the software , Web and mobile interfaces and analytics used to process it for voter contact and targeting , advertising , fundraising and even compliance .\nAs 2016 approaches , Catalist has faced questions about whether it \u2019 s kept pace with the rapid evolution . Not long after Ready for Hillary settled on NGP-VAN for the voter file project , Catalist announced a long-planned major fundraising push to boost its game , trumpeting a $ 2.25-million lead investment from Soros , a founding member of the Democracy Alliance . Soros had invested a similar , though slightly smaller , amount during Catalist \u2019 s last major fundraising round , back in 2006 , when it raised $ 11 million , and this fall he also pledged $ 25,000 to Ready for Hillary .\nCatalist needs the cash to integrate new technology , including social media , into its systems , said Al Dwoskin , a major Democratic donor and the second-largest investor in Catalist behind Soros . \u201c Doing that work is not cheap , \u201d Dwoskin said .\nDwoskin has yet to write a check for the latest round of fundraising , but he said Catalist benefits \u2014 rather than suffers \u2014 from its age . \u201c They \u2019 ve been at this a little longer and perhaps have more experience with the architecture and data management , \u201d he said .\nThat \u2019 s not the sense of author Sasha Issenberg , whose 2012 book \u201c The Victory Lab \u201d is regarded as the definitive take on political data . \u201c Soros Throws Catalist a Lifeline , \u201d Issenberg tweeted after The New York Times reported Soros \u2019 s investment .\nCatalist CEO Laura Quinn said she is puzzled by that assessment . And , while she wouldn \u2019 t comment on Ready for Hillary or any other specific clients , she said that generally the Democratic data marketplace is growing .\n\u201c It \u2019 s becoming bigger , healthier , \u201d she said . \u201c We don \u2019 t see opportunities shrinking . We see it expanding and we see investment not drying up , but accelerating . \u201d\nCatalist would compete for 2016 presidential data work , Quinn suggested . \u201c There is a big evolution in hand right now , and that \u2019 s very natural and normal and the Party goes through this all the time , \u201d she said .\nThe Democratic rivalry in some ways mirrors that which has been raging for the past few years on the right , where various technologists and firms have competed with another \u2014 sometimes bitterly \u2014 to come up with an answer to close a technology gap with Democrats . The Republican National Committee \u2019 s solution was a privatized voter file called Data Trust that in some ways was meant to mirror Catalist . It was to have opened avenues for campaign and parties to benefit from the data enhancements that could be made by deep-pocketed outside groups like Karl Rove \u2019 s Crossroads , but Data Trust has struggled to achieve lift-off .\nCentralized , party-blessed voter files are yesterday \u2019 s news , asserted John Phillips , CEO of Aristotle , a company that provides data and support services to campaigns and committees on both sides of the aisle \u2014 making it a competitor to some of NGP-VAN \u2019 s work for Democrats . \u201c The competition is shifting to the data-mining software and the analytics as opposed to just the data itself , because the data is only so valuable , \u201d Philips said . He attributed the shift partly to the decreasing power of the parties in a super PAC age in which candidates can field their own operations and aren \u2019 t necessarily eager to align too closely with the parties .\n\u201c Handing over your secret data to the party is so 2008 . In 2014 and 2016 , it \u2019 s every man for himself , \u201d said Phillips . \u201c You still have one firm or a handful of firms that are the favored firms of the national party , but there is no more monopoly in Democratic voter data . \u201d\nObama \u2019 s data trove \u2014 which includes detailed information about the issue , voting , volunteering , donating and social media proclivities of just about every voter in America \u2014 stands as the closest thing to a Democratic master file , and questions about its ultimate fate have loomed over the Democratic data scramble .\nThe list \u2019 s keeper , former campaign manager Messina , has ambitious , but still ambiguous , data plans , as do two firms spawned from the campaign to which he maintains close ties , BlueLabs and Civis Analytics , the latter of which was seeded by Google \u2019 s Schmidt . Both have done modeling work for campaigns and outside groups , and the DNC has paid BlueLabs $ 107,000 over the past few months for data services .\nMessina and other Obama allies debated creating a new private , Catalist-type entity to house the various Obama databases and tools . That could have united the Democratic datasphere by allowing super PACs and campaigns to benefit from one anothers \u2019 data \u2013 which is tricky under campaign finance rules \u2013 but it would have threatened the market share of other data and analytics vendors , and raised questions about which candidates and super PACs could use it .\nUltimately , they decided to transfer most of the data \u2014 except Obama \u2019 s vaunted 20-million-address email list \u2014 to the DNC . The president \u2019 s still-functioning presidential campaign committee will retain possession of that and continue leasing it to the DNC , Organizing for Action and all manner of other groups . The arrangement will allow 2016 Democratic presidential candidates to access most of the Obama datasets , though they \u2019 d likely still bring on multiple consulting firms to develop models and interfaces to utilize the data and even contract for their own voter files on top of the data \u2013 as anticipated by Ready for Hillary \u2019 s plans .\nThere \u2019 s room for plenty of firms to do that work , said the donor Dwoskin . But he asserted Catalist is especially well-positioned in the Clinton 2016 sweepstakes , since it has \u201c some people who have long-term relationships with not only Hillary , but Ready for Hillary . And they certainly will have an opportunity to have a foot in the door , just on that alone. \u201d One of NGP-VAN \u2019 s founders , Nathaniel Pearlman , also has deep ties , having worked as chief technology officer on Clinton \u2019 s 2008 campaign .\nBut succeeding in the 2016 Big Data race will be less about learning from 2008 than looking toward 2020 , said Dan Wagner , who spearheaded analytics for Obama \u2019 s campaigns and for the Obama DNC , then went on to found Civis . His firm is currently balancing political work \u2014 including building an electoral model that helped Ed Markey win a special election for Senate in Massachusetts \u2014 with corporate and nonprofit clients , but Wagner said he would jump at the chance to work in the 2016 presidential race .\n\u201c But the way we \u2019 re going to get there is by building the tools and the technology that look beyond 2016 , \u201d he said . \u201d The people who are going to work on 2016 , I hope , are the people who are building for 2018 . Such that , when we get to 2016 , we \u2019 re not reinventing \u2014 like I did in 2012 , like I had to do in 2010 , because it was all just a graveyard of technology . \u201d",

The president\u2019s still-functioning presidential campaign committee will retain possession of that and continue leasing it to the DNC, Organizing for Action and all manner of other groups. The arrangement will allow 2016 Democratic presidential candidates to access most of the Obama datasets, though they\u2019d likely still bring on multiple consulting firms to develop models and interfaces to utilize the data and even contract for their own voter files on top of the data \u2013 as anticipated by Ready for Hillary\u2019s plans.\n\nThere\u2019s room for plenty of firms to do that work, said the donor Dwoskin. But he asserted Catalist is especially well-positioned in the Clinton 2016 sweepstakes, since it has \u201csome people who have long-term relationships with not only Hillary, but Ready for Hillary. And they certainly will have an opportunity to have a foot in the door, just on that alone.\u201d One of NGP-VAN\u2019s founders, Nathaniel Pearlman, also has deep ties, having worked as chief technology officer on Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign.\n\nBut succeeding in the 2016 Big Data race will be less about learning from 2008 than looking toward 2020, said Dan Wagner, who spearheaded analytics for Obama\u2019s campaigns and for the Obama DNC, then went on to found Civis. His firm is currently balancing political work \u2014 including building an electoral model that helped Ed Markey win a special election for Senate in Massachusetts \u2014 with corporate and nonprofit clients, but Wagner said he would jump at the chance to work in the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\u201cBut the way we\u2019re going to get there is by building the tools and the technology that look beyond 2016,\u201d he said. \u201dThe people who are going to work on 2016, I hope, are the people who are building for 2018. Such that, when we get to 2016, we\u2019re not reinventing \u2014 like I did in 2012, like I had to do in 2010, because it was all just a graveyard of technology.\u201d\n\nMaggie Haberman contributed to this report.\n\nFollow @politico",
