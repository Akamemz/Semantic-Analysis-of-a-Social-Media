Some observers and critics say audiences know politicians and their surrogates bend the truth . It \u2019 s the media \u2019 s responsibility , they say , to invite guests like Conway on , challenge them , and fact-check them in real time .

After Conway cited a terrorist attack in Bowling Green , Ky. , that never happened , CNN declined to have her on as a guest on its Sunday morning talk shows two weeks ago .
