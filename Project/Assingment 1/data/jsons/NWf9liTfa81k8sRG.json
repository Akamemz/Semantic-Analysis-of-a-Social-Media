Rand Paul declared victory Thursday after Attorney General Eric Holder assured him that the president can not use a drone to kill a noncombatant American on U.S. soil -- an assurance Paul had sought during his 13-hour filibuster the day before .\n`` Hooray ! '' Paul responded when the letter was read to him for the first time during an interview with Fox News . `` For 13 hours yesterday , we asked him that question , so there is a result and a victory . Under duress and under public humiliation , the White House will respond and do the right thing . ''\nDuring his dramatic filibuster , which delayed a vote on CIA director nominee John Brennan , Paul had demanded the administration clarify the government 's authority to kill on U.S. soil . The filibuster ended past midnight early Thursday morning . The Senate voted , 63-34 , to confirm Brennan later Thursday afternoon .\nShortly before the vote , Holder sent a terse letter to Paul that read : `` It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question : 'Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil ? ' The answer to that question is no . ''\nIn response , Paul said Thursday that `` we 're proud to announce that the president is not going to kill unarmed Americans on American soil .

John McCain , R-Ariz. , said , arguing that some of the concerns raised about drone missile attacks on Americans -- like Paul 's suggestion that the U.S. could have killed Jane Fonda when she went to North Vietnam -- were `` ridiculous . ''\nSen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , displayed a sign that showed the number of Americans killed in the U.S. by Al Qaeda -- 2,958 -- versus the number killed in the U.S. by drones , which is zero .\nPaul , though , argued that he was raising concern about how future presidents might use their drone authority .\nPaul told Fox News the critical senators `` think the whole world is a battlefield , including America .

But Paul and a host of other lawmakers see constitutional pitfalls across the board -- namely focusing on how armed , and unarmed , drones might someday be used against American citizens .\nPaul and the senators from both sides of the aisle who joined him on the floor Wednesday described a bleak future in which an unscrupulous government might use drones against its own population if left unchecked .\n`` Your notification is the buzz of propellers on the drone as it flies overhead in the seconds before you 're killed .
