''\nPyongyang on Sunday rejected a different proposal for dialogue , one by South Korea last week regarding the North 's suspension of activity at the manufacturing zone that the two countries jointly operate .\nA statement via KCNA , the state-run news agency , called the South 's offer a `` crafty trick '' and `` empty words without any content .
