    "content": "Rep. Keith Ellison , deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee , said he was unaware of the DNC \u2019 s role in funding the Trump dossier , repeating claims from former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and sources close to Hillary Clinton . The denial is reminiscent of Ellison \u2019 s claims to have not heard of Democratic IT aide Imran Awan , despite being repeatedly informed of the major investigation involving him .\nIn both the Awan and dossier affairs , Democratic leaders have said they did not have knowledge of major events that greatly concern them . Investigators contend that Imran Awan and his family members made unauthorized access to House servers thousands of times and funneled massive amounts of data off the network shortly before the 2016 presidential election . The Awans could potentially read the data of one in five House Democrats .\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi professed unfamiliarity with the Awan investigation despite playing an important role in the handling of the case months ago as one of the House leaders who determined it warranted a criminal probe .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not familiar \u2026 I haven \u2019 t followed that so closely , \u201d Pelosi said in May when asked about Imran Awan \u2019 s continued employment in the House . \u201c We \u2019 ve been busy with a lot of other things . \u201d\nPelosi , however , was one of \u201c the leadership [ who ] agreed to refer the probe to Capitol Police and the FBI \u201d in October 2016 after the House inspector general said the Awans \u201c could be reading and/or removing information , \u201d The Washington Post reported .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation asked her about the situation and her commitment to cybersecurity in September , and she simply walked away .\nOther Democrats claim to have not looked into the matter despite the data security and corruption implications , with some members making seemingly contradictory statements or even implying there never was an investigation into cybersecurity and procurement issues .\nNumerous red flags have emerged in Awan \u2019 s background . His stepmother has accused him of wiretapping and extortion and his wife has accused him of making violent threats .\nAfter Imran \u2019 s arrest made national headlines in July , Ellison said , \u201c I don \u2019 t even know about this arrest that you say happened , and I don \u2019 t know the person you \u2019 re referring to. \u201d However , \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation brought it to the attention of his congressional office and the DNC , asking for comment in February , March and July .\n\u201c I get that you \u2019 re following me all this way , but even if you follow me all the way to my office I \u2019 m not going to suddenly know something , \u201d Ellison said when asked about the possible cyber breach . Given that the DNC itself was the victim of a cyber breach and that a staffer for dozens of elected officials had just been arrested , it \u2019 s unclear why an engaged DNC official would have never heard of it , and why his staff would not have informed him when receiving requests about it from the media .\nEllison had in fact discussed the case before , saying in May \u201c I \u2019 m at a massive disadvantage because I don \u2019 t really know the issue at all. \u201d He then apparently did nothing to correct that \u201c disadvantage . \u201d\nThe Awan family is also suspected of running a ghost employee ring in which most of them did not actually show up . Since 2014 , the IT person on the payroll of Rep. Emanuel Cleaver was Rao Abbas , who worked at McDonald \u2019 s and lived in Imran \u2019 s basement . Cleaver paid Imran Awan himself only $ 200 in the last decade .\n\u201c Imran was the guy who worked in our office , I don \u2019 t know this other guy , \u201d the Missouri lawmaker said in June . Despite the obvious discrepancy \u2014 the admission appears to mean that someone not on his payroll had been logging into his computers and that he was paying someone he didn \u2019 t actually see \u2014 Cleaver did not express any alarm or curiosity .\n\u201c Some people say it \u2019 s because he \u2019 s Muslim that he \u2019 s being railroaded \u2026 I don \u2019 t know enough about it , \u201d he said .
