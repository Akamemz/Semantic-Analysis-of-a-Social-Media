A 2012 study by the Pew Center on the States , cited by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail , concluded that 24 million registrations were outdated or invalid , 1.8 million registrants were dead and 2.75 million were registered in more than one state .\nBut even the study that Mr. Trump cited pointed to inefficient administration , not fraud . In a series of tweets , David Becker , the primary author of the study , said the study found no evidence of noncitizen voter registration or voting , and no evidence of voter fraud because of out-of-date records or deceased people still on voting rolls . He said voter rolls are more accurate now than when the study was done in 2012 .\nAnd , perhaps most important , the principal fraud that Mr. Trump and most Republicans assail , and the only one that voter identification laws address \u2014 voters who intentionally misrepresent themselves at polling places \u2014 is exceedingly rare , experts say .
