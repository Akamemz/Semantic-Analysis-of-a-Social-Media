    "content": "Ian McLoone was at his son \u2019 s first birthday party in 2011 when his drug addiction rehab center called him at his Minneapolis home , telling him he needed to come back early .\nMcLoone quickly realized he was in trouble . The day before , he had missed curfew while chaperoning another client \u2019 s family visit for the inpatient facility . After the call , McLoone told his family that he had to go , and left , embarrassed . Over the next few days , he would be forced to \u201c sit on the bench . \u201d\n\u201c It was literally a bench out in the hallway , \u201d McLoone told me . \u201c You would sit there from after breakfast time until just before dinner time . \u201d\nWhile on the bench , McLoone , who was in treatment for opioid addiction at RS Eden , a treatment center in Minneapolis , couldn \u2019 t participate in most group sessions . He couldn \u2019 t attend lectures . He couldn \u2019 t talk to others in the program or eat with them . He couldn \u2019 t watch TV or use the phone . He just had to sit \u2014 in public , in silence . It was all part of RS Eden \u2019 s approach to treatment , as McLoone described it : \u201c We \u2019 re going to break you down in order to build you up again . \u201d\nMcLoone is now doing well , staying off heroin since 2010 . But he said that RS Eden had little to do with his recovery . Instead , he credited his use of methadone , a medication for opioid addiction .\nIn fact , McLoone said RS Eden pushed him to get off methadone \u2014 leaving him feeling stigmatized about using the medication . McLoone \u2019 s mom had to convince him to stay on it . As she told him , \u201c Why wouldn \u2019 t you use every tool at your disposal to get it right this time ? \u201d\nMedications like methadone , as well as buprenorphine and naltrexone , are considered the gold standard of care for opioid addiction . Studies show that the medications reduce the mortality rate among those patients by half or more , and keep people in treatment better than non-medication approaches .\nYet rehab facilities in the US often treat medications with skepticism or even scorn , while embracing approaches with little if any peer-reviewed scientific evidence , like the bench .\nThe majority of addiction treatment facilities don \u2019 t offer medications . According to federal data , only 42 percent of the nearly 15,000 facilities tracked by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ) provide any type of medication for opioid addiction . Less than 3 percent offer all three federally approved medications : methadone , buprenorphine , and naltrexone .\nAs a result , the best response to an opioid epidemic that \u2019 s contributed to the more than 700,000 drug overdose deaths in the US since 1999 is vastly underused . Hundreds of people have now responded to the survey for \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Rehab Racket project with complaints that evidence-based treatment \u2014 including medications \u2014 is expensive , hard to find , and sometimes outright shunned at addiction care facilities .\nMedication isn \u2019 t the only effective way to treat opioid addiction . Other approaches , including cognitive behavioral therapy , motivational interviewing , and contingency management , also have evidence backing up their ability to treat addiction .\nStill , for opioid addiction , medications \u201c should be the first-line option , \u201d Keith Humphreys , a drug policy expert at Stanford , told me . \u201c Not forced , but every single person should be offered that in any decent program treating opioid addiction . \u201d\nWhen it opened in the 1970s , RS Eden at times forced patients to shave their heads and wear diapers as punishments . The approach came from the Synanon movement \u2014 to which one of RS Eden \u2019 s founders belonged to , RS Eden president Dan Cain told me . The formal Synanon organization , which began as a drug rehab program and turned into what \u2019 s now widely characterized as a \u201c violent cult , \u201d no longer exists , but some of its teachings remain in the addiction field today .\nBy the time McLoone got into RS Eden ( on a court order and paid for by the state ) , it had long gotten rid of head shaving and the diapers . But it still used the bench punishment and another technique , also from Synanon , called \u201c the game \u201d : Over the course of a typical week , patients would write down and submit complaints about others in the program . Those complaints would be read out loud by staff in group sessions , during which people would be expected to defend themselves \u2014 at times devolving into shouting matches and nearly fist fights as emotions ran high , McLoone said .\nThe Rehab Racket is \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s investigation into America \u2019 s notoriously opaque addiction treatment industry . We \u2019 re crowdsourcing patients and families \u2019 rehab stories , with an emphasis on the cost of treatment and quality of care . If you \u2019 d like help our reporting by sharing your story , please fill out this survey .\nCain acknowledged that his program \u201c made mistakes. \u201d It no longer uses the bench , but still uses \u201c the game , \u201d he said . He generally defended RS Eden \u2019 s practices .\n\u201c \u2018 Confrontation \u2019 is a term that there \u2019 s a lot of variables in and different levels in , \u201d Cain told me . \u201c We believe that people have to own who they are before they can be motivated to be somebody else. \u201d He added , \u201c We do focus on breaking through that level of denial . \u201d\nStill , scientific evidence suggests confrontational approaches like these can actually make things worse .\nMeanwhile , opioid addiction medications remain difficult to access for many .\nOther addiction patients have told \u2588\u2588\u2588 about struggles to find medication treatments . Eitan , who asked to use their Hebrew name as a pseudonym , sought help for a drug problem going back to their teenage years \u2014 after their mom died of an asthma attack because she couldn \u2019 t afford her inhalers .\nBut in two separate outpatient programs in Arizona \u2014 Mirasol Recovery Centers and Desert Star Addiction Recovery Center \u2014 Eitan said they were pushed into a restrictive , unhelpful 12-step approach . Though the programs said they used other treatment methods , Eitan felt the programs were hostile to questions about them . And neither made medications available to Eitan .\n\u201c It left me not really wanting to have treatment , \u201d Eitan told me . \u201c I felt really condescended to a lot of the time . \u201d\nRichard Poppy , owner of Desert Star , told me that \u201c we \u2019 re not \u2018 it \u2019 for everyone , \u201d and said , contrary to Eitan \u2019 s experience as a patient , that the program does support medications , although it doesn \u2019 t initiate buprenorphine or methadone . Mirasol has since shut down its drug addiction treatment services , focusing on treating eating disorders .\nEventually , Eitan moved to Massachusetts , where they now get outpatient treatment at the Boston Medical Center . There , the staff was quick to offer medications for addiction . Eitan got on naltrexone , which they said has helped reduce cravings for both alcohol and opioids . ( The evidence for medications for alcohol addiction is generally weaker than it is for opioid addiction , but experts say it \u2019 s a good option for some patients . )\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t want recovery to mean that I spend the rest of my life miserably fighting cravings in 12-step meetings , \u201d Eitan said . But , they added , that was seen as the only path to recovery in the treatment facilities they attended before Boston Medical Center .\nIn the 1980s and \u2019 90s , France faced a heroin epidemic that got as many as 300,000 people addicted and led to hundreds of overdose deaths each year along with a rise in other drug-related problems , such as HIV and hepatitis . In 1995 , French officials responded , in part , by expanding doctors \u2019 ability to prescribe buprenorphine .\nFrom 1995 to 1999 , the number of people in medication-based treatment increased . According to a 2004 study published in The American Journal on Addictions , overdose deaths in the same time span in France fell by 79 percent .\nIt \u2019 s the kind of model , experts and advocates say , that the US should move to replicate .\nThere are three federally approved medications for opioid addiction : buprenorphine , methadone , and naltrexone .\nTwo of them , buprenorphine and methadone , are opioid agonists . As opioids , they activate the same kinds of receptors in the brain that , say , painkillers or heroin would . ( Indeed , both can be used for pain treatment . ) But when taken as prescribed , at a consistent dose , neither gets the patient high . Instead , the medications just stop the withdrawals and cravings that are linked to addiction \u2014 stabilizing a patient \u2019 s condition and giving them space to rebuild .\nBoth of these medications have strong scientific and medical evidence behind them . Methadone in particular has been around for decades , and is one of the most studied addiction treatments in the world . Every major public health organization \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the National Institute on Drug Abuse , the American Medical Association , and the World Health Organization \u2014 considers opioid agonist treatment a vital approach for combating addiction .\nNaltrexone is the newer medication of the three . It \u2019 s not an opioid agonist . Instead , it blocks the effects of opioids up to certain doses , making it much harder to get high or overdose on the drugs . It can also reduce cravings for some people . While it has less evidence behind it , research suggests that naltrexone works well for some patients . The catch is that it requires full withdrawal , which makes it far more difficult to initiate for people than buprenorphine , which only requires partial withdrawal , and methadone , which doesn \u2019 t require withdrawal at all .\nNaltrexone can also be used for alcohol addiction , along with medications like disulfiram and acamprosate . Although evidence suggests medications don \u2019 t work quite as well for alcohol as they do for opioid addiction , they \u2019 re a good approach for some people , like Eitan , who was temporarily on acamprosate as well .\nThere are no equivalent medications , at least not yet , for cocaine or meth .\nDespite their effectiveness , the available medications are often stigmatized with a common trope that they \u201c replace one drug with another. \u201d On its face , this is literally true : The medications do substitute , say , heroin or alcohol .\nBut the context matters . The issue with addiction is not just drug use . Most people use some kind of drug \u2014 caffeine , alcohol , or medications . Some people are even dependent on these drugs , whether someone needs coffee to get going in the morning or insulin to survive .\nWhat makes addiction a medical disorder is not just drug use or even dependence , but continued , compulsive use despite negative consequences . So someone would be unable to stop using heroin even when it poses serious risks to his health , career , or family . It \u2019 s only then that drug use becomes a drug use disorder .\nThe medications alleviate those problems , turning a drug use disorder back into just drug use . That \u2019 s why they reduce all sorts of drug-related problems , including the risk of death .\nThe medications don \u2019 t work for everyone , and different medications might work better for different individuals . Some people may need the medications for months or years , while others benefit for the rest of their lives . With a condition as individualized , complex , and difficult to treat as addiction , the correct treatment is going to vary from person to person .\nBroadly , though , medications are proven to be effective for addiction .\nAs Eitan put it , \u201c It \u2019 s definitely not a silver bullet . It \u2019 s not like I took the medication and emerged cured . But about a week or a week and a half after taking it , I had this experience where I was like , \u2018 I didn \u2019 t think about substances today. \u2019 \u201d They added , \u201c There was a break . \u201d\nDespite the evidence , many addiction treatment facilities don \u2019 t offer any medications . Some outright shun the medications \u2014 perpetuating the stigma that they simply replace one drug with another . That \u2019 s deeply unusual compared to the rest of the health care industry , in which medications are , obviously , used quite often to treat medical conditions .\nCain , the president of RS Eden in Minnesota , called methadone an \u201c opioid replacement drug \u201d and \u201c more a tool than a solution. \u201d He acknowledged some people might need to be on a medication for the rest of their lives , but said it \u201c can be problematic \u201d and ultimately would like to see patients \u201c titrate off \u201d medications like methadone during or after RS Eden \u2019 s program . \u201c In terms of \u2018 encourage to get off , \u2019 I think that \u2019 s a bit difficult to define , \u201d Cain said .\nIn McLoone \u2019 s experience , RS Eden \u2019 s message was clear : He felt pushed to get off methadone \u2014 until his mom intervened . ( RS Eden didn \u2019 t speak specifically about McLoone \u2019 s case , citing patient confidentiality . )\nThe resistance toward medications stems from the moralization and stigma that has wrapped addiction treatment for decades . For most of American history , addiction has been viewed as a moral failing , not a medical condition . So addiction was kept out of the health care system \u2014 leaving it to religious and spiritual groups , the criminal justice system , and Alcoholics Anonymous , Narcotics Anonymous , and other 12-step modalities to fill the void .\n\u201c It would be like sending a bunch of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes to camp \u201d\nIt \u2019 s in this environment that the current model of what many Americans think of treatment \u2014 the 28-day stay in rehab \u2014 took off . Known as the \u201c Minnesota Model , \u201d the concept was popularized by the Hazelden Foundation , now the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation , as a way to treat people with addictions . The idea : People go to an inpatient setting for one month or several months , often outside the community where they use drugs , to cure themselves of their drug addiction .\nPaul Earley , president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine ( ASAM ) , described the Minnesota Model as \u201c a hodgepodge of efforts \u201d that \u201c combined a little bit of AA , a little bit of psychosocial treatment , and a little bit of group therapy . \u201d\n\u201c It was an acute care metaphor , \u201d he explained . \u201c You went to treatment for 28 days . And then when you left , they said , \u2018 Good luck . Go to AA meetings , and it will all work out. \u2019 That works for a very small subset of people who have addiction. \u201d He added , \u201c But because there was nothing else , that grew throughout the United States , and that metaphor of shorter-term care for a chronic illness took hold . \u201d\nAt the same time , some people in the addiction field took things further \u2014 leading to the kind of confrontational approach popularized by Synanon and the \u201c tough love \u201d industry more broadly .\nThis history has led to a system that would appear ridiculous if it were applied to any other medical condition , said Kim Sue , medical director of the Harm Reduction Coalition , which focuses on services that treat and mitigate the harms of drug use and addiction .\n\u201c It would be like sending a bunch of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes to camp , \u201d Sue told me . \u201c Then saying , \u2018 We \u2019 re going to give you your meals every day . You \u2019 re going to go to group every day about how to be a better diabetic . We \u2019 re not going to give you any insulin . Instead , we \u2019 re going to make you exercise , have counseling about your bad eating habits \u2014 things like that. \u2019 And then send people out and say , \u2018 Good luck . We \u2019 ve endowed you with the skills to better handle your disease , \u2019 and expect people to get better . \u201d\nA reprieve came for McLoone after four months at RS Eden , when he was accused \u2014 falsely , he said \u2014 of misusing opioids and kicked out .\nHe then found an outpatient program at the hospital and clinic chain Fairview , which he said worked better for him , while he stayed on methadone . He went on to grad school at the University of Minnesota , getting training to be a counselor for addiction and mental health issues .\nIn 2015 , he tapered off methadone , struggling with the many restrictions people taking the medication face . In the US , only specially licensed clinics can dispense methadone . Due to rules around how methadone is stored , secured , and distributed , patients at first have to go back to their methadone clinic at least once a day to get the drug , earning the right to take home a limited amount of medication after months or years . Travel can be a burden , with strict , often complex rules on whether patients can go to other clinics to get methadone when they \u2019 re out of town .\n\u201c Traveling became really difficult . Working became difficult . Fitting it around my schedule became very difficult , \u201d McLoone said .\nMcLoone was in a place in his life in which he felt comfortable tapering off methadone . But some patients may need it indefinitely \u2014 just like someone with diabetes needs insulin \u2014 and the strict rules around methadone could get in the way .\n\u201c No other medication is prescribed in this way , \u201d Sue , of the Harm Reduction Coalition , said .\nBuprenorphine can be prescribed in a traditional health care setting , but it too faces unique restrictions . Doctors have to go through an eight-hour training course to get certification to prescribe it , and nurse practitioners and physician assistants have to go through a 24-hour training course . The restrictions are one reason that , according to the White House opioid commission \u2019 s 2017 report , 47 percent of US counties \u2014 and 72 percent of the most rural counties \u2014 had no physicians who could prescribe buprenorphine as of 2016 .\nSince methadone and buprenorphine are opioids themselves , the rules are meant to make it harder to get and illegally sell the medications for misuse . ( Naltrexone , the non-opioid option , doesn \u2019 t face similar restrictions . ) But the laws and regulations have also helped create an environment in which rehab facilities are more likely to try unproven methods than medication-based treatments with decades of scientific evidence .\n\u201c When you see people who \u2019 ve been through the wringer \u2014 people who have been through 20 detoxes and 10 rehabs \u2014 it just makes you think : \u2018 Well , what are treatment centers doing ? \u2019 \u201d Sue said . \u201c It \u2019 s really a disservice , because it \u2019 s kept failing , and we \u2019 ve never looked at why you keep revolving in and out of this very dysfunctional system . \u201d\nLooking back , McLoone , who worked at a food shelf before he went into addiction care , said it was his time at the bench at RS Eden that led him to a new career . \u201c I knew in my heart that there had to be a better way , \u201d he said . \u201c There had to be more respectful , more humane , more dignified , and more scientifically valid approaches out there . \u201d\nNow he \u2019 s trying to change the addiction treatment field from within . In 2013 , after graduate school , he started working at the Alltyr Clinic in St. Paul . The clinic was founded by Mark Willenbring , who was previously profiled in the New York Times for his efforts to apply evidence and research to addiction treatment . Today , McLoone is the lead therapist there .\nHe supports medications , McLoone said , but also understands people \u2019 s concerns : \u201c I think my experiences on methadone also helped me appreciate the nuances and ambivalence that most people feel about taking medications in general , and I can understand acutely how and why people feel hesitant about taking a medicine , especially one that requires a longer-term commitment . \u201d\nBut for him , staying on methadone was \u201c by far the best decision I could have made . \u201d\n\u201c I was able to finish rehab , get a job shoveling asphalt that summer , working my ass off , \u201d McLoone added . \u201c I got into grad school . I got through grad school . And I was able to really have the life and the family and the career that I had dreamed of . Methadone absolutely facilitated that and helped to make that possible . \u201d\nWe \u2019 re shining a light on the problems with the addiction treatment system in America and how they \u2019 re affecting people , financially and otherwise , every day .

The day before, he had missed curfew while chaperoning another client\u2019s family visit for the inpatient facility. After the call, McLoone told his family that he had to go, and left, embarrassed. Over the next few days, he would be forced to \u201csit on the bench.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was literally a bench out in the hallway,\u201d McLoone told me. \u201cYou would sit there from after breakfast time until just before dinner time.\u201d\n\nWhile on the bench, McLoone, who was in treatment for opioid addiction at RS Eden, a treatment center in Minneapolis, couldn\u2019t participate in most group sessions. He couldn\u2019t attend lectures. He couldn\u2019t talk to others in the program or eat with them. He couldn\u2019t watch TV or use the phone. He just had to sit \u2014 in public, in silence.

As she told him, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you use every tool at your disposal to get it right this time?\u201d\n\nThis is the reality of America\u2019s drug rehab industry.\n\nMedications like methadone, as well as buprenorphine and naltrexone, are considered the gold standard of care for opioid addiction.

But it still used the bench punishment and another technique, also from Synanon, called \u201cthe game\u201d: Over the course of a typical week, patients would write down and submit complaints about others in the program. Those complaints would be read out loud by staff in group sessions, during which people would be expected to defend themselves \u2014 at times devolving into shouting matches and nearly fist fights as emotions ran high, McLoone said.\n\nThe Rehab Racket is Vox\u2019s investigation into America\u2019s notoriously opaque addiction treatment industry. We\u2019re crowdsourcing patients and families\u2019 rehab stories, with an emphasis on the cost of treatment and quality of care. If you\u2019d like help our reporting by sharing your story, please fill out this survey.\n\nCain acknowledged that his program \u201cmade mistakes.\u201d It no longer uses the bench, but still uses \u201cthe game,\u201d he said. He generally defended RS Eden\u2019s practices.\n\n\u201c\u2018Confrontation\u2019 is a term that there\u2019s a lot of variables in and different levels in,\u201d Cain told me. \u201cWe believe that people have to own who they are before they can be motivated to be somebody else.\u201d He added, \u201cWe do focus on breaking through that level of denial.\u201d\n\nStill, scientific evidence suggests confrontational approaches like these can actually make things worse.\n\nMeanwhile, opioid addiction medications remain difficult to access for many.\n\nOther addiction patients have told Vox about struggles to find medication treatments. Eitan, who asked to use their Hebrew name as a pseudonym, sought help for a drug problem going back to their teenage years \u2014 after their mom died of an asthma attack because she couldn\u2019t afford her inhalers.\n\nBut in two separate outpatient programs in Arizona \u2014 Mirasol Recovery Centers and Desert Star Addiction Recovery Center \u2014 Eitan said they were pushed into a restrictive, unhelpful 12-step approach. Though the programs said they used other treatment methods, Eitan felt the programs were hostile to questions about them. And neither made medications available to Eitan.\n\n\u201cIt left me not really wanting to have treatment,\u201d Eitan told me. \u201cI felt really condescended to a lot of the time.\u201d\n\nRichard Poppy, owner of Desert Star, told me that \u201cwe\u2019re not \u2018it\u2019 for everyone,\u201d and said, contrary to Eitan\u2019s experience as a patient, that the program does support medications, although it doesn\u2019t initiate buprenorphine or methadone. Mirasol has since shut down its drug addiction treatment services, focusing on treating eating disorders.\n\nEventually, Eitan moved to Massachusetts, where they now get outpatient treatment at the Boston Medical Center. There, the staff was quick to offer medications for addiction. Eitan got on naltrexone, which they said has helped reduce cravings for both alcohol and opioids. (The evidence for medications for alcohol addiction is generally weaker than it is for opioid addiction, but experts say it\u2019s a good option for some patients.)\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want recovery to mean that I spend the rest of my life miserably fighting cravings in 12-step meetings,\u201d Eitan said. But, they added, that was seen as the only path to recovery in the treatment facilities they attended before Boston Medical Center.\n\nHow medications for addiction work\n\nIn the 1980s and \u201990s, France faced a heroin epidemic that got as many as 300,000 people addicted and led to hundreds of overdose deaths each year along with a rise in other drug-related problems, such as HIV and hepatitis. In 1995, French officials responded, in part, by expanding doctors\u2019 ability to prescribe buprenorphine.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1999, the number of people in medication-based treatment increased. According to a 2004 study published in The American Journal on Addictions, overdose deaths in the same time span in France fell by 79 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of model, experts and advocates say, that the US should move to replicate.\n\nThere are three federally approved medications for opioid addiction: buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone.\n\nTwo of them, buprenorphine and methadone, are opioid agonists. As opioids, they activate the same kinds of receptors in the brain that, say, painkillers or heroin would. (Indeed, both can be used for pain treatment.) But when taken as prescribed, at a consistent dose, neither gets the patient high. Instead, the medications just stop the withdrawals and cravings that are linked to addiction \u2014 stabilizing a patient\u2019s condition and giving them space to rebuild.\n\nBoth of these medications have strong scientific and medical evidence behind them. Methadone in particular has been around for decades, and is one of the most studied addiction treatments in the world. Every major public health organization \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the American Medical Association, and the World Health Organization \u2014 considers opioid agonist treatment a vital approach for combating addiction.\n\nNaltrexone is the newer medication of the three. It\u2019s not an opioid agonist. Instead, it blocks the effects of opioids up to certain doses, making it much harder to get high or overdose on the drugs. It can also reduce cravings for some people. While it has less evidence behind it, research suggests that naltrexone works well for some patients. The catch is that it requires full withdrawal, which makes it far more difficult to initiate for people than buprenorphine, which only requires partial withdrawal, and methadone, which doesn\u2019t require withdrawal at all.\n\nNaltrexone can also be used for alcohol addiction, along with medications like disulfiram and acamprosate. Although evidence suggests medications don\u2019t work quite as well for alcohol as they do for opioid addiction, they\u2019re a good approach for some people, like Eitan, who was temporarily on acamprosate as well.\n\nThere are no equivalent medications, at least not yet, for cocaine or meth.\n\nDespite their effectiveness, the available medications are often stigmatized with a common trope that they \u201creplace one drug with another.\u201d On its face, this is literally true: The medications do substitute, say, heroin or alcohol.\n\nBut the context matters. The issue with addiction is not just drug use. Most people use some kind of drug \u2014 caffeine, alcohol, or medications. Some people are even dependent on these drugs, whether someone needs coffee to get going in the morning or insulin to survive.\n\nWhat makes addiction a medical disorder is not just drug use or even dependence, but continued, compulsive use despite negative consequences. So someone would be unable to stop using heroin even when it poses serious risks to his health, career, or family. It\u2019s only then that drug use becomes a drug use disorder.\n\nThe medications alleviate those problems, turning a drug use disorder back into just drug use. That\u2019s why they reduce all sorts of drug-related problems, including the risk of death.\n\nThe medications don\u2019t work for everyone, and different medications might work better for different individuals. Some people may need the medications for months or years, while others benefit for the rest of their lives. With a condition as individualized, complex, and difficult to treat as addiction, the correct treatment is going to vary from person to person.\n\nBroadly, though, medications are proven to be effective for addiction.\n\nAs Eitan put it, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a silver bullet. It\u2019s not like I took the medication and emerged cured. But about a week or a week and a half after taking it, I had this experience where I was like, \u2018I didn\u2019t think about substances today.\u2019\u201d They added, \u201cThere was a break.\u201d\n\nWhy the addiction treatment field frequently rejects medication\n\nDespite the evidence, many addiction treatment facilities don\u2019t offer any medications. Some outright shun the medications \u2014 perpetuating the stigma that they simply replace one drug with another. That\u2019s deeply unusual compared to the rest of the health care industry, in which medications are, obviously, used quite often to treat medical conditions.\n\nCain, the president of RS Eden in Minnesota, called methadone an \u201copioid replacement drug\u201d and \u201cmore a tool than a solution.\u201d He acknowledged some people might need to be on a medication for the rest of their lives, but said it \u201ccan be problematic\u201d and ultimately would like to see patients \u201ctitrate off\u201d medications like methadone during or after RS Eden\u2019s program. \u201cIn terms of \u2018encourage to get off,\u2019 I think that\u2019s a bit difficult to define,\u201d Cain said.\n\nIn McLoone\u2019s experience, RS Eden\u2019s message was clear: He felt pushed to get off methadone \u2014 until his mom intervened. (RS Eden didn\u2019t speak specifically about McLoone\u2019s case, citing patient confidentiality.)\n\nThe resistance toward medications stems from the moralization and stigma that has wrapped addiction treatment for decades. For most of American history, addiction has been viewed as a moral failing, not a medical condition. So addiction was kept out of the health care system \u2014 leaving it to religious and spiritual groups, the criminal justice system, and Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and other 12-step modalities to fill the void.\n\n\u201cIt would be like sending a bunch of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes to camp\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s in this environment that the current model of what many Americans think of treatment \u2014 the 28-day stay in rehab \u2014 took off. Known as the \u201cMinnesota Model,\u201d the concept was popularized by the Hazelden Foundation, now the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, as a way to treat people with addictions. The idea: People go to an inpatient setting for one month or several months, often outside the community where they use drugs, to cure themselves of their drug addiction.\n\nPaul Earley, president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), described the Minnesota Model as \u201ca hodgepodge of efforts\u201d that \u201ccombined a little bit of AA, a little bit of psychosocial treatment, and a little bit of group therapy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an acute care metaphor,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou went to treatment for 28 days. And then when you left, they said, \u2018Good luck. Go to AA meetings, and it will all work out.\u2019 That works for a very small subset of people who have addiction.\u201d He added, \u201cBut because there was nothing else, that grew throughout the United States, and that metaphor of shorter-term care for a chronic illness took hold.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, some people in the addiction field took things further \u2014 leading to the kind of confrontational approach popularized by Synanon and the \u201ctough love\u201d industry more broadly.\n\nThis history has led to a system that would appear ridiculous if it were applied to any other medical condition, said Kim Sue, medical director of the Harm Reduction Coalition, which focuses on services that treat and mitigate the harms of drug use and addiction.\n\n\u201cIt would be like sending a bunch of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes to camp,\u201d Sue told me. \u201cThen saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to give you your meals every day. You\u2019re going to go to group every day about how to be a better diabetic. We\u2019re not going to give you any insulin. Instead, we\u2019re going to make you exercise, have counseling about your bad eating habits \u2014 things like that.\u2019 And then send people out and say, \u2018Good luck. We\u2019ve endowed you with the skills to better handle your disease,\u2019 and expect people to get better.\u201d\n\nAddiction treatment doesn\u2019t have to be this way\n\nA reprieve came for McLoone after four months at RS Eden, when he was accused \u2014 falsely, he said \u2014 of misusing opioids and kicked out.\n\nHe then found an outpatient program at the hospital and clinic chain Fairview, which he said worked better for him, while he stayed on methadone. He went on to grad school at the University of Minnesota, getting training to be a counselor for addiction and mental health issues.\n\nIn 2015, he tapered off methadone, struggling with the many restrictions people taking the medication face. In the US, only specially licensed clinics can dispense methadone. Due to rules around how methadone is stored, secured, and distributed, patients at first have to go back to their methadone clinic at least once a day to get the drug, earning the right to take home a limited amount of medication after months or years. Travel can be a burden, with strict, often complex rules on whether patients can go to other clinics to get methadone when they\u2019re out of town.\n\n\u201cTraveling became really difficult. Working became difficult. Fitting it around my schedule became very difficult,\u201d McLoone said.\n\nMcLoone was in a place in his life in which he felt comfortable tapering off methadone. But some patients may need it indefinitely \u2014 just like someone with diabetes needs insulin \u2014 and the strict rules around methadone could get in the way.\n\n\u201cNo other medication is prescribed in this way,\u201d Sue, of the Harm Reduction Coalition, said.\n\nBuprenorphine can be prescribed in a traditional health care setting, but it too faces unique restrictions. Doctors have to go through an eight-hour training course to get certification to prescribe it, and nurse practitioners and physician assistants have to go through a 24-hour training course. The restrictions are one reason that, according to the White House opioid commission\u2019s 2017 report, 47 percent of US counties \u2014 and 72 percent of the most rural counties \u2014 had no physicians who could prescribe buprenorphine as of 2016.\n\nSince methadone and buprenorphine are opioids themselves, the rules are meant to make it harder to get and illegally sell the medications for misuse. (Naltrexone, the non-opioid option, doesn\u2019t face similar restrictions.) But the laws and regulations have also helped create an environment in which rehab facilities are more likely to try unproven methods than medication-based treatments with decades of scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cWhen you see people who\u2019ve been through the wringer \u2014 people who have been through 20 detoxes and 10 rehabs \u2014 it just makes you think: \u2018Well, what are treatment centers doing?\u2019\u201d Sue said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a disservice, because it\u2019s kept failing, and we\u2019ve never looked at why you keep revolving in and out of this very dysfunctional system.\u201d\n\nLooking back, McLoone, who worked at a food shelf before he went into addiction care, said it was his time at the bench at RS Eden that led him to a new career. \u201cI knew in my heart that there had to be a better way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere had to be more respectful, more humane, more dignified, and more scientifically valid approaches out there.\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s trying to change the addiction treatment field from within. In 2013, after graduate school, he started working at the Alltyr Clinic in St. Paul. The clinic was founded by Mark Willenbring, who was previously profiled in the New York Times for his efforts to apply evidence and research to addiction treatment. Today, McLoone is the lead therapist there.\n\nHe supports medications, McLoone said, but also understands people\u2019s concerns: \u201cI think my experiences on methadone also helped me appreciate the nuances and ambivalence that most people feel about taking medications in general, and I can understand acutely how and why people feel hesitant about taking a medicine, especially one that requires a longer-term commitment.\u201d\n\nBut for him, staying on methadone was \u201cby far the best decision I could have made.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was able to finish rehab, get a job shoveling asphalt that summer, working my ass off,\u201d McLoone added. \u201cI got into grad school. I got through grad school. And I was able to really have the life and the family and the career that I had dreamed of. Methadone absolutely facilitated that and helped to make that possible.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear from you\n\nWe\u2019re shining a light on the problems with the addiction treatment system in America and how they\u2019re affecting people, financially and otherwise, every day.
