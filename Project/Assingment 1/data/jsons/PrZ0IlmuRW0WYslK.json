    "content": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 The sex scandal that led to CIA Director David Petraeus \u2018 downfall widened Tuesday with word the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan is under investigation for thousands of alleged \u201c inappropriate communications \u201d with another woman involved in the case . Some of the material was \u201c flirtatious , \u201d an official said .\nEven as the FBI prepared a timeline for Congress about the investigation that brought to light Petraeus \u2018 extramarital affair with his biographer , Paula Broadwell , Defense Secretary Leon Panetta revealed that the Pentagon had begun an internal investigation into emails between Gen. John Allen and a Florida woman involved in the case .\nSome of the 20,000-plus pages of documents and emails between Allen and Tampa socialite Jill Kelley were \u201c flirtatious , \u201d according to a senior defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn \u2019 t authorized to discuss the case publicly . It wasn \u2019 t immediately clear who wrote the flirtatious notes \u2014 Allen , Kelley or both .\nAllen succeeded Petraeus as the top American commander in Afghanistan in July 2011 , and his nomination to become the next commander of U.S. European Command and the commander of NATO forces in Europe has now been put on hold , as the scandal seemed certain to ensnare another acclaimed military figure .\nIn a White House statement early Tuesday , National Security spokesman Tommy Vietor said President Barack Obama has held Allen \u2019 s nomination at Panetta \u2019 s request . Obama , the statement said , \u201c remains focused on fully supporting our extraordinary troops and coalition partners in Afghanistan , who Gen. Allen continues to lead as he has so ably done for over a year . \u201d\nIt was Broadwell \u2019 s threatening emails to Kelley , a Petraeus family friend , that led to the FBI \u2019 s discovery of communications between Broadwell and Petraeus indicating they were having an affair . Petraeus acknowledged the affair when he resigned from the CIA post on Friday .\nIn the latest revelations , a Pentagon official traveling with Panetta to Australia said \u201c inappropriate communications \u201d \u2014 20,000 to 30,000 pages of emails and other documents from Allen \u2019 s communications with Kelley between 2010 and 2012 \u2014 are under review . The official would not say whether they involved sexual matters or whether they are thought to include unauthorized disclosures of classified information . He said he did not know whether Petraeus is mentioned in the emails .\nAllen has denied wrongdoing . He was due to give Panetta a recommendation soon on the pace of U.S. troop withdrawals in 2013 . If Allen was found to have had an affair with Kelley , he could face charges of adultery , which is a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice .\nThe decision by the FBI to hand off the Allen information to the military seems to indicate the issue is not one involving the handling of classified information , but rather some other issue .\nThe Petraeus case has sparked an uproar in Congress , with lawmakers complaining they should have been told earlier about the probe that has roiled the intelligence and military establishment .\nRep. Peter King , R-N.Y. , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , called the latest revelations in the case \u201c a Greek tragedy . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s just tragic , \u201d King said Tuesday on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Today \u201d show . \u201c This has the elements in some ways of a Hollywood movie or a trashy novel . \u201d\nThe issue of what the FBI knew , when it notified top Obama administration officials , and when Congress was told , has brought criticism from lawmakers , who say they should have been told earlier .\nThe White House wasn \u2019 t informed of the FBI investigation that involved Petraeus until Nov. 6 , Election Day , although agents began looking at Petraeus \u2018 actions months earlier , sometime during the summer . Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , complained that she first learned of the matter from the media late last week , and confirmed it in a phone call to the then-CIA director on Friday .\nThat was the same day Obama accepted Petraeus \u2018 resignation , and the 60-year-old retired Army general , who headed U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan before taking charge of the CIA , acknowledged an affair with Broadwell , and expressed regret .\nDefending the notification timing , a senior federal law enforcement official pointed Monday to longstanding policies and practices , adopted following abuses and mistakes that were uncovered during the Nixon administration \u2019 s Watergate scandal of the early 1970s . The Justice Department \u2014 of which the FBI is part \u2014 is supposed to refrain from sharing detailed information about its criminal investigations with the White House .\nThe FBI also looked into whether a separate set of emails between Petraeus and Broadwell might involve any security breach . That will be a key question Wednesday in meetings involving congressional intelligence committee leaders , FBI deputy director Sean Joyce and CIA deputy director Michael Morell .\nA federal law enforcement official , speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the investigation , said the FBI had concluded relatively quickly \u2014 and certainly by late summer at the latest \u2014 that there was no security breach . Absent a security breach , it was appropriate not to notify Congress or the White House earlier , this official said .\nExtramarital affairs are viewed as particularly risky for intelligence officers because they might be blackmailed to keep the affair quiet . For military personnel , adultery is a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice .\nAccording to two federal law enforcement officials , the FBI initially began a criminal investigation of unsigned , harassing emails that were sent , beginning last May , to Kelley , a Tampa socialite . She and her husband , Scott , were longtime friends of Petraeus and his wife , Holly . FBI agents traced the alleged cyber harassment to Broadwell and during that process discovered she was exchanging intimate messages with a private Gmail account . Further investigation revealed that account belonged to Petraeus , under an alias .\nPetraeus and Broadwell apparently used a trick , known to terrorists and teenagers alike , to conceal their email traffic , one of the law enforcement officials said .\nRather than transmitting emails to the other \u2019 s inbox , they composed at least some messages and instead of transmitting them , left them in a draft folder or in an electronic \u201c dropbox , \u201d the official said . Then the other person could log onto the same account and read the draft emails there . This avoids creating an email trail that is easier for outsiders to intercept or trace .\nAgents later told Petraeus that Broadwell sent emails warning Kelley to stay away from the general and carrying a threatening tone .\nFriends and former staff members of Petraeus told The Associated Press that he has assured them his relationship with Kelley was platonic , although Broadwell apparently saw her as a romantic rival .

He assured investigators they did not come from him , and he mused to his associates that they were probably given to her on her reporting trips to Afghanistan by commanders she visited in the field there .\nOne associate also said Petraeus believes the documents described past operations and had already been declassified , although they might have still been marked \u201c secret . \u201d\nBroadwell had high security clearances as part of her former job as a reserve Army major in military intelligence .
