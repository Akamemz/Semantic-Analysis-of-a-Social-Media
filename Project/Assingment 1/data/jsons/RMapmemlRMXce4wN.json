I've boiled it down to a short summary - and a longer analysis.\n\nWith the clock ticking again, Theresa May wants Parliament to finally agree on the UK's withdrawal from the EU preferably before 23 May, to avoid the UK taking part in elections to the European Parliament.\n\nHer plan is first to try to get a cross-party agreement with the opposition Labour Party.\n\nIf that fails, there could be a series of votes in Parliament on alternatives to her deal, such as holding a second referendum. But agreement has so far proved elusive, so it's entirely possible the UK will be back where it started at the end of extra time.\n\nThe granting of six more months looks like an extension of the UK's Brexit crisis, rather than an imminent end to the uncertainty.\n\nThe two big questions now are:\n\nCan UK politicians reach a consensus on how to leave the EU, after more than two years of failing to do so?\n\nCan Mrs May survive as prime minister and leader of the governing Conservative Party, after yet another delay to Britain's departure?\n\nOn the first question there has to be little reason for optimism.\n\nBritain's politicians are now broadly divided into three camps:\n\nThose enthusiastic \"Brexiteers\" on the right of the Conservative Party who want to leave the EU sooner rather than later, even if that means doing so without any kind of deal\n\nThose who see Brexit as a question of damage limitation and who would prefer the UK to stay close to the EU after departure\n\nThose who now see Brexit as such a disaster they want it reversed altogether, either by another referendum, or if necessary by Parliament simply calling a halt to the whole process itself.\n\nAs time has gone on and tempers have frayed, MPs have, if anything, hardened in their positions rather than become more willing to compromise. So finding agreement won't be easy in the months ahead.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC's Adam Fleming explains how the EU agreed a Brexit delay.\n\nComplicating what is undoubtedly the UK's most profound political crisis since World War Two, Brexit is also an issue that provokes powerful divisions not just between the two main parties, Conservative and Labour, but within them too.\n\nMore on Brexit:\n\nAs to Mrs May's survival, it's hard to say. There is now turmoil in the Conservative Party.\n\nIts pro-Brexit wing is furious with Mrs May for the delays to the UK's departure and her attempts to reach out to Labour and the possibility, therefore, of a Brexit that would leave the UK too closely tied to the EU for their tastes.\n\nBut moderate Conservatives are in turn furious with the Brexiteers for what they see as their utter unreasonableness.
