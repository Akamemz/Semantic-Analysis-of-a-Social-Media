The Obama administration officials focused their public comments only on seven Iranian-born men in the U.S. whose convictions or prosecutions were being dropped as part of the swap , and described them as civilians involved in mere sanctions-related offenses but not charged with terrorism or any violent offenses .\nIn reality , many of the men \u2014 and 14 other Iranian fugitives not named publicly by the top Obama officials \u2014 had been accused or convicted of charges stemming from their alleged involvement in clandestine networks supplying Iran with parts and technology for its weapons , ballistic missile and nuclear programs , \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported .
