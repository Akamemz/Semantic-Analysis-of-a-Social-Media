    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump seems to have realized that despite the end of the Mueller probe , his administration may never escape the vise handed to Democrats by their midterm election wins last year .\nThe President is doing what he always does when he 's in a dark political corner : fight harder than any man alive , adopting a relentless strategy of total political warfare and lashing out in a way that may ultimately be self-defeating .\nTrump complained Wednesday , in an angry and , at times , even poignant televised outburst , that he 's not getting any breaks -- and it 's just not fair !\nHe complained about taking hits from the courts , from Democrats , from the press , from enemies old and new . He bemoaned the treatment of his son , Don Jr. , who he said was a `` good young man who 's gone through hell . ''\nThis all came amid worrying signs for the President from a brace of judicial rulings that financial and tax records he 's fought desperately to keep private may -- sooner or later -- find their way into Democratic hands .\n`` We 've had a House investigation . We have Senate investigations . We have investigations like nobody 's ever had before , '' he said , speaking behind banners taped to the presidential podium , reading `` No Collusion '' and `` No Obstruction . ''\nTrump 's Wednesday walkout marked a clear strategic shift . He 's decided that as long as he 's under investigation , his hopes of finding any common ground with Democrats on issues that could help both sides in 2020 are a busted flush .\n`` You can go down the investigation track , and you can go down ... the track of let 's get things done for the American people , '' he said .\n`` We 're going to go down one track at a time . Let them finish up , '' Trump said , adopting an absolutist position that could strip his legacy of badly needed domestic achievements .\nBy Thursday morning , the President was trying to spin the stalemate to his advantage , painting Democrats as uncooperative on issues important to Americans including health care , infrastructure and high prescription drugs prices .\n`` All they are geared up to do , six committees , is squander time , day after day , trying to find anything which will be bad for me , '' Trump tweeted .\n`` The Democrats have become known as THE DO NOTHING PARTY !

Trump will fight all the way up to the Supreme Court if necessary .
