And he said yes , I made a wish .\nIt was inevitable that when speaking for 8 straight hours on the House floor , Nancy Pelosi would spout some crazy nonsense . But I was not prepared for what only can be called a depraved celebration of racial self-hatred . The muddled state of her thinking was on display when she spoke praise of her grandson wishing he were not white . Tucker Carlson ( video below ) captured the pathetic nature of her celebration of racial self-hatred when she said :\nI said what is your wish ? He said I wish I had brown skin and brown eyes like Antonio . So beautiful . So beautiful . The beauty is in the mix .\nCarlson \u2019 s response was appropriate , but I have some further thoughts below his .\nWas it healthy to hate yourself for the way that God made you ? Nancy Pelosi thinks it is . Their delight says everything about the modern Democratic Party . Certain races are good . Others are bad . So bad that it \u2019 s considered beautiful to hate your own innate appearance and want it changed . And that Pelosi is saying one of the main reasons she supports mass immigration so America will look different and in her view better than it does now . Now , whatever you think of that idea , it is a genuinely radical sentiment . Nobody has said anything like that on the House floor for a long time . They used to . But they don \u2019 t anymore . And for good reason . Elevating one race over another is the definition of bigotry . Pelosi may not be sharp enough to understand the consequences of what she just said . She may not know what she is saying . If you want to live in a country where everyone doesn \u2019 t hate everyone else for the color of your skin , you ought not say things like that . Democrats ought to stop talking like this in public .\nI deplore Pelosi \u2019 s comment for these reasons , but would add one more factor to consider . Recall that the landmark Supreme Court decision that outlawed school segregation , Brown v. Board of Education , relied in part on a famous experiment called \u201c The Doll Test \u201d to supposedly prove the harmful effects of segregation . The NAACP Legal Defense Fund described it :\nIn the 1940s , psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark designed and conducted a series of experiments known colloquially as \u201c the doll tests \u201d to study the psychological effects of segregation on African-American children . Drs . Clark used four dolls , identical except for color , to test children \u2019 s racial perceptions . Their subjects , children between the ages of three to seven , were asked to identify both the race of the dolls and which color doll they prefer . A majority of the children preferred the white doll and assigned positive characteristics to it . The Clarks concluded that \u201c prejudice , discrimination , and segregation \u201d created a feeling of inferiority among African-American children and damaged their self-esteem .\nApplying the same logic to her sample of one , Pelosi ought to conclude that the last several decades of nonstop idealization of nonwhites and denigration of Caucasians has had harmful effects on her grandson . Unfortunately for her , the impetus behind that racism is her own party \u2019 s drive for power by means of the left \u2019 s creating and then exploiting racial resentment among minorities , who then give their loyalty to Democrats as their presumed protectors from the evil Caucasoids around them .",
