Would you resent it if the club collected dues from all members but only provided benefits to a select few?\n\nOf course you would. Across the country, voluntary organizations thrive because all of their members derive benefits from joining and participating. Churches, civic associations, and hobbyist groups exist because supporters voluntarily decide these groups merit their time, energy and money.\n\nOnly one type of private organization doesn\u2019t play by the same rules. For decades, union officials have been empowered by federal and state law to collect mandatory dues from employees who haven\u2019t actually joined a union. But a landmark Supreme Court case could change all that for America\u2019s civil servants.\n\nThis Monday, the Supreme Court will hear Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, a case brought by 10 California public school teachers. The teachers are challenging a policy that requires them to pay dues to a union they don\u2019t belong to or support. The case builds on two recent National Right to Work Foundation Supreme Court victories \u2014 Knox v. SEIU (2012) and Harris v.

In Knox, Justice Alito\u2019s majority opinion called forced dues for public employees \u201csomething of an anomaly\u201d in American jurisprudence. In Friedrichs, the plaintiffs are asking the Court to correct that anomaly once and for all.\n\nThe injustice of forcing employees to subsidize an organization they don\u2019t belong to and disagree with should be readily apparent, but the arguments in Friedrichs also highlight the faulty logic behind unions\u2019 own justifications for collecting forced dues.
