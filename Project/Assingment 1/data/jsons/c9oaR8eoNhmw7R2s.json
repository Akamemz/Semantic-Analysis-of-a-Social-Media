    "content": "Ted Cruz has developed a reputation as the most conservative of the major 2016 Republican presidential candidates , but he has n't taken many specific policy positions to earn that moniker . One exception ? His longtime support for a flat tax .\nThe flat tax dramatically lowers the top tax rate and exempts capital gains and dividends from taxation . It 's astonishingly regressive : the rich pay far less , hedge fund managers and private equity types like Mitt Romney would pay literally nothing , and while the exact rate varies from plan to plan , it 's certainly not going to be as low as 10 or 15 percent , meaning the plan would likely raise taxes for middle-class people currently in those brackets .\nCruz 's flat tax proposal , as you would expect , drives liberals crazy . `` It 's a fiscal fantasy for people who wish the US existed as it did before FDR was president , '' writes Wonkblog 's Matt O'Brien . `` It 's not an agenda for anyone who 's interested in governing the country as it is today . ''\nBut liberals should take at least some of the ideas in the flat tax more seriously . Just as a monomaniacal obsession with growth has made conservative tax policy into a regressive disaster , an obsession with progressivity above all else is becoming an anchor on progressive tax thinking . It 's easy to come up with a flat tax\u2013like plan that 's not crazily regressive but still benefits the economy , and the result would be substantially better than most of the tax plans Democratic politicians promote .\nWhen thinking about tax policy , you first have to ask what you ultimately want the taxes for . Sometimes \u2014 as with alcohol or carbon taxes \u2014 the tax does good in and of itself by deterring people from bad behaviors . But mostly you want taxes to pay for worthwhile programs , and liberals in particular need a tax policy that can raise a substantial amount of money to fund a large welfare state . And the experience of most European social democracies is that to do that , you ca n't just soak the rich . You need broad-based consumption taxes , such as value-added taxes ( VATs ) , that everyone pays .\nIn his book Growing Public , economic historian Peter Lindert notes that high-budget welfare states in general tax investment income less and consumption more . His argument is that European social democrats realized that income taxes of the scale they 'd need to fund a comprehensive welfare state would have a deleterious effect on growth , and that the only way to sustainably pay for universal health care , generous education and pension systems , and so forth is to move toward more broad-based , pro-growth tax schemes .\nThe term `` flat tax '' is mostly misleading . It makes people think the flat tax is just an income tax , but with one rate instead of many . It 's not , really . Rather , it 's a kind of consumption tax \u2014 very similar to a VAT of the kind social democracies depend upon .\nVATs work by taxing the difference between what a company paid on materials to make a product and what it sells that end product for : the value added , in other words . As the Tax Policy Center 's Len Burman explains , the corporate tax side of a flat tax is just a VAT that also lets companies deduct the cost of wages . Individuals then pay taxes on those wages themselves .\nEconomists tend to find that consumption taxes are better for the economy than income taxes , because income taxes discriminate against savers .\nTo see why , imagine you make $ 50,000 in wages and there 's a flat 20 percent tax on all income . You 'd pay $ 10,000 in taxes on your wages . That leaves you with $ 40,000 .\nNow you 've got a decision to make : do you want to take $ 5,000 of the $ 40,000 you have left and invest it , or do you want to take that $ 5,000 and spend it on a really awesome television ? If you invest it and make money off the stocks , then the thing you bought with your money \u2014 the profits those stocks made for you \u2014 will get taxed again . If you just buy the TV , the government does n't tax you a second time .\nUnder standard economic models , eliminating this double-taxing of savings promotes investment and thus boosts economic growth . And it 's not just conservatives and libertarians arguing this ; a highly influential model by Anthony Atkinson and Joseph Stiglitz , both noted lefties , gives this result . A widely cited 2001 paper by David Altig , Alan Auerbach , Lawrence Kotlikoff , Kent Smetters , and Jan Walliser estimates that switching from income taxation to consumption taxation boosts growth in the long run by 1.9 to 9.4 percent , depending on how you do it .\nThe empirical evidence is murkier . UC Berkeley 's Danny Yagan found that the 2003 dividend tax cut \u2014 meant to reduce double taxation of savings , just like consumption taxes \u2014 did n't do anything to help the economy . But a recent paper by Tulane 's James Alm and the IMF 's Asmaa El-Ganainy found that in 15 EU countries , increases in VAT rates decreased consumption and boosted savings \u2014 exactly the result you get from the models . The matter is n't open and shut , but at the moment the weight of the evidence suggests consumption taxes are preferable for growth . That gives credence to Lindert 's argument that to raise taxes enough to fund a welfare state without hurting growth too much , you need to move to consumption taxation .\nThe problem with consumption taxes is that they 're usually regressive . VATs are sales taxes : they make everything more expensive by a set percentage , and because poor and middle-class people spend more of their incomes than the rich do , the end result is that the VAT hits them more than it does the rich . But there are a variety of ways to tax consumption without making the poor worse off .\nThe simplest way would be to do take a flat tax but make it not , y'know , flat . Recall that the main feature of the flat tax is its business component \u2014 again , it 's like a VAT that subtracts out wages . It 's totally possible to pair that with a progressive tax on wages , rather than a flat tax on wages . The result is still a consumption tax , but it 's a progressive one .\nThis idea \u2014 known as the X tax and originated by the late Princeton economist David Bradford \u2014 has been promoted in recent years by the American Enterprise Institute tax expert Alan Viard , who along with Robert Carroll wrote an excellent book outlining a detailed X tax proposal . The 2001 simulation by Altig et al . found that replacing the income tax with an X tax would be better for growth then even the flat tax .\nThe big problem with the X tax is that it does n't touch capital income . Mitt Romney would n't pay a thing . So , alternatively , you could simply amend the income tax so that all savings is tax-deductible . This would effectively turn the income tax into a consumption tax , and do it in a way that makes sure capital income still gets hit .\nBut the most reliable way to make a consumption tax progressive has nothing to do with the tax itself and everything to do with what the money it generates is used for . Europe 's flat VATs are not themselves progressive , the way an X tax or personal consumption tax are , but they pay for transfer payments that are larger , relative to income , for lower- and middle-class people than for the rich . The overall system is progressive even if the tax is n't .\nSo there 's a way to change the tax and transfer system so that it 's still progressive but does n't punish savings , and the change would likely boost economic growth . Why are n't Democratic politicians jumping all over this ?\nThey flirt with the idea occasionally . Then\u2013House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) stated that a VAT was `` on the table '' for funding health-care reform in 2009 . President Obama expressed openness to the idea in 2010 after his adviser Paul Volcker signaled support . Volcker 's comments provoked Congressional outrage , and the Senate voted 85\u201313 to condemn the idea as `` a massive tax increase that will cripple families on fixed income , '' but all but one of the 13 senators opposing that move were Democrats .\nBut years of Republicans promoting flat taxes and sales taxes have left a residual distrust for consumption taxation among liberals . More to the point , supply-siders ' insistence that marginal tax rates are the main determinant of the course of human history has done a lot to discredit , among liberals , the idea that taxes have much of an effect on growth at all .\nThat 's fair so far as the recent debates in American tax policy go : the idea that cutting the top tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent could boost growth by any significant amount is nutty , as are claims that big tax cuts like Ted Cruz 's or Marco Rubio 's would boost growth so much they 'd pay for themselves . But the result of the backlash is that progressivity has become the only criterion by which many left-of-center people judge tax proposals , and more credible cases that tax reform could boost growth are ignored . That 's really too bad , especially for those who want a dramatically larger welfare state . Realistically , that increase has to be paid for , and consumption taxes are the obvious way to do it .\nTo quote Paul Krugman , `` if I can trade a somewhat regressive VAT for guarantees of decent retirement and universal health care , I \u2019 ll take it . ''\nCorrection : This post originally said that all 13 senators opposing an anti-VAT amendment were Democrats . Twelve were ; the 13th was then\u2013Sen . George Voinovich ( R-OH ) .",
