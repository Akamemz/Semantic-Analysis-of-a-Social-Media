Show Hide Stone is the self-proclaimed \u201cdirty trickster\u201d of Republican politics and a longtime ally of Donald Trump. The 66-year-old has spent decades cultivating a reputation as a combative political operative with a penchant for making brash statements and trafficking in conspiracy theories. Raised in Lewisboro, New York, Stone\u2019s first foray into national politics came when he was just 19. An ardent supporter of Richard Nixon, Stone was part of a scheme in 1972 to sink the president\u2019s longshot primary challenger, Pete McCloskey. The plot, uncovered during the Watergate congressional hearings, entailed sending McCloskey donations from the \u201cYoung Socialist Alliance\u201d and then leaking the information to the press in an attempt to damage his image. Stone remained such a Nixon devotee that he infamously got the former president\u2019s face tattooed on his back. During the 70s, Stone also played a key role in bringing the full force of outside campaign money to negative advertising. He worked for Ronald Reagan\u2019s unsuccessful 1976 presidential campaign and served as a political director on Reagan\u2019s second, successful, run in 1980. Although he did not join the Reagan administration, Stone remained a key player in politics. A Washington Post profile, published in 1986, said Stone \u201cearns a reported $450,000 a year, owns two homes and a hot tub, wears $800 designer suits and a Patek Phillipe watch\u201d. Stone repeatedly urged Trump to run for president. When Trump ultimately threw his hat in the ring, Stone acted as an adviser. He later left his official position in the campaign, but continued to informally advise Trump.

Late last year he predicted he would be indicted.\n\n\u201cRobert Mueller is coming for me,\u201d Stone wrote to supporters in August. Stone denied wrongdoing and said he faced legal peril simply because he had advised Trump for several decades.\n\nA self-proclaimed \u201cdirty trickster\u201d, Stone has been a controversial figure in Republican political circles stretching back to the 1970s, when he worked on Richard Nixon\u2019s notorious committee for re-election. He has a tattoo of Nixon\u2019s face on his back.\n\nThe indictment also said Stone made false statements when questioned by the intelligence committee of the House of Representatives. When asked if he had no emails or other communications relating to WikiLeaks and the hacked Democratic documents, Stone allegedly said: \u201cThat is correct. Not to my knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the indictment said, Stone \u201csent and received numerous emails and text messages during the 2016 campaign in which he discussed\u201d WikiLeaks, Assange, and their possession of hacked emails.\n\nIt was Stone who first recommended that Trump\u2019s team hire as its campaign manager Paul Manafort, his former business partner. Manafort has since been found guilty on eight counts of financial crimes and is said to have breached a plea agreement with the special counsel.\n\nManafort made his first court appearance in months on Friday as prosecutors and defence lawyers argue over whether he intentionally lied to investigators.\n\nMueller\u2019s team say Manafort repeatedly lied to them even after he began cooperating last September. Manafort\u2019s lawyers say he simply forgot some details.\n\nAdditional reporting: Richard Luscombe in Fort Lauderdale",
