Less than two weeks into his presidential transition , Trump is still defying convention , ignoring the rules and naysayers , tweeting and assembling an administration in a manner that only further fuels the country \u2019 s culture wars \u2014 and its new addiction to the spectacle of its politics .\nThe most dramatic story line surrounds Trump \u2019 s pick for secretary of state , which could come this week , and the speculation that he could go with Romney , one of his most outspoken GOP critics , over Rudy Giuliani , perhaps his closest campaign confidant , who openly covets the post .\nAs he did throughout the campaign , Trump is managing to keep news coverage of his transition on his own terms , eschewing news conferences at which reporters could ask serious questions and offering only photo ops and tweets the media continues to willingly amplify .\nAfter a week of scattered media reports from a scrum of reporters lurking in the Trump Tower lobby , the president-elect \u2019 s transition operation shifted to his Bedminster , New Jersey , estate , where he held meetings over the weekend with potential Cabinet appointees .\nFor the past two days , every meeting played out before a phalanx of cameras that captured every coming and going from the front door , with the president-elect appearing each time to greet his visitor as they arrived \u2014 offering a smile or a wave , pointing his finger like a gun at his latest potential hire \u2014 and seeing them off as they departed . Several times , the goodbyes brought a few succinct comments for the press , with generic platitudes , providing little insight . Sunday morning \u2019 s New York Times featured a large above-the-fold color photo of Trump waving from his doorstep at a departing Romney , whose face looked right into the cameras with a knowing smirk .\nTrump offered more pointed comments \u2014 not related to his transition \u2014 over the weekend via his Twitter feed . After blasting off a series of tweets Saturday morning demanding an apology from the cast of \u201c Hamilton \u201d for its Friday night post-performance plea to Vice President-Elect Mike Pence to look out for all Americans , Trump took aim Sunday morning at the cast of `` Saturday Night Live '' for continuing to lampoon him even after his election victory .
