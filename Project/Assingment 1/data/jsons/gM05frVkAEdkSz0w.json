Biden , in a statement in response , said that \u201c not once \u201d in his career did he believe that he had acted inappropriately .

Nevada politician Lucy Flores alleged that Biden had inappropriately sniffed her hair and kissed the back of her head as she waited to go on stage at a rally in 2014. Biden, in a statement in response, said that \u201cnot once\u201d in his career did he believe that he had acted inappropriately. But Flores\u2019s allegation sounded accurate to Reade, she said, because Reade had experienced something very similar as a staffer in Biden\u2019s Senate office years earlier. After she saw an episode of the ABC show \u201cThe View,\u201d in which most of the panelists stood up for Biden and attacked Flores as politically motivated, Reade decided that she had no choice but to come forward and support Flores. She gave an interview to a local reporter, describing several instances in which Biden had behaved similarly toward her, inappropriately touching her during her early-\u201990s tenure in his Senate office. In that first interview, she decided to tell a piece of the story, she said, that matched what had happened to Flores \u2014 plus, she had filed a contemporaneous complaint, and there were witnesses, so she considered the allegation bulletproof. The short article brought a wave of attention on her, along with accusations that she was doing the bidding of Russian President Vladimir Putin. So Reade went quiet.\n\nTo get legal help, Tara Reade reached out to Time\u2019s Up, established in the wake of the #MeToo movement to help survivors tell their stories.\n\nAs the campaign went on, Reade, who first supported Sen. Elizabeth Warren and then Sen. Bernie Sanders, began to reconsider staying silent. She thought about the world she wanted her daughter to live in and decided that she wanted to continue telling her story and push back against what she saw as online defamation. To get legal help, and manage what she knew from her first go-around would be serious backlash, she reached out to the organization Time\u2019s Up, established in the wake of the #MeToo movement to help survivors tell their stories. The Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund was the recipient of an outpouring of donations over the past two-plus years, and is set up as a 501(c)3 nonprofit housed within the National Women\u2019s Law Center. It was launched in December 2017 and was the most successful GoFundMe in the site\u2019s history, raising more than $24 million. Among the accusers backed so far by Time\u2019s Up are some of those assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, as well scores of others with allegations against executives in male-dominated industries. The group has committed more than $10 million toward funding cases. In January of this year, Reade spoke with a program director at NWLC and was encouraged by the conversation. The fact that she was a Sanders supporter and had come forward previously in incomplete fashion didn\u2019t dissuade Time\u2019s Up. The program director referred her to outside attorneys, Reade said, and suggested that the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund might be able to provide funding for PR and subsidize legal assistance. The program director shared with Reade the note she planned to forward to attorneys, which read, in part: She began publicly sharing the harassment she experienced in April 2019 but was attacked \u2026 online including by Richard Painter (Univ. of MN law professor who worked in the Obama administration) and journalist Edward-Isaac Dovere for being a Russian operative. There is more to the story of the harassment that she did not feel safe sharing at that time. She is looking for support in sharing her story and guidance on any possible legal action she may be able to take against online harassers. [Editor\u2019s note: Painter served in the Bush, not Obama, administration, and ran for Senate in 2018 as a Democrat.] The references to Dovere, a reporter with The Atlantic, and Painter stem from their Twitter posts that highlighted favorable comments Reade had made about Putin in a now-deleted post on Medium. \u201cWhat if I told you that everything you learned about Russia was wrong?\u201d she had written in one 2018 post. \u201cPresident Putin scares the power elite in America because he is a compassionate, caring, visionary leader. \u2026 To President Putin, I say keep your eyes to the beautiful future and maybe, just maybe America will come to see Russia as I do, with eyes of love. To all my Russian friends, happy holiday and Happy New Year.\u201d\n\nReade says that she learned about Russia and Putin through a Russian friend in her creative-writing group; she is currently writing a novel set in Russia. She wrote the post in the spirit of world peace and solidarity with her friend, she said, adding that the writing should have nothing to do with her allegation. Reade\u2019s leftist mother had raised her to oppose American imperialism and be skeptical of American exceptionalism. She hoped that Time\u2019s Up would be able to help push back against the attacks she knew would be coming.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Tara Reade\n\nBy February, she learned from a new conversation with Time\u2019s Up, which also involved Director Sharyn Tejani, that no assistance could be provided because the person she was accusing, Biden, was a candidate for federal office, and assisting a case against him could jeopardize the organization\u2019s nonprofit status.
