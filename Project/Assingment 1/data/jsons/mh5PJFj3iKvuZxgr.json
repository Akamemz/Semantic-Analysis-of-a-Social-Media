His sales are climbing , and he expects to borrow $ 350,000 to open a third location next year where he will sell prime rib , hamburgers and his `` Idaho Ice Cream Potato '' dessert .\nAmerica 's credit crunch is easing . For the past six years , consumers and businesses have struggled to borrow money , but slowly , things are getting easier .\nLarge U.S. companies are taking advantage of low interest rates to borrow record amounts of capital in bond markets . Banks are opening the spigots for commercial and industrial firms , and loans grew at an 11 % annualized rate in the first quarter of this year , the sixth double-digit percentage increase in seven quarters , Federal Reserve data show . According to the Fed 's survey of senior bank-lending officers released Monday , 28 % of banks lowered the cost of credit lines early this year to smaller firms like Mr. Aaron 's that have annual sales of less than $ 50 million . Residential lending began edging up last year , and even people with bad credit can get a loan to buy a car these days .\nIn all , some $ 713 billion in credit flowed to U.S. households and nonfinancial businesses last year , double 2011 's $ 336 billion , according to the Fed . That is still a fraction of the $ 2.2 trillion in credit that lifted American consumers and businesses in 2007 .\nIndeed , many Americans still struggle to get loans .

He said improved `` household access to credit '' was a factor .\nThe change is evident in Boise , a community that suffered a real-estate crash and recession similar to the nation 's .\nThe metro area 's 640,000 residents are recovering from their debt hangover .\nPer capita debt among Boise consumers has dropped nearly 19 % from its peak in 2008 to about $ 35,000 as of the first quarter of 2013 , mostly due to foreclosures and bankruptcies , according to data from Moody 's Analytics and Equifax Inc. , a credit monitoring service . Debt levels rose in the first quarter for the first time in five years , suggesting that Boise residents are starting to borrow again .\nOver the past year , Boise 's economy has picked up . In this year 's first quarter , for example , the number of city permits issued for new residential and commercial construction projects\u2014efforts that usually require borrowed money\u2014jumped nearly 20 % to a five-year high . Meanwhile , Boise 's unemployment rate fell to 6.1 % in March from 7.6 % a year earlier .\n`` There 's an abundant amount of credit available , '' says John V. Evans III , executive vice president of D.L . Evans Bank , a local lender . Mr. Evans says his bank is `` aggressively trying to make loans .

When the 48-year-old approached his bank , KeyBank , for loans to finance the purchase of a new robot and other equipment , the bank initially fretted about the company 's high level of debt relative to its assets , he says .\nEventually , Mr. Youngwerth won over his bankers , and the robot\u2014which helps with loading\u2014arrived about a month ago . `` The credit came quickly and easily , '' he said .\nJohn Williamson , senior vice president at KeyBank , said `` banks , contrary to popular belief , do want to lend money . '' However , he said , KeyBank and other lenders need `` to be protective of our capital . '' Lending by KeyCorp , the parent of KeyBank , grew 6.5 % , on average , in the first quarter of this year from a year earlier , the bank said .\nCredit usually gets tighter during downturns , but the latest recession was significantly worse , thanks to billions of dollars of souring home loans that shook the nation 's banks and gummed up its mortgage-finance system .\nMany banks remain reluctant to make home loans to borrowers with tarnished credit histories .
