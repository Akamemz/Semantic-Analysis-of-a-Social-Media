''\n`` We believe a decision on a woman \u2019 s reproductive choices is best left between a woman and her doctor and I am still waiting for Rand Paul to say whether or not he supporting exceptions when a woman is raped , going to force a woman to carry a baby to term and not allow her to make that choice ? When she \u2019 s the victim of rape , the victim of incest ? Are we going to let a woman die ?
