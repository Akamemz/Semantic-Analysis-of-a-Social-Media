Accusations by Bolton include Trump asking for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsing China\u2019s use of prison camps for Muslims, speaking about executing journalists and a firsthand account of Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine that were at the center of the impeachment saga.\n\nThe president called the book \u201ca compilation of lies and made up stories\u201d from a former staffer who was \u201cjust trying to get even\u201d for being fired. At the same time, the Trump administration took legal action to block its release over claims that it contains classified information. A federal judge on Saturday ruled in Bolton\u2019s favor.\n\nBolton became Trump\u2019s third national security adviser in April 2018. Bolton either resigned or was fired, depending on who you ask, in September 2019 after reportedly clashing with the president on a number of foreign policy issues. House Democrats chose not to subpoena Bolton as a witness during their impeachment inquiry, largely over concerns that it would spark a protracted legal battle. Republicans in the Senate declined to seek his testimony as well.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nThe flood of claims made in Bolton\u2019s book has prompted strong reactions across the political spectrum. Trump\u2019s allies have been quick to echo his criticisms of Bolton and have attempted to undercut the claims made in the book. Bolton has also received significant criticism from liberals, who say he put personal profit over the country\u2019s interest by using his claims to sell a book rather than sharing them publicly months ago.\n\nThe accusations could have been especially impactful during the impeachment trial, Democrats argue.

It contains allegations of severe violations by the president that may resonate with voters who are already discontent with his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests, some argue. Bolton\u2019s claims that Trump took a conciliatory approach to China, specifically, could undercut the president\u2019s attempts to sell himself as a strong adversary to Beijing.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nBolton\u2019s book is scheduled for release on June 23. Democrats in the House are considering whether to seek testimony from Bolton in light of the new allegations, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday.\n\nPerspectives\n\nThe claims will hurt Republican senators seeking reelection\n\n\u201cThe ones who really will suffer, deservedly so, from Bolton\u2019s account are the Republican senators who refused to hear his testimony and then voted to acquit (for lack of evidence, some said).
