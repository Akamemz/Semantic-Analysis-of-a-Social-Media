And , no , not because of their hand gestures .\nIn the final round of \u201c Super Sloppy Double Dare \u201d that was the GOP nominating process , Kasich argued that he should be the nominee because he handily beat Hillary Clinton in hypothetical head-to-head matchups while now-presumptive nominee Donald Trump consistently lagged .\nNow , Sanders who is , as Kasich was , out of the running for the nomination is asking his party to throw over the frontrunner for the sake of general election viability . And there \u2019 s data to back him up .\nIn this week \u2019 s \u2588\u2588\u2588 poll and the most recent NYT/CBS News poll , Sanders outperforms Clinton against Trump . And it had been true for Kasich , too .\nBut it doesn \u2019 t really matter . First , any Democrat without her enormous negative ratings would match up better with Trump than Clinton does . Throw Martin O \u2019 Malley or even an imaginary candidate ( insofar as those are different concepts ) in a poll , and you might see a similar result .\nAnd that \u2019 s because those candidates haven \u2019 t been the target of millions of dollars in attack ads or even garnered much in the way of media scrutiny . These are not just hypothetical matchups , they are , in many ways , hypothetical candidates .\nHead-to-head matchup polls in primaries can be useful if you \u2019 re talking about frontrunners and/or candidates who have been substantially defined in the minds of voters .\nThen there \u2019 s the question of how the process shapes the product . Competing for your party \u2019 s nomination definitely can damage your reputation . Lordy day , it can .\nBut , there is also a payoff at the end of the line , as the party swings in behind its man or woman . So it \u2019 s not just that Sanders \u2019 head-to-head matchups with Trump aren \u2019 t reflective of the general-election reality , neither are Clinton \u2019 s .\nThe current Trump bump is real . The NYT/CBS News poll tells the tale : Eight in 10 Republicans said that the party should unite behind him , despite their disagreements . And in his battle with Clinton , Trump is getting the same post-victory boost his predecessor , Mitt Romney , got four years ago .\nAfter a primary season of unrivaled acrimony , the realities of the binary choice of the general election are setting in .\nThe big question now is what Clinton \u2019 s bounce will look like .\nIt will certainly be there . Eighty percent of Democrats in the poll said that party unity was essential to victory and 83 percent said Clinton could do that . For Republicans , just 63 percent said unity was essential to victory and just 64 percent believed Trump could deliver on that task .\nWhat we must wait to see is how big a boost Clinton will get \u2013 perhaps less than Trump considering that her party is already more united . We also can \u2019 t know whether the surge in partisan loyalty we see for Trump today will last , or if the party \u2019 s underlying fracture will reassert itself .\nThe answers to both sets of questions will depend on how well Clinton and Trump traverse the eight weeks until convention time .\nThe Scientist : \u201c They don \u2019 t snore , but might creak during their slumbers . For the first time , trees have been shown to undergo physical changes at night that can be likened to sleep , or at least to day-night cycles that have been observed experimentally in smaller plants .
