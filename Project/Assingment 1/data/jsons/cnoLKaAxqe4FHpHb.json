The U.S. has invested $ 1 trillion and some 4,500 American lives to create , as initially envisioned , a pro-American , democratic bastion in the Middle East .\nThose aspirations evaporated long ago , after years of U.S. missteps in Iraq were met with violent chaos and insurgency , resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis .

U.S. and coalition airpower was also instrumental in driving back ISIS .\n\u201c We have seen during the war against ISIS just how effective coalition training is , and how the most successful troops in battle were the ones trained by the coalition , \u201d says the Iraqi official . \u201c To lose that support is not a good thing for Iraq .
