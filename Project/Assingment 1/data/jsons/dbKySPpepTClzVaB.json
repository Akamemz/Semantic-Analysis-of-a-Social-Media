Exclusive : Mega-donors plan GOP war council\nA group of major GOP donors , led by New York billionaire Paul Singer , is quietly expanding its political footprint ahead of the midterm elections in an increasingly assertive effort to shape the direction of the Republican Party .\nThe operation was launched discreetly last year , with the previously unreported formation of a club called the American Opportunity Alliance to bring together some of the richest pro-business GOP donors in the country , several of whom share Singer \u2019 s support for gay rights , immigration reform and the state of Israel . Around the same time , Singer and his allies also formed a federal fundraising committee called Friends for an American Majority that raised big checks for a select list of the GOP \u2019 s most highly touted 2014 Senate hopefuls .\nThose candidates are among the big names expected at a two-day retreat organized by the American Opportunity Alliance set for the last week of February at a swanky Colorado resort . The closed-door event \u2014 which is also expected to draw House Speaker John Boehner and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte , according to Republicans familiar with the plans \u2014 is seen in GOP finance circles as a grand debut of sorts for Singer \u2019 s still-amorphous club .\nOn its face , it in some ways resembles a much smaller-scale version of Charles and David Koch \u2019 s fabled network , which brings together hand-picked operatives and politicians twice a year at tony resorts to make presentations to dozens of rich conservatives . At the conclusion of the Koch seminars , as they \u2019 re called , donors commit massive sums into a pool of cash disseminated to various Koch-backed groups for seven- and eight-figure advertising and organizing campaigns that have made them a force in Republican politics rivaling the official party .\nThat doesn \u2019 t appear to be the goal of Singer and his donors . While many of them \u2014 including Singer himself \u2014 have attended the Koch seminars and also maintain their own independent spending groups , their approach with the American Opportunity Alliance is more donor-centric , focusing on comparing notes about one another \u2019 s political projects and funneling limited hard-money contributions effectively .\nStill , the list of big-name pols expected at the American Opportunity Alliance \u2019 s upcoming Colorado gathering highlights the influence that only a few big donors can command in the post- Citizens United era , when a small group of wealthy individuals can reorder elections with just a few huge checks . That new reality has shifted some of the power and control once maintained by the parties and their candidates to factions of major donors , like the libertarian-infused Koch network on the right or the Democracy Alliance club of major liberal donors on the left .\nThe ideological and tactical contours of Singer \u2019 s plans remain somewhat unclear , as does the membership of the American Opportunity Alliance , which is registered as a for-profit corporation in Delaware . If nothing else , though , the group appears to represent a new center of gravity in the world of GOP money , anchored by a famously prolific Republican bundler with a distinct ideological agenda .\nSinger , who founded the hedge fund Elliott Management , has long been a key player in GOP money circles , espousing a nontraditional brand of conservatism that includes aggressive backing for gay marriage and immigration reform , as well as more traditional GOP stances like lower taxes and less government regulation .

At the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa , Singer put together an economics panel featuring at least one congressman , plus he teamed with fellow hedge funder Dan Loeb \u2014 another prominent gay rights supporter \u2014 to host a dinner at the Hyatt Regency headlined by New Jersey Gov .
