Bustos attended the session after flying back to Washington .\nThe episode underscores the level of discontent with Bustos throughout the House Democratic ranks . According to one House Democrat , Bustos made promises to lawmakers of all stripes in her bid to take over the reigns from Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n ( D-N.M. ) , a main reason for the fallout she and the committee are experiencing only seven months after she took over as chair .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the Monday Night Massacre at DCCC , \u201d one lawmaker said . \u201c Cheri campaigned as all things to all people , Telling blue dogs one thing , telling progressives another . So inevitably once in office she would disappoint them . \u201d\nAmong some , the committee \u2019 s day of meetings was a source of mockery , especially after a largely drama-free cycle under Luj\u00e1n , the No . 4 House Democrat , who ultimately landed the plane last cycle en route to taking back the House .\nMore than anything , Democrats believe the party \u2019 s campaign apparatus needs an infusion of know-how at the highest levels . As one external source put it : \u201c They need some adults in there . \u201d\nThe committee released a statement late Monday announcing that Jacqueline Newman would take over as executive director on an interim basis and that the committee \u2019 s executive council will conduct a search for a new permanent executive director . According to one senior aide , Bustos has empowered the senior staffers on the council \u201c to offer recommendations , \u201d adding that she \u201c followed their recommendations in this restructure \u201d ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) .\n> Saudi Arabia : The Senate failed on Monday to override vetoes by the president that would have blocked his arms deal with Saudi Arabia , dealing another setback to lawmakers trying to target Riyadh .\nSenators voted 45-40 , 45-39 and 46-41 on the override attempts , falling well short of the two-thirds majority needed to nix Trump \u2019 s veto , marking the third , fourth and fifth time Congress has tried ( and failed ) to override a Trump veto this year .\nThe arms deal , which Trump announced publicly in June , is estimated to be worth more than $ 8 billion . Trump used an \u201c emergency \u201d provision in the Arms Export Control Act to bypass the 30-day congressional notification requirement to make the deal ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 : Sen.

Bustos attended the session after flying back to Washington.\n\nThe episode underscores the level of discontent with Bustos throughout the House Democratic ranks. According to one House Democrat, Bustos made promises to lawmakers of all stripes in her bid to take over the reigns from Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-N.M.), a main reason for the fallout she and the committee are experiencing only seven months after she took over as chair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Monday Night Massacre at DCCC,\u201d one lawmaker said. \u201cCheri campaigned as all things to all people, Telling blue dogs one thing, telling progressives another. So inevitably once in office she would disappoint them.\u201d\n\nAmong some, the committee\u2019s day of meetings was a source of mockery, especially after a largely drama-free cycle under Luj\u00e1n, the No. 4 House Democrat, who ultimately landed the plane last cycle en route to taking back the House.\n\nMore than anything, Democrats believe the party\u2019s campaign apparatus needs an infusion of know-how at the highest levels. As one external source put it: \u201cThey need some adults in there.\u201d\n\nThe committee released a statement late Monday announcing that Jacqueline Newman would take over as executive director on an interim basis and that the committee\u2019s executive council will conduct a search for a new permanent executive director. According to one senior aide, Bustos has empowered the senior staffers on the council \u201cto offer recommendations,\u201d adding that she \u201cfollowed their recommendations in this restructure\u201d (The Hill).\n\n> Saudi Arabia: The Senate failed on Monday to override vetoes by the president that would have blocked his arms deal with Saudi Arabia, dealing another setback to lawmakers trying to target Riyadh.\n\nSenators voted 45-40, 45-39 and 46-41 on the override attempts, falling well short of the two-thirds majority needed to nix Trump\u2019s veto, marking the third, fourth and fifth time Congress has tried (and failed) to override a Trump veto this year.\n\nThe arms deal, which Trump announced publicly in June, is estimated to be worth more than $8 billion.
