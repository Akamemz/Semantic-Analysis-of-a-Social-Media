    "content": "On The Ides Of March , Trump And Clinton See Fates Pointing To Nomination\nIn the presidential nominating contests of recent decades , the middle of March has told the tale .\nBy St. Patrick 's Day , we expect to know one , if not both , of the major party nominees . Usually , the rest of the election season is just a mopping-up operation . Of course , it 's been hard to find such clarity in 2016 , the year that defies nearly every expectation at every turn .\nYet with the latest round of voting , we can see a trajectory and calculate a timetable for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to reach their goals : amassing the needed number of delegates before convention time .\nOn Tuesday , Trump and Clinton both won Florida , North Carolina , Illinois and apparently Missouri ( though the margins there are so small that The Associated Press has not yet called the race ) . Clinton also added the crucial state of Ohio , making for a potential sweep of events on the primary day with the second-most delegates available all year .\nIt should be noted this was the first voting day that included four top-10 states by population ( Missouri is 18th ) . Ohio had a special significance as perhaps the pivotal contest of the night and the month \u2014 and Clinton won there by nearly 14 points . ( More about Ohio in a moment . )\nSo will Trump and Clinton ultimately be nominated ? Things still may not work out that way , and powerful forces are still moving to prevent these front-runners from wrapping their respective nominations before the conventions . But stopping either of them now will require major turnarounds in momentum and math , most likely driven by some unforeseen and powerful event .\nHere 's why : Clinton now owns such a lead in pledged delegates ( and such an exaggerated lead among the so-called superdelegates ) that only a total reversal of fortune could deny her the 2,383 delegates she needs on the first ballot in Philadelphia in July .\nIt is still mathematically possible , and states still to vote offer a little more than half the total delegate count . But rival Bernie Sanders will need to win consistently , and win with big margins , to pull even .\n`` This is another Super Tuesday for our campaign ! '' shouted a hoarse Clinton to a cheering crowd in West Palm Beach , Fla. She congratulated her rival , Sanders , on his spirited challenge .\nThat challenge had taken on new force since Sanders defied the polls to win Michigan in a squeaker on March 8 . His campaign had spoken of a path to winning a majority of the pledged delegates before the convention , and the next several weeks include half a dozen states where the Vermont senator is still expected to do well .\nThat list begins with Arizona on March 22 , and Sanders addressed a wildly enthusiastic crowd in Phoenix on Tuesday night . Speaking for nearly an hour , Sanders visited his proven themes : Wall Street power , corruption in campaign finance , a `` rigged economy '' and income inequality . But he did not mention the results of that day 's primaries .\nIn her speech , Clinton sounded as if Sanders were once again in her rearview mirror and her gaze was fixed forward on November and Trump .\n`` When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants , banning all Muslims from entering the United States , when he embraces torture , that does n't make him strong , it makes him wrong , '' she told the crowd .\nNot far away , at his Mar-a-Lago Club 's ornate ballroom , Trump hailed his victories as well . `` We 're going to win and win and win for our country , '' Trump said . He urged Republicans everywhere to unite behind his candidacy , adding that he 'd had friendly telephone calls with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell .\n`` We have to bring our party together , '' said Trump , suddenly earnest about unity . `` We have something that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story in the world . ''\nTrump was certainly the biggest story in the Republican world again this week . Even without allocating Missouri 's delegates , Trump now leads his nearest competitor by 225 delegates , with no sign of slowing down .\nIt is now all but impossible for anyone but Trump to reach the 1,237 delegates needed for nomination . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has a mathematical chance , but it is remote . No other candidate has even that .\nIn a field of Republican candidates that initially numbered 17 , Trump has now outlasted all but Cruz and Ohio Gov . John Kasich , who won his home state last night \u2014 his first first-place finish of the year .\nNot so fortunate was Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , once thought the rising star of the party and the last hope of its establishment element after older and more experienced office holders fell by the wayside . Rubio had made Florida 's winner-take-all primary his last stand .\nOn Tuesday night , having lost to Trump in most every demographic in a 19-point beatdown , Rubio tried to console his grieving supporters . He told them the Republican establishment had failed to understand the pent-up anger of conservatives .\n`` From a political standpoint , the easiest thing to have done in this campaign is to jump on all of those anxieties , '' Rubio said , adding that he had rejected that approach for a campaign of hope and aspiration .\n`` I ask the American people do not give in to the fear , do not give in to the frustration . The politics of resentment against other people will not just leave us a fractured party \u2014 they 're going to leave us a fractured nation . ''\nRubio made clear he would be interested in running again . But in the near term , he will need to deal with the resentment of Cruz supporters who may blame him for dividing the anti-Trump vote in recent contests . Internet threads and social media sites were filled with arguments between backers of the two rival Cuban-American candidates , born five months apart and now both first-term senators .\nNo states were called for Cruz on Tuesday night , but he did finish second in three and add modestly to his stash of delegates .\n`` Only two campaigns have a plausible path to the nomination : ours and Donald Trump 's , '' Cruz said . `` Nobody else has any mathematical possibility whatsoever . '' Cruz added an appeal to those who had backed Rubio to join him .\n`` We welcome you with open and welcoming arms , '' Cruz said , inviting backers of other former candidates as well .\nNeither Trump nor Cruz seemed overly concerned with the third candidate still in the Republican race , Kasich , who remains far behind with just 138 delegates to date . Clearly , the Kasich hope is to stay alive through the remaining primaries and caucuses , winning here and there and arriving in Cleveland as the hometown `` favorite son '' in position to be a dark-horse alternative to Trump and Cruz \u2014 both of whom are off-putting to many mainstream Republican donors and office holders .\nHe also has the benefit of representing a swing state , or what might be called the ultimate swing state . When you listen to people talk about American politics , you will hear someone say `` it all comes down to Ohio . '' Because it often does .\nMost recently , in 2004 , flipping just over 100,000 votes in the Buckeye State would have made John Kerry president and denied George W. Bush a second term . And no Republican has ever won the White House without carrying Ohio .
