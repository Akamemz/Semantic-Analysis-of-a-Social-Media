It was n't just the military tanks , jet flyovers or the speech by President Donald Trump .\nThe president 's role in what is usually a nonpartisan celebration created what felt like three different events : Protesters who decried his administration and its policies ; a campaign rally where supporters cheered for him to keep the White House for another term ; and those who simply wanted to enjoy hot dogs and fireworks with their families for the annual Independence Day festivities .\nOn a holiday marking America 's birthday , the country 's divisions were on full display .\nThere was a giant blimp depicting the president as an orange infant . There was also a sea of red , `` Make America Great Again '' hats . And there were families spread out along the National Mall with blankets and children anxiously awaiting the fireworks display and not focused on politics .\nWhen the protesters and Trump supporters clashed over a flag burning in front of the White House , there were two arrests , although most confrontations did not go beyond shouting matches .\n'Nothing America can not do ' : Donald Trump touts U.S. military strength in 4th of July speech\nUh-oh : Donald Trump trips up on history in 4th of July speech , mentions airports during Revolutionary War\nTrump 's influence on the annual celebrations were easy to spot .\nSupporters poured into the National Mall throughout the day , many waving `` Trump 2020 '' flags or wearing `` MAGA '' hats .
