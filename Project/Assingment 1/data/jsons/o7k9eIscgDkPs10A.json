The effort comes just as the president capped off a month filled with racially divisive language and Twitter taunts aimed at House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings and four freshman congresswomen of color .\nCritics may find the timing of the outreach outrageous . But the campaign hopes that if it can shave just a few percentage points off Democrats \u2019 overwhelming support among black voters , it can boost voter turnout in eight or so key states such as Michigan , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 each of which Trump won in 2016 by less than 1 percentage point .\nThe campaign \u2019 s pitch to African Americans is simple : Ignore the president \u2019 s words and instead focus on his policies , the state of the economy , the low unemployment rate , the passage of criminal justice reform and the creation of Opportunity Zones , which are meant to bolster investment in underserved or poorer cities .\nWhen Trump took office in January 2017 , the unemployment rate among African Americans was 7.7 percent . Friday \u2019 s jobs report pegged it at 6 percent for July .\n\u201c Do I think some of his verbal formulations are inartful ? Yeah , \u201d said Ken Blackwell , the former mayor of Cincinnati , former Ohio secretary of state and a top Trump transition official . \u201c But for me , as a domestic policy adviser during the Trump transition , it has been all about the agenda , a set of results and tomorrow . You have to believe his policy agenda flies in the face of the false narrative of the racist in charge . \u201d\nBut for others , Trump 's rhetoric can not be divorced from his record , and critics argue he must take responsibility for that as president .
