    "content_original": "The Trump administration gave the Keystone XL pipeline its key federal permit Friday, clearing a major hurdle for the project that former President Obama rejected in 2015.\n\nThe State Department announced Friday morning that its undersecretary for political affairs, Tom Shannon, issued the permit, two months after President Trump signed a memorandum to revive the project after Obama\u2019s rejection.\n\n\u201cIn making his determination that issuance of this permit would serve the national interest, the under secretary considered a range of factors, including but not limited to foreign policy; energy security; environmental, cultural, and economic impacts; and compliance with applicable law and policy,\u201d State said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe decision closes a significant chapter in the long-running saga over the controversial oil sands pipeline, which has been a flashpoint in the debate surrounding climate change and dependence on foreign oil.\n\nObama rejected the application in November 2015, arguing, in part, that it would harm the United States' standing in the world as a leader in fighting climate change.\n\n\u201cUltimately, if we\u2019re going to prevent large parts of this Earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we\u2019re going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them and release more dangerous pollution into the sky,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nThe approval fulfills a major campaign promise of Trump's and a top priority that congressional Republicans and the oil industry have had for years.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant milestone for the Keystone XL project,\u201d Russ Girling, president of Keystone\u2019s developer, Canada-based TransCanada Corp., said in a statement. \u201cWe greatly appreciate President Trump's Administration for reviewing and approving this important initiative and we look forward to working with them as we continue to invest in and strengthen North America's energy infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe 875-mile line would carry up to 830,000 barrels a day of heavy oil sands petroleum from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska.

State officials in Nebraska still have to approve the line\u2019s route through that state, something that could take another six months.\n\nEnvironmentalists might also sue to stop the construction.\n\n\u201cThe Keystone XL tar sands pipeline was a terrible idea when it was first proposed nearly ten years ago, and it\u2019s an even worse idea today. This dirty and dangerous export pipeline would run right through America\u2019s heartland, threatening our water, our land, and our climate \u2014 all to pad the profits of a foreign oil company,\u201d said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters.\n\n\u201cThis pipeline is all risk and no reward, and we will continue to fight it every step of the way,\u201d she said.\n\nThe business community welcomed the approval.\n\n\u201cAfter many years of unfortunate delays and partisan posturing, Keystone XL pipeline finally got the green light it has long deserved,\u201d U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue said in a statement. \u201cThis pipeline, and countless other projects around the nation, will improve America\u2019s energy security, create jobs, and help get the economy back on track.\u201d\n\nThe State Department previous estimated that the project would create 42,100 jobs.
