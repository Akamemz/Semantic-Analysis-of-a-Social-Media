We are compelled to change people \u2019 s minds because otherwise we have to accept enormous limitations on the effect that we can have on other people . But if you think about it \u2013 this is my great revelation \u2013 it \u2019 s like trying to make somebody fall in love with you who doesn \u2019 t . You can \u2019 t do it !

It \u2019 s in a way , it \u2019 s radically respecting the other person \u2019 s selfhood .\nI learned this from personal experience because I \u2019 ve been married to a conservative commentator for 39 years . And I change people \u2019 s minds for a living , that \u2019 s what I do . So of course I thought , with total arrogance , that I could certainly change his \u2013 an intelligent guy like this . And for the first , I would say probably for the first 10 years , I really gave it the old college try .\nWith you and Richard , what is the difference of values between you ?\nIf I thought that we had fundamentally different values , I couldn \u2019 t be with him . I think this is the main idea in my book . I have a chapter called \u201c What is a core value ? \u201d And to me a core value is not your political philosophy .\nThere was one person I interviewed who really embodied this , a young woman , and her father was a dear friend of mine . He died a very terrible death . He had five brothers and sisters , all of whom were progressives and she totally identified with these people . He had one brother who had moved to the South , converted to evangelical Christianity , and was in the military . Guess who was the only person who showed up to help her ? And he left his wife and his five children far away and came . Not one of the progressives \u2013 she knew them well \u2013 lifted a finger . And this was not lost on her .\nThey had been fighting on Facebook about all kinds of stuff . She made a heartfelt apology to him . She said , \u201c I have misjudged you. \u201d So she found out that they really did share core values even though they had a lot of things not in common , the things that were the fundamental human values .\nSo , to understand where people are coming from , you have to have mutual respect ?\nYou don \u2019 t start trying to understand the other person , you first start understanding yourself . Your own prejudices , your own resistance , the way that you are obnoxious . For instance , if you take an article from your point of view and you stick it in the face of the other person at the breakfast table , or send it to them on e-mail or whatever , and you expect that this is going to be a way to have a dialogue . It has never worked yet .\nHas social media made it more difficult to have real dialogue ?\nI have eight commandments . And one of them is , \u201c avoid social media. \u201d Do not read what the other person says . You know what they \u2019 re gon na say . Consider it like their diary . Stay away from that and , whatever you do , do not \u201c unfriend. \u201d It is a disaster . People are devastated . It \u2019 s very hard to fix . And if you have something to say to somebody , I say go analog . That is , write him a letter . Call him on the telephone . Or go and see them . And I counsel people to do this . And I think I saved a few relationships that way .\nSo it is possible to preserve relationships in this fraught era ?\nI did not expect this because I \u2019 m not the biggest optimist . I can give you some examples of some of them where I really thought it was hopeless . I often told them what to do .
