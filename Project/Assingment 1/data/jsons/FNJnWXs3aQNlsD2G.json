In many states , teenagers are allowed to own a car in their name at the age of 16 , not to mention it is n't impossible to rent a car before age 25 , it just costs more . There are already laws on the books when it comes to firearms purchases and in many states people can purchase a handgun or rifle at the age of 18 , taking full advantage of their Second Amendment rights just as they would take advantage of their right to vote . Other states require a person be 21 before being able to legally purchase a firearm .\nAccording to the National Shooting Sports Foundation , 21.8 percent of target shooters in America are under the age of 25 .
