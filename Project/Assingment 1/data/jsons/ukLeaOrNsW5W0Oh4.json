    "content": "A great many Americans know the compelling story of Joseph and his brothers . Some know it well from their childhood Bible studies in synagogue , yeshiva , church , religious school \u2014 or even having had parents read Bible passages to them every night or weekend when they were growing up . Even more know the story presumably from an Andrew Lloyd Weber Broadway musical . And even more Americans than those in the above groups probably would ask Jesse Watters , \u201c Isn \u2019 t that the guy who got the raincoat ? \u201d Regardless\u2026\nThere is a powerful underlying theme in that Torah narrative . Joseph \u2019 s brothers fear that he is a false prophet , and they sell him into slavery . In short order , he ends up incarcerated in an Egyptian prison with perhaps no hope left for freedom . While locked up , he meets two artisans who have dreamt the identical dream , interprets the imagery they describe , and predicts what will unfold . His prophecies rapidly come true : The wine steward , as predicted , is restored to the Pharaoh \u2019 s service , and the baker is hanged . Two years later , the Pharaoh ( whom most Americans associate with Elvis , thanks to the musical ) himself dreams two disturbing visions , and no one can interpret the dreams convincingly . At Pharaoh \u2019 s side , his now-trusted wine steward tells him that there is some Jew in the lock-up who is the greatest expert dream interpreter , and Pharaoh has Joseph cleaned up and brought out .\nJoseph predicts that a terrible famine will be coming after the immediately forthcoming seven years of plenty , and the Pharaoh is so impressed by how the prognostication fits the dreams that he elevates Joseph to Viceroy , the second highest government position in the empire . By nine years later , with the second year of famine now devastating the region and people dying of hunger , people all over the Middle East flock to Egypt , desperately begging Joseph for food . Among the supplicants , Joseph \u2019 s brothers come down to Egypt to beg . After a few songs in the style of Maurice Chevalier and Reggae , Joseph saves their lives by personally ordering that they be supplied with an abundance of life-saving food . Years later , when the patriarch Jacob passes away , the brothers fear that , now that Dad is gone , the all-powerful Viceroy Joseph will take revenge on them for selling him into slavery four decades earlier . Dad will not be there to protect them . But Joseph reassures them in approximately these words : \u201c Fear not . I am not G-d Who judges . And , besides , you sold me into slavery because you wanted to harm me . You meant it for evil . But G-d meant it all for the good , so that I miraculously would be positioned uniquely to save a whole bunch of people \u2014 including our entire family. \u201d ( Gen. 50:19-20 ) You meant it for evil , but G-d meant it for good .\nI come not to bury Hillary Clinton , James Comey , Chuck Schumer , and Nancy Pelosi but to praise them .\nEvery established pundit predicted that Donald Trump never would win the Republican nomination for President in 2016 \u2014 and , if he somehow would win the nomination by miracle , he would get clobbered in the general election . The Year 2016 was Hillary \u2019 s turn . She had waited in Arkansas , watching her huckster husband serve as governor , even as he serviced some of the locals . That made her the state \u2019 s First Lady . She practiced law at a firm where billing records got lost conveniently during criminal investigations into defalcations . With her husband earning less than any other American governor ( $ 35,000 a year ) , she invested $ 1,000 in cattle futures and made $ 100,000 \u2014 a return whose odds , if her trading instead had been honest , would be one in 31 trillion . In time , the Comeback Kid got elected President , and she moved with him to the White House , kind-of like the Clampetts . She then finagled throughout the ensuing eight years , messed up healthcare legislation so badly that the 1994 Republicans recaptured Congress for the first time in forty years , and she even took the American people \u2019 s furniture with her to New York when her two terms were up .\nHaving moved to liberal Democrat New York , she easily got elected United States Senator based on the above r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 plus other extras in her curriculum vitae : Travelgate , having arrived in Bosnia under gunfire , having been named for Sir Edmund Hillary , and so many other falsifications that she burned out the batteries on the lie detectors . In other words , she had no qualifications other than having been married to a President . Truly the personification of a woman achieving equal status based on her own merits .\nNext it was her time to be President in 2008 , so she and the Comeback Kid changed Democrat primary rules to give enhanced influence to \u201c caucuses \u201d over straight-out fair voting . In a caucus , people have to hang around for hours to be counted , and that process always gives a disproportionate advantage to the candidate whose supporters are most passionate and energized . Because we never before had a woman President , the Clintons expected that the new caucuses would play to her advantage , revving up excitement \u2014 Wow , a Woman President ! Alas , she did not anticipate Barack Obama \u2014 Wow , a Black President ! \u2014 and she lost .\nObama made her his Secretary of State not because she had any particular foreign-affairs experience . Indeed , she and her husband had been focused mostly on his domestic affairs \u2014 Gennifer Flowers , Paula Corbin Jones , Kathleen Willey , Juanita Broaddrick , Monica Lewinsky . But Obama had a greater purpose , actually quite clever : By making her Secretary of State , he basically got her out of the country for several years . Her service in State was utterly undistinguished . The reset with Russia was a joke . She messed up Middle East talks and screamed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone for half an hour . As we look back , there is no Clinton Doctrine to remember , no accomplishments \u2014 not even too many bad ones . It would seem that most of her time was spent learning how to text and planning for a wedding that required 33,000 emails . And of course she oversaw our relations with Libya and Benghazi .\nFinally , 2016 finally , finally was her time to be President . It finally was her turn . But even more than her email scandal , more than her \u201c Weekend at Bernie \u2019 s \u201d collapse at that curb and being stuffed into that car on 9/11 , her forgetting to campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin , and her remarkable gaffe calling half the country she would lead \u201c a basketful of Deplorables , \u201d there was one overriding reason she lost : By and large , objectively , Hillary Clinton is despised . People just do not like her . She is phony . Her laugh is phony . Her pledges are phony . Her assertion that she stands for women \u2019 s rights is most phony : As an attorney , she helped a child molester and rapist get off light and then giggled about it as she remembered it years later . Her \u201c Faith Advisor \u201d ( nice job if you can get it ! ) sent her two or three Biblical passages a day ( \u201c And the L-rd spoke to Moses , saying \u201d ) , and otherwise harassed women \u2014 and she dealt with his physical batteries against women by reassigning the woman who complained . And what verses did the Faith Advisor send her as she infamously coordinated character assassinations of the women whom her husband sexually abused ? \u201c And the L-rd spoke to Moses , saying \u201d ?\nIt is more than a year since the election of Donald Trump . Do not underestimate all the pundits who said that a seasoned Democrat would have defeated Donald Trump . Looking back , one of the greatest blessings , even a miracle , that ever unfolded for American conservatives \u2014 who desperately needed to recapture the White House , drain the swamp , and reverse Obama \u2019 s eight years of tyrannical executive orders and the corruption in his \u201c Justice \u201d Department and Eric Holder ( \u201c Fast and Furious \u201d ) and Loretta Lynch ( tarmac discussions about the grandchildren ) and Bruce Ohr and Nellie Ohr , Obama \u2019 s FBI ( Strzok and Page and McCabe and all the others ) , their abuse of the FISA court , his IRS and Lois Lerner , his Department of Energy , his Department of Education , his immigration mess \u2014 was the miracle that Hillary was the Democrats \u2019 candidate against Trump . She was that hated .\nBe grateful every day that Hillary Clinton , in service to her country , ran as the Democrats \u2019 standard bearer in 2016 .\nHillary Clinton perpetrated federal crimes by removing top secret Government documents and records from secure sites . Although most bathrooms in most homes are private , her server in her bathroom did not meet the federal standard . At the very least , her gross negligence in handling the 33,000 yoga and wedding dress emails should have prompted FBI Director James Comey to urge the convening of a grand jury . If the \u201c fix \u201d had not been in for Clinton even months before Comey \u2019 s \u201c investigation \u201d had begun , the FBI would not have given her associates promises of immunity without something in return , and she would have been compelled to speak to the FBI under oath , exposing her to further prosecution for perjury , exactly as the FBI later did to Michael Flynn .\nBut pause a moment and think : What if Comey had been honest ? If Comey had been honest , Clinton would have been tied up with a grand jury , probably indicted , and would have been making inquiries of Obama whether any remaining White House furniture would fit in a prison cell . With Hillary then being removed from the Presidential campaign midway through the election cycle , Vice President Joe Biden ultimately would have been drafted to run against Donald Trump . Conservatives do not like Joe Biden \u2019 s politics and mock his gaffes , but Joe Biden very possibly would have won the election . Biden is one of the nicest , most lovable public figures around . Again , go and hate his politics , his meandering lies about Republicans wanting blacks to be back in chains , his declaration at the Democrat convention that ISIS had been destroyed , but the man , as a person , is a very likable guy . He really is a nice guy , one of the nicest public figures in Washington . Moreover , he has a compelling story about personal tragedy he has faced and overcome , and that story had just been amplified when his beloved and gifted son passed away .\nIf Comey had been honest , Hillary now would be in a striped orange pantsuit , bleaching emails and planning weddings , and Joe Biden would be President of the United States . Be grateful every day that James Comey , in service to his country , manipulated justice so that Hillary would remain the Democrats \u2019 candidate against Donald Trump .\nWith President Trump elected , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , supposedly a moderate , allowed himself to get pulled into leading \u201c The Resistance. \u201d In his role , he effectively has forced Democrats in the Senate to oppose everything President Trump has initiated . He has pursued the cynical defamation that Donald Trump colluded with Russians to win the 2016 election . Had Schumer not done so , the American people never would have discovered Obamagate \u2014 the extent of corruption existing at the highest echelons of the Obama \u201c Justice \u201d Department and the FBI . Had Schumer not been so determined to resist any reasonable deal-making with the President , he never would have forced each and every Democrat United States Senator to vote against the Trump tax cuts and tax-reform package . But Schumer whipped his senators into line and forced them to resist .\nNow Claire McCaskill ( Missouri ) , Heidi Heitkamp ( North Dakota ) , Joe Manchin ( West Virginia ) , Jon Tester ( Montana ) , Bill Nelson ( Florida ) , Sherrod Brown ( Ohio ) , Joe Donnelly ( Indiana ) , and other Democrats up for reelection in pro-Trump conservative states have to explain why they voted against the tax cuts that have put substantial bonuses , wage increases , enhanced benefits packages , and reduced federal withholding into the pockets of tens of millions of Americans , even as billions are being repatriated to the United States , new investment is booming , and the economy is defying the usual cyclical expectation that a recovery has run its course .\nIf Schumer had been just a bit more reasonable , Democrats seeking reelection this November would be much more competitively positioned . Be grateful every day that Chuck Schumer , in service to his country , has led the Senate Democrats in a Resistance that will topple Democrat incumbents who otherwise would have been better situated to win .\nPray for her every day . Pray for her health , her sustenance , her strength . Pray that her voice remains strong so that she can speak into microphones daily . Pray that her hands remain steady so that she can sit on them for ninety minutes while a President reports to the nation that the economy is robust , that black unemployment is at its lowest level ever recorded , that the flag waves majestically , that criminal gangs comprised of Illegal Immigrants are being thrown out of the country . Pray that she continues that thing where she seems to suck her own face . And pray that she continues telling Americans that the thousand-dollar bonuses they have been given by their employers are \u201c crumbs , \u201d that their wage hikes are crumbs , that their increased take-home pay is crumbs . Nearly 70 percent of all American households have less than $ 1,000 in life savings . Pelosi \u2019 s net worth is between $ 20 million and $ 120 million . As roles have reversed and the Republicans have become the party of common hard-working families while Democrats have become the party of the billionaires \u2014 the likes of Buffett , Bezos , Soros , and the billionaires in Silicon Valley and Wall Street \u2014 pray daily that Nancy Pelosi remains strong and at least semi-coherent .\nAs the Obamagate Scandal now exposes truth and light on sordid corruption at the highest echelons of America \u2019 s law-enforcement apparatus , a corruption that is reminiscent of how Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler both manipulated their respective secret police services to spy on and destroy their political opponents , I am grateful for the four unsung heroes in this musical : Crooked Hillary , James Comey , Schumer , and Pelosi . Each of them has acted with the secret intent to do evil , and machinations of each have proven instead to be the blessings that give us a chance to recover our country , our national culture , and restore an America that we came very close to losing on the eve of 2016 .",
