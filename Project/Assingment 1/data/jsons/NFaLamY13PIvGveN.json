    "content": "The debate didn \u2019 t exactly go as District Attorney Jackie Lacey had planned . Lacey , onstage at the Aratani Theatre in Los Angeles on January 29 , struggled to complete a sentence before protesters started yelling again . \u201c Jackie Lacey must go ! \u201d they chanted . One 71-year-old man rushed toward the stage after shouting about the more than 500 people who activists say have been killed by law enforcement under Lacey \u2019 s tenure . \u201c You were supposed to meet with us six months ago ! \u201d he yelled as security dragged him away . A woman with straight black hair rose from her seat demanding justice for her dead son . Security hauled her out of the room , too , along with about a dozen other demonstrators , many of them members of Black Lives Matter .\nLacey , the first African American person and the first woman to become district attorney in Los Angeles , was elected eight years ago with strong backing from communities of color . But since then , she has opposed state reforms to lower the prison population and declined to charge almost all officers accused of fatal shootings . As the LA County district attorney \u2019 s primary approaches , tensions have been mounting between her office and Black Lives Matter protesters . To top things off , Lacey faces stiff competition from San Francisco \u2019 s former district attorney , George Gasc\u00f3n , as well as reformist darling Rachel Rossi .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c the single most important DA race in the country , \u201d says Patrisse Cullors , a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement .\nPatrisse Cullors , a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement , described the election as \u201c the single most important DA race in the country. \u201d Los Angeles has the nation \u2019 s biggest prosecutor \u2019 s office by far , and its biggest jail , making it a top prize for reformists who have launched campaigns from Chicago to Philadelphia to Brooklyn to put progressive lawyers at the head of traditionally tough-on-crime district attorney \u2019 s offices . The race is also important for the future of police accountability : Los Angeles sees more fatal officer-involved shootings than just about anywhere else in America . Prosecutors\u2014led by the district attorney\u2014are the ones who decide whether to press charges against cops who kill .\nPolice shootings have become a focal point of the race . Nationally , it \u2019 s extremely rare for prosecutors to charge police who kill . But incumbent district attorneys with poor track records on this issue have lost elections elsewhere in recent years after high-profile shootings of unarmed black teens like Laquan McDonald and Michael Brown . After she declined to charge hundreds of officers , including one who shot a homeless , unarmed black man , Lacey now faces the same threat . \u201c It could be a real liability for her , \u201d says Rachel Barkow , a law professor at NYU who writes about efforts to reform district attorney \u2019 s offices . \u201c Jackie Lacey promised reform but has continued\u2026fueling mass incarceration and destroying black and brown communities in Los Angeles , \u201d Cullors tweeted . Lacey counts Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti , California Sen. Dianne Feinstein , San Francisco Mayor London Breed , and the local union that represents police officers among her supporters . But she \u201c has run from us at every turn , \u201d says Melina Abdullah , a co-founder of Black Lives Matter LA , which does not endorse candidates but has protested outside Lacey \u2019 s office for years .\nIn an unusual twist for an election that hinges on police reform , Gasc\u00f3n , the progressive candidate viewed as Lacey \u2019 s biggest challenger , is a white-haired former Los Angeles police officer . Even so , he has support from the LA County Democratic Party , progressive district attorneys like Larry Krasner in Philadelphia , and BLM \u2019 s Cullors , along with Sen. Kamala Harris . Lacey \u2019 s second challenger , Rossi , is a public defender who is also endorsed by Cullors and has strong backing by grassroots activists , but she lacks the statewide profile and funding of the other two candidates . The top-two finishers in the March 3 primary will go head-to-head in November , unless one of them receives more than half the total vote .\nGasc\u00f3n , who served for decades as an officer and a police chief , is now pitching himself as one of the country \u2019 s most liberal prosecutors on matters of police accountability . And people like Abdullah are paying attention . \u201c We are saying almost anybody would be better than Jackie Lacey , \u201d she says\u2014 \u201c including a former cop . \u201d\nLacey has childhood roots in Los Angeles \u2019 Crenshaw neighborhood , near plenty of gang violence . Her dad was a sanitation worker , and her mom worked in a garment factory . Lacey grew to understand why her neighbors distrusted the police : She watched the Watts riots on television when she was eight , along with protests led by Martin Luther King Jr. , where officers released attack dogs and fire hoses on black demonstrators . But she also developed a respect for law enforcement , especially after her dad was shot in the leg while mowing the lawn . \u201c People in the community knew , \u2018 Hey , if something \u2019 s going on , call the cops , \u2019 \u201d Lacey told the Los Angeles Times in 2016 . After law school , she joined the Los Angeles district attorney as a line prosecutor in 1986 , working her way up the ranks .\nLos Angeles voters elected Lacey as district attorney in 2012 , just before the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement . Many black activists , including Abdullah and others who would later join BLM , hoped Lacey would bring fresh perspective to a district attorney \u2019 s office that had been run by men since 1850 . Hip-hop mogul Sean \u201c Diddy \u201d Combs and basketball star Magic Johnson congratulated her , while R & B singer Macy Gray performed at her election night party .\nBut Lacey \u2019 s reluctance to crack down on officers involved in fatal shootings quickly drew criticism from activists . Her standing with Black Lives Matter took a turn for the worse in 2015 . A video emerged of a Highway Patrol officer repeatedly punching a mentally ill black woman on a freeway . Lacey \u2019 s office found that he was justified in using force to keep her from stepping into traffic . BLM protesters poured in to protest and shut down another freeway in Los Angeles . That year , an LAPD officer also shot and killed an unarmed , black homeless man near the Venice boardwalk ; in a highly unusual move , the department \u2019 s police chief recommended that Lacey press charges against the officer , but she later decided not to . She said there was not enough evidence to prove he violated the law , which was weighted heavily in favor of police .\nProtesters say Lacey ran from them or pushed them away after shootings , rather than hearing them out . In 2016 , Black Lives Matter collected hundreds of signatures urging Lacey to prosecute the officers who fired 20 rounds into Kisha Michael , 31 , and her boyfriend as they appeared to sleep inside a parked Chevy Malibu . But when the activists brought the signatures to Lacey \u2019 s office , security officers blocked them from entering , says Abdullah , one of the organizers . ( Lacey \u2019 s campaign still hasn \u2019 t responded to my request for comment about the incident or answered any other questions . )\n\u201c You \u2019 re a race traitor , \u201d one woman yelled to Lacey at a 2016 town hall .\nThe relationship continued to sour . At a town hall that October , people shouted at Lacey as she tried to speak to a crowd of activists and victims \u2019 family members in a community center . \u201c You \u2019 re a race traitor , \u201d a woman yelled , as reported in the San Diego Union-Tribune . \u201c You help killer cops ! \u201d others chanted . When Lacey said she could understand their anger , a boy screamed , \u201c No , you don \u2019 t ! \u201d Her voice became quieter . \u201c I \u2019 m just one woman who \u2019 s trying to follow the law , who \u2019 s trying to listen , who \u2019 s trying to do the right thing , \u201d she said . But as the boos continued , she folded her arms across her chest , told the audience it was being \u201c patronizing and insulting , \u201d and walked out of the room .\nLacey was reelected the next month without a challenger and survived a recall attempt in 2017 . But the protesters did not let up . Some went to her home and used a projector to beam the words \u201c Jackie Lacey Must Go \u201d onto her garage door . ( The phrase also became a hashtag on Twitter . ) She made plans for another town hall in early 2018 , but when the time came , she didn \u2019 t show . By the middle of that year , Los Angeles law enforcement officers were involved in their 1,500th shooting since 2000 . None of them had ever been prosecuted . \u201c She is dismissing her constituency , \u201d says Akili , the 71-year-old Black Lives Matter activist who rushed to the stage at the January debate and goes by his last name . \u201c If you don \u2019 t take no action , \u201d he told me , referring to Lacey , \u201c then the assumption is you can kill us , for whatever reason , and it \u2019 s okay . \u201d\nLacey finally took a stand in December 2018 . She filed manslaughter charges against a sheriff \u2019 s deputy who had approached a car he believed was stolen and fired at the driver pulling away . \u201c We believe the officer \u2019 s use of deadly force was unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances , \u201d she said when she announced charges . But it was not enough for some Black Lives Matter activists , who remembered the hundreds of other cases she dismissed . \u201c We really tried to get her to help us understand what barriers there were \u201d to prosecuting police , Abdullah says . \u201c And then when nothing happened , when we \u2019 re getting into hundreds of murders and she \u2019 s not prosecuting , then we recognized it \u2019 s not just a matter of limitations ; it \u2019 s a matter of her unwillingness . \u201d\nHelen Jones , the woman who was escorted out of the January debate by security , and another Black Lives Matter member , says she has been protesting outside Lacey \u2019 s office for over two years now . \u201c She just ignored us . \u201d\n\u201c People can talk trash , but what they will do when the pressure is on is different , \u201d Lacey said .\nAt the debate , Lacey \u2019 s record on police came up repeatedly . Gasc\u00f3n said he would have at least pressed charges against the Venice boardwalk officer , and described Lacey as a \u201c district attorney that is comfortable looking away. \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s simply not true , \u201d Lacey said in response . \u201c People can talk trash , but what they will do when the pressure is on is different . \u201d\nGasc\u00f3n never thought he would become a cop . As a boy living under Fidel Castro \u2019 s regime in Havana in the 1960s , he watched as Cuban police beat protesters in the streets and even jailed his own father and uncle . His family moved to Los Angeles when he was 13 . Speaking only faltering English , he dropped out of high school and enlisted in the Army , with plans to become a history teacher . Then a childhood friend in the LAPD convinced him to join the department . He patrolled the Hollywood Division while earning a law degree , and eventually rose through the ranks to assistant chief .\nA scandal at the LAPD changed how Gasc\u00f3n would come to see the relationship between prosecutors and police . In 1999 , Officer Rafael Perez , facing charges for stealing $ 1 million worth of cocaine from police evidence storage , signed a deal agreeing to help identify other corrupt officers within the department . He went on to implicate 70 officers in the Rampart Division of misconduct , from unprovoked shootings to perjury . Gasc\u00f3n , then a captain , was not accused of wrongdoing , and he joined a team tasked with investigating failures in the department \u2019 s management that had allowed the corruption to spread . He realized that prosecutors had seen signs of misconduct and looked the other way , allowing some tainted cops to testify in court . More than a hundred convictions were thrown out .\n\u201c It was one of those \u2018 aha moments \u2019 for me , \u201d he told me via phone call in February . \u201c Nobody questioned [ the police ] because it \u2019 s almost like there \u2019 s this theory within law enforcement that you \u2019 re fighting evil and therefore you \u2019 re justified . \u201d\nWhen Gasc\u00f3n replaced Kamala Harris as district attorney in San Francisco in 2011 , after two stints as a police chief there and in Arizona , he pushed for key reforms to lower California \u2019 s ballooning prison populations . That year , the Supreme Court ruled that the state \u2019 s prisons were so overcrowded they were essentially a form of cruel and unusual punishment . One of Gasc\u00f3n \u2019 s biggest accomplishments was co-authoring a statewide ballot measure that reduced punishments for certain drug crimes , allowing more people to stay out of prison . ( Lacey opposed the measure , called Proposition 47 . ) He also won praise from progressives for expunging minor marijuana convictions and using technology to address racial bias among his prosecutors .\nBut police accountability remained a major challenge . By the numbers , Gasc\u00f3n \u2019 s record on charging officers for fatal shootings is no better than Lacey \u2019 s . He didn \u2019 t charge any of them , including when five officers fired 20 bullets into 26-year-old Mario Woods\u2014a killing that sparked protests across the Bay Area . Gasc\u00f3n said California law also prevented him from prosecuting the officers who killed Luis G\u00f3ngora Pat , an immigrant in a homeless encampment . But in an unusual move for a district attorney , Gasc\u00f3n announced to the public that he believed these killings were wrong and unnecessary . \u201c To the Woods family and the G\u00f3ngora family , there are not enough words that I can say that are going to bring their loved ones back , \u201d Gasc\u00f3n said in 2018 . \u201c I \u2019 m very sorry they lost a son , they lost a brother , a friend , because I don \u2019 t believe that was necessary . \u201d\nThen , in 2019 , a state lawmaker , Shirley Weber , introduced a bill that would make it much harder for law enforcement to get away with fatal shootings . Previously , California officers , like officers in most states , could use deadly force if they \u201c reasonably \u201d feared for their safety , regardless of whether they were actually in danger . Under the new bill , they could be prosecuted if they used deadly force that wasn \u2019 t \u201c necessary \u201d to protect against an imminent threat of serious injury . \u201c Necessary \u201d was defined as the absence of a \u201c reasonable alternative . \u201d\nThe measure would give California the nation \u2019 s toughest restrictions on police use-of-force .\nThe measure would give California the nation \u2019 s toughest restrictions on police use-of-force . Gasc\u00f3n was the only district attorney to publicly support it . \u201c It \u2019 s pretty rare for DAs around the country to support legislation that would allow greater charges to be brought against law enforcement officers , \u201d says Barkow , the NYU professor , noting that prosecutors rely on law enforcement to help them gather evidence for other cases on their docket .\nPolice unions , predictably , opposed the bill and convinced lawmakers to water it down . The amended version still allowed officers to use force only when \u201c necessary , \u201d but no longer defined that term , leading some Black Lives Matter activists to describe it as toothless . Lacey supported the watered-down version , which Gov . Gavin Newsom signed into law .\nBoth Gasc\u00f3n and Rossi , the public defender candidate , believe a stronger law is needed . In Los Angeles , Gasc\u00f3n proposes a county-wide standard that would go further than the state law by allowing officers to use lethal force only as a last resort . \u201c We need a prosecutor who \u2019 s gon na argue for an expansive definition of what \u2018 necessary \u2019 means , \u201d Rossi said during the January debate . In a sign of law enforcement \u2019 s unease with Gasc\u00f3n , the union representing the LAPD has contributed $ 1 million toward an anti-Gasc\u00f3n super-PAC . Lacey , meanwhile , is benefiting from police donations : Almost all of the $ 2.2 million in contributions to outside committees supporting her have come from law enforcement unions .\nAlmost all of the $ 2.2 million in contributions to outside committees supporting Lacey have come from law enforcement unions .\nGasc\u00f3n and Rossi both believe officer-involved shootings should not be investigated by prosecutors who work with the police on other cases , since that creates a conflict of interest ; Gasc\u00f3n created an independent unit within the district attorney \u2019 s office in San Francisco to conduct these investigations . And both have pledged not to use the testimony of officers with a history of certain misconduct . They say they would create a \u201c do not call \u201d list of disreputable officers , something Black Lives Matter has pressured Lacey to do , unsuccessfully . Activists have also lambasted Lacey \u2019 s record of sending 22 people to death row , all of them people of color ; Gasc\u00f3n and Rossi have pledged not to use the death penalty .\nAs the primary nears , Gasc\u00f3n has tried to show how far he \u2019 s come since his early days as a beat cop . \u201c He actually became pretty emotional talking about his role advancing the war on drugs , and how he understands things differently now , \u201d says Abdullah , who attended a meeting he had with Black Lives Matter members . \u201c I don \u2019 t know how much of that is campaign and how much of that is real , but I believed him . \u201d\nDuring her campaign , Lacey has not met publicly with Black Lives Matter members or families reeling from the fallout of officer-involved shootings . She also missed other debates with her challengers . Every Wednesday , Black Lives Matter protesters continue to demonstrate outside her office . Helen Jones shows up to lament the death of her son . He died in sheriff \u2019 s custody in 2009 , after he was found hanging in his jail cell ; Jones alleges officers staged a suicide to cover up a fatal beating . The county paid her a $ 2 million settlement but admitted no wrongdoing . She still wants the officers prosecuted , something Lacey declined to do . \u201c They brutally beat my son to death and are getting away with it , \u201d Jones says .\nTo Jones , standing up during the debate was the only way she could get Lacey \u2019 s attention . \u201c We can \u2019 t catch Jackie Lacey , \u201d Jones told me after she was pulled out of the room . \u201c This is a public official , you working for us , and we can \u2019 t catch you . \u201d\nA few weeks ahead of the primary , Jones was still deciding whether to vote for Rossi or Gasc\u00f3n . \u201c I just hope that he really does what he says , if he makes it into office . Because now you no longer a police , \u201d she says of Gasc\u00f3n . \u201c You make it to DA\u2014you a district attorney now for the people . \u201d",

As a boy living under Fidel Castro\u2019s regime in Havana in the 1960s, he watched as Cuban police beat protesters in the streets and even jailed his own father and uncle. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was 13. Speaking only faltering English, he dropped out of high school and enlisted in the Army, with plans to become a history teacher. Then a childhood friend in the LAPD convinced him to join the department. He patrolled the Hollywood Division while earning a law degree, and eventually rose through the ranks to assistant chief.\n\nA scandal at the LAPD changed how Gasc\u00f3n would come to see the relationship between prosecutors and police. In 1999, Officer Rafael Perez, facing charges for stealing $1 million worth of cocaine from police evidence storage, signed a deal agreeing to help identify other corrupt officers within the department. He went on to implicate 70 officers in the Rampart Division of misconduct, from unprovoked shootings to perjury. Gasc\u00f3n, then a captain, was not accused of wrongdoing, and he joined a team tasked with investigating failures in the department\u2019s management that had allowed the corruption to spread. He realized that prosecutors had seen signs of misconduct and looked the other way, allowing some tainted cops to testify in court. More than a hundred convictions were thrown out.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those \u2018aha moments\u2019 for me,\u201d he told me via phone call in February. \u201cNobody questioned [the police] because it\u2019s almost like there\u2019s this theory within law enforcement that you\u2019re fighting evil and therefore you\u2019re justified.\u201d\n\nWhen Gasc\u00f3n replaced Kamala Harris as district attorney in San Francisco in 2011, after two stints as a police chief there and in Arizona, he pushed for key reforms to lower California\u2019s ballooning prison populations. That year, the Supreme Court ruled that the state\u2019s prisons were so overcrowded they were essentially a form of cruel and unusual punishment. One of Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s biggest accomplishments was co-authoring a statewide ballot measure that reduced punishments for certain drug crimes, allowing more people to stay out of prison. (Lacey opposed the measure, called Proposition 47.) He also won praise from progressives for expunging minor marijuana convictions and using technology to address racial bias among his prosecutors.\n\nBut police accountability remained a major challenge. By the numbers, Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s record on charging officers for fatal shootings is no better than Lacey\u2019s. He didn\u2019t charge any of them, including when five officers fired 20 bullets into 26-year-old Mario Woods\u2014a killing that sparked protests across the Bay Area. Gasc\u00f3n said California law also prevented him from prosecuting the officers who killed Luis G\u00f3ngora Pat, an immigrant in a homeless encampment. But in an unusual move for a district attorney, Gasc\u00f3n announced to the public that he believed these killings were wrong and unnecessary. \u201cTo the Woods family and the G\u00f3ngora family, there are not enough words that I can say that are going to bring their loved ones back,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n said in 2018. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry they lost a son, they lost a brother, a friend, because I don\u2019t believe that was necessary.\u201d\n\nThen, in 2019, a state lawmaker, Shirley Weber, introduced a bill that would make it much harder for law enforcement to get away with fatal shootings. Previously, California officers, like officers in most states, could use deadly force if they \u201creasonably\u201d feared for their safety, regardless of whether they were actually in danger. Under the new bill, they could be prosecuted if they used deadly force that wasn\u2019t \u201cnecessary\u201d to protect against an imminent threat of serious injury. \u201cNecessary\u201d was defined as the absence of a \u201creasonable alternative.\u201d\n\nThe measure would give California the nation\u2019s toughest restrictions on police use-of-force.\n\nThe measure would give California the nation\u2019s toughest restrictions on police use-of-force. Gasc\u00f3n was the only district attorney to publicly support it. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare for DAs around the country to support legislation that would allow greater charges to be brought against law enforcement officers,\u201d says Barkow, the NYU professor, noting that prosecutors rely on law enforcement to help them gather evidence for other cases on their docket.\n\n\n\nPolice unions, predictably, opposed the bill and convinced lawmakers to water it down. The amended version still allowed officers to use force only when \u201cnecessary,\u201d but no longer defined that term, leading some Black Lives Matter activists to describe it as toothless. Lacey supported the watered-down version, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law.\n\nBoth Gasc\u00f3n and Rossi, the public defender candidate, believe a stronger law is needed. In Los Angeles, Gasc\u00f3n proposes a county-wide standard that would go further than the state law by allowing officers to use lethal force only as a last resort. \u201cWe need a prosecutor who\u2019s gonna argue for an expansive definition of what \u2018necessary\u2019 means,\u201d Rossi said during the January debate. In a sign of law enforcement\u2019s unease with Gasc\u00f3n, the union representing the LAPD has contributed $1 million toward an anti-Gasc\u00f3n super-PAC. Lacey, meanwhile, is benefiting from police donations: Almost all of the $2.2 million in contributions to outside committees supporting her have come from law enforcement unions.\n\nAlmost all of the $2.2 million in contributions to outside committees supporting Lacey have come from law enforcement unions.\n\nGasc\u00f3n and Rossi both believe officer-involved shootings should not be investigated by prosecutors who work with the police on other cases, since that creates a conflict of interest; Gasc\u00f3n created an independent unit within the district attorney\u2019s office in San Francisco to conduct these investigations. And both have pledged not to use the testimony of officers with a history of certain misconduct. They say they would create a \u201cdo not call\u201d list of disreputable officers, something Black Lives Matter has pressured Lacey to do, unsuccessfully. Activists have also lambasted Lacey\u2019s record of sending 22 people to death row, all of them people of color; Gasc\u00f3n and Rossi have pledged not to use the death penalty.\n\nAs the primary nears, Gasc\u00f3n has tried to show how far he\u2019s come since his early days as a beat cop. \u201cHe actually became pretty emotional talking about his role advancing the war on drugs, and how he understands things differently now,\u201d says Abdullah, who attended a meeting he had with Black Lives Matter members. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much of that is campaign and how much of that is real, but I believed him.\u201d\n\nDuring her campaign, Lacey has not met publicly with Black Lives Matter members or families reeling from the fallout of officer-involved shootings. She also missed other debates with her challengers. Every Wednesday, Black Lives Matter protesters continue to demonstrate outside her office. Helen Jones shows up to lament the death of her son. He died in sheriff\u2019s custody in 2009, after he was found hanging in his jail cell; Jones alleges officers staged a suicide to cover up a fatal beating. The county paid her a $2 million settlement but admitted no wrongdoing. She still wants the officers prosecuted, something Lacey declined to do. \u201cThey brutally beat my son to death and are getting away with it,\u201d Jones says.\n\nTo Jones, standing up during the debate was the only way she could get Lacey\u2019s attention. \u201cWe can\u2019t catch Jackie Lacey,\u201d Jones told me after she was pulled out of the room. \u201cThis is a public official, you working for us, and we can\u2019t catch you.\u201d\n\nA few weeks ahead of the primary, Jones was still deciding whether to vote for Rossi or Gasc\u00f3n. \u201cI just hope that he really does what he says, if he makes it into office. Because now you no longer a police,\u201d she says of Gasc\u00f3n. \u201cYou make it to DA\u2014you a district attorney now for the people.\u201d",
