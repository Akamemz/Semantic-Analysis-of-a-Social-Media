    "content": "President Donald Trump faced swift resistance from Democrats and a range of Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday after offering a 10-year plan to balance the federal budget that depends heavily on cuts to government safety-net programs and expectations of a big gain in economic growth .\nThe White House budget proposal for the 2018 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would cut federal spending by $ 4.5 trillion over 10 years . But it leaves mostly untouched the big entitlement programs\u2014Social Security and Medicare for retirees\u2014and proposes increases to infrastructure spending , a new parental leave program and a short-term boost to military spending .\nWith those priorities set\u2014in addition to the shared Republican goal of cutting taxes\u2014the White House offered up significant reductions in other spending programs to further the aim of reducing budget deficits . But the call for rolling back programs that touched their constituents made lawmakers bristle .\nThe proposal , which serves as a recommendation to Congress , is likely to be largely rewritten when lawmakers craft their own budget resolutions in the coming months .\n\u201c I hate to say it , but I would say the budget was dead before the ink was dry , \u201d Rep. Don Young ( R. , Alaska ) , who opposes the budget \u2019 s elimination of two programs in his state .\nPayments to Medicaid , the federal-state health program for the poor , would be cut by more than $ 600 billion over a decade from levels projected under current law in addition to proposed Medicaid cuts under the House bill repealing and replacing much of the Affordable Care Act .\nThe food-stamp program would be cut over 10 years by $ 193 billion , the student-loan program by $ 143 billion , disability payments by $ 72 billion and farm subsidies by $ 38 billion .\n\u201c The proposed cuts to some federal programs are not mere shavings ; they are rather deep and harmful to my district spanning Kentucky \u2019 s Appalachian region and other rural , impoverished parts of the country , \u201d Rep. Hal Rogers ( R. , Ky. ) , a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , said of the proposal .\n\u201c This is the budget you write if you think working families have it too easy , \u201d Sen. Ron Wyden ( D. , Ore. ) said .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s budget risks alienating at least some of his core voters who rely on programs that he is proposing to cut . Rural white voters are among his staunchest supporters , the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows . While the president \u2019 s overall approval rating was 39 % , 52 % of rural voters said they approved of his performance .\nThe budget blueprint calls for scrapping two commissions important to Alaska , a state that Mr. Trump won by 15 points in the November election . The budget would eliminate the Denali Commission , which provides economic development services in Alaska , and an Essential Air Service program , which works to ensure that small communities offer some level of air service .\nIn all , nondefense spending as a share of the economy would fall to just 1.5 % by the end of the next decade , well below the lowest level in records going back to 1962 .\nBesides wide-ranging spending reductions , the proposal depends on a projection that economic growth will reach 3 % by 2021 and stay there through 2027 , bolstering government revenue and holding down the need for support programs like unemployment insurance .\nThat growth projection is more aggressive than the Congressional Budget Office projection of 1.9 % over a decade or the Fed \u2019 s 1.8 % projection . It also assumes the country \u2019 s economic expansion , already nearly eight years old , won \u2019 t be interrupted by another economic downturn .\nThe plan drew praise from some Republicans for proposing to balance the budget over 10 years and boosting military spending . GOP lawmakers have also backed overhauling federal funding for Medicaid in previous congressional budgets . Still , many balked at cuts to foreign aid , farm subsidies , health-care programs for low-income families and other programs that mattered back home .\n\u201c It \u2019 s nothing new\u2014it \u2019 s just a lot of people who don \u2019 t know what the hell is going on in farm country , \u201d said Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts ( R. , Kansas ) , who objected to proposed cuts for farm subsidies and new limits on crop insurance , as well as cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program , also known as food stamps .\nSen. John McCain ( R. , Ariz. ) , chair of the Armed Services Committee , said the increase for the miliary was \u201c a betrayal of the president \u2019 s commitment to rebuild our military .
