    "content": "Why it matters : While today is more procedural than symbolic in nature , the U.S. beginning the exit process is likely to further dampen the 2015 climate deal 's aspirations and remove any slim chance that Trump would ever re-engage on the matter , like he suggested in 2017 he would be willing to .\nWhat they 're saying : A White House spokesman did n't comment beyond writing by email that `` the president has already announced that the U.S. is not a part of the Paris Climate Agreement .

Ours is a realistic and pragmatic model . ''\nThe big picture : The U.S. is the only country in the world not to support the accord , whose goal is to drastically slash greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades to keep Earth 's global temperature from rising 2\u00b0C within this century .\nWhere it stands : The planet 's temperature has already increased about 0.8\u00b0C since 1880 , according to NASA , and the world is n't even close to meeting the Paris goals . In fact , trends are going in the opposite direction . Global carbon dioxide emissions just reached an all-time high .\nReality check : In a Rose Garden speech in June 2017 , Trump criticized the accord as a bad deal for America because it allowed China to continue increasing its emissions and because it would hurt the bottom lines of U.S. businesses . But most big companies \u2014 even oil producers \u2014 say they support the accord .\nWhat we 're watching : If a Democrat wins the White House in 2020 , he or she would have to submit a letter to rejoin the accord , at which point there is a 30-day delay .
