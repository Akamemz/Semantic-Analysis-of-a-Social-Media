    "content": "A few months ago , the New York Times Magazine published an interesting profile of Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly . Written by Jim Rutenberg , one of the Times \u2019 political reporters , it suggested that Kelly \u2019 s promotion to the coveted 9 p.m. time slot , immediately following `` The O \u2019 Reilly Factor , '' was part of Roger Ailes \u2019 interest in broadening FNC \u2019 s audience .\nAs numerous surveys have revealed , Fox News may be the \u201c most-watched \u201d cable news channel , but its viewers are older than those of its competitors ( though , to be fair , the competition 's viewers are pretty old , too ) , and its most devoted ones are consistently conservative . Rutenberg \u2019 s piece raised the possibility that Kelly might be able to attract younger and more ideologically diverse viewers , especially \u201c independents \u201d who watch Fox from time to time but are not regulars .\nThe magazine \u2019 s cover went so far as to suggest that Kelly \u2019 s style and departures from conservative orthodoxy might even make her appealing to \u2026 readers of the New York Times ! ( That appeal , such as it is , seems likely to have been undercut in recent weeks by Kelly \u2019 s bafflingly out of touch interview of the Duggars and her resort to the tired , racially coded \u201c not exactly a saint \u201d to describe the teenage girl knocked down by a cop in McKinney , Texas . )\nThese departures from orthodoxy have become legendary among close followers of the media and have earned her praise from a variety of figures outside the conservative movement . Rutenberg calls them \u201c Megyn moments \u201d : occasions when she asks a conservative guest , nearly always an older white man , a sharp question that doesn \u2019 t necessarily fit within the conservative worldview .\nRutenberg 's argument struck me as dubious . While conducting research for my book on the history of TV news , I watched lots and lots of old segments and programs , including many from Fox News . I \u2019 m pretty familiar with Bill O \u2019 Reilly , Sean Hannity , Shepard Smith and the rest of the Fox crew , including its regular pundits . But I hadn \u2019 t seen that much of Kelly . Could Ailes really be moving away from his successful formula of pandering to Fox \u2019 s conservative base ? By watching Kelly \u2019 s program , could I learn about important subjects unreported by the Times and the other \u201c mainstream media \u201d that I follow ? Or perhaps acquire new and useful perspectives on things that I thought I understood ?\nTo find out , I watched `` The Kelly File '' nearly day every from early March through the first week of May . I saw her report on everything from the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear weapons program to the controversy over Hillary Clinton \u2019 s use of a private email account , and watched her interviews with Republican presidential aspirants and her coverage of the riots in Baltimore in the wake of Freddie Gray \u2019 s death . But , in the end , I wasn \u2019 t impressed -- and not because Kelly is a conservative and her program trumpets conservative points of view . The problem is that she is a conventional Fox News television anchor , and Fox News isn \u2019 t about nuance or complexity , the things I look for in news reporting and analysis .\nIt \u2019 s true that she is less doctrinaire than Hannity . And she can occasionally ask good questions \u2014 though , mostly , it \u2019 s her prosecutorial style , rather than the question itself , that it is noteworthy . Watching her regularly , however , made me realize that she \u2019 s merely a slightly different version of O \u2019 Reilly \u2014 she 's a smart , engaging television personality whose \u201c reports \u201d reaffirm the conservative ideology of most of her viewers .\nKelly \u2019 s biggest attribute is her personality . She \u2019 s intelligent , down-to-earth and can poke fun at herself as well as at her guests . And , no doubt much to Ailes \u2019 s delight , she has developed a very effective broadcasting style . Her husky voice , quick wit and experience as a lawyer give her an admirable air of authority . In the peculiar style favored by FNC producers , she evokes a still glamorous ex-cheerleader . She is also a superb performer , never losing her cool or command of her program . She \u2019 s well-suited for television journalism , and in another era , would likely have been a big star for the networks .\nSadly , however , she works for Fox News , a purveyor of a kind of television journalism that has become the norm for cable news , even among channels that eschew its conservatism . That means covering only a few stories , usually the ones most likely to appeal to their target audience , and following them very closely over the course of the broadcast day , sometimes through live reports from the field , but mostly by allowing assorted guests to opine and pontificate about them . At Fox News and MSNBC , anchors routinely join in the pontificating , and these breaks with old-school journalistic practice are part of their appeal . It makes them seem \u201c real , \u201d and as Ailes recognized long ago , most viewers of TV news prefer this to the detachment displayed by journalists at the major networks and CNN . And Fox at least has the ratings to prove it .\nKelly is most certainly \u201c real , \u201d and she opines and pontificates no less than O \u2019 Reilly and Hannity . This is why she is popular with Fox News viewers , who expect this from their prime-time anchors in particular . But I doubt it will appeal to very many real independents ( as opposed to people with largely conservative beliefs who like to think they are independents ) or readers of the Times . And this isn \u2019 t just because `` The Kelly File '' covers so few stories or because Kelly expresses her opinions about so many things . The same can be said about Rachel Maddow .\nIt \u2019 s because Kelly \u2019 s program isn \u2019 t very informative , even when she devotes attention to stories given short shrift by other news outlets . With a handful of exceptions -- usually compelling breaking news stories like the tragic Germanwings airline crash -- every story Kelly and her producers select is predictable . And , rather than exploring their complexity , Kelly and her guests dumb them down so that everything fits neatly into their viewers \u2019 worldview .\nI was shocked at how few subjects , sources and points of view `` The Kelly File '' presents , and by her almost ritualistic recourse to the same old conservative clich\u00e9s and talking points during discussion and analysis , even when more interesting and complicated angles virtually begged to be examined . As on `` The O \u2019 Reilly Factor , '' the role played by liberal guests is to be flayed by the host and her allies . Often this is easy because such guests are academics or policy wonks unaccustomed to talking in sound bites ; sometimes their statements are so out of touch with reality that they almost invite ridicule . Even those famous \u201c Megyn moments \u201d are too few for my liking . And they always are followed by gracious and supportive remarks that demonstrate to viewers that Kelly is on the side of the \u201c good guys . \u201d\nWatching Kelly reminded me of what I learned while researching my book \u2014 that Fox News , particularly during prime time , really isn \u2019 t in the news business . It \u2019 s in the entertainment business . To a certain degree , this is true of most all television news . But in FNC \u2019 s case , there is a difference . Fox News \u2019 core audience is more than just a particular slice of the larger consumer marketplace . It \u2019 s a group of people with firm convictions and a coherent ideological worldview \u2014 not unlike orthodox Marxists back in the early 1900s . And part of what Fox does is make this worldview seem even more coherent \u2014 and impervious to information that might undermine or contradict it . That \u2019 s actually what its viewers want , and , from the start , Ailes and FNC have eagerly given it to them .\nI \u2019 m sure Ailes would like to expand FNC \u2019 s audience and win over viewers whose views are less doctrinaire . This would be good business , and Ailes is a brilliant businessman . But I can \u2019 t see this happening without him alienating his most loyal viewers , who prefer every story and virtually every fact filtered through the lens of ideology . At least in present form , `` The Kelly File '' isn \u2019 t going to do this , despite Kelly \u2019 s undeniable appeal as a broadcaster .",
