    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 For the first time in his presidency , Donald Trump gave his State of the Union address to a divided Congress . The president did n't flinch as he faced a House of Representatives led by Democrats who have recently pushed for late-term abortions .\nTrump boldly pushed back on that agenda , saying America 's leaders need to `` work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life . '' The president then called on Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions .\n`` Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother 's womb moments before birth , '' Trump said . `` These are living , feeling , beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world . ''\n`` And then , we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth , '' the president continued . `` All children \u2013 born and unborn \u2013 are made in the holy image of God . ''\nThe commander in chief also broke down his vision for safe and legal immigration , demanding a wall be constructed along America 's southern border .\nHe illustrated his point by hosting the family members of Gerald and Sharon David , an elderly couple murdered in their Nevada home just last month by an immigrant who was in the US illegally .\n`` I will never forget , and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon , that it should never happen again , '' Trump said . `` Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border . ''\n`` Simply put \u2013 walls save lives , '' he stated . `` In the past , most people in this room voted for a wall \u2013 but the proper wall never got built . I 'll get it built . ''\nMeanwhile , the future of the wall still remains in question as congressional negotiators continue to work on a deal to prevent another government shutdown .\nIn the Democrats ' response to the president 's address , former Georgia governor candidate Stacey Abrams placed blame for the recent closing of the government directly on the president .\n`` The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the President of the United States , one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people \u2013 but our values , '' she charged .\nTrump struck a bipartisan tone when talking about rebuilding America , fighting cancer , eradicating HIV , lowering the cost of healthcare and his handling of the economy .\n`` An economic miracle is happening in the United States , '' he declared . `` The only thing that can stop it are foolish wars , politics , or ridiculous partisan investigations . ''\nPresident Trump got a standing ovation from both sides after stating women have filled more than 50 percent of new jobs created in the last year . `` We also have more women in the Congress than ever before , '' he said .\nTrump then reaffirmed his determination to protect American interests and end foreign wars .\nTo that end , the president confirmed his second summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un for Feb. 27-28 in Vietnam . `` If I had not been elected president of the US , we would right now , in my opinion , be in a major war with North Korea , '' he said .\nMeanwhile , lawmakers ' reactions to the president 's State of the Union address fell along partisan lines .\nRepublicans praised the president 's remarks . `` It was very inspirational , '' remarked Rep. Vicky Hartzler ( R-MO ) .\nRep. Mark Walker ( R-AL ) agreed , saying , `` He did a great job . ''\nLikewise , Rep. Jody Hice ( R-GA ) noted , `` The president did an outstanding job .

''\nDemocrats also took the president to task for his suggestion that `` foolish wars , politics '' and `` ridiculous partisan investigations '' like the Russia probe were hindering Congress from doing its job .\n`` If there is going to peace and legislation , there can not be war and investigation .
