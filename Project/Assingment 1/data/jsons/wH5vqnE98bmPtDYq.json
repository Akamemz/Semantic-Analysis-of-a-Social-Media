''\n`` We 've got to stop being the stupid party . It 's time for a new Republican Party that talks like adults , '' he said . `` We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments . I 'm here to say we 've had enough of that . ''\nJindal , thought to be a potential 2016 presidential contender , offered little detail in the 25-minute address .
