    "content": "All the outreach activity by political campaigns , including door to door canvassing , phone banking , direct mail , and even advertising , has basically no effect on voters \u2019 choice of candidate in general elections , according to a striking new academic study .\nThe new analysis covers 49 field experiments conducted in real US election campaigns , typically run with cooperation from the campaigns themselves .\nCampaigns spend millions of dollars during general elections on canvassing ; phone banking ; advertising on TV , radio , and the internet ; and other efforts designed to win over undecided voters and supporters of the opposing candidate . The new study \u2019 s authors , UC Berkeley political scientist Joshua Kalla and Stanford professor David Broockman , conclude that essentially no one targeted is persuaded .\nThis doesn \u2019 t mean that political campaigns never matter . Kalla and Broockman find that these activities can persuade voters in primary elections and during ballot-initiative campaigns . Campaigns can still effectively turn out voters whose minds are already made up about a candidate , and voters can and do change their opinions when prompted by politicians they already support ( something a previous study of Broockman \u2019 s confirmed ) .\nMoreover , it \u2019 s possible that even in general elections candidates can persuade voters by varying their positions on issues ( say , defecting from their party consensus to a more popular view ) or by receiving different media coverage \u2014 factors that Kalla and Broockman \u2019 s study doesn \u2019 t cover .\nBut the study should force campaigns to seriously reexamine how they \u2019 re spending money , and how they try to persuade winnable voters . Running a successful campaign isn \u2019 t impossible . It \u2019 s just hard , and might require making some unconventional choices .\n\u201c Campaigns probably need to get more creative and think more outside the box , \u201d Broockman says . \u201c Whatever box they are working within now does n't usually produce results . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s an especially shocking result given the authors \u2019 previous work . Kalla and Broockman conducted a large-scale canvassing experiment , published in 2016 , that found that pro-trans-rights canvassers could change Miami residents ' minds about transgender issues by having intense , substantive , 10-minute conversations with them . The persuasive effects of this canvassing were durable , lasting at least three months . The study was , understandably , a big deal : There was a whole This American Life episode made about it . The idea that having deep conversations with people can change their minds seemed incredibly promising .\nBut now , Kalla and Broockman are finding that this kind of persuasion doesn \u2019 t appear to happen during campaigns , at least not very often .\nThe paper is unusual in that it \u2019 s not a straightforward review of existing evidence on campaign persuasion . Kalla and Broockman did find 40 existing randomized field experiments wherein campaigns , working in cooperation with academic researchers , randomly subjected a subset of voters to canvasses , phone calls , direct mail , TV or online ads , and other interventions , and compared how the treated and untreated groups responded to later surveys on how they expect to vote in the upcoming election , or how they voted if the election happened already .\n\u201c There has been a lot of buzz but not much public information on the experiments political campaigns have been conducting to learn how to persuade voters , \u201d Broockman writes in an email . \u201c The study contains data from inside dozens of those efforts . \u201d\nKalla and Broockman found that , if the campaign action ( canvass , phone call , etc . ) happens within two months of election day , the average effect on voter preferences was effectively zero . About one in 800 people reached were persuaded , they estimate .\nBy contrast , when the campaign action happens well before election day , and the effects are measured quickly thereafter , there 's a real impact on opinions \u2014 but it disappears before election day . The sooner you get to the election , the more voters get set in their ways and choose candidates by their partisan alignment , and are n't persuadable by additional campaigning .\nPartisanship seems to be the major factor here . While campaigns can rarely persuade people in general elections , Kalla and Broockman do find that campaigning significantly increases support for primary candidates and ballot measures . And while your partisan identity tells you how to vote in general elections , it \u2019 s of much less help for ballot initiatives and primary elections . ( By definition , the rivals in a primary election come from the same party \u2014 so cues from party leadership tend to be subtler . )\n`` Although campaigns may have some scope for persuasion in competitive primary elections , where there is no partisan cue , in general elections there are few considerations they can provide today \u2019 s voters that would lead them to abandon their party , \u201d Kalla and Broockman write .\nThe authors conducted nine field experiments during the 2015 and 2016 elections\nBut Kalla and Broockman were n't content with only 40 existing studies . The evidence they had on hand was useful but very imprecise : For instance , they found that the eight studies measuring the effect of personal canvassing within two months of election day had an average effect of negative 1.9 percentage points , barely larger than the standard error of 1.7 percent . If you use standard techniques to construct a confidence interval , that finding suggests that late-stage canvassing could do anything from hurt candidates by 5.3 points to help them by 1.5 points .\nNot satisfied with that kind of uncertainty , Kalla and Broockman teamed up with Working America , the political organizing branch of the AFL-CIO , to conduct nine more field experiments in a 2015 primary , a special election that year , and the 2016 general election . These were large-scale experiments that radically increased the evidence base they had to work with \u2014 \u201c by about a factor of 10 , '' Kalla and Broockman write .\nWorking America appears to be an unusually effective canvassing group . In the 2015 Democratic primary they studied \u2014 for mayor of Philadelphia\u2014 Kalla and Broockman find that a Working America canvass six weeks out from the election increased support for their candidate , Jim Kenney ( who won the primary and is now mayor ) , by 11 percentage points a week later ; the effects mostly persisted to the end of the campaign .\nSimilarly impressive numbers came in a 2015 special election for the Washington state legislature , and a turnout experiment in the 2016 general election in North Carolina . These results confirmed that boosting turnout , primary election persuasion , and perhaps persuasion in special elections are possible , especially with a skilled organization .\nBut evidence of persuasion in general elections remained negligible . Reconducting their meta-analysis with all this new data , Kalla and Broockman concluded , once again , that contacting voters within two months of a general election does not persuade them . The average effect was indistinguishable from zero .\nSo what does this mean for campaigns ? One takeaway is that campaigns and non-campaign groups like Working America could do well to focus more of their energy on boosting turnout at the end of a race than persuading voters earlier on . Another is that campaign funders should consider directing more money to primary election and ballot initiatives , where persuasion does appear possible .\nBut the authors found a couple possible exceptions in general elections too , when persuasion is possible . They were all in somewhat unique circumstances , but nonetheless suggest possible caveats to the study \u2019 s overall pessimism .\nThe first case occurred in the 2008 US Senate race in Oregon . It was an unusual race ; Oregon is a reliably blue state that \u2019 s had a Democratic governor for the past 30 years , but the two-term incumbent , Gordon Smith , was a moderate Republican . Smith was unusually pro-LGBTQ for a Republican at that time , most notably pushing for sexual orientation to be added to the federal hate-crimes statute . That led to a common misconception that he also favored abortion rights , when he actually identified as pro-life .\nWith that in mind , Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon and NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon worked together on a campaign in which they identified pro-choice voters and targeted them with mailings and phone calls hoping to educate them on Smith 's actual views , and the pro-choice views of his opponent Jeff Merkley . Crucially , the groups worked with political scientists to randomize which voters got these treatments .\nHarvard psychologist Todd Rogers and Temple University political scientist David Nickerson evaluated the campaign , and found that it was very effective . Merkley 's vote share rose by 3.4 to 4.5 percentage points among people getting the messages , for a swing in the two-party vote share of up to 9 points . That \u2019 s huge , in campaign terms , especially in a close race where the margin of victory was 3 points .\nBut this was a very strange situation . Senators aren \u2019 t normally as out of step with their home states as Smith was with Oregon . There are a few cases where a similar effort might work \u2014 say , if Republicans wanted to remind vehemently pro-life North Dakota voters that Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is pro-choice \u2014 but they \u2019 re not the norm .\nThe more intriguing case of persuasion working occurred in North Carolina . Working America , in the effort being studied by Kalla and Broockman , did an experiment early on in the election where canvassers left flyers attacking the Republican governor , Pat McCrory , for his signing of a `` bathroom bill '' restricting trans rights , which cost the state billions in business . The experiment concluded that the flyer was persuasive for black voters , but not white voters . Working America then adjusted its technique and only handed out the flyer to black households . By the end of the campaign , the effort as a whole was persuasive , due to this targeting .\nThis is an expensive technique , requiring as it does an additional experiment to identify demographics for whom certain messages work and demographics for whom they do n't , and it relies on North Carolina having voter files that list voters ' races , and on McCrory 's endorsement of a very unpopular law . It 's not easily replicable . But it suggests that building on early studies can help campaigns improve their persuasiveness .\nBut all that aside , it was a case where persuasion worked . And that matters . Even given its overall low effectiveness , persuasion is an important part of campaigning . Other methods of attempting to gain more votes than your opponent have their own drawbacks . Voter registration is costly ; an experiment by Temple 's Nickerson found that voter registration efforts cost about $ 60 per vote for campaigns running them , far more than turnout efforts . Turnout efforts directed at party bases aren \u2019 t enough for candidates running in unfavorable environments , like a Democrat in Alabama or a Republican in Vermont , who need to persuade voters of the other party ( and sometimes do : Vermont governor Phil Scott is a Republican ) . Meanwhile , persuasion efforts can effectively net campaigns two votes , by subtracting one from the opposing campaign too .\nAll of which makes getting persuasion right important for campaigns . The trouble is that getting it right appears to be really , really hard .",
