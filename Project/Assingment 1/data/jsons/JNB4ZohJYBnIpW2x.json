Someone said to her , \u201c Hey there \u2019 s a girl crying over there , you should go hug her. \u201d Christine ran up to an Asian woman who appeared to be in her early 20s .\n\u201c I asked her what was up , and she pointed at a sign that said , \u2018 I am an Asian lesbian and I respect my family , \u2019 \u201d Christine recalled . \u201c And she said , \u2018 You never see that . You never see that kind of representation within LGBT culture . \u2019 \u201d\nThe moment made Christine , who declined to use her full name because she \u2019 s not out to her parents , realize how important it was to be in that parade\u2014even though , she confessed , \u201c I hate walking. \u201d That \u2019 s why this year , she \u2019 s an organizing member of Lunar New Year for All , a coalition of LGBTQ+ Asian and Pacific Islander groups ( including Q-Wave , GAPIMNY , Project Reach , and API Rainbow Parents ) working to increase queer Asian representation in the annual Lunar New Year parades throughout New York City . On Sunday , the group will celebrate its 10th year of marching in the Manhattan Chinatown parade \u2014 a trailblazing moment that both built upon and helped pave the way for other marginalized groups seeking acceptance in the wider mainstream community , by joining in a moment of communal celebration .\nWhen Lunar New Year for All formed 10 years ago , queer Asian groups had already been marching in New York 's main Pride Parade for many years . But the coalition \u2019 s co-founders felt it was important to be represented within their own community , too . \u201c Our mission statement was to dismantle homophobia and discrimination within Asian communities , \u201d said co-founder Karen Lee . \u201c Because that can lead to acceptance of us. \u201d Still , on the West Coast where Lee grew up , out , queer Asian contingents have been marching in the Lunar New Year parades for decades .\nChristine said that many of the issues she and many of her gay friends deal with are especially common among Asian people . Chief among them is the East Asian concept of \u201c filial piety. \u201d The term can mean different things to different people , but suggests an obligation to demonstrate respect to your parents and elders by obeying their wishes , supporting them financially , serving as a caregiver as they get older , and having children within a straight marriage . \u201c These are all things you are raised to do , but reconciling that with your queerness\u2014that \u2019 s a challenge that \u2019 s very much an Asian thing , \u201d Christine said .\n\u201c Some white people will be like , \u2018 Why do you even bother [ with your parents ] if they don \u2019 t accept you ? Why do you do so much for them ? \u2019 And it \u2019 s like , they don \u2019 t get it , \u201d said Christine . She points out that many immigrants rely on their American-born children to serve as translators and go-betweens from a very young age . \u201c It \u2019 s like you \u2019 re their guide in America ; there \u2019 s that dependence early on . You can \u2019 t just not do that . \u201d\nSome Asians also see being gay as something of a white , Western concept . Chinatowner Olympia Moy ( a friend of yours truly ) recalled that when she came out to her immigrant parents , they initially told her , \u201c You got too much diversity training to be an [ residential advisor ] in college , to help those gay kids , now you think you \u2019 re one of them ! \u201d\nIn 2018 Moy wrote about a certain cultural pressure to keep \u201c private \u201d matters private . She described meeting a Chinese-American woman who said that \u201c between her and her mom , being gay was \u2018 understood. \u2019 \u201d As the woman put it , \u201c My partner comes with me to my parents \u2019 house , we sit at the same dinner table , but we don \u2019 t say it . That \u2019 s the \u2018 Chinese way. \u2019 \u201d The woman also said that having a gay contingent march openly down Mott Street , in the heart of Chinatown , would be \u201c culturally inappropriate . \u201d\nMoy was shaken by those words , because for her , the most painful aspect of coming out to her parents had been them urging her to not tell other relatives\u2014and by extension , anyone else in Chinatown , a hub for Chinese Americans throughout the East Coast ever since its founding more than a century ago . Each year , about 500,000 people attend the famed parade . \u201c Deep inside , \u201d Moy wrote , \u201c I knew that being out at home , in your community of heritage , should not be disrespectful , should not be \u2018 inappropriate . \u2019 \u201d\nFor these reasons and more , Lunar New Year for All \u2019 s battle to make queer Asians visible was a watershed moment . When the organization first applied to the 2010 parade , the organizers \u201c initially showed a lot of interest [ but ] when we said we were a queer Asian contingent , \u201d Lee recalled , but then the organizers essentially ghosted them .\nThey set out to whip up support for their cause , reaching out to Asian organizations like OCA Asian Pacific American Advocates and the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center , and big-name personalities like the actress Joan Chen , journalist and activist Helen Zia , and Christine Quinn , then New York City \u2019 s first openly gay City Council Speaker . They also issued press releases in Chinese and English , did radio segments , and garnered coverage in English and Chinese newspapers both local and national . \u201c It got to a point where the organizers felt a lot of pressure , \u201d Lee said . \u201c Where if they said no to us , they would hear from their constituents . \u201d\nTheir coalition was allowed in . And not only did they join the dragon dancers and confetti in Chinatown , but they also invited other groups who \u2019 d been waging similar battles to march alongside them . Those included St. Pat \u2019 s for All , an organization that had been fighting to get into the St. Patrick \u2019 s Day parade on Fifth Avenue for nearly two decades , and SALGA-NYC , which after being allowed into the India Day Parade in 2000 , had not been allowed back since . Later in 2010 , though , SALGA was accepted into the India Day Parade , thanks in part to the experience , resources , and political contacts that Lunar New Year for All was able to share , Lee said .\n\u201c Parades in New York City have this heightened sense of significance that they might not even have back in the old country , \u201d said Brendan Fay , an immigrant from Ireland who co-founded the LGBTQ Irish group Lavender and Green Alliance , and spent 25 years fighting to be allowed into New York 's St. Patrick \u2019 s Day Parade . An LGBTQ Irish contingent marched in 1991\u2014with New York 's first African American mayor David Dinkins alongside them\u2014but was not allowed to do so under their own banner , Fay said , or any banner containing the words lesbian or gay . The alliance was finally welcomed in 2016 .\nFay also co-founded St. Pat \u2019 s for All , an alternate St. Patrick \u2019 s Day parade in Queens that embraces inclusivity . The one-of-a-kind event opens with a remembrance of the Choctaw of Oklahoma ( among the first to donate money to Ireland during the famine , Fay said ) , and features banners of Frederick Douglass , who spent a year in Ireland \u201c speaking up for the starving Irish , and pleaded with the Irish to join the movement for abolition , \u201d Fay said . Through the years , it also has invited Asian and South Asian LGBTQ organizations , and other Asian groups .\n\u201c Sometimes I get , \u2018 Brendan , parades ? Really ? \u2019 \u201d Fay said . \u201c But I have come to understand the importance of community rituals. \u201d When he came to New York , he found himself seeking out other gay people and Irish people . \u201c It \u2019 s natural that immigrants and ethnic groups look for our kind , to celebrate our culture . It all comes out of a human need to belong . And that \u2019 s at the heart of what parades are about : the instinct to connect , to be part of the human family . If you \u2019 re an immigrant , that longing is even deeper . \u201d\nIn recent years , Lunar New Year for All has expanded beyond Manhattan to march in Lunar New Year parades in Flushing , Queens . Next year , they plan to apply and march for the first time in Brooklyn \u2019 s parade in Sunset Park as well .\n\u201c I think this year our messaging will be more vocal , \u201d Lee mused . \u201c Our first year we were more timid , so we used a lot of euphemisms like \u2018 rainbow family. \u2019 But now we want people to know exactly what we are : a queer Asian contingent . \u201d\nWhich isn \u2019 t to imply that there \u2019 s been any conflict with parade organizers . The group is invited back every single year since their first parade , Lee said . \u201c There \u2019 s never been any issue or break . We \u2019 re just part of the community now . \u201d",
