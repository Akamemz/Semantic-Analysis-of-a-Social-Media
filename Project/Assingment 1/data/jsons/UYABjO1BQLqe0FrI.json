    "content": "The Cliven Bundy standoff , involving an angry rancher who refuses to pay federal grazing fees , took a new , ugly turn Wednesday night when the New York Times reported horrifying comments he made about `` the Negro '' and slavery . Meanwhile , Bundy 's quest continues to grip Fox News audiences . This is largely because his story is more reasonable if you watch Fox 's creative , often fictionalized version of it .\nHere , then , are nearly two dozen claims that have been uttered in defense of Bundy by Fox personalities , other right-wing pundits and Bundy himself . ( A good deal of them , alas , come from Sean Hannity . )\nFor each claim , we \u2019 ve offered a bit of a fact-check or truthful context afterward .\n1 . \u201c The BLM \u2019 s actions lacked proportionality. \u201d ( Sean Hannity ) The Bureau of Land Management simply arrived to take cattle , per a court order . They didn \u2019 t show up with guns drawn and they never even entered Bundy \u2019 s property . They did , however , carry arms for a good reason : They had received intelligence that Bundy and his crew might cause trouble . There is nothing \u201c disproportionate \u201d about being prepared .\n2 . \u201c The BLM pointed guns at children. \u201d The Republican Nevada Assemblywoman Michelle Fiore has been saying this during her 15 minutes of fame , including on \u201c All In With Chris Hayes \u201d on MSNBC last week . There has been no evidence offered that the BLM \u201c pointed guns at children. \u201d Bundy \u2019 s teenage son attempted to assault officers and kicked a police dog and resisted arrest , and so they used a taser on him , as well they should have .\n3 . \u201c The Feds are going to \u2018 cause another Waco \u2019 . \u201d ( Cliven Bundy , et al . ) The feds are trying to avoid another Waco . The U.S. government did not \u201c cause Waco \u201d but rather botched the response ; they could have waited it out more patiently to avoid the loss of life of innocent children . And this is exactly why the feds have not pressed the issue ( yet ) with Bundy , and why the BLM stood down .\n4 . \u201c Since when does the government send armed officers to collect a debt ? \u201d ( Hannity ) Many repossession and foreclosure actions often involve a sheriff or other armed officials , and confiscation of property is an ordinary means by which a government resolves a debt . For example , if you accumulate 20 years of unpaid parking tickets , a court will order that your car be booted and towed until you pay . And if you point a rifle at the cop or otherwise assault him , you might get shot ( or tased ) .\n5 . \u201c Nobody has seen any bill for $ 1.1 million . It doesn \u2019 t exist. \u201d ( Michelle Fiore , R-Nevada Assembly , on MSNBC ) Bundy says he has \u201c never been sent a bill \u201d but also says he never opens mail from the U.S. government because he does not recognize the U.S. government \u2019 s existence . A court has ordered him to pay a debt of $ 1.1 million in accumulated fines and fees for having put greater than his allowed quota of cattle on federally protected tortoise habitat .\n6 . \u201c The BLM provoked , escalated this controversy. \u201d Rep. Steve Stockman , R-Texas , made this accusation , as have numerous others . If an armed resistance is put up against an asset seizure by law enforcement officials who are acting under a court order , the provocation is exclusively the work of those who have chosen to threaten the lawmen with violence .\n7 . \u201c The land is not being used -- it \u2019 s not like they want to build a school , road or hospital on it. \u201d ( Hannity ) How federal land is used is determined by federal law . A citizen does not get to decide for himself whether the land should remain vacant or grazed , or whether something should be built on it .\n8 . \u201c Harry Reid and his son have a financial motive to remove Bundy \u2019 s cows. \u201d ( Bob Massi , Fox News legal correspondent ) There is no evidence at all that Harry Reid or his son have any financial or political interest in what is going on . Don \u2019 t believe everything you hear on Fox News , especially when the reporter qualifies it , as Massi did here , by saying , \u201c We don \u2019 t really know if it \u2019 s true . \u201d\n9 . \u201c The BLM killed cattle and put the corpses in a mass grave. \u201d There is no evidence that the BLM euthanized Bundy \u2019 s cattle except some photos and footage of dubious pedigree being aired nightly on Fox News . That said , it is possible that a cow or two could have died during the roundup . Cattle are occasionally killed in large roundups . Now , if there was a mass euthanizing of cattle , the BLM should be forced to explain that .\n10 . \u201c The sheriff is the only man with arresting power in Clark county. \u201d Bundy has made this claim in his nightly appearance on the Sean Hannity show , and it has long been a favorite talking point of Tea Partyers , especially in the West . But it is false . Federal officers have arresting power where federal land is trespassed or where federal law has otherwise been broken . The BLM does have an obligation under federal regulations to seek the cooperation of local law enforcement to resolve certain disputes . But in this case , the sheriff refused to help out .\n11 . \u201c People should not die over a few cows eating free government grass. \u201d ( Hannity ) That \u2019 s true , which is why Bundy and his militia members should not have chosen to point guns at federal officials and escalate the situation . Now , those militia members could find themselves getting shot or even killed . Such is the consequence of pointing rifles at lawmen trying to do their job .\n12 . \u201c How could a cow possibly eat $ 1.1 million of grass ? \u201d ( Bundy \u2019 s daughter , Stetsy Bundy ) Cows can easily eat a million bucks worth of grass but that \u2019 s neither here nor there . Grazing fees are not assessed by weighing the amount of tonnage that a cow eats . It is a per-animal-unit , per-month fee , and it adds up over 20 years . Furthermore , Bundy \u2019 s liability is as much for fines for illegal trespass as it is for fees .\n13 . \u201c What \u2019 s wrong with Bundy \u2019 s cows simply cutting the grass for free ? \u201d ( Hannity ) A trespass is not forgiven simply because the trespasser believes he is performing a service for the owner . Furthermore , \u201c cutting grass \u201d is not depriving the owner of a nuisance but rather taking a valuable resource ( edible grass ) from the owner .\n14 . \u201c Bundy has rights to the land because his ancestors worked the land prior to formation of BLM. \u201d Bundy has made this argument himself and others have echoed it , but even if Bundy \u2019 s ancestors did work the land ( and we only have his word that they did , and he is notoriously dishonest ) , as of the passage of the Taylor Act in 1934 they would have had to pay grazing fees . And it was never private land . The parcel that Bundy is trespassing has been owned by the U.S. government ever since it was purchased and/or won from Mexico or Spain .\n15 . \u201c This is all predicated on a tortoise that is not even endangered. \u201d ( Hannity ) The decision as to whether the tortoise is endangered and whether it can withstand grazing , and how much , is one for biologists to make and can be challenged in court by anyone that disagrees with it , in which case the government must show that it is using valid science .\n16 . \u201c Grazing more cattle on federal land will keep beef prices down. \u201d Sean Hannity made this idiotic remark two nights ago . If the government wants to centrally control the market for beef ( as it sometimes does with other commodities ) it is a policy decision to be made by Congress and the Department of Agriculture , not Mr. Bundy or Sean Hannity .\n17 . \u201c We have rapists , pedophiles and murderers . Why is government focusing on this piece of land ? \u201d ( Hannity ) The government \u2019 s decision to seize the assets of a scofflaw will not cause rapes , murders or acts of pedophilia to be neglected . Law enforcement is capable of multitasking .\n18 . \u201c The feds should simply put a lien on Bundy \u2019 s property. \u201d ( Fiore , Hannity et al ) Yes , they can and they should ( and likely have already , since it \u2019 s been going on 20 years ) , and this would mean that when his cows arrive at market , the proceeds would go directly to the government . But realized that the collection of the past due amount is only one issue -- the other is that Bundy continues to run his cows on land that is closed to grazing , and a lien won \u2019 t accomplish that .\n19 . \u201c If you owed money , would you like it if the government came to your house and pointed guns at you and your wife and family ? \u201d ( Fiore ) The BLM did not \u201c point guns \u201d at the Bundys until the Bundys assaulted them . The BLM was doing its job , and Bundy \u2019 s armed supporters threatened them with force and the son assaulted one of the officers and his dog .\n20 . \u201c Peaceful protesters were relocated miles away from entrance to the Bundy ranch , and denied their First Amendment Rights. \u201d ( Brian Sandoval , GOP governor of Nevada ) When law enforcement needs to operate in a tense situation , they are within their rights to move protesters to an area safely away from the action . This is for their own protection , and it is especially appropriate where some of the protesters bring weapons .\n21 . \u201c Bundy has already paid fees to Nevada County. \u201d Dana Loesch , a frequent guest on Fox , has repeatedly made this peculiar argument . Whatever Bundy might have paid to Nevada County is of no consequence to his federal tax bill . You can not avoid a federal tax bill by paying fees and taxes to the county .\n22 . \u201c If the cattle were illegal immigrants , the Justice Department would be running guns to them and Homeland Security would be giving them free phones. \u201d ( Dana Loesch ) Even if this were true ( and it isn \u2019 t ) , cattle are not illegal immigrants . Nor does this silly hypothetical scenario bear in any way on the fact that Bundy and his thugs have broken the law by ignoring several court orders , and interfering with law enforcement in many ways .",
