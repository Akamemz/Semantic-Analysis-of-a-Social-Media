    "content": "The U.S. government did a lot of things wrong in the Great Recession of 2008 . But one of the most consequential screw-ups , made when it really counted , was low-balling the stimulus . President Obama 's economic advisors rapidly concluded it would take $ 1.8 trillion to plug the hole in the economy , but never pushed for that amount for fear of the politics . The stimulus that passed was less than half that number , and the grinding decade of slow recovery that followed was the inevitable result .\nNow , the global coronavirus pandemic means the president and Congress are faced with the same choice again . Numbers out of China , where the virus began , show a staggering hit to the country 's economy ; here in America , activity in various service sectors was down by as much as half before the mandatory shutdowns began sweeping the states ; economists project output will shrink 5 percent in the second quarter ; White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told Politico the next jobs report could be the single worst we 've ever seen .\nThis is no time to repeat the mistakes of 2008 . Even a few months of shuttered economic activity could set off cascading job and income losses unless it 's counteracted by a massive stimulus . Simply put , the U.S. government should spend at least a trillion dollars . Literally .\n`` I am in the one-trillion-to-two-trillion-dollar camp , preferably by dinner time , '' Ian Shepherdson , the founder of Pantheon Macroeconomics , told The New Yorker . Olivier Blanchard , the former head economist at the International Monetary Fund , compared the current situation to World War II , and cited the massive deficits \u2014 many trillions in today 's terms \u2014 the war effort justified . Furthermore , we now have a reasonably good idea of what specific policies are needed , and can do a rough back-of-the-envelope calculation .\nThere 's a growing economic consensus that the most useful thing the government could do is just hand people cash . It can happen at the necessary speed , and it 's flexible enough to address a situation as fluid as the coronavirus outbreak . Economists across the political spectrum support this idea . Mitt Romney , Republican Senator from Utah , supports it . The basic plan going around is $ 1,000 immediately to every adult American , and $ 500 for every child . Jason Furman , former economic chief for President Obama , estimated it would cost $ 350 billion .\nWe 'll almost certainly have to do it more than once , though . The shutdown of American life needed to contain the coronavirus outbreak could last a while . `` If this pandemic continues , we might have to do it again in a month , '' conservative economist Greg Mankiw told CNN . Even if we only had to do it twice , that would get us to $ 700 billion right there .\nWe also need to support state budgets . Another problem in 2008 was that states ca n't deficit-spend the way the federal government can . When the economy tanks , their tax revenue tanks with it , forcing them to cut spending , which makes the recession even worse . To avoid that dynamic this time around , progressive economist Josh Bivens recommended the federal government pick up the full tab for Medicaid for the year .\nMedicaid is jointly funded by the states and the feds , who kick in 37.5 percent and 62.5 percent , respectively . It 's one of the biggest expenditures on state budgets . Medicaid 's total cost was $ 593 billion in 2018 , so paying the program 's full freight for 2020 will cost the federal government at least another $ 225 billion .\nThat brings us to $ 925 billion already . But we 're not done .\nPaid sick leave needs to be made available to all Americans \u2014 ideally permanently , but at a minimum for the duration of the crisis .

But unfortunately the paid sick leave provision in particular is grossly inadequate , and the bill is being held up by GOP objections in the Senate .\nFrankly , the Republicans ' economic ideology is always poisonous , and especially at times like this . But it also sounds like Democrats are insisting the paid sick leave be provided on employers ' dime rather than the government 's \u2014 they 're refusing to compromise on what they should compromise on ( who pays for it ) and compromising on what they should n't ( universality and permanence ) . At any rate , the Congressional Budget Office has n't scored the bill yet , so it 's hard to say how much doing all this properly would cost . But it would probably put our $ 925 billion stimulus over the $ 1 trillion mark .\nWe 're still not done , though , because we should also think about helping businesses directly . Everything I 've discussed so far is about keeping Americans and their families financially whole , and the extra spending money should help businesses stay afloat as well . But plenty of businesses and industries wo n't be able to continue functioning whether people have money to spend or not .

We can make credit cheaper throughout the economy , or offer low-to-no interest loans directly via the federal government .
