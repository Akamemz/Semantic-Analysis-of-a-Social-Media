In fact, he has been limping along for some time already.\n\nTuesday\u2019s result was no political mandate. In his victory speech, Mr. Obama told supporters, \u201cYou made your voice heard,\u201d but the voice was more like a whisper. He attracted 9 million fewer votes than he did in his first campaign for \u201chope and change,\u201d which is slightly more than John McCain earned in 2008.
