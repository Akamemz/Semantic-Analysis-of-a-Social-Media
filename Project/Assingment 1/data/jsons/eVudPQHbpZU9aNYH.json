    "content": "Benghazi , awash in guns , has recently witnessed a string of assassinations as well as attacks on international missions , including a bomb said to be planted by another Islamist group that exploded near the United States mission there as recently as June . But a Libyan politician who had breakfast with Mr. Stevens at the mission the morning before he was killed described security , mainly four video cameras and as few as four Libyan guards , as sorely inadequate for an American ambassador in such a tumultuous environment . \u201c This country is still in transition , and everybody knows the extremists are out there , \u201d said Fathi Baja , the Libyan politician .\nPresident Obama condemned the killings , promised to bring the assailants to justice and ordered tighter security at all American diplomatic installations . The administration also sent 50 Marines to the Libyan capital , Tripoli , to help with security at the American Embassy there , ordered all nonemergency personnel to leave Libya and warned Americans not to travel there . A senior defense official said that the Pentagon sent two warships toward the Libyan coast as a precaution .\n\u201c These four Americans stood up for freedom and human dignity , \u201d Mr. Obama said in a televised statement from the White House Rose Garden with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton . \u201c Make no mistake , we will work with the Libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people . \u201d\nIn Tripoli , Libyan leaders also vowed to track down the attackers and stressed their unity with Washington .\nYussef Magariaf , president of the newly elected Libyan National Congress , offered \u201c an apology to the United States and the Arab people , if not the whole world , for what happened. \u201d He pledged new measures to ensure the security of foreign diplomats and companies . \u201c We together with the United States government are on the same side , standing in a united front in the face of these murderous outlaws . \u201d\nObama administration officials and regional officials scrambled to sort out conflicting reports about the attack and the motivation of the attackers . A senior Obama administration officials told reporters during a conference call that \u201c it was clearly a complex attack , \u201d but offered no details .\nCol. Wolfgang Pusztai , who until early August was Austria \u2019 s defense attach\u00e9 to Libya and visited the country every month , said in an e-mail that he believed the attack was \u201c deliberately planned and executed \u201d by about a core group of 30 to 40 assailants who were \u201c well trained and organized. \u201d But he said the reports from some terrorism experts that the attack may be linked to the recent death in drone strikes of senior Qaeda leaders , including Abu Yahya al-Libi , were unsupported .\nA translated version of the video that set off the uprising arrived first in Egypt before reaching the rest of the Islamic world . Its author , whose identity is now a mystery , devoted the video \u2019 s prologue to caricatured depictions of Egyptian Muslims abusing Egyptian Coptic Christians while Egyptian police officers stood by . It was publicized last week by an American Coptic Christian activist , Morris Sadek , well known here for his scathing attacks on Islam .\nMr. Sadek promoted the video in tandem with a declaration by Terry Jones \u2014 a Florida pastor best known for burning the Koran and promoting what he called \u201c International Judge Muhammad Day \u201d on Sept. 11 .\nThe video began attracting attention in the Egyptian news media , including the broadcast of offensive scenes on Egyptian television last week . At that point , American diplomats in Cairo informed the State Department of the festering outrage in the days before the Sept. 11 anniversary , said a person briefed on their concerns . But officials in Washington declined to address or disavow the video , this person said .\nBy late afternoon Tuesday , hundreds had gathered in mostly peaceful protest outside the United States Embassy here , overseen by a large contingent of Egyptian security forces . But around 6 p.m. , after the end of the workday and television news coverage of the event , the crowd began to swell , including a group of rowdy young soccer fans .\nThen , around 6:30 p.m. , a small group of protesters \u2014 one official briefed on the events put it around 20 \u2014 brought a ladder to the wall of the compound and quickly scaled it , gaining entrance to the ground . Embassy officials asked the Egyptian government to remove the infiltrators without using weapons or force , to avoid inflaming the situation , this official said . ( An embassy official said that contrary to reports on Tuesday , no one fired weapons in the air . ) But it took the Egyptian security officers five hours to remove the intruders , leaving them ample time to run around the grounds , deface American flags , and hoist the black flag favored by Islamic ultraconservatives and labeled with Islam \u2019 s most basic expression of faith , \u201c There is no god but God , and Muhammad is his prophet . \u201d\nIt is unclear if television images of Islamist protesters may have inspired the attack in Benghazi , which had been a hotbed of opposition to Colonel Qaddafi and remains unruly since the Libyan uprising resulted in his death . But Tuesday night , a group of armed assailants mixed with unarmed demonstrators gathered at the small compound that housed a temporary American diplomatic mission there .\nThe ambassador , Mr. Stevens , was visiting the city Tuesday from the United States Embassy compound in Tripoli to attend the planned opening of an American cultural center , and was staying at the mission . It is not clear if the assailants knew that the ambassador was at the mission .\nInterviewed at the scene on Tuesday night , many attackers and those who backed them said they were determined to defend their faith from the video \u2019 s insults .
