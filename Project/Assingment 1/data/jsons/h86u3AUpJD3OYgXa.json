    "content": "Red-state Kentucky \u2019 s broad embrace of Obamacare has been a comforting success story for the White House . But now the Affordable Care Act is the central issue in the state \u2019 s off-year governor \u2019 s race , and a Republican victory could be a portent for 2016 , when GOP presidential contenders will run on a renewed vow to repeal the act .\nAs Obamacare \u2019 s rollout floundered in 2013 , President Barack Obama repeatedly took solace in Kentucky \u2019 s success . The state \u2019 s exchange , known as Kynect , worked virtually glitch-free and helped sign up tens of thousands of uninsured people . Obama even invited outgoing Gov . Steve Beshear to his 2014 State of the Union and praised him as \u201c a man possessed \u201d by his crusade to make the president \u2019 s law work in a state where the Obama himself isn \u2019 t particularly beloved .\nGallup polling shows Kentucky saw the second biggest drop in its uninsured rate in the country , behind only Arkansas .\nYet , Republican gubernatorial nominee Matt Bevin , a tea party favorite who narrowly won a brutal primary last month and could run a competitive general election race , has made eliminating the state \u2019 s Obamacare programs \u2014 and sharply curtailing the ranks of the newly insured \u2014 a central plank of his platform . If he wins this November , more than half a million people who got covered through the exchange or an Obamacare-prescribed expansion of Medicaid could find themselves in health care limbo .\nBeshear , a Democrat and the only southern governor to fully implement and champion the cause of the Affordable Care Act , is furious .\n\u201c I am not going to allow someone to become governor of this state who wants to take us back to the 19th century , \u201d he said in a phone interview . \u201c For a serious candidate for governor to be advocating a simple repeal of the whole program without offering any kind of alternative which will continue health care for these people is irresponsible . \u201d\nBevin shrugs off the criticism . He insists that Obamacare is coverage in name only \u2014 that Kentuckians still lack access to high-quality health care , partly because Medicaid pays doctors such low rates , partly because he says too many people rely on emergency rooms . He wants to abolish Kynect \u2014 which he calls \u201c redundant \u201d and too expensive \u2014 and intends to give enrollees a year to sign up for subsidized coverage through HealthCare.gov , the federal portal for more than three dozen states . But that assumes the Supreme Court doesn \u2019 t abolish subsidies though HealthCare.gov in its decision in King v. Burwell , which is expected later this month .\nThat doesn \u2019 t worry Bevin . \u201c You \u2019 re worrying about a hypothesis , \u201d he said . \u201c Let \u2019 s let the Supreme Court rule . \u201d\nBevin would also put an end to Obamacare \u2019 s Medicaid expansion , and many of the hundreds of thousands of low-income Kentuckians who had signed up would simply be deemed ineligible to renew. \u201c When you reenroll , you may or may not have access to Medicaid going forward , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c People are not on it for extended periods of time . It \u2019 s not meant to be a lifestyle . It really isn \u2019 t . The point of it is to provide for those who truly have need . \u201d\nA Bevin win would ripple beyond Kentucky , where Republicans running for president and Congress are still working to articulate what health care in a post-Obamacare America might look like \u2014 presuming they could win a tricky repeal of the health law in the first place . A Bevin administration would be the first to actively undo a state exchange , becoming a test case for states looking to untangle themselves from Obamacare .\nOn the other hand , if Bevin loses , White House allies are sure to paint the election as a win for Obamacare .\n\u201c Because it is such a clearly red state at this moment , if Bevin were to lose and a key part to of his campaign is to rescind coverage as it exists today , it probably will be perceived as a victory for the Affordable Care Act , \u201d said Ron Pollack , executive director of the advocacy group Families USA .\nState Attorney General Jack Conway , the Democrat running to succeed the term-limited Beshear , would largely continue Beshear \u2019 s policy of promoting Kynect , while trying , rhetorically , to distinguish it from Obamacare .\nThe state \u2019 s most powerful Republicans , Sens . Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul , have been among the most vocal champions of Obamacare repeal , but Democrats here have managed to brand Kynect as distinct from the much-maligned health law .\n\u201c Jack Conway \u2019 s top priority is growing the economy and helping businesses create jobs , and making sure Kentuckians have access to healthcare is an important component of that goal , \u201d said Conway spokesman Daniel Kemp . \u201c Jack wants to make sure that the hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians who now have health insurance through Kynect , especially kids , keep their health insurance \u2014 not play politics or push an ideology that \u2019 s out of touch with Kentucky \u2019 s values . \u201d\nWhich doesn \u2019 t mean he wants to talk about it very much . Conway is in the tricky spot of embracing Kynect while trying to keep his distance from Obama and Obamacare , a term that still generates ire among Kentucky residents . A September 2014 Marist poll found that 61 percent of registered Kentucky voters had an unfavorable impression of Obamacare . Only 17 percent had negative feelings about Kynect .\nWhen asked directly about Kynect , Conway tends to hail his state \u2019 s efforts while indicting Washington , despite the fact that Obamacare created the state exchange .\n\u201c The people of Kentucky have distinguished between the inability of Washington to get it right and what Kentucky did , \u201d he said in an interview with the Associated Press last year .\nThe campaign declined to make Conway available for an interview . Some political observers think he will steer clear of talking health care on the trail .\n\u201c I think Conway will avoid talking as much about health care as he can , because he \u2019 s going to be running away from Obama as much as he can , \u201d said Al Cross , director of Kentucky \u2019 s Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues .\nKentucky Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jack Conway ( from left ) , Kentucky Gov . Steve Beshear and Kentucky Republican gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin . | AP Photos\nIt may be hard to avoid , particularly as insurers \u2019 preliminary rate requests suggest that health insurance premium could rise significantly in Kentucky next year .\nThe White House declined to comment on the race or the prospect of Kynect vanishing .

And he turns to his friend and said , \u2018 this is a great deal . This is a lot better than Obamacare , \u2019 \u201d Obama said . \u201c I don \u2019 t have pride of authorship on this thing . I just want the thing to work . \u201d\nAnd in Kentucky , to the delight of the White House , it did appear to work . More than 400,000 residents have enrolled in Medicaid because of Obamacare , according to state officials . Another 106,000 people had signed up for private insurance on the exchange through April .\nBut the Bluegrass State is also a reminder that implementation of the law is not the same thing as public buy-in : Beshear was able to enact the exchange and Medicaid expansion through executive order without relying on the legislature ; Bevin can use the same method to undo it .\nBevin \u2019 s emergence as the Republican nominee was an unlikely reversal of fortunes , just a year after he ran in the Senate GOP primary as a strident , tea party-affiliated conservative against McConnell .
