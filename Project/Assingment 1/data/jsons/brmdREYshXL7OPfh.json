    "content": "( CNN ) Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are historically unpopular , but large numbers of Americans who ca n't stand them will likely vote for one of them anyway . They 'll do this because , among other reasons , they 'll feel forced into choosing the lesser of two evils .\nAnd they should n't feel ( or more importantly , vote ) this way . U.S. presidential elections were never supposed to devolve into contests between just two people , even though that 's what happens in a winner-take-all system such as ours . The Constitution does not mention political parties at all , and the Framers were worried that the rise of powerful factions would undermine liberty . As John Adams wrote in a letter in 1780 : `` There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties , each arranged under its leader , and concerting measures in opposition to each other . This , in my humble apprehension , is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution . ''\nAnd even in 2016 , voters still have choices beyond Clinton or Trump . A viable third party has put forth a compelling alternative in the form of libertarian Gary Johnson . For the second presidential election in a row , the Libertarian Party has chosen Johnson , a softspoken entrepreneur and former governor of New Mexico , as its candidate . His running mate is the impressive former governor of Massachusetts , William Weld . And just in the last few days , David French -- a constitutional lawyer , National Review writer and Iraq war veteran -- has emerged as a potential independent candidate .\nBoth served as moderate Republicans who generally opposed runaway government spending while advocating social tolerance . Weld cut spending and privatized state services , earning high marks from the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank . Johnson pushed for school choice reforms and low taxes . Both supported drug decriminalization and same-sex marriage . As such , both embody the libertarian philosophy that government should leave people alone , an approach that is broadly popular with the American public .\nMany voters are quick to dismiss third-party candidates , but Johnson and Weld are different .

Contrast this with the presumptive Republican and Democratic nominees : Donald Trump is a thin-skinned reality TV star with an authoritarian streak , and Hillary Clinton is a former secretary of state whose signature contribution to foreign policy \u2014 the 2011 military intervention in Libya \u2014 was an unmitigated disaster . It 's no wonder Americans are reacting unfavorably to the idea of deciding whether Donald Trump 's complete lack of experience , decorum and honesty are more disqualifying than Hillary Clinton 's sleaziness and corruption .\nJUST WATCHED Gary Johnson blows Donald Trump a kiss Replay More Videos ...
