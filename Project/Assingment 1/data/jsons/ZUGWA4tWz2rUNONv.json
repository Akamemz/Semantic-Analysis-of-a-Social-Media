    "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin made an unusual and direct appeal to the American people Wednesday night to reject President Obama 's calls for possible use of force against Syria , using an op-ed in The New York Times to counter many of the arguments Obama made 24 hours earlier in a speech to the nation .\n`` The potential strike by the United States against Syria , despite strong opposition from many countries and major political and religious leaders , including the pope , will result in more innocent victims and escalation , potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria 's borders , '' Putin warned . `` A strike would increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism . It could undermine multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and further destabilize the Middle East and North Africa . It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance . ''\nCountering Obama 's historical references justifying possible `` limited '' U.S. strikes to damage Syrian President Bashar Assad 's chemical weapons , Putin painted his own picture of an international community endangered by the use of U.S. military might .\n`` It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States . Is it in America 's long-term interest ? I doubt it , '' wrote Putin . `` Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force , cobbling coalitions together under the slogan 'you 're either with us or against us . ' ``\nIn m any respects , Putin seemed to echo the arguments from critics of Obama 's call for military strikes , including Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. Putin also seemed to be playing to the fears many Americans have expressed in polls that show an overwhelming opposition to a military strike on Syria .\nIn a prime-time address to the nation Tuesday , Obama described the history of chemical weapons dating from World War I and said a failure to act forcefully against Assad could be read by some world leaders as a sign that the international community would turn a blind eye to future use of such weapons .\nBut Obama also used the speech to announce that he had asked Congress to delay voting on his call for authorization for a military strike to give time for an 11th hour diplomatic solution to work . The deal , which would require Assad to turn over chemical weapons to an international body , has been brokered in part by the Russians .\nPutin directly challenged Obama 's claim that the use of sarin gas on Damascus suburbs , which killed more than 1,400 civilians on Aug. 21 , came directly and inarguably from Assad 's forces . Wrote Putin :\n`` No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria . But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian Army , but by opposition forces , to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons , who would be siding with the fundamentalists . Reports that militants are preparing another attack \u2014 this time against Israel \u2014 can not be ignored . ''\nAnd on the 12th anniversary of 9/11 , Putin warned that a U.S. military strike could strengthen terrorists :\n`` Syria is not witnessing a battle for democracy , but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multireligious country . There are few champions of democracy in Syria . But there are more than enough Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government . The United States State Department has designated Al Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant , fighting with the opposition , as terrorist organizations . This internal conflict , fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition , is one of the bloodiest in the world . '' `` Mercenaries from Arab countries fighting there , and hundreds of militants from Western countries and even Russia , are an issue of our deep concern . Might they not return to our countries with experience acquired in Syria ? ''\nFinally , Putin argued that the use of U.S. military power without international backing actually gives foreign powers an incentive to acquire weapons of mass destruction .\n`` The world reacts by asking : if you can not count on international law , then you must find other ways to ensure your security . Thus a growing number of countries seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction . This is logical : if you have the bomb , no one will touch you . We are left with talk of the need to strengthen nonproliferation , when in reality this is being eroded . ''\nThe muscular assault on Obama 's credibility , published late Wednesday , included Putin 's ironic claim that his working relationship with Obama `` is marked by growing trust .
