( Simon Dawson/Reuters )\nAfter what seem like years of a phony war , British and European Union negotiators finally agreed on the terms of Britain \u2019 s departure from the EU earlier this week , and Theresa May announced it in the House of Commons . The deal covers more than 500 pages of legal and bureaucratic prose , and few but the negotiators have read it in full . But those who have say that it confirms the earlier leaks : After leaving , Britain will continue to be subject to EU rules and regulations more or less indefinitely but , as a non-EU-member state after March , the country will have no say or vote in designing them .\nIt doesn \u2019 t sound like a very attractive package , but May argues that this deal fully achieves the Brexit that the voters chose two years ago . It \u2019 s hard to square this claim with the \u201c red lines \u201d she vowed a year ago to never cross :\nRed Line : Britain will leave the single market and its regulations .\nDeal : Britain will sign on to a \u201c common rulebook \u201d of regulations that will in fact be the EU single-market rulebook .\nRed Line : Britain will leave the Customs Union in order to sign free-trade deals with non-EU countries such as the U.S .\nDeal : Britain will stay indefinitely in a customs union with the EU , which will make it impossible to negotiate free-trade deals with others , and Britain will only be able to leave it by agreement with the EU and with the consent of an international arbitration body .\nRed Line : Britain will be out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice .\nDeal : Britain will be subject to ECJ jurisdiction on regulation and trade matters , and U.K. courts will take account of its rulings .\nMay nonetheless is sticking to the line \u2014 which she has firmly , indeed obstinately , defended in two parliamentary appearances this week \u2014 that she has achieved the Brexit deal she wanted all along .
