    "content": "What did we learn about the Republican Party at the Ronald Reagan Library debate Wednesday night ? We discovered that leading GOP candidates think Reagan 's administration was part of a \u201c wild left-wing \u201d conspiracy to cripple American business over the hoax of climate change . Also : there , in a shrine to the man who reached out to the Soviet Union \u2019 s Mikhail Gorbachev and helped negotiate an end to the Cold War , nominal debate winner Carly Fiorina said she \u2019 ll refuse even to talk to the leader of Russia if she \u2019 s elected president .\nOf course , all the contenders genuflected at the memory of Reagan while trashing President Obama 's Iran deal -- yet nobody mentioned Reagan 's role in bolstering the Iranian hardliners by violating an embargo to sell them arms in exchange for help to the Nicaraguan contras and a possible hostage release .\nWe learned as well that when it comes to Donald Trump vs. the right wing media , it \u2019 s Trump 2 , conservative media personalities 0 . Just like Trump got Fox to bow to him after he savaged Megyn Kelly following the last debate , he humiliated radio host Hugh Hewitt \u2013 unbelievably , a \u201c panelist \u201d at this CNN debate -- by getting Hewitt to say that it wasn \u2019 t Trump \u2019 s fault that he confused the Kurds with the Quds force . \u201c It was my fault , \u201d Hewitt told MSNBC \u2019 s \u201c Morning Joe , \u201d and he seconded that Thursday night .\nHewitt also lobbed a softball question to Trump ( which he actually kind of flubbed ) giving him a chance to blast President Obama \u2019 s Syria policy , and some of his 2016 rivals for not supporting military intervention in 2013 . It looked as if Trump \u2019 s campaign against Hewitt as a \u201c third-rate \u201d radio host asking \u201c gotcha \u201d questions \u2013 backed by Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter \u2013 actually worked .\nOh , if you \u2019 re waiting for me to tell you definitively who \u201c won \u201d the debate , and who might begin to rise or fall in the polls as a result ? I \u2019 m sorry , I really have no idea . Dr. Ben Carson looked like he confused his One-A-Day vitamin with Lunesta ; he was barely able to keep his eyes open and talked in sleepy non-sequiturs . But I thought Carson blew the last debate , and he rose in the polls . So what do I know ?\nJeb Bush clearly had another mediocre night , which he can \u2019 t afford . He came out kind of peppy \u2013 even Trump praised his \u201c energy \u201d \u2013 and accused Trump of exactly the kind of special interest lobbying he rails against , saying the real estate mogul gave him money back when he ran for governor , and then unsuccessfully lobbied to place casinos in Florida . But Trump denied it and loudly talked over Bush ; there was brief confusion about whether the former governor was telling the truth ( PolitiFact later confirmed it ) ; and the moment faded .\nLikewise , Bush was later given a chance by CNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper to call Trump out on a Twitter insult to Bush \u2019 s Mexican-born wife Columba . Bush started strong , demanding an apology , but then faded again as Trump filibustered .\nBut Bush \u2019 s worst moment was when Hewitt asked him \u2013 in another kindness to Trump \u2013 about the fact that a lot of his foreign policy advisors worked for his brother , the last GOP president , who got us into disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . Trump then jabbed Bush \u2013 \u201c Your brother , and your brother \u2019 s administration , gave us Barack Obama \u201d \u2013 which led Bush to retort , \u201c My brother kept us safe. \u201d As if he didn \u2019 t remember his brother was president during the Sept. 11 attacks . It was that kind of night for Jeb !\nTrump didn \u2019 t have a great night either , but he has one thing in common with Reagan \u2013 so far he \u2019 s seemed to share an impermeable outer political coating with the Teflon president . He engaged in a juvenile spat with Rand Paul early on that ended in his insulting Paul \u2019 s looks , and looking kind of silly . Carly Fiorina absolutely owned him when she was asked about the episode when Trump clearly insulted her appearance -- 'Look at that face ! ' he told Rolling Stone . 'Would anyone vote for that ? \u201d -- then insisted he was actually talking about her \u201c persona . \u201d\n\u201c Women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said , \u201d Fiorina shot back . \u201c I think she \u2019 s got a beautiful face and I think she \u2019 s a beautiful woman , \u201d Trump countered , with characteristic sexism , but looking uncharacteristically sheepish . This was an establishment crowd , heavy on donors , and they were tougher on Trump than the Fox audience was .\nPerhaps most damaging , Trump himself seemed relatively \u201c low-energy \u201d \u2013 his constant jibe against Bush . He told reporters later that it was his attempt at looking presidential , but whatever : he was much less a factor than in the last GOP go-round .\nStill , pundits have predicted Trump \u2019 s decline before , including after his boorish performance in the last debate , and they \u2019 ve been wrong . Trump himself crowed about a Drudge Report poll showing him the winner of the debate , again . That poll was right last time , so who knows .\nOnce again , lots of the punditocracy claimed Sen. Marco Rubio was one of the debate winners , but that 's crazy . The young Florida senator fell flat on his face with an early joke about the California drought : \u201c I brought my own water ! \u201d he said with a big dumb smile . That was a twofer : He made fun of a local tragedy on a day when the death toll of the state \u2019 s drought-fueled wildfires continued to mount , and he reminded everyone of his humiliating big-gulp moment when he got to reply to Obama \u2019 s State of the Union address two years ago .\nWhen Trump dinged Rubio \u2013 accurately -- for having the worst absentee record in the Senate , Rubio essentially defended it by saying Congress isn \u2019 t getting anything done . So he stopped doing his job because it was frustrating ? In the real world , he \u2019 d get fired . Score one for Trump . Anyway , lots of smart-ish folks thought Rubio did well in the last debate to0 , but he went nowhere in the polls .\nFiorina probably had the best night -- if you don \u2019 t fact check anything she said . She flat out lied about what the doctored , bogus Planned Parenthood videos showed , claiming they featured a still living intact aborted fetus , killed for its organs , when they did no such thing . When she insisted she \u2019 d call Iran \u2019 s Supreme Leader to call off the recent nuclear deal on her first day as president , the CNN moderators missed a chance to ask her why , as CEO of Hewlett Packard , she skirted anti-Iran sanctions -- rather like the night 's patron saint , Ronald Reagan -- and sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment to the anti-U.S. regime .\nShe was allowed to misrepresent her awful HP record , and inaccurately trash Hillary Clinton on Benghazi and her controversial email practices . Still , she \u2019 s a poised , practiced debater , and she may get another small bump in the polls .\nI don \u2019 t think any of the rest , including the occasionally statesmanlike John Kasich , did enough last night to significantly change their campaign standing . Gov . Scott Walker was a bit more energetic but probably didn \u2019 t make enough of an impression to reverse his sinking fortunes . Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov . Mike Huckabee continued stridently narrow-casting to the far-right evangelical community , which might matter if Trump suddenly left the field . But the twice divorced libertine billionaire and born-again Republican is leading among that group , too .\nWhoops , I have n't mentioned the pumped up , inauthentic `` It 's not about me , guys '' flailing New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie . Oh well . Now I have .\nAt any rate , the seemingly interminable three-hour debate \u2013 I accidentally typed \u201c three-month debate , \u201d because that \u2019 s how it felt \u2013 worked against anyone who had a good moment or two .
