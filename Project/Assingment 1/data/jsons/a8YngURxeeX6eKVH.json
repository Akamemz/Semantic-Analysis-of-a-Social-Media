    "content": "It took only two minutes to know that the second night of the Democratic debates on CNN would be very annoying . \u201c Tonight ! \u201d a gravelly voiced narrator intoned over a video promo that introduced each candidate as though they were characters in some guilty-pleasure reality TV show . \u201c A critical rematch ! Former Vice President Joe Biden , aiming to reclaim his momentum . Sen. Kamala Harris : not backing down after clashing with Biden over race. \u201d The presentation would have been a good fit for WrestleMania . Presidential politics : This time , it \u2019 s personal !\nThe implication was clear : CNN expected the candidates to rumble . On Wednesday night , the network got what it wanted . The debate was a contentious one\u2014though not as feisty as Tuesday \u2019 s debate , largely thanks to the absence of the perpetually snippy John Delaney\u2014with Biden going after Harris and basically everyone else onstage going after Biden . Although the moderators were less aggressive about cutting candidates off , as they had mercilessly the night before , Dana Bash , Don Lemon , and Jake Tapper largely took a hands-off approach , setting up each thematic segment of the debate with a specific question directed toward a single candidate , and then bringing in other candidates by asking them to respond to what their counterparts just said . \u201c \u201d Do you have a response ? \u201d was how the follow-up usually went . What they really meant was : Fight !\nThough this strategy ultimately proved exasperating , it was a mild improvement on Tuesday night \u2019 s debate , in which the moderators spent much of their time aggressively questioning the positions of Sens . Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , the two most prominent progressives in the field . While I understand the impulse to use the debates as an opportunity to hold candidates \u2019 feet to the fire on their policies and public statements , the questions seemed mostly designed to get Warren and Sanders to admit that they are not , in fact , centrists . Mission accomplished ?\nAnyway , someone at CNN apparently decided the moderators should step back and let the candidates tear each other up instead . And so on Wednesday , Bash , Lemon , and Tapper mostly let the candidates engage with each other , intervening only to call time or bring other voices into the fray . This minimalist approach worked well during the health care section of the debate , in part because it exposed how uncomfortable both Biden and Harris are when being challenged on this topic . That \u2019 s valuable information for Democratic voters as they try to envision the general election .\nBy the end of the second hour , however , CNN had reached the limits of the \u201c your response ? \u201d strategy . It turns out that \u201c Candidate X , another candidate says this thing , what do you think ? \u201d is not a productive mode of questioning . At times it felt like the moderators had primarily researched what the candidates had said about each other \u2019 s policies , not what those policies actually said . The laziness showed .\nSometimes , when one candidate actually had criticized another \u2019 s policies , it was clear why the former should be asked to respond , as in the health care portion . But more often , the moderators would just randomly invite Candidate Y to respond to Candidate X \u2019 s statements without setting up why they thought Candidate Y \u2019 s perspective would be valuable . \u201c We will have to stop separating children from their parents , make it so that it \u2019 s easier for people to seek asylum in this country , make sure that we are securing our borders and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws , \u201d Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said during the immigration portion . \u201c Mr . Yang , your response ? \u201d was Lemon \u2019 s follow-up . What , exactly , was Andrew Yang supposed to be responding to ? Gabbard hadn \u2019 t mentioned him at all .\nA little bit later , Biden offered an odd , garbled comment about how \u201c anybody that crosses the stage with a Ph.D. , you should get a green card for seven years . We should keep them here. \u201d Nobody understood quite what he meant . Instead of asking Biden to clarify , though , Lemon said , \u201c Thank you . Thank you very much , Mr. Vice President . Gov . Inslee , what \u2019 s your response ? \u201d What ? We didn \u2019 t need to hear from Jay Inslee about Joe Biden \u2019 s confusing statement . We needed to hear from Joe Biden about his confusing statement .\nThe candidates were sometimes confused by the moderators \u2019 tactics , too . At one point , Biden said something about how immigrants made America great , and how President Barack Obama tried hard to change the immigration system in the face of significant pushback . \u201c Sen . Gillibrand , what \u2019 s your response ? \u201d Lemon asked . Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand didn \u2019 t have a response , because she wasn \u2019 t expecting to be called on , because Biden \u2019 s answer had absolutely nothing to do with her . \u201c Ummm , \u201d she said , fumbling for a few seconds before eventually eking out an answer about treating others the way you \u2019 d want to be treated . The sequence may come to be seen as a gaffe on her part , but it \u2019 s more accurate to see it as a function of the moderators \u2019 strategy , if we can call it that , since their follow-ups barely required them to think about the substance of anything said .\nI will concede that it probably wasn \u2019 t just laziness that dictated CNN \u2019 s approach Wednesday night . There were 10 people onstage and less than three hours scheduled for the debate , after all . CNN had to find some way to get all of the candidates involved , and daisy-chaining one candidate \u2019 s response after another was certainly one way to solve that problem .
