Boehner on Thursday called on President Obama to release a cache of emails that Republicans say clearly prove senior White House and State Department officials sought to mislead the American public about the Benghazi terrorist attack during last year \u2019 s election campaign .\nMr. Boehner , Ohio Republican , told reporters on Capitol Hill that the administration now has a chance to clear up some of the lingering questions about when it learned that the attack was indeed \u201c conducted by Islamic terrorists . \u201d\nAt issue is the extent to which electoral politics may have motivated White House officials to strip any mention of al Qaeda or terrorism from unclassified \u201c talking points \u201d about who the administration thought was behind the Sept. 11 attack .\nThe talking points were given to U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations Susan E. Rice , who appeared on several Sunday talk shows Sept. 16 \u2014 five days after the Benghazi attack . Mrs. Rice characterized the incident as a spontaneous assault that had grown out of a protest against a U.S.-made video denigrating Islam .\nAlthough the talking points have been discussed extensively over the past eight months , one exchange during a dramatic hearing Wednesday by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee appears to have triggered a new wave of interest .\nDuring the hearing , Rep. Trey Gowdy , South Carolina Republican , claimed at one point to be reading from an email by acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Beth Jones to other senior State Department and White House officials on Sept. 12 \u2014 one day after the Benghazi attack .\nMr. Gowdy said Mrs. Jones asserted in the email her belief that the group responsible for carrying out the attacks was Ansar al-Shariah , which she said was \u201c affiliated with Islamic terrorists. \u201d It was reported months ago that U.S. officials in Libya had told Washington that Ansar al-Shariah claimed responsibility on the day of the attack .\nReference to the email set off something of a firestorm among Democrats on Thursday . Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland the ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee , said the hearing revealed nothing new , and State Department officials asserted that Mr. Gowdy quoted Mrs. Jones \u2018 email inaccurately and out of context .\n\u201c One of the concerns is , the way that the email was read , there was a potential inadvertent inaccuracy in the word \u2014 use of the word \u2018 terrorist , \u2019 \u201d said State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell .\n\u201c My understanding is that aspects of this correspondence may have been inadvertently entered into the record incorrectly , \u201d Mr. Ventrell said .\nHe added that \u2014 contrary to Mr. Gowdy \u2019 s reading of the email \u2014 the word used in the email was not \u201c terrorist , \u201d but \u201c extremist . \u201d\nMr. Gowdy confirmed that the email used the word extremist but blamed that on the department for not releasing the emails , instead letting members and staff examine them only under supervision .\n\u201c I \u2019 m entirely capable of misreading my own handwriting , \u201d he said .\nHe also accused the State Department of \u201c playing word games \u201d and wanting \u201c to be politically correct \u201d about Muslim terrorism .\n\u201c The broader point is there is not one word [ in the email ] about a video , not one word about a spontaneous protest , \u201d he said .\nMr. Cummings suggested that Mrs. Jones \u2018 email was intentionally mischaracterized by Republicans in an attempt to \u201c generate an entirely new controversy out of nothing . \u201d\nIn a statement Thursday evening , Mr. Cummings said \u201c five different congressional committees have had access to this email for months . \u201d\n\u201c The email refers to reports that Ansar al-Sharia took credit for the attacks in a Facebook posting , but shortly after the email was sent , the group publicly denied that it was involved in the attack , \u201d he added .\nA congressional source on the Democratic side of the House said Ansar al-Shariah denied involvement well before Mrs. Rice said in TV appearances that the attack likely grew out of a protest similar to those at the same time in other Middle Eastern cities .\nA final version of the talking points made no mention al Qaeda or Ansar al-Shariah , and instead referred to the Benghazi attackers as \u201c extremists \u201d and in one place even protesters rather than terrorists .\nIn reference to the talking points Thursday , Mr. Boehner said : \u201c You can characterize it any way you want , but somebody clearly decided they didn \u2019 t like the references to Islamic terrorism and made changes in this document . \u201d\nSpeculation appeared to swirl among Democrats that the goal of House Republicans with regard to Benghazi is to damage former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in the event she runs for president in 2016 .\nMrs. Clinton has not said whether she intends to run , but a veteran Clinton strategist told The Associated Press on Thursday that \u201c the Republicans are pulling out the stops to manufacture a scandal , but it \u2019 s not likely to stick on Hillary Clinton or Democrats in general . \u201d\nAlso Thursday , former Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly suggested to House Republicans that they subpoena Mrs. Clinton to get the answers they seek .
