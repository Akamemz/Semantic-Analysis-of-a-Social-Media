    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Donald Trump has learned he can get away with anything .\nWhile the President has always profited from creating his own reality , the impact of having a commander in chief who so frequently bends fact is only beginning to be understood .\nOn Sunday , White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked by CNN 's Jake Tapper whether she thinks the President 's job included lying to the American people and whether his distortions created a credibility crisis for his White House .\nBefore Trump , the idea of having a President who habitually fails to tell the truth and survives would have been unthinkable . But it 's becoming clear that Trump 's tenure is not just a lesson in fractured presidential convention . It amounts to a unique challenge to the office of the presidency itself , to the institutions that underpin American democracy and the long-held idea that government can only function effectively if it has the trust of the governed .\nThe most shocking aspect of the President 's latest flurry of untruths in recent days relating to events before the 2016 election is that they were not at all shocking to a nation numbed by his barrage of easily disprovable claims and statements .\nRevelations that Trump dictated a doctor 's report on his health before voters went to the polls and his ever-shifting story on a hush payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels might have been a debilitating blow to any normal politician .\nIn Trump 's case , they were simply more of the same flurry of daily controversies that characterize his presidency . While his critics reacted with outrage , his supporters saw media fact checks as just more `` fake news . ''\nFormer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , whose criticisms Trump has previously rejected , compared the President 's method to the `` moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts '' described by George Orwell in his novel `` Nineteen Eighty-Four .\n`` Up is down , black is white , war is peace , '' Clapper recently said on CNN . `` What disturbs me is this is becoming normal in this country . The people just accept the fact that the place to look for truth is not the White House . ''\nTrump 's strategy of prevarication is about to face its biggest test .\nThe looming midterm elections offer voters their first chance to judge his conduct since his earth-shaking capture of the presidency .\nWhile there 's no evidence that Trump broke the law before the election or since , his thickening legal challenges will show whether the evasions and shifting stories that helped him reinvent politics can withstand the more rigid codes of the rule of law and the will of the voters over time .\nSome Trump critics believe there is more going on here than a President who lies to just to get out of trouble .\nMichael Hayden , a former CIA and National Security Agency director under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush , argues in a new book that the ideals of America itself are threatened by such behavior .\nHayden , a CNN commentator , points out that Trump 's biggest clashes have been with power centers that have the evidence-based pursuit of truth and fact as part of their mandate -- like the intelligence agencies , judicial authorities , news organizations and scientists .\nHe writes in `` The Assault on Intelligence '' that the American experiment depends on a Jeffersonian vision of truth based on objective reality .\n`` What becomes of the legitimacy of that vision -- the legitimacy of that experiment -- in a world that has redefined or is simply indifferent to truth ? And are we about to find out ? ''\nIt 's not difficult to see why the President might conclude that willingness to shade the truth is a useful weapon -- its effectiveness was reconfirmed as recently as last week .\n`` If elected , Mr Trump , I can state unequivocally , will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency , '' the doctor , Harold Bornstein , had written .\nThough the revelation confirmed the suspicions of many at the time -- it was a classic Trump line , improbable in its audacity , yet unsurprising because it came from a man who often acted as his own spokesman to generate tabloid interest during the 1980s .\nAnd , of course , at the time of the dictated letter , Trump was lashing his opponent Hillary Clinton as lacking the `` mental and physical stamina '' to take on ISIS .\nBut though it was embarrassing when the origins were exposed , no one can say it did n't work : By falsifying a report on his health , the oldest man elected President for a first term had defused a nettlesome political problem .\nIt was also a lesson that behavior that would have felled any other candidate did not harm Trump as he evaded accountability .\nFor instance , his lawyer Michael Cohen paid off Daniels while he was simultaneously lambasting Clinton as bad for women over her treatment of accusers who claimed affairs or sexual misconduct by her husband .\nJUST WATCHED Inauguration crowds in fast forward Replay More Videos ...
