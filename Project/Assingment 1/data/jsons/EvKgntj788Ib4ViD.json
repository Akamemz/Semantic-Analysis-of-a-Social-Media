    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) The Pentagon successfully shot down an intercontinental ballistic missile using its own upgraded long-range interceptor missile on Tuesday in what was widely seen as a test of US ability to counter a North Korean missile launch .\nThe Missile Defense Agency launched a ground-based interceptor from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to intercept a US-launched mock ICBM target over the Pacific Ocean , according to a US defense official .\nThe test ICBM , which flew thousands of miles per hour , was destroyed `` thousands of miles off the coast '' of the US mainland , with the intercept taking place northeast of Hawaii , the director of the Missile Defense Agency , Vice Adm. Jim Syring , told reporters at the Pentagon via a Wednesday phone call .\nThe interceptor `` destroyed the target in a direct collision , '' according to a statement from the Missile Defense Agency .\n`` The intercept of a complex , threat-representative ICBM target is an incredible accomplishment ... and a critical milestone for this program , '' Syring said in a statement shortly after the test .\n`` This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland , and this test demonstrates that we have a capable , credible deterrent against a very real threat , '' he said .\n`` Everything we did was operationally realistic , '' Syring told reporters , adding that `` decoys '' were deployed by the target ICBM to make the test more realistic .\nHe said that the test ICBM `` flew at a higher altitude and a longer range and a higher velocity than any other target we 've flown to date . ''\nHe said the designers of the test ICBM worked with the intelligence community in order to replicate a realistic Iranian or North Korean threat that the US might face between now and 2020 .\n`` I was confident before the test that we have the capability to defeat any threat that they would throw at us and I am more confident -- even more confident today , '' Syring added .\n`` We are launching an interceptor that is flying thousands of miles past Hawaii and that requires us to shut down large parts of the ocean in terms of mariner ship traffic and air traffic , '' he said .\nThe next test will take place in August/September 2018 and will involve multiple interceptors attempting to take out a single test ICBM .\n`` We shoot more than one in a real world operational scenario , '' Syring said .\nWhile the Pentagon is calling this test a success , some experts cautioned that the $ 40 billion missile defense system still has a long way to go before it can be considered fully developed .\n`` It marks two successes in a row , which is significant , but only two hits out of the last five attempts ; that is , only a 40 % success rate since early 2010 , '' said Philip E. Coyle , a senior fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation .\n`` In school , 40 % is n't a passing grade , '' added Coyle , who formerly headed the Pentagon 's office of operational test and evaluation . `` Based on its testing record , we can not rely upon this missile defense program to protect the United States from a North Korean long-range missile . ''\nWashington Rep. Adam Smith , the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee , congratulated the Missile Defense Agency for a successful test but sounded a note of caution that `` much work remains to be done to ensure we have a reliable and effective system . ''\n`` After an investment of more than $ 40 billion since 2002 , it 's good that the Missile Defense Agency is finally doing a missile defense test against an ICBM target , some 13 years after the first Ground-Based Interceptor system 's deployment , '' Smith told CNN .\n`` Flight intercept testing , particularly against realistic targets , remains a key element of the program to assess the effectiveness of our deployed missile defense system , as well as to demonstrate the capability and continue the development of such a system , '' he added .\nThe test comes just two days after Pyongyang fired a short-range ballistic missile that traveled an estimated 248 miles , splashing down within Japan 's exclusive economic zone .\nIn a Monday tweet , President Donald Trump joined the leaders of South Korea and Japan in condemning the test , saying that North Korea had `` shown great disrespect '' for China by `` shooting off yet another ballistic missile .

Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 29 , 2017\nThe Pentagon insists the long-planned test of its ground-based interceptor system is not solely about North Korea , and the test is aimed at being able to challenge any threatening ICBM , including possibly from Iran in the future .\nThat test involved firing a new version of the military 's single long-range ground-based interceptor missile , which is currently based in Alaska and California .
