    "content": "Recent debates over US government spying have focused on one specific program : the National Security Agency 's bulk collection of Americans ' telephone records \u2014 and the Patriot Act provision that supplied the program 's legal justification . From that perspective , the partial expiration of the Patriot Act a week ago and the subsequent passage of surveillance reform legislation might seem like a decisive victory against mass surveillance .\nBut the surveillance debate is actually a lot bigger than the phone records program and the Patriot Act . The NSA has other spying programs with other legal foundations . And the USA Freedom Act , which President Obama signed on Tuesday , does n't do anything to rein them in .\nOn Friday , I talked to John Napier Tye , a former State Department official who resigned last year over what he regards as unconstitutional surveillance by the US federal government . He sees the USA Freedom Act as `` a small step in the right direction , '' but he 's hoping the next step will be a broader debate about other ways the US government spies on innocent Americans .\nTye says the most intrusive NSA programs are based on an obscure executive order\nMost people have heard about the Patriot Act , which was signed just weeks after the 9/11 attacks , and was reformed this week by the USA Freedom Act . But Tye argues the real action is elsewhere .\n`` You have to keep in mind that most NSA collection on Americans was not under the Patriot Act . It was under other legal authorities . And none of that surveillance is affected by this new law , '' he says . `` When you think about all the collection that the NSA has been doing on Americans , a small percentage \u2014 5 or 10 percent , maybe less \u2014 was under the Patriot Act . ''\nTye points to two other sources of authority for government spying . One is the 2008 FISA Amendments Act , which is the legal basis for a controversial NSA program called PRISM that collects private data from major internet companies like Google and Facebook . The other is Executive Order 12333 , a Reagan-era directive that has become the basis for a lot of NSA spying .\nTye says that EO 12333 is `` an executive order , it 's not a statute . It was never passed by Congress . It was originally issued by President Reagan in 1981 and has been amended several times since then \u2014 including by George W . Bush . ''\nA huge amount of our data is collected : Gmails and Yahoo messages , Facebook messages , Apple iMessages\nEO 12333 `` gives a very broad grant of authority to intelligence agencies to do all kinds of things , '' Tye says . `` There 's one section in there that allows the NSA to collect data on US persons as part of a lawful foreign intelligence investigation . That provision is being used to collect a huge amount of Americans ' communications and data . ''\nWhen the government collects information overseas , it is n't bound by most US surveillance laws . The NSA has reserved the right to `` incidentally '' collect Americans ' private communications overseas so long as Americans are not the target of a particular surveillance effort . But Tye argues that this is a huge loophole in practice .\n`` I do n't think most Americans understand that almost all of their internet and phone data is either stored on backup servers overseas or transits outside of our borders , '' he says . `` A huge amount of our data is collected under this authority outside the borders of the US \u2014 Gmails and Yahoo messages , Facebook messages , Apple iMessages , Twitter , every service you can think of . ''\nTye was briefed on NSA spying after the Snowden disclosures\nTye says he has firsthand knowledge of the extent of NSA spying programs . That 's because he was an official in the State Department 's Bureau of Democracy , Human Rights , and Labor in 2013 when Edward Snowden 's revelations became public .\n`` My jobs was internet freedom , promoting free and open internet around the world , '' Tye says . `` When the Snowden leaks happened in June of 2013 , I was not surprised . I knew that a lot of stuff had been happening . I knew that a lot of surveillance was going on that no one knew about . And it did n't surprise me that this was finally front-page news . ''\nCongress should take a more active role in overseeing executive branch activity\nTye says that after the Snowden leaks , `` part of my job was to help develop responses to initiatives within the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly by Germany , Brazil , and other countries that were very concerned with online privacy . To be able to properly negotiate those efforts , I was briefed on the scope of US intelligence practices . In two different classified briefings , one in the fall of 2013 and one in the first part of 2014 , I learned about activities under 12333 . ''\nTye believed these programs were unconstitutional and began filing complaints inside the government about them .

If Obama does n't , Tye would like Congress to hold hearings on the issue . `` I think that Congress should take a more active role in overseeing executive branch activity under 12333 , '' Tye says . `` Congress should hold hearings and find out what protections really exist for Americans and how much our data is being collected .
