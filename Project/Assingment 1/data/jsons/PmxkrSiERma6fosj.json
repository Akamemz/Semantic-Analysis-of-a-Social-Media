    "content": "Not even three weeks ago on February 7 , Chris Christie , then a candidate for the Republican nomination , stood in the center of a middle school cafeteria in Hampton , New Hampshire and told a few hundred people that Donald Trump is a joke .\nHe said his campaign was nothing but \u201c make believe , \u201d just like The Apprentice , and that his policy proposals , to the extent that he has any , are stupid .\n\u201c Bravado , by itself , is not a plan , \u201d he said , \u201c I like him , he \u2019 s a good person , he \u2019 s just not the right person to be President of the United States and not the person that we \u2019 d want representing our country . \u201d\nAnd then he mocked that bravado in a long , involved monologue in which he impersonated Trump \u2019 s voice .\nBut on Friday afternoon , Christie\u2014standing at Trump \u2019 s side onstage in Fort Worth , Texas\u2014had a change of heart .\n\u201c There is no one who is better prepared to provide America with the strong leadership that it needs both at home and around the world than Donald Trump , \u201d Christie said , \u201c he is\u2014looking at the five people on that stage last night\u2014the clear standout and the person who will do exactly what needs to be done to make America a leader around the world again . \u201d\nChristie didn \u2019 t provide an explanation for his decision in his remarks , other than to say Trump is a \u201c loyal \u201d friend . The rationale is that this is an attempt to mitigate the damage of a Trump candidacy or , not altogether unrealistically , a Trump presidency . If Trump is going to be the de facto leader of the Republican party , the thinking goes , it \u2019 s best to get on his good side and attempt to influence his policies as much as possible .\nNew Jersey Republicans floated other theories , on Facebook\u2014namely that Christie , the former United States Attorney from New Jersey , might be positioning himself to be President Trump \u2019 s Attorney General . Presumably in a Trump administration , the federal investigations into his office wouldn \u2019 t be disqualifying .\nOr that Christie loathes Marco Rubio , who he pilloried in his last debate , so much that he would endorse Satan himself to ensure he never wins the nomination .\nBoth Christie and Trump noted , on Friday , that they have a history , and it \u2019 s true .\nTrump memorably built casinos in Atlantic City in the 1990s ( and indeed some still bear his name , much to his chagrin ) while Christie was getting his start in local politics .\nAnd somewhat awkwardly Christie , in his role as U.S. Attorney , locked up Charles Kushner\u2014the father of Trump \u2019 s son-in-law\u2014for two years for making illegal campaign contributions , evading taxes and tampering with a witness .\nIn the past , they seemed more like real friends than just acquaintances .\nIn 2014 , I interviewed Trump for a story about the closing of the Taj Mahal . Atlantic City had crumbled since the casino opened in 1990 , and Christie had , for the previous four years , tried and spectacularly failed to keep it from dying altogether . But Trump refused to criticize him on the record . All he would say , publicly , was , \u201c the governor \u2019 s trying very hard . It \u2019 s a tough situation , but he \u2019 s trying very hard . \u201d\nEven as late as November , the two men were keeping the gloves on .\nAfter Trump repeatedly and incorrectly insisted that he had witnessed Muslims cheering in the streets of Jersey City on 9/11 , Christie declined to attack him . He tiptoed around Trump \u2019 s lie , saying meekly , \u201c I don \u2019 t recall that . \u201d\nBut as the primary dragged on and Trump grew more popular , Christie began to attack him .\nWhen Trump declined to appear at the Fox News debate in Iowa in January , after bickering pettily with the network over its supposedly \u201c unfair \u201d coverage , Christie said , \u201c the American people should wonder , you know , if you \u2019 re not willing to show up when everything isn \u2019 t going your way\u2026 \u201d\nOn February 7th , the New Hampshire primary just a few days away , Christie \u2019 s knocks at Trump were growing in tandem with his desperation .\n\u201c The core of my criticism of Mr. Trump is this , and it was said last night at the debate : How ? How ? The core of my criticism is how ? \u201d he said .\n\u201c First he says he \u2019 s gon na build a wall across the entire border to the United States and Mexico . Let \u2019 s stop first at the moment of , Why ? Why ? \u201d he said . The audience laughed , but he wasn \u2019 t done .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not gon na work by the way , \u201d he said , \u201c I \u2019 ve never seen a wall that a determined human being couldn \u2019 t get over , under or around . Right ? Never . \u201d\nChristie assumed Trump \u2019 s persona , right down to the voice\u2014 \u201c beautiful , marvelous wall . An incredible wall . The wall is gon na be unbelievable . The wall is gon na have a door , the door is gon na open and close and good people come in , the bad people go out . It \u2019 s gon na be an amazing wall . It \u2019 s gon na be a beautiful wall and the Mexicans are gon na pay for the wall because Trump says , they \u2019 ll pay for the wall . \u201d\nHe went back to being Chris Christie : \u201c How ?

We \u2019 re all gon na get so rich that we \u2019 re not gon na have to worry about Social Security\u2014how do you answer that ? I \u2019 m opposed to that ? Like , what do you say , right ? I mean I \u2019 ve known him for 13 years . \u201d\nHe then added , \u201c I like Donald , he \u2019 s a very good guy , he \u2019 s a very smart guy .
