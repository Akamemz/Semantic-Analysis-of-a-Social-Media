    "content": "North Carolina 's anti-abortion license plate is unconstitutional because the state does n't provide the same forum for motorists on the other side of the contentious issue , a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday .\nA three-judge panel of the Richmond-based 4th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a federal judge 's ruling that the `` Choose Life '' license plate is unconstitutional .\nLawmakers approved the anti-abortion plates in 2011 and rejected proposals to offer plates with messages `` Trust Women '' and `` Respect Choice . '' That constitutes `` blatant viewpoint discrimination squarely at odds with the First Amendment , '' wrote appeals court Judge James A. Wynn , who is from North Carolina .\n`` Today 's ruling protects the right of North Carolinians of all political beliefs to have equal access to avenues for free speech , '' American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina attorney Chris Brook said in a written statement . Brook , who urged the appeals court to strike down the specialty plate at a hearing in October , said the ACLU would have taken the same position had the state authorized a plate only for abortion-rights supporters .\nThe state could appeal the panel 's decision to the full appeals court or to the U.S. Supreme Court . Noelle Talley , spokeswoman for Attorney General Roy Cooper , said state attorneys were reviewing the ruling but had no further comment .\nThe central issue in the case was whether the specialty license plate is purely government speech , which would allow the state sole discretion over the message , or individual speech implicating the First Amendment . The appeals court concluded that the program is a blend of the two , but that it tilts heavily in favor of private expression .\n`` Specialty plates are closely associated with the drivers who select and pay for them , '' Wynn wrote . `` And the driver , on whose car the special message constantly appears for all those who share the road to see , is the ultimate communicator . ''\nThe 4th Circuit previously ruled the same way on South Carolina 's `` Choose Life '' license plate . Wynn noted that three of the other four federal appeals courts that have ruled on specialty plates also have concluded that they are not solely government speech .\nIn North Carolina , the `` Choose Life '' plate was one of 80 specialty tags approved by the General Assembly in 2011 . Each `` Choose Life '' plate would cost $ 25 , with $ 15 of that going to the Carolina Pregnancy Care Fellowship , an association of nonprofit pregnancy counseling centers .\nThe state has been barred from manufacturing the plates while the ACLU 's challenge is pending .",
