Since the 1980s, the share of people living on less than $1.25 day has plummeted from 53% to just 17% in 2011. Globally, those at the bottom of the economic ladder is \u201cfalling faster than ever,\u201d according to Oxford economics Fellow, Max Roser.\n\nIndeed, the World Bank is so elated by the trend that it believes, for the first time in human history, poverty can be completely eliminated by 2030.\n\nYet, at the same time, the global rich-poor class gap is skyrocketing; as of 2014, the richest 80 people in the world now control more wealth than the bottom 50% combined [PDF].\n\nSource: Oxfam\n\nSo, why is poverty decreasing while inequality is increasing?\n\nLund University economist, Andreas Bergh, has a contentious, if fascinating, theory: greater inequality means a greater portion of the population exists at the lowest income, making it cheaper to provide goods to a larger share of lower-income consumers. The more people need cheap products, the more incentive companies have to streamline non-luxury versions of food, education, and other goods. In other words, lower-income people scale.\n\nIn this way, rather than having an even distribution of income over many economic classes (e.g. low, low-middle, middle, upper-middle, and upper), an economy with only a few classes allows companies to focus on making products for greater portion of similar customers.\n\nIn his paper, \u201cWhen More Poor Means Less Poverty,\u201d Bergh finds that as inequality increases around the world, the cheaper rice and Big Macs become.\n\nHis explanation is worth quoting in full:\n\nOn average, a 10 point increase in the Gini coefficient (corresponding to shifting from the level of inequality in Latvia to Kenya) decreases the time required to buy a kilo of rice by 7 minutes (compared to the 2007 global average of 22 minutes). Similarly a corresponding inequality increase would on average decrease the time required for a Big Mac by 16 minutes (compared to the 2007 global average of 37 minutes).\n\nThe Android Class\n\nThink of the difference between the global poor and rich as the difference between the iOS and Android operating systems. Apple designed a phone that only a relatively small portion of the world can afford.
