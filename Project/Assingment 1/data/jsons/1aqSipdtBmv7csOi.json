On the controversy over immigrant families , Mr. Trump said : \u201c We have to take care of separation , \u201d according to a lawmaker in the room . \u201c It \u2019 s too nasty , it \u2019 s too nasty . \u201d\nMr. Trump took no questions and engaged in no discussion on a day when family separations engulfed nearly every other issue . Many Republicans had come to the meeting prepared to press Mr. Trump to halt his administration \u2019 s \u201c zero-tolerance \u201d policy of detaining adult immigrants at the southern border , which has split more than 2,000 children from their parents in less than two months .\nA decades-old court settlement bars the jailing of migrant children . Past administrations had opted to let families be released while their cases were pursued .\n\u201c We certainly want to support our president , but most of us have to support our district first , \u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows ( R. , N.C. ) , who is close to the president , as he headed into the meeting . \u201c It has not only got my attention but requires action , \u201d Mr. Meadows said about the issue , which he said has sparked more constituent mail than any in recent memory .\nThe meeting set the stage for House Republican leaders to begin lining up votes for a compromise bill that is seen as having the best chance of passing later this week . But the president \u2019 s performance did little to give momentum to bills that are tentatively set for votes on Thursday , because he didn \u2019 t line up behind one and sell it . As a whole , Republicans remain divided over how to treat young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children .\n\u201c His message to us was we \u2019 ve got to pass something , \u201d said Rep. Warren Davidson ( R. , Ohio ) . \u201c If he spends the week very publicly embracing the compromise bill\u2026I think that will generate a lot more support than this meeting just generated . \u201c\nRaj Shah , a spokesman for Mr. Trump , said both bills meet Mr. Trump \u2019 s requirements , because they \u201c build the wall , close legal loopholes , cancel the visa lottery , curb chain migration , and solve\u2026the family separation issue by allowing for family detention and removal . \u201d\nThe meeting at the Capitol had originally been envisioned as a chance for the president to rally Republicans around immigration legislation and for lawmakers to air their concerns on family separations .\nBut earlier Tuesday , Mr. Trump had defended his policy . In remarks at a National Federation of Independent Business meeting , Mr. Trump said he considered there to be only two options : \u201c totally open borders or criminal prosecution for lawbreaking. \u201d He said he wanted to see Congress \u201c give us a third option , \u201d describing it as the legal authority to detain and remove families \u201c together as a unit . \u201d\nAlso earlier on Tuesday , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R. , Ky. ) said that Republicans would quickly craft legislation that aims to address family separations . Sen. John Cornyn ( R. , Texas ) said he hopes to introduce a bill this week that would place detained families into a \u201c humane \u201d and \u201c safe \u201d facility together while they wait for their cases to be processed .\nThe administration \u2019 s new policy of detaining adults attempting to cross into the U.S. at the southern border , which has resulted in separating children from parents or other adults , has sparked explosive debate in recent days . As Democrats and some Republicans have called for an end to the policy , Mr. Trump and his administration officials have dug in and sought to blame Congress for not having passed a broader immigration overhaul that might have ameliorated the problem .\nCurrent policy prevents migrant children from being held with adults in criminal detention , and the Trump administration policy , by arresting more adults and charging them with border-crossing offenses , has meant more children are separated and moved to separate facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services .\nThe House is poised to consider the two broader GOP immigration measures this week that would address issues including border security , funding for the wall and a way to protect Dreamers , undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as young children . House Republicans , buffeted by a weekend of escalating criticism over the separation issue , plan to include a provision to measures to address the family separations .\nBut neither broad GOP immigration bill is seen as likely to pass amid intraparty divisions , and House Republican leaders haven \u2019 t said whether they would allow a vote on a standalone bill related to family separations if the two separate immigration bills fail to pass .\nMr. Trump said at the NFIB meeting that he planned to \u201c make changes \u201d to any package that House Republicans put before him . \u201c We have one chance to get it right , \u201d he said .\nMr. Trump also leveled another attack at Democrats Tuesday , alleging in a tweet that they \u201c don \u2019 t care about crime and want illegal immigrants , no matter how bad they may be , to pour into and infest our Country , \u201d saying they view such immigrants \u201c as potential voters ! \u201d\nDemocrats argue that because Mr. Trump started the family-separation policy , he should be the one to stop it , and not tie it to broader immigration legislation .\n\u201c Infest ?
