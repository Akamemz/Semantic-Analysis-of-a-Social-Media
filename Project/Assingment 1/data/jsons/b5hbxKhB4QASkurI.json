    "content": "Here \u2019 s a simple question : How many Americans don \u2019 t believe in God ?\nPew and Gallup \u2014 two of the most reputable polling firms in America \u2014 both come to a similar figure . About 10 percent of Americans say they do not believe in God , and this figure has been slowly creeping up over the decades .\nBut maybe this isn \u2019 t the whole story . University of Kentucky psychologists Will Gervais and Maxine Najle have long suspected that a lot of atheists aren \u2019 t showing up in these polls . The reason : Even in our increasingly secular society , there \u2019 s still a lot of stigma around not believing in God . So when a stranger conducting a poll calls and asks the question , it may be uncomfortable for many to answer truthfully .\nGervais and Najle recently conducted a new analysis on the prevalence of atheists in America . And they conclude the number of people who do not believe in God may be even double that counted by these polling firms .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of atheists in the closet , \u201d Gervais says . \u201c And ... if they knew there are lots of people just like them out there , that could potentially promote more tolerance . \u201d\nPeople are embarrassed to tell strangers they don \u2019 t believe in God\nCurrently , if you \u2019 re seeking data to answer the question , \u201c How many Americans do not believe in God ? \u201d you have two main sources .\nFirst is the Pew Research Center . Most recently , Pew found that around 3 percent of Americans say they are atheists . It also found that a larger group \u2014 around 9 percent \u2014 say they do not believe in God or a universal spirit . ( Which goes to show that you may not believe in God but could still be uncomfortable calling yourself an atheist \u2014 because that term implies a strong personal identity and an outright rejection of religious rituals . ) Gallup also regularly asks the question point blank \u2014 \u201c Do you believe in God ? \u201d The last time it asked , in 2016 , 10 percent of respondents said no .\nGervais \u2019 s experience studying the stigma around atheism the world over made him suspect these numbers are wrong .\nStudy after study has shown that most people ( even other atheists ) believe atheists are less moral . \u201c We \u2019 ll give participants a little vignette , a story about someone doing something immoral , and probe their intuition about who they think the perpetrator was , \u201d Gervais says . \u201c And time and time again , people intuitively assume whoever is out there doing immoral stuff doesn \u2019 t believe in God . \u201d\nSo it would make sense that when Pew or Gallup calls , people who don \u2019 t believe in God may be reluctant to say so . \u201c We shouldn \u2019 t expect people to give a stranger over the phone an honest answer to that question , \u201d Gervais says .\nSo recently , Gervais and Najle designed a test to find these \u201c closet atheists. \u201d Their results were recently published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science .\nSo if you can \u2019 t ask people outright whether they \u2019 re atheist and get an honest response , how do you go about finding them ?\nGervais and Najle set up a very subtle test . They sent a nationally representative poll to 2,000 Americans , who were randomly assigned to two conditions .\nThe first condition asked participants to read through a bunch of statements like , \u201c I am a vegetarian , \u201d \u201c I own a dog , \u201d and , \u201c I have a dishwasher in my kitchen . \u201d\nAll the participants had to do was simply write down the number of statements that were true for them .\nThe value of this method is that participants don \u2019 t have to directly say , \u201c I am a vegetarian , \u201d or , \u201c I \u2019 m a dog owner \u201d \u2014 they only have to acknowledge the number of statements that apply to them . That alone should zero out any embarrassment or hesitance to admit to a particular item .\nThat \u2019 s important because the other 1,000 or so participants saw the exact same list \u2014 but with one statement added : \u201c I believe in God . \u201d\nBy comparing the responses between the two groups , Gervais and Najle could then estimate how many people don \u2019 t believe in God . ( Because both groups of 1,000 poll takers should , in theory , have the same number of vegetarians , dog owners , and so on in each group , any increases in the number of agreed-to statements from the first group to the second should be reflective of the number of people who don \u2019 t believe in God . )\nOne thing is clear from the results : Much more than 10 or 11 percent of the country ( as assessed in Gallup and Pew polling ) does not believe in God . \u201c We can say with a 99 percent probability that it \u2019 s higher than [ 11 percent ] , \u201d said Gervais .\nHis best estimate : Around 26 percent of Americans don \u2019 t believe in God . \u201c According to our samples , about 1 in 3 atheists in our country do n't feel comfortable disclosing their lack of belief , \u201d Najle explains in an email .\nGervais admits this method isn \u2019 t perfect , and yields an answer with a wide margin of error . ( On the other end of the margin of error , around 35 percent of Americans don \u2019 t believe in God . ) But the most fundamental question he and Najle are asking here is do polling firms like Gallup and Pew undercount atheists ? And it seems the answer is yes .\nGervais and Najle also concurrently replicated the study with a second sample of 2,000 participants , and got similar results . ( In this second sample , they framed the atheism question in the negative \u2014 \u201c I do not believe in God \u201d \u2014 which yielded a slightly lower number of atheists . This could be because people are a bit more anxious to respond to such a definite phrase as , \u201c No , I do not believe in God . \u201d )\nCould this really be true ? A few grains of salt .\nI ran Gervais and Najle \u2019 s conclusion by Greg Smith , who directs Pew \u2019 s polling efforts on religion . He \u2019 s not yet ready to buy it .\n\u201c I would be very reluctant to conclude that phone surveys like ours are underestimating the share the public who are atheists to that kind of magnitude , \u201d he says .\nFor one , Smith says , Pew has asked questions on religion both on the phone and online and didn \u2019 t see much of a difference . You \u2019 d expect if people were unwilling to say that they \u2019 re atheists over the phone to a stranger , they \u2019 d be slightly more likely to input it into a computer . ( Though Pew \u2019 s online questioning still has participants directly answer the question , instead of asking people to merely list the numbers of items they agree with . Even online , people might be uneasy answering the question . )\nAlso , Smith points out a weird quirk in Gervais \u2019 s data .\nIn one of the trials , instead of adding the \u201c I don \u2019 t believe in God \u201d measure to the list , the survey added a nonsense phrase : \u201c I do not believe that 2 + 2 is less than 13. \u201d And 34 percent of their participants agreed . Bizarre indeed . The researchers \u2019 explanation ? \u201c It may reflect any combination of genuine innumeracy [ lack of math skills ] , incomprehension of an oddly phrased item , participant inattentiveness or jesting , sampling error , or a genuine flaw in the ... technique , \u201d Gervais and Najle write in the paper .\nBut they still think their measure is valid . When they limited the sample to people who were self-professed atheists ( as measured in a separate question ) , 100 percent said they didn \u2019 t believe in God , which is correct . \u201c It is unlikely that a genuinely invalid method would track self-reported atheism this precisely , \u201d they write .\nStill , more research is needed . \u201c In time , we 'll hopefully be able to refine our methods and find other indirect measurement techniques , \u201d Gervais says . ( Overall , kudos to Gervais and Najle for being forthright about their curious finding . In the past , psychologists have had incentives to avoid printing this type of contradictory finding in their papers . )\nFor a lot of us , belief in God is not a binary\nThere \u2019 s something else to consider here : Our experience with religion can \u2019 t really be boiled down to one question \u2014 \u201c Do you believe in God ? \u201d\nMany of us have a complicated relationship with religion . There are plenty of people celebrating Easter and Passover this week not because they have devout faith , but because it \u2019 s a cultural tradition they cherish and identify with .\nPew regularly finds data that supports this multifaceted view . When people in their surveys say , \u201c I believe in God , \u201d Pew will often ask a follow-up question : \u201c How certain are you ? \u201d And they find that not everyone is so sure .\nAbout a quarter of the US population say they believe in God but are less than absolutely certain of it , Smith says .\nThe lesson : Belief in God doesn \u2019 t exist as a binary . Not everyone is certain about what they feel ; many people have shades of gray . \u201c There are gradations of belief , \u201d Smith says . \u201c It \u2019 s not that it \u2019 s wrong to ask \u2018 yes or no , \u2019 but it \u2019 s not the whole story . \u201d\nAnd Gervais admits : This measure doesn \u2019 t capture the complex and contradictory feelings many people have about religion . ( And Najle adds that these data \u201c are limited to the U.S. and should not be generalized beyond that . \u201d )\nBut in the data , they also find some small evidence that the stigma around atheism is changing .
