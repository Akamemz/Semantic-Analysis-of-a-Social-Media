ET ] Over and over , as Republican voters spoke of the presidential race \u2013 and of Donald Trump in particular \u2013 one word kept coming up : \u201c strong . \u201d\nThe nation needs a strong leader , said the 12 voters , gathered Tuesday night in St. Louis for a focus group . That \u2019 s hardly a surprising conclusion , especially following the deadly terror attacks by the Islamic State in Brussels earlier in the day . And Mr. Trump , the GOP presidential front-runner , projects strength , they said .\nAfter Tuesday \u2019 s nominating contests , in which Trump gained more delegates than his top rival , Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , the billionaire is one step closer to accomplishing an extraordinary feat : winning the Republican presidential nomination as a political novice , while bucking party orthodoxy on a range of issues , from trade to entitlements to the US \u2019 s role in the world to Planned Parenthood .\nSome in the group expressed reservations about Trump . He needs a \u201c filter , \u201d two of the women said . He needs to \u201c turn the noise down just a tad , \u201d said another . \u201c Be a bit more humble , \u201d said one of the men . Two of the 12 voters in the focus group \u2013 organized by veteran pollster Peter Hart , with reporters watching via live stream \u2013 said they would vote for Trump in November only as \u201c a last resort . \u201d\n\u201c Because he \u2019 s direct and outspoken , and uses language that they understand and relate to , \u201d Mr. Hart told the Monitor Wednesday . \u201c I don \u2019 t want to say the swear words , but the way in which he approaches it , it \u2019 s not political speak . It \u2019 s straight talk , and he gets credit for it . \u201d\nHart describes Trump \u2019 s style as \u201c authoritarian. \u201d In fact , recent academic research shows that Trump supporters are united by one common trait \u2013 not income , education level , or race , but an inclination toward authoritarian leadership . That finding could have profound implications for the Democrats come November , if Trump is the Republican nominee .\n\u201c Because of the prevalence of authoritarians in the American electorate , among Democrats as well as Republicans , it \u2019 s very possible that Trump \u2019 s fan base will continue to grow , \u201d wrote Matthew MacWilliams , the author of the study and a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts , Amherst , in Politico last December .\nPlacing Trump in the American historical context is tricky . In many ways , the real estate mogul/reality TV star/Twitter maven has no historical precedent . But in his ability to project strength , at least , Hart sees a hint of Ronald Reagan .\n\u201c If you were looking for the one link between President Reagan and Trump , it is the clear , straightforward , declarative language , \u201d says Hart . \u201c The difference is , Reagan was always the smiling face , with an upbeat , sunny message of \u2018 morning in America , \u2019 and Trump is obviously stern and tough . And while he says he will \u2018 make America great again , \u2019 essentially his language is much more negative and harsher . \u201d\nAfter Tuesday \u2019 s nominating contests , in which Trump gained more delegates than his top rival , Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , the billionaire is one step closer to accomplishing an extraordinary feat : winning the Republican presidential nomination as a political novice , while bucking party orthodoxy on a range of issues , from trade to entitlements to the US \u2019 s role in the world to Planned Parenthood .\nBut ultimately , if Trump wins the Republican nomination , only one said they would never vote for him . That result flies in the face of polls that show major reservations about Trump by Republican voters . One recent survey shows more than a third of Republican voters in the \u201c never Trump \u201d camp .\nOn Tuesday , Trump and Senator Cruz performed as expected : Trump won the Arizona primary , and all 58 delegates at stake , with 47 percent of the vote . Senator Cruz won the Utah caucuses , and all 40 of the state \u2019 s delegates , with 69 percent of the vote . A contested GOP convention in July remains a possibility , but Trump still has potential to lock up the nomination before then .\nIn Arizona , about half of the voting took place before Tuesday , and the attacks in Brussels . Among those who voted on primary day , it \u2019 s not clear how the terror attack might have affected voters \u2019 choices .\nBut Brussels certainly weighed heavily on the focus group voters in St. Louis . When asked for the \u201c one thing \u201d they \u2019 re looking for in the next president , voters named a range of qualities , including ability to get things done , high moral character , and toughness .\n\u201c You \u2019 ve got to be strong , \u201d said Trump supporter Kevin Rotellio , a restaurant manager in his 40s . \u201c We can \u2019 t be weak , or we might be the next terror attack . \u201d\nAt another point , when the discussion turned to leadership style , one participant brought up a world leader whom Trump has said he admires .\n\u201c This business about Trump \u2019 s being outspoken and harsh and all that \u2013 isn \u2019 t Putin the same way ? And he seems to be doing OK , so I don \u2019 t know that that \u2019 s bad , \u201d said Joseph Glass , a retired engineer who voted for Ohio Gov . John Kasich in the Missouri primary .\nThe biggest reservations over Trump were voiced by women \u2013 a reflection of polling that shows women are more concerned than men by Trump \u2019 s manner , and an overall gender gap . When the group was asked by Mr. Hart if Trump would be different as president than he has been as a candidate , some expressed hope that that would be the case .\n\u201c If he surrounds himself with reasonable people , he will be different , \u201d said Joyce Reinitz , a teacher who lists her party affiliation as \u201c not strong Republican. \u201d \u201c He \u2019 ll still be opinionated . But he will have perhaps some of the social filters built in as personalities that will try to calm him down . \u201d\nAnother woman , homemaker Gabrielle Ritter , also hoped for the calming influence of advisers , if Trump is elected . Ms. Ritter , an independent who voted for Cruz in the primary and came into the focus group with a \u201c very unfavorable \u201d view of Trump , wished \u201c he could just come across more reasonable . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m concerned about him discussing deals with Putin or Iraq or the Middle East or Mexico , \u201d she said . \u201c I \u2019 m concerned , because of how he is portrayed in the media right now , how he is going to handle those situations , so that we don \u2019 t end up in a worse international situation .
