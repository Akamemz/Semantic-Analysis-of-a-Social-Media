Brennan ( @ JohnBrennan ) August 15 , 2018\nIn a subsequent phone interview on MSNBC , Brennan added that if the president believed that the action would lead the former CIA director \u201c to just go away and be quiet , he is very badly mistaken. \u201c\n\u201c I \u2018 ve seen this type of behavior and actions on the part of foreign tyrants and despots and autocrats during my CIA and national security career , \u201d he said . \u201c I never thought I would see it here in the United States . And so I do believe that all Americans really need to take stock of what is happening right now in our government , and how abnormal and how irresponsible and how dangerous these actions are. \u201c\nBrennan also said he was not informed by the government that his security clearance was revoked , but instead learned it from a friend who called when Sanders was delivering the president \u2019 s statement .\nThe White House last month announced that it was looking into revoking security clearances for the individuals Sanders listed , with the exception of Yates , Strzok , Page and Ohr , whose names were added on Wednesday .\nTrump has over the past couple of days dug into Strzok , who was fired from the FBI on Friday , and Ohr .\nOhr , a senior Justice Department official , has come under scrutiny after it was revealed he had contact during the 2016 election cycle with Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson and former British spy Christopher Steele , who compiled a dossier that described a complex conspiracy of Trump and his campaign working with the Kremlin to influence the outcome of the presidential election . Trump has denied the dossier \u2018 s findings . Ohr 's wife , Nellie , also worked for Fusion GPS during the 2016 election .\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on Ohr 's security clearance .\n\u201c Security clearances for those who still have them may be revoked , and those who have already lost their security clearance may not be able to have it reinstated , \u201d Sanders said .\nClapper on Wednesday said during an interview with CNN that he had not had any access to current intelligence since he resigned in January 2017 .\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what 's driving the afternoon in Washington .

And , she said , former officials with clearances should maintain certain standards to keep those clearances .\nConservatives have over the past couple of weeks pushed for Brennan \u2019 s security to be removed .\nSen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) in June said he spoke to the president about that very issue , and Fox News host Tucker Carlson also called for Brennan \u2019 s clearance to be removed after he reported he still had it .\nOn Wednesday , the Senate majority whip , John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) , who is on the Intelligence Committee , said it was \u201c entirely appropriate \u201d for Trump to take action against Brennan .\nBut Sen. Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) , the retiring chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , said : \u201c Without having some kind of tangible reasons for doing so , which there may be that I \u2019 m not aware of , I don \u2019 t like it at all . It just feels like sort of a \u2026 banana republic kind of thing , \u201d\nBrennan , in the MSNBC interview on Wednesday , said he believed that Trump was concerned about the criticism Brennan has been voicing publicly and was trying to diminish his integrity .\n\u201c I must tell you that Mr. Trump \u2018 s dishonesty , his lack of integrity , his nastiness , mean-spiritedness , the types of things that he has just tweeted out the past 72 hours , the terms that he uses , this is not what I think of an American president , nor of America , \u201c Brennan said . \u201c We 're better than this . We have to be better than this . We have been a shining example to the world , and Mr. Trump is letting this country down. \u201c\nIn addition , Brennan criticized Trump \u2018 s attacks on Mueller and his investigation . He added that although he did not know any details from the inquiry , he believed that the president \u2019 s recent attacks were a result of the \u201c closer magnification of some of the things that those around him have been involved in \u201c through the probe .\n\u201c I know some things that the Russians were involved in , but I certainly don \u2018 t know all the things that Mr. Trump has been involved in over the years , \u201c he said . \u201c I do not pretend to have that knowledge .
