    "content": "( CNN ) Former Vice President Joe Biden , who 's the current front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary , made several gun-related claims recently during an argument with an auto worker and during a tele-townhall this week . We took a look at some of those claims to see what the facts were .\nDuring a campaign stop at a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant on March 10 , Biden was accused by one of the workers of wanting to take away people 's guns .\n`` You are actively trying to end our Second Amendment right and take away our guns , '' one man accused Biden .\n`` You 're full of sh * * , '' Biden snapped back . `` I did not\u2014no , no , shush . Shush . I support the Second Amendment . ''\nLater , the man again accused Biden of saying he would take away guns in the US . `` You were with Beto when he said he was going to take our guns . ''\nTo which , Biden replied , `` I did not say that . That 's not true . I did not say that . ''\nFacts First : Biden 's gun control plan does not include confiscating legally owned weapons and an interpretation of a `` viral video '' is a mishearing of what was said . The former vice president has said in the past that a Biden administration would come for people 's `` assault weapons . ''\nBiden 's gun control plan outlines a buyback program for `` assault weapons and high-capacity magazines , '' but the program is not a mandatory buyback and would not force people to give their up their guns .\nAccording to Biden 's website , the buyback program `` will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options : sell the weapons to the government , or register them under the National Firearms Act . ''\nBut in August 2019 , during an interview with CNN 's Anderson Cooper , Biden was asked about people who think a Biden administration `` means they 're going to come for my guns . '' Biden replied , `` Bingo , you 're right if you have an assault weapon . The fact of the matter is they should be illegal . Period . ''\nWhen asked about this exchange , a Biden official told CNN , `` Joe Biden defeated the NRA to ban assault weapons before , and he was reminding viewers that as president he will do it again . ''\nThe auto worker 's reference to a video of Biden and former Congressman Beto O'Rourke likely refers to one of Biden talking with O'Rourke and his wife in a restaurant in Texas .\nWhen talking about how O'Rourke has championed certain progressive issues , Biden said `` this guy ( O'Rourke ) can change the face of what we 're dealing with . With regard to guns -- assault weapons -- with regard to dealing with climate change . ''\n`` And I just want to warn Amy ( O'Rourke 's wife ) , if I win , I 'm coming for him , '' Biden said , referring and pointing to O'Rourke , who has supported confiscating assault rifles from US citizens Some have mistakenly said that Biden was claiming he would come for US citizen 's guns , not O'Rourke , but Biden is talking about coming for `` him '' ( O'Rourke ) not `` 'em '' ( i.e . guns ) .\nDuring the tele-town hall Monday , Biden was asked a question on guns and the Second Amendment and in his response , Biden talked about what are often called `` smart guns '' some of which require a fingerprint to fire .\nBiden claimed that in response to smart gun tech `` the NRA and the gun manufactures came along and said 'if you keep selling them , we 're going to put you out of business . ' ''\nFacts First : The National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation , a trade association for firearm manufacturers , told CNN they do not oppose smart guns but do oppose mandates of the technology .\nAmy Hunter , director of media relations for the NRA , told CNN in a statement that `` Biden is wrong '' and that the NRA simply opposes government mandates for smart guns .\n`` He should check his facts before opening his mouth , '' Hunter said . `` The NRA does not oppose smart gun technology . The NRA is opposed to government mandates that require consumers to only buy smart guns . That 's why we oppose any law that mandates when smart gun technology became available , all traditional firearms would become illegal . ''\nOne aspect of Biden 's gun safety plan is to `` put America on the path to ensuring that 100 % of firearms sold in America are smart guns '' and says `` Biden believes we should work to eventually require that 100 % of firearms sold in the US are smart guns . ''\nMark Oliva , director of public affairs at NSSF , told CNN regarding Biden 's statement about smart gun tech that `` the bottom line is this is categorically false . The industry has never made such a statement . ''\n`` We represent the gun manufacturers , '' Oliva said , `` we have never opposed the technology , we have only opposed the mandate with the technology . '' Oliva also said the technology was not ready and that `` no police departments have adopted this technology because it just does n't work .\nOne issue facing `` smart guns '' is the New Jersey Childproof Handgun law which was passed in 2002 . That New Jersey law mandates that once what the law calls `` personalized '' ( i.e . smart ) guns are available in the US , all handguns sold in New Jersey must be such `` personalized '' guns .\nBiofire , one of the companies working on smart gun technology , says on its website that `` the New Jersey mandate is a major roadblock to smart guns , and has been since it was passed 20 years ago . ''\nBiden , arguing that the Second Amendment does not give everyone the right to own any firearm or weapon they want , said during the town hall that `` you 're not allowed to own , for example , a machine gun in the United States of America . ''\nFacts First : Older machine guns , or fully automatics , can be purchased in the US , but there are many regulations which make it difficult to do so .\nPrivate citizens who want to purchase a fully automatic weapon must buy it from someone with a Federal Firearms License -- which is necessary , among other things , to manufacture ammo and firearms and sell them as a major source of income . The gun must have been made and registered with the US government prior to May 19 , 1986 .\nTo transfer/purchase one of these machine guns there is transfer tax of $ 200 and the FFL holder must submit a form to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives which includes information about the gun as well as the transferee 's personal information , photo , fingerprints , and answers to questions to determine if the purchaser can legally possess the firearm .\nThe ATF will then review the form to determine if the transfer is legal and `` will not approve the form if the transfer , receipt , or possession of the firearm would place the transferee in violation of any Federal , State , or local law . '' Only when the ATF approves the transfer \u2014 checking state and local laws that govern fully automatic weapons \u2014 can the gun be purchased .",
