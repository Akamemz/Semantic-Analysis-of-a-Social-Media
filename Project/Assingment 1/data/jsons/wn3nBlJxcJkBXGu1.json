What is this issue that could destroy our country ? It is , simply , the death of civil discourse . U.S . Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has been the most recent leader to address this societal problem .\nSince her appointment , Ambassador Haley has become a conservative \u201c rock star \u201d for her stunning speeches on the UN floor . At an event at The Heritage Foundation this month , the Ambassador called the UN Human Rights Council , a council which currently includes egregious human rights violators Iran and the Congo , a \u201c cesspool of political bias. \u201d She has defended Israel\u2014America \u2019 s main ally in the Middle East\u2014countless times against its detractors in the UN .\nNow Ambassador Haley is advising conservatives on their approach to debating and discussing ideas with those who may disagree . In a recent speech to a group of conservative high schoolers at the Turning Point USA conference at George Washington University , she commented on a recent trend by young people on social media : \u201c Raise your hand if you \u2019 ve ever posted anything online to quote-unquote \u2018 own the libs. \u2019 \u201d For those not up-to-date with modern slang , in this context , to \u201c own \u201d someone is to render them unable to reasonably reply to a sarcastic statement or zinger .\nQuite a few students raised their hands and a few cheered . The ambassador then explained her view of the tactic : \u201c I know that it \u2019 s fun and that it can feel good , but step back and think about what you \u2019 re accomplishing when you do this\u2014are you persuading anyone ? Who are you persuading ? We \u2019 ve all been guilty of it at some point or another , but this kind of speech isn \u2019 t leadership\u2014it \u2019 s the exact opposite. \u201d Instead , Ambassador Haley offered her own definition of leadership : \u201c Real leadership is about persuasion , it \u2019 s about movement , it \u2019 s bringing people around to your point of view . Not by shouting them down , but by showing them how it is in their best interest to see things the way you do . \u201d\nAmbassador Haley \u2019 s words line up perfectly with what Scripture says ( which is not surprising , as she is a Christian ) . In the book of Proverbs , Solomon advises his son that \u201c A gentle answer turns away wrath. \u201d He then warns that the opposite , \u201c harsh words , \u201d only \u201c stir up anger \u201d ( Proverbs 15:1 ) . Peter writes to his readers that they should \u201c always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have \u201d and to \u201c do this with gentleness and respect \u201d ( 1 Peter 3:15 ) .\nThe fundamental issue here is how we conduct discourse . Disagreements should never become merely a platform for \u201c zingers \u201d in and of themselves . When one or both sides resort to name calling and/or mocking their opponent rather than using reason to persuade , nothing of any value is accomplished . For example , suppose a conservative ( or liberal ) posts a political statement on Facebook or another social media platform , and a commenter on the other side of the aisle replies nastily to the post . The original poster has three options : not replying , replying with the same amount of ire , or replying with the purpose of persuasion . If the poster replies with \u201c gentleness and respect , \u201d there is a good chance that their original argument will get a fair hearing . Obviously , civil discourse needs two participants , and the commenter may not comply , but Scripture demands that we at least try to respectfully persuade our opponents .\nIf our culture really is coming apart at the seams , as some commentators are bemoaning , then conservatives adding to the cacophony of empty rhetoric will certainly not aid in tamping down the culture war vitriol . If conservatives are correct , than we should be comfortable voicing our opinions reasonably .
