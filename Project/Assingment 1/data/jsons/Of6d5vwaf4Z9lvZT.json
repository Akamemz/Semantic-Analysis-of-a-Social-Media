So it \u2019 s becoming an adventure . \u201d\nThe drive-in , a medium that has waned since its heyday decades ago , is suddenly at the forefront of pop culture again . It \u2019 s an attractive option for watching movies while practicing pandemic-related social distancing , with demand high from coast to coast . But innovators are also looking toward the drive-in model as a way to experience live events now that people can no longer stand elbow to elbow . At least temporarily , audiences may end up in front of vast screens for not just films , but also concerts , sports , and even theater . For many people , cars congregating for a collective experience under the stars offers a nostalgic allure .\n\u201c A drive-in is very democratic , \u201d says Joe Bob Briggs , host of \u201c The Last Drive-In \u201d on AMC \u2019 s Shudder streaming service . \u201c The drive-in is usually on the edge of the city . And the people who live in the city drive out to the country to be at the drive-in . And people in the country drive in towards the city to be at the drive-in . ... It \u2019 s a festive , communal place. \u201d \u2018\nSocial distancing is a boon for the outdoor screens that remain in the United States . Some 305 locations were still in operation in 2019 , according to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association . Until Hollywood offers new releases again , drive-ins can still attract moviegoers with retro fare such as \u201c Jaws \u201d and \u201c Back to the Future. \u201d Owners are also considering other entertainment . In Lockport , New York , the Transit Drive-in Theatre is lobbying to show live prime-time NFL games featuring the nearby Buffalo Bills . Promoters are also besieging drive-ins with offers to stream live entertainment events . There \u2019 s a precedent : In 2014 , Jimmy Buffett played a show beamed exclusively to drive-ins across the U.S .\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff Dave Andelman , co-owner of the Mendon Twin Drive-In , shows the upgrades that he has made May 7 , 2020 , in Mendon , Massachusetts . His face mask , with a cartoon hotdog , is one of many that were custom-made for his employees , who swing back into action on Memorial Day .\n\u201c Free markets fill vacuums very quickly , \u201d says Dave Andelman , co-owner of the Mendon Twin Drive-In in Mendon , Massachusetts , which plans to open on Memorial Day . He envisions the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship having ideas . \u201c Dana White from the UFC will say , \u2018 OK , we \u2019 ll put it on the biggest card we ever put out. \u2019 ... There \u2019 ll be boxing , there \u2019 ll be concerts , there \u2019 ll be comedy . \u201d\nWhen drive-in theaters aren \u2019 t readily available , entrepreneurs are building their own pop-up versions . In the German towns of Sch\u00fcttorf and D\u00fcsseldorf , night clubs this month assembled stages and screens in their parking lots for raves in which the clubbers waved glow sticks out of car windows and flashed headlights in time with the beat . On June 1 , the Danish soccer club FC Midtjylland is planning to use two large screens in its 2000-space parking lot so that fans can watch games being played inside the empty stadium . Similarly , a dinner theater company in Boulder , Colorado , is examining the economic viability of projecting a musical production from its stage to a phalanx of cars outside .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got these big vast walls on both sides of the theater and we could hook them up with an FM receiver from a soundboard inside the theater , \u201d explains Michael Duran , producing artistic director of BDT Stage . \u201c We \u2019 re theater people , we \u2019 re creative people . We should be able to figure out a way to bring theater to the people and still be able to stay safe . \u201d\nAnother idea is to turn drive-ins into actual concert venues . Already bands in Mesa , Arizona , and Fort Collins , Colorado , are planning such events . And Houston \u2019 s Showboat Drive-In is gearing up for a DJ event in which masked dancers must stay within the width of their car \u2013 the strictest social distancing since high school proms in the 1950s .\n\u201c I had one promoter talking to me about essentially leaving a big stage setup here , basically all year , \u201d says Mr. Andelman during a tour of his 16-acre drive-in highlighting the social distancing procedures it has instituted .
