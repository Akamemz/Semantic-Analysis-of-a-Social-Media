Rumors circulate almost daily that the decision is ready for release . As usual , those rumors are perpetrated by people who know nothing , but the decision is expected by the end of this month .\nThe near hysteria is partially about politics : Congressional Republicans hate the bill , and some see President Obama 's chance at a second term hinged to the fate of the law . But constitutional scholars know there is much more at stake here than an individual election . Just how much is illustrated by the legal history of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution .\nIt gives Congress the power to `` regulate commerce ... among the several States , '' and it authorizes Congress to `` make all laws which shall be necessary and proper '' for achieving that goal .

But the words of the Commerce Clause are pretty general , and it is the Supreme Court that for more than 200 years has interpreted what they mean .\nThe court 's first major Commerce Clause decision came in the 1824 . The great Chief Justice John Marshall , who was himself one of the Founding Fathers , wrote in Gibbons v. Ogden that the Commerce Clause gives Congress broad power to regulate commerce and that this power is mainly limited by the power of the people to deny their representatives re-election if they do n't like what Congress does .\nThe decision infuriated the likes of Thomas Jefferson , who viewed federal power as far more limited under the Constitution , but the ruling stood as the guiding light on commerce questions for about 70 years .\nThe next landmark case came in 1895 , during the rise of great national corporations and concentrations of wealth . When the U.S. government , using the antitrust law , sought to block the leading sugar refining company from acquiring 98 percent control of the industry , the company fought back and won . In U.S. v. E.C . Knight Co. , the Supreme Court ruled that since sugar refining took place before shipments of the product crossed state lines , Congress was powerless to regulate the industry .\nFederal appeals court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson , author of a new book on constitutional theory , notes that this was a period of profound change in America . The country was being transformed by massive industrialization , coupled with changes in communication and transportation .\nThe question facing the court , Wilkinson explains , was whether the Congress could deal with these changes . Could it regulate them ? `` And the court gave a preliminary answer : No . ''\nOver the next 40 years , the court used a variety of standards to determine which regulations were permissible and which were not . Did the activity have an indirect or direct effect on commerce ? A substantial or insubstantial effect ? Was it more like manufacturing or more like trading ? The standards were vague and the court 's decisions inconsistent , unpredictable and subjective .\nAt the same time , the court , citing the fundamental right to make private contracts , was striking down state legislation aimed at regulating wages , hours and working conditions . It was a one-two punch .\nThe court 's hostility to regulation became even more aggressive at the height of the Great Depression , when Congress , at the behest of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , enacted New Deal legislation to set rules for everything from banks to agriculture , all of which were on the brink of disaster .\nRepeatedly , the court struck down legislation enacted by huge congressional majorities . `` The conservative majority started with the proposition that laissez-faire economics was good and that any intrusion by the state or the federal government was necessarily suspect , '' says New York Law School professor James Simon , author of a book about the court and the New Deal .\n`` The conservative courts of that era really put their collective thumb on the scale on behalf of property at the expense '' of the rights of workers , says Jeff Shesol , author of another book about that era .\nThe ultimate setback for the New Deal came in 1936 , when the conservative court , by a 5-4 vote , struck down a new federal law designed to regulate wages , hours and working conditions in the coal mining industry .

When the U.S. government, using the antitrust law, sought to block the leading sugar refining company from acquiring 98 percent control of the industry, the company fought back and won. In U.S. v.

Could it regulate them? \"And the court gave a preliminary answer: No.\"\n\nHostility To Regulation\n\nOver the next 40 years, the court used a variety of standards to determine which regulations were permissible and which were not. Did the activity have an indirect or direct effect on commerce? A substantial or insubstantial effect? Was it more like manufacturing or more like trading? The standards were vague and the court's decisions inconsistent, unpredictable and subjective.\n\nAt the same time, the court, citing the fundamental right to make private contracts, was striking down state legislation aimed at regulating wages, hours and working conditions. It was a one-two punch.\n\nThe court's hostility to regulation became even more aggressive at the height of the Great Depression, when Congress, at the behest of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, enacted New Deal legislation to set rules for everything from banks to agriculture, all of which were on the brink of disaster.\n\nRepeatedly, the court struck down legislation enacted by huge congressional majorities. \"The conservative majority started with the proposition that laissez-faire economics was good and that any intrusion by the state or the federal government was necessarily suspect,\" says New York Law School professor James Simon, author of a book about the court and the New Deal.\n\n\"The conservative courts of that era really put their collective thumb on the scale on behalf of property at the expense\" of the rights of workers, says Jeff Shesol, author of another book about that era.\n\nRoosevelt, Court-Packing And Change\n\nThe ultimate setback for the New Deal came in 1936, when the conservative court, by a 5-4 vote, struck down a new federal law designed to regulate wages, hours and working conditions in the coal mining industry. In Carter v. Carter Coal Co., the court said that coal production, like sugar refining, did not constitute commerce among the states and thus could not be regulated by the federal government.\n\nThat decision turned out to be Roosevelt's last major defeat at the court. Months later, after winning a landslide re-election, he announced what came to be known as his court-packing plan: He proposed to add six new justices to the court.\n\nThe announcement may have provoked the court into rethinking the confrontational path it had undertaken.

Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. ushered in the modern Commerce Clause doctrine. After that, the court deferred to Congress on economic regulations almost entirely.\n\nThe Modern Doctrine\n\nThe high point of the new era was a 1942 case called Wickard v. Filburn, a challenge to the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The law was aimed at stabilizing agriculture prices, which were in free fall. It paid farmers not to grow certain crops on some of their land. A farmer named Roscoe Filburn went to court, claiming that Congress had exceeded its power when it tried to bar him from growing crops on his own land for his own use.

Even an entirely local activity like Filburn's, the court held, may fall under Congress' reach \"if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.\"\n\nFilburn's case sealed the deal. No piece of economic regulatory legislation was struck down for the next half-century.\n\nIn 1995, that streak came to an end when the Supreme Court rejected a federal law that banned the possession of guns within 1,000 feet of a school.

A second case of this sort followed five years later, but in hindsight, neither did much to change the overall deference given to Congress on regulating the economy.\n\nEnter The Health Care Law\n\nNow comes the Obama health care overhaul, known as the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, a law under full assault by the modern conservative movement. Some, like Georgetown Law Center professor Randy Barnett, the architect of the challenge, say openly that they believe many of the New Deal cases were wrongly decided.\n\n\"They are well-settled precedents and are not likely to be revisited in my lifetime,\" Barnett says. \"But I do think that according to the original meaning of the Constitution, they were wrongly decided.\"\n\nBarnett is similarly skeptical of some conservatives' insistence that judges defer to popularly elected legislatures. \"I don't think the court should simply defer to what Congress wants, especially when the issue is the scope of Congress' own power,\" Barnett says.\n\nBarnett argues that the health care law can be struck down without undoing 75 years of judicial precedent. \"Nothing about existing Supreme Court doctrine needs to change for us to prevail in this case,\" he insists.\n\nBut his critics, including George Washington University law professor Jeff Rosen, contend that Barnett's claim is disingenuous, and that the real goal here is to achieve what has not been achievable even by conservative Republican presidents and Congresses: rolling back major economic regulation.\n\n\"Let's not pretend that this is just a modest case of applying existing precedents,\" Rosen says. \"The question is: Are you going to reverse decades of judicial deference in economic matters?\"\n\nAnother Turning Point?\n\nOther scholars agree that the ACA presents a watershed, a potential breaking point with the legal framework that has undergirded our modern economy. \"The expansive understanding of the Commerce Clause has been the basis of minimum-wage legislation, of workplace safety legislation, of economic protections, and in fact of our civil rights laws,\" notes Shesol. \"The conservative legal establishment has been very open about its interest in undoing the New Deal at the constitutional level,\" and \"this would be the first great success of the movement.\"\n\nNonetheless, Shesol cautions that comparisons to the 1930s can be overblown.
