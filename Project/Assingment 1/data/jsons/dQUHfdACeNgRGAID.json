    "content": "President-elect Donald Trump 's proposals would modestly cut income taxes for most middle-class Americans . But for nearly 8 million families -- including a majority of single-parent households -- the opposite would occur : They 'd pay more .\nMost married couples with three or more children would also pay higher taxes , an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found . And while middle-class families as a whole would receive tax cuts of about 2 percent , they 'd be dwarfed by the windfalls averaging 13.5 percent for America 's richest 1 percent .\nTrump 's campaign rhetoric had promoted the benefits of his proposals for middle-income Americans .\n`` The largest tax reductions are for the middle class , '' said Trump 's `` Contract With the American Voter , '' released last month .\nThe tax hikes that would hit single parents and large families would result from Trump 's plan to eliminate the personal exemption and the head-of-household filing status . These features of the tax code have enabled many Americans to reduce their taxable income .\nHis other proposed tax changes would benefit middle- and lower-income Americans . But they would n't be enough to offset those modifications .\n`` If you 're a low- or moderate-income single parent , you 're going to get hurt , '' said Bob Williams , a fellow at the Tax Policy Center .\nUnlike Trump 's polarizing proposals on immigration and trade , his tax plan is in line with traditional Republican policy . His steep tax cuts in many ways resemble those carried out by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush , and the Republican-run Congress is expected to welcome them .\nDuring the campaign , Trump said his tax cuts -- for individuals and companies -- would energize the economy by boosting business investment in factories and equipment , while leaving consumers with more cash to spend . His proposals , he contended , would help create 25 million jobs over the next decade .\nBut Lily Batchelder , a visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center and former deputy director of President Barack Obama 's National Economic Council , estimates that roughly 7.9 million families with children would pay higher taxes under his proposals . About 5.8 million are led by single parents .\nOther analysts , including economists at the conservative Tax Foundation and right-of-center American Enterprise Institute , have agreed with Batchelder 's conclusions .\nRight now , a single parent with $ 75,000 in income and two children can claim a head of household deduction of $ 9,300 , plus three personal exemptions .
