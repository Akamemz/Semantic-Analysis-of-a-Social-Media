It 's hard for the VA to hire doctors when it pays so much less than the `` private '' sector , where doctors ' main source of income is , well , other government programs that pay more . Perhaps government should overpay VA clinicians as much as it overpays non-VA clinicians .\nIt 's impossible , absent a price mechanism , to know whether V.A . salaries ( prices ) and overall spending are too low , but there is \u2588\u2588\u2588 to think they might be .

Indeed , such reforms could make Congress and the president less likely to engage in unnecessary wars , thereby reducing the risk that active-duty personnel would need veterans benefits in the first place .\nInstead of making an implicit , unfunded promise of veterans benefits , Congress should immediately increase military pay enough to allow active-duty personnel to purchase a standard package of life , health , and disability benefits from private insurance companies at actuarially fair rates . Private veterans-benefits insurance would begin paying claims the moment military personnel leave active duty . Since active-duty personnel could choose their veterans-benefits insurers , those who treat veterans the way Congress has would soon find themselves put out of business by those who keep their promises .
