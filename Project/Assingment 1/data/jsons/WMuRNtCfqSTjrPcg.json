    "content": "In a previous column , I lamented how the poverty rate in the United States has remained range-bound between 11 and 15 percent ever since the War on Poverty was launched in the 1960s .\nOn Aug. 21 , economist and former U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm and John F. Early , former assistant commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics , wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal titled \u201c Americans Are Richer Than We Think \u201d ( an article I highly recommend ) . Among the authors \u2019 assertions is that the incidence of poverty in the United States is a minuscule 2 percent , not the 12.3 percent that is the current official poverty rate .\nWhat can possibly explain such a startling and enormous difference between a supposed poverty rate of 2 percent and an official poverty rate of 12.3 ? The answer is twofold , both having to do with how we measure wealth and poverty .\nIn the first place , this is an apples and oranges comparison . The official poverty rate strangely and confusingly includes some government assistance , but excludes the lion \u2019 s share , leaving about $ 1 trillion of assistance uncounted . The Gramm/Early computation includes all the gov \u2019 t benefits . Thus , Americans who are categorized as poor in terms of income have an actual standard of living that is not poor when one counts the government assistance they receive .\nIndeed , poverty in the sense of acute deprivation is largely nonexistent in the United States in the 21st century . As reported by The Heritage Foundation , \u201c The typical poor household , as defined by the government , has a car and air conditioning , two color televisions , cable or satellite TV , a DVD player \u201d and \u201c the typical average poor American has more living space in his home than the average ( non-poor ) European has . \u201d\nThe second reason for the gaping disparity between the official poverty rate and the Gramm/Early poverty rate is due to major differences in how key macroeconomic data are measured . GDP , consumer price , and real wage indexes , inflation , productivity , and poverty rates all are inherently difficult to measure accurately . According to Gramm and Early , methodological flaws have resulted in all of these economic indicators making us appear less prosperous than we really are .\nOne seemingly insuperable obstacle in macroeconomic statistics is how to quantify improvements in quality .

Whether that figure hit the bullseye , I can \u2019 t say , but the 6 percent figure has long seemed unrealistic based on everyday observations of material standards of living .\nAmerican Enterprise Institute economist Mark J. Perry has convincingly shown that wage stagnation is a myth .
