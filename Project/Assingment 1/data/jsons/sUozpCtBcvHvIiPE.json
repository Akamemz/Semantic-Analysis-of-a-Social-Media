    "content": "\u201c We all want the same thing , \u201d President Donald Trump said Friday to members of Congress and other dignitaries . \u201c We 're all good people , whether you 're a Republican or Democrat , it does n't make any difference . We 're going to get along . \u201d\nPresident Trump \u2019 s message of goodwill at the traditional post-inaugural congressional luncheon seemed more an expression of hope over reality , in a political system that has grown increasingly polarized over the years .\nAnd as violence broke out on the streets of Washington Friday \u2013 away from the inaugural festivities but aimed at marring an otherwise orderly transfer of presidential power \u2013 it was clear that words alone will not be enough to heal the nation \u2019 s divisions .\nProtesters threw rocks , smashed windows , and lit small fires ; police deployed tear gas and flash bangs . Six officers were injured , and 217 protesters were arrested . The last time there was large-scale unrest at an inauguration was in 1969 , when antiwar protests led to dozens of arrests .\nIn all , it made for moments of anger and frustration , but violence didn \u2019 t typify the day . Groups of people wearing \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d caps walked by anti-Trump groups wearing pink knitted hats \u2013 the headgear of choice for Saturday \u2019 s big women \u2019 s march \u2013 and seemed to largely ignore each other .\nInauguration Day , of course , brings many who wish to celebrate and support the man they sent to Washington . Theirs were expressions of joy on a day meant to celebrate a hallmark of American democracy \u2013 the peaceful transfer of power .\nAnn Hermes/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 From left , Amy Kelash , Ann Kelash , and Jeb Strehlo call family members from National Mall after arriving on a bus from Gilman , Minn. , for the 58th Presidential Inauguration on Friday in Washington .\nThe Graham family \u2013 mom , dad , and college student son \u2013 drove in overnight from Bristol , Tenn. , to show their support for the new president , waving Trump flags and wearing Trump hats and T-shirts .\nNone had ever attended an inauguration before . So why now ?\n\u201c Because I \u2019 m a huge supporter of Donald Trump , and I think he \u2019 ll make America great again , \u201d said Steve Graham , an electrician .\nHow ? Mr. Graham has a ready list : fixing the economy , securing the border , strengthening the military . \u201c I think he \u2019 s a man of his word , and he \u2019 ll hold true to it . \u201d\nHis wife , Darlene Graham , a realtor , says her No . 1 reason for supporting Trump is \u201c his stand with Jesus Christ and his support for the state of Israel . \u201d\nMr. Graham expects quick action , and quick results . Ms. Graham gives Trump a year to improve the nation . And son Justin says he \u2019 ll assess Trump \u2019 s performance by the midterm elections in 2018 .\nEverybody , it seemed , was eager to express their opinions \u2013 with both supporters and detractors expressing outsize views about the man and what he can accomplish .\nMary Moga did not vote for Trump . Nor did she vote for Hillary Clinton . And yet , standing before the festooned Capitol as the seated inaugural audience began to break up , she described the experience as \u201c electric \u201d and \u201c surreal. \u201d She came , she said , because \u201c it \u2019 s about the US . \u201d\nBut she also came to march . Ms. Moga , who is from Seattle , and her cousin , Debby Burger of San Diego , both plan to take part in the Women \u2019 s March on Washington Saturday . Ms. Burger campaigned for Hillary Clinton .\nJust as a reporter asked what they thought of the speech , Moga \u2019 s daughter \u2013 one of five children she \u2019 s raised \u2013 passed by answering , \u201c It was a joke . \u201d\nCousin Burger chimed in . \u201c He \u2019 s promising all these things he never could do . \u201d\n\u201c I just hope and pray he surrounds himself with quality people , \u201d added Moga .\nJohn Minchillo/AP Spectators wait in the rain on the National Mall in Washington Friday before the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump .\nChad Suenram , standing rows away from where Donald Trump had just given his inauguration speech , came away feeling completely the opposite .\nHe says he was \u201c blown away. \u201d What he really liked was Trump \u2019 s message about \u201c the positivity of the US prospering , of everyone growing together and just bringing back America . \u201d\nThe promise of prosperity was the main reason Mr. Suenram , who has four kids , voted for Trump .\nThe Kansan , wearing an \u201c All Lives Matter \u201d button on his sweatshirt , says he came from \u201c a struggle , \u201d growing up in a trailer park .
