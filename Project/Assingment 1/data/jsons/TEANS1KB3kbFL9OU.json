Journalists misrepresent the details and try to convince their audience with a mix of invective and shouting . It \u2019 s precisely what happened with the GOP \u2019 s tax cut vote .\nMedia attacked the plan 24-7 and then labeled it \u201c deeply unpopular. \u201d Shocker .

Her fellow columnist Paul Krugman called it a \u201c nightmare , \u201d though he also predicted post-election \u201c we are very probably looking at a global recession , with no end in sight . \u201d\nNBC \u201c Today \u201d co-host Savannah Guthrie seemed shocked that Republicans thought the tax cut would help employees . She even asked House Speaker Paul Ryan : \u201c Are you living in a fantasy world ? \u201d\nSeveral companies have since announced that they are giving raises or bonuses to their workers following the cut . Ironically , these include NBC \u2019 s parent company Comcast .

But the reality is that 80 percent of taxpayers are scheduled for a cut .\nAs with any major issue of the day , the story was filled with crazy and hyperbolic reactions .

But if you 'd rather just see my skin color , pls feel free . \u201d\nThen there was comedian Rosie O \u2019 Donnell .
