    "content": "It has been suggested that there \u2019 s is a \u201c war \u201d on against Fox News as the network completes critical personnel changes and launches new programming . Certainly critics hope viewers are under the impression that Fox is suffering in the ratings . But they are not , and this is indisputable . The network still rules . For the 22nd week in a row , Fox News remains the most-watched cable network of all , besting HGTV , USA and TBS , say the latest Nielsen Media Research findings . Additionally , Fox News programs made up 15 of the top 30 telecasts on basic cable .\nAnd no matter what you might hear about ratings minutiae , Fox News outranked both MSNBC and CNN in prime time , drawing 2.2 million viewers compared to MSNBC \u2019 s 1.3 million and CNN \u2019 s 1.1 million . Fox also triumphed when breaking news about terrorist attacks in London terror emerged : Fox News was the No . 1 cable news network Saturday evening with 2.1 million viewers ; CNN garnered 1.2 million and MSNBC a telling 628,000 viewers . And it has been ever thus , it seems . In brief , Fox News has been the No . 1 cable news channel for 15 years according to those Nielsen numbers .\n\u201c Fox News is still strong despite the turmoil , \u201d says Jeff McCall , a DePauw University communications professor , in an op-ed for the Indianapolis Star . \u201c For all the controversy surrounding Fox News Channel in recent months , one could conclude the channel is in ratings trouble . Surprisingly , however , the network \u2019 s prime time audience in May was 11 percent higher than for May 2016 .\nMr. McCall continues , \u201c MSNBC and CNN have seen even larger growth , but those gains have not come at the expense of Fox . MSNBC , in particular , has expanded its audience with a laserlike focus on the Trump administration \u2019 s daily dramas . The question for MSNBC now is whether the anti-Trump fervor that fueled its ratings gains has staying power . \u201d\n\u201c A slim majority of Americans ( 55 percent ) say religion can answer all or most of today \u2019 s problems . Although this percentage has declined substantially over time , it has been relatively stable over the past year and a half and is up from the all-time low of 51 percent in May 2015 , \u201d reports Gallup analyst Art Swift .\nAnd the inevitable partisan divide : 71 percent of Republicans , 50 percent of independents and 47 percent of Democrats also agree that faith is still the answer . The strongest sentiment \u2014 85 percent \u2014 was found among those who attend church weekly , the lowest \u2014 9 percent \u2014 who had no religious preference .\n\u201c A slim majority of Americans believe religion can answer problems , a vast majority think that God played some part in the process of human creation , and most believe God also had a role in the contents of the Bible , \u201d says Mr . Swift , summarizing multiple Gallup findings . \u201c Religious fervor may be declining , but with these questions , Americans still assert religion and topics relating to religion as having relevance in 21st-century life . \u201d\nAn event of note on Wednesday in the nation \u2019 s capital : Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao offers the keynote speech at the Competitive Enterprise Institute \u2019 s Annual Dinner , staged at a sparkling hotel not all that far from the White House . Ms. Chao is likely to address regulatory reform and forward-thinking ideas about infrastructure and yes , the nation \u2019 s transportation .\nThe event has a unique theme , however : \u201c Through the Looking Glass : Washington Gets Curiouser and Curiouser. \u201d Few can argue with that idea . Guests will be treated to \u201c enticing \u2018 Eat Me \u2019 cookies , \u201d these sweets borrowed from the children \u2019 s book itself . There will also be a \u201c looking glass selfie mirror \u201d and a karaoke room complete with a dramatic Red Queen theme .\nThe Trump resistance goes on . And on and on . Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has launched TrumpiLeaks a secure new extension of his personal website for those who believe they have something negative to share about President Trump \u2014 and are motivated to \u201c protect the United States of America from tyranny . \u201d\nMr. Moore has provided four online encryption apps , plus email and regular mail contacts for interested parties ; he \u2019 s looking for comments , photos , video and audio files . Will this fuel a future documentary ?
