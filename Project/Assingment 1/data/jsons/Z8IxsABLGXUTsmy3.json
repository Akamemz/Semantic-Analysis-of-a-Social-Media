You don \u2019 t have any children . You don \u2019 t use your husband \u2019 s name . You practice law . Does it concern you that maybe other people feel that you don \u2019 t fit the image that we have created for the governor \u2019 s wife in Arkansas ? \u201d\n\u201c No , \u201d she began , \u201c because just as I said before \u2026 \u201d\nShe had made a choice . In 1974 , she had moved to Arkansas to be with her boyfriend , Bill Clinton . It was a decision that would dictate so many others , big and small , for decades to come\u2014and here , in this spartan studio , on this rinky-dink show , was one of them . How to respond to this man ?\nThis issue of wifeliness was being put to the first female lawyer at the finest firm in Little Rock . Rodham had been 1 of just 27 women among the 200-plus students in her law school class at Yale . She was one of only three on the staff of 44 attorneys on the Watergate impeachment team . She could have responded to the interviewer by pointing out any of these things . It was the \u2018 70s : She could have responded with an impassioned lecture about feminism , or chauvinism , or women \u2019 s lib . But she didn \u2019 t . She responded with an equanimity that must have been a challenge to muster . \u201c That doesn \u2019 t bother me , and I hope that doesn \u2019 t bother very many people , \u201d she said .\nRodham by then was already hugely accomplished . But it also was true that she had arrived in the governor \u2019 s mansion not as a governor but as the governor \u2019 s wife . And when she arrived at the White House , 13 years later , it would be in the same way\u2014as the unelected half of a couple , attracting more questions about her role , not only from traditionalists , who queried her all over again , but also from feminists\u2014even some fellow Wellesley grads\u2014who believed she should have gotten there under her own power . \u201c We should not take a second seat to our life partners , \u201d one alum would write , \u201c and Hillary should not be applauded for having reached her position by doing so . \u201d\nSo here , now , is Hillary Clinton\u2014168 years after the first women \u2019 s rights convention in Seneca Falls in New York , 96 years after women in America gained the right to vote , 37 years after that community-access interview\u2014poised to be elected president . The 45th president of the United States . And the first woman . If the polls are right , she is on the verge of an outcome that would be no less historic than the election of Barack Obama . If she wins on Tuesday , she will be , forever , the woman who shattered the highest , hardest glass ceiling .\nIf she wins on Tuesday , she will be , forever , the woman who shattered the highest , hardest glass ceiling .\nA deep look at her record of her pursuit of power and interviews with people who have known her throughout her adult life suggest that the Hillary Clinton who sits at that cusp\u2014the guarded 69-year-old woman Americans have watched so closely on this year \u2019 s campaign trail\u2014is a personality forged through a career-long collision with the constantly shifting set of gender-based expectations people have put on her . To get here , she has done for so many years so many versions of what she did on In Focus : adjust , compromise and concede where necessary , never letting pure ideology interfere with the progress her ambitions required . She has done what she needed to for her husband to win elections , then for her to do the same , making repeated course corrections along the way .\nThe list is considerable . To help her husband in Arkansas , she started wearing contacts and makeup , changed her clothes and her hair , and ( most meaningfully ) dropped her maiden name\u2014the one she had vowed as a girl to keep for life . After first emerging on the presidential campaign trail as a groundbreaking near-co-candidate , she realized she could help him win only by settling into a softer , more docile , more universally palatable role . Once in Washington , she stepped up zealously to reform the health care system , and under attack was forced to recede again , to a less partisan and more traditional posture as first lady . When her husband philandered in the Oval Office , humiliating her in the most painful way on the most public stage , she didn \u2019 t leave\u2014she stayed . And ever since , every time she has run for office for herself , twice for the Senate , and now twice for the presidency , she generally has been reluctant to embrace an explicit , forceful feminist mantle\u2014not so much a flouting of ideals as an assessment that it might be counterproductive to her ability to win .\nThere \u2019 s no question her inside-the-system strategy , the long life of triangulation and shifting , adjusting her goals and even her persona to maintain access , is what created the path that led to her presidency . It may also be her biggest challenge in governing the American people , who sense in her a person who is neither one thing nor the other . Some see an opportunist , others a pragmatist . She has been labeled too radical and not radical enough , beset by conservatives and liberals alike , sometimes simultaneously . But she has been , always , not a radical or an ideologue , as many of her most vociferous critics have claimed , but a realist , a centrist . And people who know her well , who have been mentors and friends , who have worked with her and for her , say this is precisely why she is where she is . It is the reason , they said in interviews this week , she stands at this threshold .\n\u201c She \u2019 s obviously had her eyes on this for a long time\u2014she wasn \u2019 t just doing it for Bill\u2014and she was preserving her options at every step of the way , \u201d said Kris Olson , who went to Wellesley with her and also to Yale .\n\u201c Really , \u201d said Ann Henry , a retired law professor in Fayetteville , Arkansas , who \u2019 s been friends with Clinton for more than 40 years , \u201c she is an incrementalist\u2014and it takes a long time to get things changed . \u201d\n\u201c You have to make certain accommodations , \u201d said Melanne Verveer , who was chief of staff to the first lady in the Clinton White House , went on to be the first U.S. ambassador for Global Women \u2019 s Issues and is currently the executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women , Peace and Security . \u201c And it seems to me that if they don \u2019 t go to the essence of who you are and what you believe , then they are accommodations you make to achieve greater goals . \u201d\nIf she wins next week , after all , she will be President Clinton , not President Rodham . But the title is what will matter .\nWhen she wrote to NASA as a teenager asking about training for space flight , she got a letter back that said , \u201c We are not accepting girls as astronauts. \u201d When she ran for student body president in high school , she lost to a boy who told her she was \u201c really stupid if I thought a girl could be elected president , \u201d she wrote in a letter to her youth minister . When she was trying to decide whether to go to law school at Harvard or Yale , she went to a cocktail reception at Harvard , where a professor told her , \u201c We don \u2019 t need any more women , \u201d and so she went to Yale .\nHer classmates in high school had elected her as the girl \u201c most likely to succeed , \u201d and Alan Schechter , her thesis adviser at Wellesley , had written to Yale that she had \u201c the intellectual ability , personality , and character to make a remarkable contribution to American society \u201d \u2014and the women around her in her early to mid-20s saw in her intoxicating potential . Her fellow students in college believed she could be the first female president . Betsey Wright , a political consultant who worked with her in George McGovern \u2019 s presidential campaign in Texas in 1972 , thought the same thing . When she told an older lawyer involved in the Watergate work that she wanted to be a trial attorney , he told her she couldn \u2019 t be because she wouldn \u2019 t \u201c have a wife \u201d \u2014a wife , he explained , to buy the groceries and do the laundry and keep the home . She and some of the other women made a sign with a message and hung it next to the coffee machine . \u201c The women in this office were not hired to make coffee , \u201d it said . \u201c Make it yourself \u2026 \u201d\nSo the women who knew Rodham at the time were surprised , and chagrined , when she married a man with such heady political plans of his own . \u201c I was thrown at first when she moved to Arkansas to be with Bill , \u201d Jan Piercy , one of her oldest friends , told me recently . Piercy called it \u201c startling. \u201d Wright , too , was dismayed . She told him , not her , according to Carl Bernstein \u2019 s biography , A Woman in Charge , that \u201c he shouldn \u2019 t do that \u201d because \u201c he could find anybody he wanted to be a politician \u2019 s wife \u201d \u2014but women , women looking for standard-bearers , for women who could run for political office themselves , would \u201c never find anybody like her . \u201d\nRodham , though , assured them they shouldn \u2019 t worry . She wouldn \u2019 t kowtow to expectations of retrograde men . She wouldn \u2019 t be a \u201c sacrificial \u201d political wife . She would have her own career . And she would keep her own name .\nPeople noticed . The New York Times did . \u201c A graduate of Yale Law School who plays a mean jazz saxophone , Mr. Clinton , \u201d the newspaper wrote in November 1978 in a brief portrait about the new governor of Arkansas , \u201c is married to an ardent feminist , Hilary Rodham \u201d \u2014mischaracterizing her while also misspelling her name\u2014 \u201c who will certainly be the first first lady of Arkansas to keep her maiden name . \u201d\nThe Arkansas Democrat noticed too . \u201c Despite the fact that she keeps her maiden name , \u201d the newspaper in Little Rock wrote , also misspelling her first name with one l , \u201c the wife of Arkansas \u2019 s new governor , Bill Clinton , claims she \u2019 s really an old-fashioned girl. \u201d She believed in hard work and the golden rule , she explained , but she stressed : \u201c I need to maintain my interests and my commitments . I need my own identity , too . \u201d\nIt mattered back at Wellesley . The 1969 class notes in the college \u2019 s alumnae magazine in the spring of 1979 made mention of \u201c Hillary Rodham , the first lady of Arkansas\u2014and the nation \u2019 s only first lady to have retained her maiden name . \u201d\n\u201c I really did not want to mix my professional activities with his political activities , \u201d she explained to the host on In Focus . \u201c I didn \u2019 t want anyone ever to think that I was either taking advantage of his position or in some way riding on it , and there aren \u2019 t very many ways to persuade people of that . \u201d\nRemaining Hillary Rodham , she figured , was one way to do that . But the more trenchant point , to herself and to others , she would write later in her memoir , was clear : \u201c I was still me . \u201d\nHer politically talented husband had lost the governorship in 1980 after a single two-year term\u2014in part because of her , because many people in Arkansas had never been placated by her justifications . She had some decisions to make .\nSome of them were cosmetic . She defrizzed and lightened her hair and got rid of her glasses . She hired a fashion consultant . Some of her friends were bothered by the change in her look . \u201c She was going to have to fit into this Barbie Doll model , \u201d said Nancy Wanderer from Wellesley . Others dismissed it as mostly cosmetic .\nBut there was a bigger compromise in front of her , one that was politically a much bigger deal . \u201c He lost because she hadn \u2019 t changed her name , \u201d Ann Henry told me .\n\u201c It cost them dearly , \u201d Schechter , her Wellesley thesis adviser , told me last week . \u201c So she learned : You better go along to get along . \u201d\n\u201c Rodham , Rodham , Rodham , \u201d said Verveer , describing the crux of the attacks from her husband \u2019 s opponents\u2014already in 1978 , when he had won , and again in 1980 , when he had not . \u201c As though she were a monster from another world . \u201d\nRodham , Rodham , Rodham , \u201d said Verveer , describing the crux of the attacks from her husband \u2019 s opponents . \u201c As though she were a monster from another world . \u201d\nHow much was her identity worth if it meant costing him his political future ? Her calculation was concise , as she would phrase it in the memoir : \u201c I decided it was more important for Bill to be Governor than for me to keep my maiden name. \u201d She made her announcement at the same news conference her husband announced he would be running to win back the office .\nIt worked . Bill Clinton was elected governor again in 1982 , and 1984 , and 1986 , and 1988 , and 1990 . Bill and Hillary Clinton were a power couple with a rising national profile : a young and successful governor , and his law-partner wife . When he ran for president in 1992 , his wife burst forth as a new kind of woman on the national scene . \u201c Not your normal first lady type , right ? \u201d said Patti Solis Doyle , a staffer of hers from the campaign . \u201c She was strong . She was opinionated . She was definitely an equal partner . \u201d\nHillary Rodham Clinton triggered all sorts of complicated emotions from the public in the 1992 60 Minutes interview in which she sat next to her husband and defended him in the face of flaring allegations of infidelity . She managed to offend a raft of women by saying snippily that she hadn \u2019 t stayed home to bake \u201c cookies \u201d and have \u201c teas. \u201d The campaign began to understand that she was seen as an asset by some , but that there was another , not insignificant group that viewed her as a liability .\n\u201c If the wife comes through as being too strong and too intelligent , \u201d former President Richard Nixon told the New York Times , \u201c it makes the husband look like a wimp . \u201d\n\u201c While voters genuinely admire Hillary Clinton \u2019 s intelligence and tenacity , \u201d Clinton pollsters Stan Greenberg and Celinda Lake wrote in a memo that spring , \u201c they are uncomfortable with these traits in a woman . \u201d\nWhile voters genuinely admire Hillary Clinton \u2019 s intelligence and tenacity , \u201d Clinton pollsters Stan Greenberg and Celinda Lake wrote in a memo that spring , \u201c they are uncomfortable with these traits in a woman . \u201d\nThat summer , the Republicans knew they had a target\u2014not in the president , but in his wife . As the party coalesced around a new euphemism , \u201c family values , \u201d she was pilloried at the Republican National Convention as a \u201c radical , \u201d an anti-family \u201c dowdy feminazi. \u201d One explanation for the attacks ? \u201c She would have been \u2026 the first professional , independent , working first lady , \u201d Jody Franklin , her chief of staff during that campaign , said in a recent interview . \u201c The country couldn \u2019 t wrap its brain around that . \u201d\nTo anyone who knew her , there was a powerful irony : much of her work as a lawyer , and also her work on the side as the first lady of Arkansas , had centered around the welfare of children and families . And the image of her as some bra-burning feminist couldn \u2019 t have been more off-base . Even in college , she had been a moderate at a radical time , a young woman who usually avoided demonstrations in favor of conversations with professors and deans .\nAs in Arkansas , she had pushed forward\u2014only to have to pull back . She adjusted , and did what had to be done , clapping for her husband , waving to the growing crowds , submitting a chocolate chip cookie recipe to Family Circle magazine . \u201c She was put in a box for the rest of the campaign , \u201d Franklin said .\nShe hoped it would be different in the White House . \u201c What I hope , \u201d she said , the week before the election , to the author Donnie Radcliffe , \u201c is that each woman , and someday men in that position , will be free to be who they are . \u201d\nIt might have been tempting , at least for a moment , for her or for anybody else , to think that the choices she had made to get there , the adjustments and accommodations , the compromises and concessions , finally had paid off . Having weathered the pitfalls of the campaign , she now was moving from Arkansas to the White House . She wanted to be unburdened and unleashed . She wanted to be called Hillary Rodham Clinton , not just Hillary Clinton . She wanted to have an office in the West Wing , the hub of the power , not just the East Wing , the headquarters for the ceremonial duties expected of the president \u2019 s spouse . She , on the other hand , wanted to have an active policy-making role in her husband \u2019 s administration . She got all those things .\nBut while polling showed people around the country had a generally \u201c favorable \u201d opinion of her\u2014respondents to the Los Angeles Times in January 1993 pegged that figure at a relatively robust 58 percent\u2014the numbers also suggested they remained deeply uncomfortable with the notion that she would be intimately involved with the government \u2019 s most substantive work .\nIf the move to Washington and the White House was a window of opportunity , it also brought a new , startling kind of clarity to the limits of what she had achieved . \u201c You \u2019 re first lady , you \u2019 re there solely by the virtue of your marriage to your husband , \u201d Verveer , her White House chief of staff , said in an interview this week . \u201c That is the criteria. \u201d Americans had voted for Bill for president , not his wife . Nearly 70 percent said she should stay away from Cabinet meetings . The U.S. News & World Report offered a blunt and yet undeniable takeaway : \u201c Most Americans object to Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s plans to carve out an unprecedented role for herself . \u201d\nThe new first lady was caught off guard by the fact that she quickly had to pick decorations and cards for the following Christmas . She was far less interested in this part of her new position . \u201c Let me say , \u201d Lisa Caputo , her press secretary at the time , told me this week , \u201c that the traditional aspects initially , initially , perhaps , were not at the top of the priority list\u2014because she was given a job to be the health care czar . And she rolled up her sleeves and went to work . \u201d\n\u201c I want to free women to live according to their own needs and desires , \u201d Clinton said in a speech at Scripps College in California early in her time as first lady . \u201c I want all women to be given the respect they deserve to have for the choices they may make . \u201d\nBut that \u2019 s not how it worked . She was criticized by conservatives and other opponents of government health care for being too independent . Almost simultaneously , though , she was criticized by others\u2014even by women from Wellesley\u2014for not being independent enough .\n\u201c I want to free women to live according to their own needs and desires , \u201d Clinton said in a speech early in her time as first lady . \u201c I want all women to be given the respect they deserve to have for the choices they may make. \u201d But that \u2019 s not how it worked .\n\u201c You look gorgeous , but I worry about the kind of message your highly publicized \u2018 make-over \u2019 may send to young women , \u201d one of her classmates wrote to her in Wellesley \u2019 s alumnae magazine in 1993 . \u201c Try to maintain your identity as an independent woman . \u201d\nIn a letter to the editor in the magazine in 1994 , a 1968 graduate and a doctor from Madison , Connecticut , denigrated Clinton as a terrible role model for aspiring young women .\n\u201c Hillary \u2019 s entire career has been a direct result of the fact that she married Bill , \u201d she said . \u201c Her role in the development and politicization of the president \u2019 s proposal for the revision of the health care system of the United States is hers not because of any training , experience , or expertise in the field . She holds this position because she is married to the president . \u201d\nShe went on : \u201c My major concern is that young Wellesley women not perceive Hillary as a role model for pursuit of independent careers . If she had political or societal aspirations , which I suspect she did , why did she not have the faith in herself and her Wellesley background to follow them ? Why did she make the apparently conscious decision that she could only get where she wanted to by riding on her husband \u2019 s coattails ? \u201d\nA 1985 graduate who was a lawyer in Washington concurred , mailing in a similar censure\u2014comparing Clinton , unfavorably , to Madeleine Albright , another Wellesley graduate who then was the United States ambassador to the United Nations and three years away from becoming the first female secretary of state . \u201c Madeleine Korbel Albright , \u201d the woman wrote , \u201c deserves respect because she has built her expertise over several years of being good at what she does . The first lady is good at what she does , too\u2014that is , she is good at being a politician \u2019 s wife \u2026 \u201d\nIn fact , in major national health care reform , Bill Clinton couldn \u2019 t have given his wife a more daunting , politically demanding task . And when it faltered , after Republicans had made her a singular subject of their opposition and ire\u2014attacking it as \u201c Hillarycare \u201d \u2014she retreated . She was blamed for the results of the midterm elections of 1994 , which were disastrous for Democrats . And she again made the accommodations that were required . She was no longer involved in any efforts to write significant legislation . She all but disappeared from the West Wing . It \u2019 s what she had to do , she was told , by the public and by pollsters\u2014just like in Arkansas in 1982\u2014to give her husband a chance at reelection .\nShe didn \u2019 t disappear , and she didn \u2019 t turn silent . She used the uncommon platform her position afforded to reach an audience more receptive to her message . Women . Especially overseas .\nShe went in the spring of 1995 on a tour of South Asia , where she gave speeches on women \u2019 s rights . \u201c Women , \u201d she said in India , \u201c have to be responsible for our own lives and our own futures ... \u201d\nThat fall , she accepted an invitation to go to China , to attend the fourth United Nations \u2019 World Conference on Women . \u201c I want to push the envelope as far as I can when it comes to women \u2019 s rights and human rights , \u201d she told her speechwriter , Lissa Muscatine , Muscatine told biographer Cynthia Levinson .\nIt was time , she said , to speak up\u2014and she did , in a bold new way . Clinton , not typically known for soaring oratory , delivered in Beijing one of the most resonant lines of any of her many speeches .\n\u201c Human rights are women \u2019 s rights , \u201d she said , \u201c and women \u2019 s rights are human rights . \u201d\nIt vaulted her once and for all onto an international stage .\nBack home , though , she remained angry and frustrated . About the failure of health care . About her diminished participation in that portion of the administration .\n\u201c She did substantive work as first lady , \u201d Caputo said , \u201c but she did it within a box with a label of \u2018 first lady \u2019 attached to it . \u201d\nIt was \u201c not easy , \u201d Verveer said . \u201c And that \u2019 s an understatement . \u201d\nOn Thanksgiving Day in 1996 , a few weeks after her husband \u2019 s reelection , she called her best friend Diane Blair , according to Blair \u2019 s notes , which are in the archives of the University of Arkansas . She vented . She had returned recently from another trip , to Thailand and Australia , where she had given speeches at schools for girls . \u201c She knows this is important to do , but still frustrated , \u201d Blair wrote in her notes . Blair told Clinton , she said , it was difficult \u201c being a pioneer in an anachronistic role . \u201d\n\u201c She has come to the conclusion , \u201d Blair wrote , \u201c that no matter what she does , she is going to piss off some people , so will just continue to be herself and let everyone else make whatever adjustments they have to . \u201d\n\u201c She has come to the conclusion , \u201d Blair wrote , \u201c that no matter what she does , she is going to piss off some people , so will just continue to be herself and let everyone else make whatever adjustments they have to . \u201d\nClinton , though , was the one who had made the adjustments . And where had it gotten her ? \u201c I know how to compromise , \u201d she told Blair . \u201c I have compromised . I gave up my name , got contact lenses \u2026 \u201d\n\u201c Now , for the first time , \u201d Clinton said in an interview with Talk magazine , heading into her campaign in New York in 2000 for a seat in the Senate , \u201c I am making my own decisions . I can feel the difference . It is a great relief . \u201d\nHer comments to Talk were candid , and they were optimistic , too\u2014overly so . It was not nearly so simple .\nIt was complicated because of what her husband had done to her , because of what he had done with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office , and because she had chosen to stay . She shared her reasons with Talk , pointing to Bill \u2019 s difficult childhood without a father and calling him \u201c a very , very good man \u201d and his adultery \u201c a sin of weakness , \u201d not \u201c malice . \u201d\nAnd it was complicated because by then her innately cautious disposition had only been accentuated and intensified by the ways in which she had gotten to this new stage\u2014the adjustments and the accommodations , the compromises and the concessions , and the incredible national ordeal she had faced . In the most personally sordid White House drama in living memory , her husband had committed a humiliating act of adultery , and had been impeached for lying about it . She was living with the residue of the choices she made and the criticisms that followed .\n\u201c More than a first lady , \u201d went one of her slogans in an early ad in that campaign , but what was clear quickly after her eight years as a White House spouse is that her obstacles hadn \u2019 t vanished . In fact , there were fresh ones now\u2014and they were a byproduct of the older obstacles and the choices she had made to overcome them .\nWomen had mixed feelings . Older women . Suburban women . Especially women just like her . White . Professional . Baby Boomers . Internal polling , according to Michael Tomasky \u2019 s book about the Senate race , Hillary \u2019 s Turn , painted a complicated picture . They considered her history and had concluded that she was \u201c smart \u201d but \u201c cold , \u201d \u201c savvy \u201d but \u201c pushy , \u201d \u201c controlling \u201d and \u201c cunning \u201d and \u201c back stabbing. \u201d \u201c Independent \u201d and \u201c self-serving . \u201d\n\u201c You get the sense that she doesn \u2019 t think like a woman , \u201d one woman told the pollsters . \u201c She thinks like a man. \u201d And they held against her her reactions to his infidelity . \u201c I \u2019 m upset at her for not taking a stand , \u201d one woman said . Once again , she was taking fire for not being traditional enough\u2014too manly in her thinking\u2014and for being too traditional , by heeding a wedding vow .\nOnce again , she was taking fire for not being traditional enough\u2014too manly in her thinking\u2014and for being too traditional , by heeding a wedding vow .\nSo it was surprising when she won in a landslide , 55 percent to 43 percent\u2014and by 20 percent with women\u2014and the race banked that way , most analysts agreed , because of two things that happened at the first debate . Her first debate ever . The moderator , Tim Russert , asked her aggressively about Lewinsky , and her opponent , Rick Lazio , bolstered a point he was trying to make by walking across the stage , toward her , closer and closer and into her personal space . Both moments , it turned out , made her seem vulnerable , and in a way that changed minds of women who watched .\nThe ambivalence ebbed and flowed over the years since but never totally went away . \u201c It seems wildly tragic that we know she could have been president if she had just not even married him , \u201d one woman , an unidentified Wellesley grad , told Carl Bernstein for his biography , A Woman in Charge , which came out in 2007\u2014the year Clinton announced she was running for president . It was an echo , though more forgiving , of the letters in the alumnae magazine from 1994 . \u201c In fact , \u201d this woman said , \u201c it \u2019 s hard to think of a sadder example of a person who couldn \u2019 t quite give up the old ideas . Her way of moving toward electoral politics was to marry someone who was going to run . \u201d\nNow , though , she had run for herself . But the lesson of vulnerability from 2000 hadn \u2019 t stuck . In advance of her first presidential campaign , longtime Clinton pollster Mark Penn cautioned her against running basically as too much of a woman , a recommendation she was plenty ready to follow . She had learned by this point that calling attention to oneself as a woman had a way of creating problems .\n\u201c Most voters in essence see the president as the \u2018 father \u2019 of the country , \u201d Penn wrote in his memo on the subject . \u201c They do not want someone who would be the first mama \u2026 \u201d\nIt informed one of her stock phrases in her stump speeches : \u201c I am not running because I \u2019 m a woman . \u201d\nThroughout 2007 , Anne Kornblut wrote in her book Notes from the Cracked Ceiling , Clinton talked about gender \u201c in the most inoffensive conceivable way . \u201d\nWhen she gave a speech at Wellesley that year in November , she couldn \u2019 t avoid the topic given the location . The campaign passed out T-shirts to students that announced , \u201c I can be president , too. \u201d \u201c In so many ways , this all-women \u2019 s college prepared me to compete in the all boys \u2019 club of presidential politics , \u201d Clinton said . \u201c We need to shatter that highest glass ceiling . We can make history. \u201d It came off as staged , stilted and half-hearted .\nOnly in the following February , after Obama had won the Iowa caucus , after she had ceded to him the territory of a historic candidacy , after Clinton had run as stubbornly strong and stern , did she crack , just a little . She hadn \u2019 t lost to Obama only in Iowa\u2014she had come in third , losing to John Edwards , too . She was trailing in polls . And a woman at a cafe in New Hampshire asked her a question . \u201c How do you do it ? \u201d Marianne Pernold Young , 64 at the time , asked Clinton . The candidate paused . \u201c It \u2019 s not easy , \u201d she said , as her voice wavered and her eyes began to get teary . It was a rare sign of vulnerability\u2014and , as had been the case at the debate in New York , she was rewarded . She won the primary the next day . Women had supported her in a big way . Obama \u2019 s win in Iowa had been hailed as historic , even though he was not the first black man to have won a presidential primary\u2014that was Jessie Jackson , in 1988\u2014and here Clinton \u2019 s win in New Hampshire was covered as a resuscitation of her horse-race hopes . It was the first time a woman had won a major presidential primary , in any state in this country , ever .\nThe news media didn \u2019 t dwell on that . But neither did she , until the very end .\nHer concession speech was different than all of her speeches on the stump . \u201c On a personal note , \u201d she said in June 2008 at the National Building Museum in Washington , \u201c when I was asked what it means to be a woman running for president , I always gave the same answer , that I was proud to be running as a woman , but I was running because I thought I \u2019 d be the best president .\n\u201c I am a woman , \u201d Clinton said , \u201c and , like millions of women , I know there are still barriers and biases out there , often unconscious . And I want to build an America that respects and embraces the potential of every last one of us . I ran as a daughter who benefited from opportunities my mother never dreamed of . I ran as a mother who worries about my daughter \u2019 s future \u2026 \u201d\n\u201c As we gather here today in this historic , magnificent building , the 50th woman to leave this Earth is orbiting overhead , \u201d she said , an unconscious nod perhaps to her long-ago letter to NASA . \u201c If we can blast 50 women into space , we will someday launch a woman into the White House . \u201d\n\u201c Although we weren \u2019 t able to shatter that highest , hardest glass ceiling this time , thanks to you , it \u2019 s got about 18 million cracks in it , \u201d she said , referring to the number of votes she amassed in the primaries , \u201c and the light is shining through like never before , filling us all with the hope , and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time . \u201d\nIt hasn \u2019 t been , of course . \u201c I \u2019 m With Her , \u201d reads one of her slogans , but throughout this campaign , on stickers , shirts , signs and hats , she has been called a bitch and a witch and worse . Even back toward the end of the primary season , as she and Donald Trump began to zero in on each other , he was the one to call particular attention to the fact that she is female . \u201c The only thing she \u2019 s got is the woman card , \u201d he said in late April after she pledged that half her Cabinet would be women . To which she responded : \u201c Well , if fighting for women \u2019 s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card , then deal me in. \u201d Her campaign started selling \u201c Woman Cards. \u201d In the general election , which has turned into a referendum on the treatment of women , Clinton has picked her spots to condemn Trump \u2019 s vulgar sexist comments and alleged harassment and assault . At times , though , she has seemed hesitant , still , to speak out about it too much or too loud . It \u2019 s \u201c not how she \u2019 s running , \u201d Verveer said . \u201c She \u2019 s running based on her achievements and who she is\u2014and she happens to be a woman. \u201d Over these past few anxious , angry , vile months , as she \u2019 s gotten closer and closer to the Oval Office , Clinton often has relied on this front on highly effective surrogates . The most forceful , most memorable repudiations of her opponent \u2019 s lengthy record of crude misogyny have come from Elizabeth Warren and Michelle Obama .\n\u201c Take a good look at her , \u201d Nancy Wanderer told her mother about her friend after Hillary Rodham finished her speech at commencement at Wellesley in May 1969 , \u201c because she will probably be president of the United States someday . \u201d\nNever , though , would Wanderer have predicted her path to this point . Not Wanderer or any of her contemporaries or classmates who thought this was a possible destination for her almost half a century back .\n\u201c Not at all , \u201d said Kris Olson . \u201c I never would have thought she would \u2019 ve gone down to Arkansas . \u201d\nOr taken the name of a husband who would go on to become president first .\nIn conversations , though , with many of them over the past couple weeks , they all agreed : This , in the end , is probably how it had to be . A woman who operated purely as a feminist would have condemned herself to fighting a permanently outside fight . And a woman who never tested the limits of the role she agreed to play\u2014tested it over and over\u2014wouldn \u2019 t have built the thick skin and the savvy needed to keep going .\n\u201c Those experiences and changes she made to forge a path are so reflective of women of her generation , \u201d said Sally McMillen , a 1966 Wellesley grad who recently retired as a professor of history , and women \u2019 s history , at Davidson College in North Carolina . \u201c I have always maintained that our generation was the transition generation for women , pulled by traditions but grabbing for new opportunities as we could\u2014constant compromises and even reinventing ourselves as needed . \u201d\n\u201c I think if she hadn \u2019 t made some of those compromises along the way , she probably wouldn \u2019 t have gotten as far as she has , \u201d said Suzanne Salomon , a classmate who lived in the same dorm on the same hall . \u201c If she hadn \u2019 t done some compromising along the way , she wouldn \u2019 t be where she is today . \u201d\nPractical , pragmatic , ambitious women do what they have to do . \u201d\n\u201c It would be hard to find a woman our age who hasn \u2019 t done these things to achieve what she \u2019 s wanted to achieve , \u201d Sentilles said . \u201c Practical , pragmatic , ambitious women do what they have to do . \u201d\nThose who have worked alongside Clinton from Arkansas to Washington and beyond feel the same way .\n\u201c A lot of this is timing , \u201d said Caputo , her old White House press secretary . \u201c She \u2019 s been a transitional figure in our history . And I think that causes one to have to do a difficult navigation with each twist and turn because you \u2019 re paving new ground . \u201d\n\u201c You learn to adopt a more practical approach , \u201d Verveer said , \u201c to get done what you want to get done . \u201d\nWanderer , like so many of the women who have known her the longest , has watched her throughout .\n\u201c She made her choices , just as we all do , \u201d she said . \u201c No woman \u2019 s career is straight . \u201d\nShe told me she followed along with some annoyance and exasperation as her college classmate made her way through the late \u2018 70s and the \u2018 80s and \u2018 90s , wishing that Clinton hadn \u2019 t had to change her look and her name . But she came to understand , she said . \u201c We \u2019 ve all tried to figure these things out , \u201d she explained . \u201c How much do we have to change to be acceptable ? Can we be fully ourselves ? \u201d Over the past decade and a half , she said , ever since Clinton stopped being first lady and started running for the Senate , even though she has remained careful , cautious and even wary , and cresting with this campaign , now closing in on Election Day , Wanderer has observed the self-possessed student she once knew re-emerge . \u201c The old Hillary Rodham , \u201d she said . And last month , Wanderer , who lives in Maine , drove to New Hampshire for a rally . Her friend was introduced to the crowd . They said Clinton . She saw , underneath it all , Rodham .",
    "content_original": "Michael Kruse is a senior staff writer for Politico.\n\n\n\nErick Trickey contributed to this report from Wellesley.\n\nIn early 1979, on a community access television program called In Focus, the wife of the new governor of Arkansas was peppered with question after question about all the ways in which she was an untraditional woman.\n\n\u201cThe thought occurs to me that you really don\u2019t fit the image that we have created for the governor\u2019s wife in Arkansas,\u201d the host, a self-described \u201cnewsman,\u201d said to 32-year-old Hillary Rodham. \u201cYou\u2019re not a native, you\u2019ve been educated in liberal Eastern universities, you\u2019re less than 40. You don\u2019t have any children. You don\u2019t use your husband\u2019s name. You practice law. Does it concern you that maybe other people feel that you don\u2019t fit the image that we have created for the governor\u2019s wife in Arkansas?\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nShe looked through her large, thick-lensed glasses and smiled.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she began, \u201cbecause just as I said before \u2026 \u201d\n\nShe had made a choice. In 1974, she had moved to Arkansas to be with her boyfriend, Bill Clinton. It was a decision that would dictate so many others, big and small, for decades to come\u2014and here, in this spartan studio, on this rinky-dink show, was one of them. How to respond to this man?\n\nThis issue of wifeliness was being put to the first female lawyer at the finest firm in Little Rock. Rodham had been 1 of just 27 women among the 200-plus students in her law school class at Yale. She was one of only three on the staff of 44 attorneys on the Watergate impeachment team. She could have responded to the interviewer by pointing out any of these things. It was the \u201870s: She could have responded with an impassioned lecture about feminism, or chauvinism, or women\u2019s lib. But she didn\u2019t. She responded with an equanimity that must have been a challenge to muster. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother me, and I hope that doesn\u2019t bother very many people,\u201d she said.\n\nRodham by then was already hugely accomplished. But it also was true that she had arrived in the governor\u2019s mansion not as a governor but as the governor\u2019s wife. And when she arrived at the White House, 13 years later, it would be in the same way\u2014as the unelected half of a couple, attracting more questions about her role, not only from traditionalists, who queried her all over again, but also from feminists\u2014even some fellow Wellesley grads\u2014who believed she should have gotten there under her own power. \u201cWe should not take a second seat to our life partners,\u201d one alum would write, \u201cand Hillary should not be applauded for having reached her position by doing so.\u201d\n\nSo here, now, is Hillary Clinton\u2014168 years after the first women\u2019s rights convention in Seneca Falls in New York, 96 years after women in America gained the right to vote, 37 years after that community-access interview\u2014poised to be elected president. The 45th president of the United States. And the first woman. If the polls are right, she is on the verge of an outcome that would be no less historic than the election of Barack Obama. If she wins on Tuesday, she will be, forever, the woman who shattered the highest, hardest glass ceiling.\n\n\n\nIf she wins on Tuesday, she will be, forever, the woman who shattered the highest, hardest glass ceiling.\n\n\n\nA deep look at her record of her pursuit of power and interviews with people who have known her throughout her adult life suggest that the Hillary Clinton who sits at that cusp\u2014the guarded 69-year-old woman Americans have watched so closely on this year\u2019s campaign trail\u2014is a personality forged through a career-long collision with the constantly shifting set of gender-based expectations people have put on her. To get here, she has done for so many years so many versions of what she did on In Focus: adjust, compromise and concede where necessary, never letting pure ideology interfere with the progress her ambitions required. She has done what she needed to for her husband to win elections, then for her to do the same, making repeated course corrections along the way.\n\nThe list is considerable. To help her husband in Arkansas, she started wearing contacts and makeup, changed her clothes and her hair, and (most meaningfully) dropped her maiden name\u2014the one she had vowed as a girl to keep for life. After first emerging on the presidential campaign trail as a groundbreaking near-co-candidate, she realized she could help him win only by settling into a softer, more docile, more universally palatable role. Once in Washington, she stepped up zealously to reform the health care system, and under attack was forced to recede again, to a less partisan and more traditional posture as first lady. When her husband philandered in the Oval Office, humiliating her in the most painful way on the most public stage, she didn\u2019t leave\u2014she stayed. And ever since, every time she has run for office for herself, twice for the Senate, and now twice for the presidency, she generally has been reluctant to embrace an explicit, forceful feminist mantle\u2014not so much a flouting of ideals as an assessment that it might be counterproductive to her ability to win.\n\nThere\u2019s no question her inside-the-system strategy, the long life of triangulation and shifting, adjusting her goals and even her persona to maintain access, is what created the path that led to her presidency. It may also be her biggest challenge in governing the American people, who sense in her a person who is neither one thing nor the other. Some see an opportunist, others a pragmatist. She has been labeled too radical and not radical enough, beset by conservatives and liberals alike, sometimes simultaneously. But she has been, always, not a radical or an ideologue, as many of her most vociferous critics have claimed, but a realist, a centrist. And people who know her well, who have been mentors and friends, who have worked with her and for her, say this is precisely why she is where she is. It is the reason, they said in interviews this week, she stands at this threshold.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s obviously had her eyes on this for a long time\u2014she wasn\u2019t just doing it for Bill\u2014and she was preserving her options at every step of the way,\u201d said Kris Olson, who went to Wellesley with her and also to Yale.\n\n\u201cReally,\u201d said Ann Henry, a retired law professor in Fayetteville, Arkansas, who\u2019s been friends with Clinton for more than 40 years, \u201cshe is an incrementalist\u2014and it takes a long time to get things changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to make certain accommodations,\u201d said Melanne Verveer, who was chief of staff to the first lady in the Clinton White House, went on to be the first U.S. ambassador for Global Women\u2019s Issues and is currently the executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security. \u201cAnd it seems to me that if they don\u2019t go to the essence of who you are and what you believe, then they are accommodations you make to achieve greater goals.\u201d\n\nIf she wins next week, after all, she will be President Clinton, not President Rodham. But the title is what will matter.\n\n***\n\nWhen she wrote to NASA as a teenager asking about training for space flight, she got a letter back that said, \u201cWe are not accepting girls as astronauts.\u201d When she ran for student body president in high school, she lost to a boy who told her she was \u201creally stupid if I thought a girl could be elected president,\u201d she wrote in a letter to her youth minister. When she was trying to decide whether to go to law school at Harvard or Yale, she went to a cocktail reception at Harvard, where a professor told her, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more women,\u201d and so she went to Yale.\n\nHer classmates in high school had elected her as the girl \u201cmost likely to succeed,\u201d and Alan Schechter, her thesis adviser at Wellesley, had written to Yale that she had \u201cthe intellectual ability, personality, and character to make a remarkable contribution to American society\u201d\u2014and the women around her in her early to mid-20s saw in her intoxicating potential. Her fellow students in college believed she could be the first female president. Betsey Wright, a political consultant who worked with her in George McGovern\u2019s presidential campaign in Texas in 1972, thought the same thing. When she told an older lawyer involved in the Watergate work that she wanted to be a trial attorney, he told her she couldn\u2019t be because she wouldn\u2019t \u201chave a wife\u201d\u2014a wife, he explained, to buy the groceries and do the laundry and keep the home. She and some of the other women made a sign with a message and hung it next to the coffee machine. \u201cThe women in this office were not hired to make coffee,\u201d it said. \u201cMake it yourself \u2026 \u201d\n\nSo the women who knew Rodham at the time were surprised, and chagrined, when she married a man with such heady political plans of his own. \u201cI was thrown at first when she moved to Arkansas to be with Bill,\u201d Jan Piercy, one of her oldest friends, told me recently. Piercy called it \u201cstartling.\u201d Wright, too, was dismayed. She told him, not her, according to Carl Bernstein\u2019s biography, A Woman in Charge, that \u201che shouldn\u2019t do that\u201d because \u201che could find anybody he wanted to be a politician\u2019s wife\u201d\u2014but women, women looking for standard-bearers, for women who could run for political office themselves, would \u201cnever find anybody like her.\u201d\n\nRodham, though, assured them they shouldn\u2019t worry. She wouldn\u2019t kowtow to expectations of retrograde men. She wouldn\u2019t be a \u201csacrificial\u201d political wife. She would have her own career. And she would keep her own name.\n\nPeople noticed. The New York Times did. \u201cA graduate of Yale Law School who plays a mean jazz saxophone, Mr. Clinton,\u201d the newspaper wrote in November 1978 in a brief portrait about the new governor of Arkansas, \u201cis married to an ardent feminist, Hilary Rodham\u201d\u2014mischaracterizing her while also misspelling her name\u2014\u201cwho will certainly be the first first lady of Arkansas to keep her maiden name.\u201d\n\nThe Arkansas Democrat noticed too. \u201cDespite the fact that she keeps her maiden name,\u201d the newspaper in Little Rock wrote, also misspelling her first name with one l, \u201cthe wife of Arkansas\u2019s new governor, Bill Clinton, claims she\u2019s really an old-fashioned girl.\u201d She believed in hard work and the golden rule, she explained, but she stressed: \u201cI need to maintain my interests and my commitments. I need my own identity, too.\u201d\n\nIt mattered back at Wellesley. The 1969 class notes in the college\u2019s alumnae magazine in the spring of 1979 made mention of \u201cHillary Rodham, the first lady of Arkansas\u2014and the nation\u2019s only first lady to have retained her maiden name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really did not want to mix my professional activities with his political activities,\u201d she explained to the host on In Focus. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone ever to think that I was either taking advantage of his position or in some way riding on it, and there aren\u2019t very many ways to persuade people of that.\u201d\n\nRemaining Hillary Rodham, she figured, was one way to do that. But the more trenchant point, to herself and to others, she would write later in her memoir, was clear: \u201cI was still me.\u201d\n\nUntil 1982.\n\nHer politically talented husband had lost the governorship in 1980 after a single two-year term\u2014in part because of her, because many people in Arkansas had never been placated by her justifications. She had some decisions to make.\n\nSome of them were cosmetic. She defrizzed and lightened her hair and got rid of her glasses. She hired a fashion consultant. Some of her friends were bothered by the change in her look. \u201cShe was going to have to fit into this Barbie Doll model,\u201d said Nancy Wanderer from Wellesley. Others dismissed it as mostly cosmetic.\n\nBut there was a bigger compromise in front of her, one that was politically a much bigger deal. \u201cHe lost because she hadn\u2019t changed her name,\u201d Ann Henry told me.\n\n\u201cIt cost them dearly,\u201d Schechter, her Wellesley thesis adviser, told me last week. \u201cSo she learned: You better go along to get along.\u201d\n\n\u201cRodham, Rodham, Rodham,\u201d said Verveer, describing the crux of the attacks from her husband\u2019s opponents\u2014already in 1978, when he had won, and again in 1980, when he had not. \u201cAs though she were a monster from another world.\u201d\n\n\n\nRodham, Rodham, Rodham,\u201d said Verveer, describing the crux of the attacks from her husband\u2019s opponents. \u201cAs though she were a monster from another world.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow much was her identity worth if it meant costing him his political future? Her calculation was concise, as she would phrase it in the memoir: \u201cI decided it was more important for Bill to be Governor than for me to keep my maiden name.\u201d She made her announcement at the same news conference her husband announced he would be running to win back the office.\n\nIt worked. Bill Clinton was elected governor again in 1982, and 1984, and 1986, and 1988, and 1990. Bill and Hillary Clinton were a power couple with a rising national profile: a young and successful governor, and his law-partner wife. When he ran for president in 1992, his wife burst forth as a new kind of woman on the national scene. \u201cNot your normal first lady type, right?\u201d said Patti Solis Doyle, a staffer of hers from the campaign. \u201cShe was strong. She was opinionated. She was definitely an equal partner.\u201d\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton triggered all sorts of complicated emotions from the public in the 1992 60 Minutes interview in which she sat next to her husband and defended him in the face of flaring allegations of infidelity. She managed to offend a raft of women by saying snippily that she hadn\u2019t stayed home to bake \u201ccookies\u201d and have \u201cteas.\u201d The campaign began to understand that she was seen as an asset by some, but that there was another, not insignificant group that viewed her as a liability.\n\n\u201cIf the wife comes through as being too strong and too intelligent,\u201d former President Richard Nixon told the New York Times, \u201cit makes the husband look like a wimp.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile voters genuinely admire Hillary Clinton\u2019s intelligence and tenacity,\u201d Clinton pollsters Stan Greenberg and Celinda Lake wrote in a memo that spring, \u201cthey are uncomfortable with these traits in a woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile voters genuinely admire Hillary Clinton\u2019s intelligence and tenacity,\u201d Clinton pollsters Stan Greenberg and Celinda Lake wrote in a memo that spring, \u201cthey are uncomfortable with these traits in a woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat summer, the Republicans knew they had a target\u2014not in the president, but in his wife. As the party coalesced around a new euphemism, \u201cfamily values,\u201d she was pilloried at the Republican National Convention as a \u201cradical,\u201d an anti-family \u201cdowdy feminazi.\u201d One explanation for the attacks? \u201cShe would have been \u2026 the first professional, independent, working first lady,\u201d Jody Franklin, her chief of staff during that campaign, said in a recent interview. \u201cThe country couldn\u2019t wrap its brain around that.\u201d\n\nTo anyone who knew her, there was a powerful irony: much of her work as a lawyer, and also her work on the side as the first lady of Arkansas, had centered around the welfare of children and families. And the image of her as some bra-burning feminist couldn\u2019t have been more off-base. Even in college, she had been a moderate at a radical time, a young woman who usually avoided demonstrations in favor of conversations with professors and deans.\n\nAs in Arkansas, she had pushed forward\u2014only to have to pull back. She adjusted, and did what had to be done, clapping for her husband, waving to the growing crowds, submitting a chocolate chip cookie recipe to Family Circle magazine. \u201cShe was put in a box for the rest of the campaign,\u201d Franklin said.\n\nShe hoped it would be different in the White House. \u201cWhat I hope,\u201d she said, the week before the election, to the author Donnie Radcliffe, \u201cis that each woman, and someday men in that position, will be free to be who they are.\u201d\n\n***\n\nShe was not free to be who she was.\n\nIt might have been tempting, at least for a moment, for her or for anybody else, to think that the choices she had made to get there, the adjustments and accommodations, the compromises and concessions, finally had paid off. Having weathered the pitfalls of the campaign, she now was moving from Arkansas to the White House. She wanted to be unburdened and unleashed. She wanted to be called Hillary Rodham Clinton, not just Hillary Clinton. She wanted to have an office in the West Wing, the hub of the power, not just the East Wing, the headquarters for the ceremonial duties expected of the president\u2019s spouse. She, on the other hand, wanted to have an active policy-making role in her husband\u2019s administration. She got all those things.\n\nBut while polling showed people around the country had a generally \u201cfavorable\u201d opinion of her\u2014respondents to the Los Angeles Times in January 1993 pegged that figure at a relatively robust 58 percent\u2014the numbers also suggested they remained deeply uncomfortable with the notion that she would be intimately involved with the government\u2019s most substantive work.\n\nIf the move to Washington and the White House was a window of opportunity, it also brought a new, startling kind of clarity to the limits of what she had achieved. \u201cYou\u2019re first lady, you\u2019re there solely by the virtue of your marriage to your husband,\u201d Verveer, her White House chief of staff, said in an interview this week. \u201cThat is the criteria.\u201d Americans had voted for Bill for president, not his wife. Nearly 70 percent said she should stay away from Cabinet meetings. The U.S. News & World Report offered a blunt and yet undeniable takeaway: \u201cMost Americans object to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plans to carve out an unprecedented role for herself.\u201d\n\nThe new first lady was caught off guard by the fact that she quickly had to pick decorations and cards for the following Christmas. She was far less interested in this part of her new position. \u201cLet me say,\u201d Lisa Caputo, her press secretary at the time, told me this week, \u201cthat the traditional aspects initially, initially, perhaps, were not at the top of the priority list\u2014because she was given a job to be the health care czar. And she rolled up her sleeves and went to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to free women to live according to their own needs and desires,\u201d Clinton said in a speech at Scripps College in California early in her time as first lady. \u201cI want all women to be given the respect they deserve to have for the choices they may make.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not how it worked. She was criticized by conservatives and other opponents of government health care for being too independent. Almost simultaneously, though, she was criticized by others\u2014even by women from Wellesley\u2014for not being independent enough.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to free women to live according to their own needs and desires,\u201d Clinton said in a speech early in her time as first lady. \u201cI want all women to be given the respect they deserve to have for the choices they may make.\u201d But that\u2019s not how it worked.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou look gorgeous, but I worry about the kind of message your highly publicized \u2018make-over\u2019 may send to young women,\u201d one of her classmates wrote to her in Wellesley\u2019s alumnae magazine in 1993. \u201cTry to maintain your identity as an independent woman.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to the editor in the magazine in 1994, a 1968 graduate and a doctor from Madison, Connecticut, denigrated Clinton as a terrible role model for aspiring young women.\n\n\u201cHillary\u2019s entire career has been a direct result of the fact that she married Bill,\u201d she said. \u201cHer role in the development and politicization of the president\u2019s proposal for the revision of the health care system of the United States is hers not because of any training, experience, or expertise in the field. She holds this position because she is married to the president.\u201d\n\nShe went on: \u201cMy major concern is that young Wellesley women not perceive Hillary as a role model for pursuit of independent careers. If she had political or societal aspirations, which I suspect she did, why did she not have the faith in herself and her Wellesley background to follow them? Why did she make the apparently conscious decision that she could only get where she wanted to by riding on her husband\u2019s coattails?\u201d\n\nA 1985 graduate who was a lawyer in Washington concurred, mailing in a similar censure\u2014comparing Clinton, unfavorably, to Madeleine Albright, another Wellesley graduate who then was the United States ambassador to the United Nations and three years away from becoming the first female secretary of state. \u201cMadeleine Korbel Albright,\u201d the woman wrote, \u201cdeserves respect because she has built her expertise over several years of being good at what she does. The first lady is good at what she does, too\u2014that is, she is good at being a politician\u2019s wife \u2026 \u201d\n\nIn fact, in major national health care reform, Bill Clinton couldn\u2019t have given his wife a more daunting, politically demanding task. And when it faltered, after Republicans had made her a singular subject of their opposition and ire\u2014attacking it as \u201cHillarycare\u201d\u2014she retreated. She was blamed for the results of the midterm elections of 1994, which were disastrous for Democrats. And she again made the accommodations that were required. She was no longer involved in any efforts to write significant legislation. She all but disappeared from the West Wing. It\u2019s what she had to do, she was told, by the public and by pollsters\u2014just like in Arkansas in 1982\u2014to give her husband a chance at reelection.\n\nShe didn\u2019t disappear, and she didn\u2019t turn silent. She used the uncommon platform her position afforded to reach an audience more receptive to her message. Women. Especially overseas.\n\nShe went in the spring of 1995 on a tour of South Asia, where she gave speeches on women\u2019s rights. \u201cWomen,\u201d she said in India, \u201chave to be responsible for our own lives and our own futures ... \u201d\n\nThat fall, she accepted an invitation to go to China, to attend the fourth United Nations\u2019 World Conference on Women. \u201cI want to push the envelope as far as I can when it comes to women\u2019s rights and human rights,\u201d she told her speechwriter, Lissa Muscatine, Muscatine told biographer Cynthia Levinson.\n\nIt was time, she said, to speak up\u2014and she did, in a bold new way. Clinton, not typically known for soaring oratory, delivered in Beijing one of the most resonant lines of any of her many speeches.\n\n\u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights,\u201d she said, \u201cand women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d\n\nIt vaulted her once and for all onto an international stage.\n\nBack home, though, she remained angry and frustrated. About the failure of health care. About her diminished participation in that portion of the administration.\n\n\u201cShe did substantive work as first lady,\u201d Caputo said, \u201cbut she did it within a box with a label of \u2018first lady\u2019 attached to it.\u201d\n\nIt was \u201cnot easy,\u201d Verveer said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an understatement.\u201d\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day in 1996, a few weeks after her husband\u2019s reelection, she called her best friend Diane Blair, according to Blair\u2019s notes, which are in the archives of the University of Arkansas. She vented. She had returned recently from another trip, to Thailand and Australia, where she had given speeches at schools for girls. \u201cShe knows this is important to do, but still frustrated,\u201d Blair wrote in her notes. Blair told Clinton, she said, it was difficult \u201cbeing a pioneer in an anachronistic role.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has come to the conclusion,\u201d Blair wrote, \u201cthat no matter what she does, she is going to piss off some people, so will just continue to be herself and let everyone else make whatever adjustments they have to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has come to the conclusion,\u201d Blair wrote, \u201cthat no matter what she does, she is going to piss off some people, so will just continue to be herself and let everyone else make whatever adjustments they have to.\u201d\n\nClinton, though, was the one who had made the adjustments. And where had it gotten her? \u201cI know how to compromise,\u201d she told Blair. \u201cI have compromised. I gave up my name, got contact lenses \u2026 \u201d\n\n***\n\n\u201cNow, for the first time,\u201d Clinton said in an interview with Talk magazine, heading into her campaign in New York in 2000 for a seat in the Senate, \u201cI am making my own decisions. I can feel the difference. It is a great relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was freeing,\u201d Verveer told me.\n\nHer comments to Talk were candid, and they were optimistic, too\u2014overly so. It was not nearly so simple.\n\nIt was complicated because of what her husband had done to her, because of what he had done with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office, and because she had chosen to stay. She shared her reasons with Talk, pointing to Bill\u2019s difficult childhood without a father and calling him \u201ca very, very good man\u201d and his adultery \u201ca sin of weakness,\u201d not \u201cmalice.\u201d\n\nAnd it was complicated because by then her innately cautious disposition had only been accentuated and intensified by the ways in which she had gotten to this new stage\u2014the adjustments and the accommodations, the compromises and the concessions, and the incredible national ordeal she had faced. In the most personally sordid White House drama in living memory, her husband had committed a humiliating act of adultery, and had been impeached for lying about it. She was living with the residue of the choices she made and the criticisms that followed.\n\n\u201cMore than a first lady,\u201d went one of her slogans in an early ad in that campaign, but what was clear quickly after her eight years as a White House spouse is that her obstacles hadn\u2019t vanished. In fact, there were fresh ones now\u2014and they were a byproduct of the older obstacles and the choices she had made to overcome them.\n\nWomen had mixed feelings. Older women. Suburban women. Especially women just like her. White. Professional. Baby Boomers. Internal polling, according to Michael Tomasky\u2019s book about the Senate race, Hillary\u2019s Turn, painted a complicated picture. They considered her history and had concluded that she was \u201csmart\u201d but \u201ccold,\u201d \u201csavvy\u201d but \u201cpushy,\u201d \u201ccontrolling\u201d and \u201ccunning\u201d and \u201cback stabbing.\u201d \u201cIndependent\u201d and \u201cself-serving.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get the sense that she doesn\u2019t think like a woman,\u201d one woman told the pollsters. \u201cShe thinks like a man.\u201d And they held against her her reactions to his infidelity. \u201cI\u2019m upset at her for not taking a stand,\u201d one woman said. Once again, she was taking fire for not being traditional enough\u2014too manly in her thinking\u2014and for being too traditional, by heeding a wedding vow.\n\n\n\nOnce again, she was taking fire for not being traditional enough\u2014too manly in her thinking\u2014and for being too traditional, by heeding a wedding vow.\n\n\n\nSo it was surprising when she won in a landslide, 55 percent to 43 percent\u2014and by 20 percent with women\u2014and the race banked that way, most analysts agreed, because of two things that happened at the first debate. Her first debate ever. The moderator, Tim Russert, asked her aggressively about Lewinsky, and her opponent, Rick Lazio, bolstered a point he was trying to make by walking across the stage, toward her, closer and closer and into her personal space. Both moments, it turned out, made her seem vulnerable, and in a way that changed minds of women who watched.\n\nThe ambivalence ebbed and flowed over the years since but never totally went away. \u201cIt seems wildly tragic that we know she could have been president if she had just not even married him,\u201d one woman, an unidentified Wellesley grad, told Carl Bernstein for his biography, A Woman in Charge, which came out in 2007\u2014the year Clinton announced she was running for president. It was an echo, though more forgiving, of the letters in the alumnae magazine from 1994. \u201cIn fact,\u201d this woman said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to think of a sadder example of a person who couldn\u2019t quite give up the old ideas. Her way of moving toward electoral politics was to marry someone who was going to run.\u201d\n\nNow, though, she had run for herself. But the lesson of vulnerability from 2000 hadn\u2019t stuck. In advance of her first presidential campaign, longtime Clinton pollster Mark Penn cautioned her against running basically as too much of a woman, a recommendation she was plenty ready to follow. She had learned by this point that calling attention to oneself as a woman had a way of creating problems.\n\n\u201cMost voters in essence see the president as the \u2018father\u2019 of the country,\u201d Penn wrote in his memo on the subject. \u201cThey do not want someone who would be the first mama \u2026 \u201d\n\nIt informed one of her stock phrases in her stump speeches: \u201cI am not running because I\u2019m a woman.\u201d\n\nThroughout 2007, Anne Kornblut wrote in her book Notes from the Cracked Ceiling, Clinton talked about gender \u201cin the most inoffensive conceivable way.\u201d\n\nWhen she gave a speech at Wellesley that year in November, she couldn\u2019t avoid the topic given the location. The campaign passed out T-shirts to students that announced, \u201cI can be president, too.\u201d \u201cIn so many ways, this all-women\u2019s college prepared me to compete in the all boys\u2019 club of presidential politics,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe need to shatter that highest glass ceiling. We can make history.\u201d It came off as staged, stilted and half-hearted.\n\nOnly in the following February, after Obama had won the Iowa caucus, after she had ceded to him the territory of a historic candidacy, after Clinton had run as stubbornly strong and stern, did she crack, just a little. She hadn\u2019t lost to Obama only in Iowa\u2014she had come in third, losing to John Edwards, too. She was trailing in polls. And a woman at a cafe in New Hampshire asked her a question. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d Marianne Pernold Young, 64 at the time, asked Clinton. The candidate paused. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d she said, as her voice wavered and her eyes began to get teary. It was a rare sign of vulnerability\u2014and, as had been the case at the debate in New York, she was rewarded. She won the primary the next day. Women had supported her in a big way. Obama\u2019s win in Iowa had been hailed as historic, even though he was not the first black man to have won a presidential primary\u2014that was Jessie Jackson, in 1988\u2014and here Clinton\u2019s win in New Hampshire was covered as a resuscitation of her horse-race hopes. It was the first time a woman had won a major presidential primary, in any state in this country, ever.\n\nThe news media didn\u2019t dwell on that. But neither did she, until the very end.\n\nHer concession speech was different than all of her speeches on the stump. \u201cOn a personal note,\u201d she said in June 2008 at the National Building Museum in Washington, \u201cwhen I was asked what it means to be a woman running for president, I always gave the same answer, that I was proud to be running as a woman, but I was running because I thought I\u2019d be the best president.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she said.\n\nThe crowd cheered.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she said again.\n\nThis was new. The but was new.\n\n\u201cI am a woman,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cand, like millions of women, I know there are still barriers and biases out there, often unconscious. And I want to build an America that respects and embraces the potential of every last one of us. I ran as a daughter who benefited from opportunities my mother never dreamed of. I ran as a mother who worries about my daughter\u2019s future \u2026 \u201d\n\nMore cheers.\n\n\u201cAs we gather here today in this historic, magnificent building, the 50th woman to leave this Earth is orbiting overhead,\u201d she said, an unconscious nod perhaps to her long-ago letter to NASA. \u201cIf we can blast 50 women into space, we will someday launch a woman into the White House.\u201d\n\nAnd still more cheers.\n\n\u201cAlthough we weren\u2019t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it\u2019s got about 18 million cracks in it,\u201d she said, referring to the number of votes she amassed in the primaries, \u201cand the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope, and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been, of course. \u201cI\u2019m With Her,\u201d reads one of her slogans, but throughout this campaign, on stickers, shirts, signs and hats, she has been called a bitch and a witch and worse. Even back toward the end of the primary season, as she and Donald Trump began to zero in on each other, he was the one to call particular attention to the fact that she is female. \u201cThe only thing she\u2019s got is the woman card,\u201d he said in late April after she pledged that half her Cabinet would be women. To which she responded: \u201cWell, if fighting for women\u2019s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.\u201d Her campaign started selling \u201cWoman Cards.\u201d In the general election, which has turned into a referendum on the treatment of women, Clinton has picked her spots to condemn Trump\u2019s vulgar sexist comments and alleged harassment and assault. At times, though, she has seemed hesitant, still, to speak out about it too much or too loud. It\u2019s \u201cnot how she\u2019s running,\u201d Verveer said. \u201cShe\u2019s running based on her achievements and who she is\u2014and she happens to be a woman.\u201d Over these past few anxious, angry, vile months, as she\u2019s gotten closer and closer to the Oval Office, Clinton often has relied on this front on highly effective surrogates. The most forceful, most memorable repudiations of her opponent\u2019s lengthy record of crude misogyny have come from Elizabeth Warren and Michelle Obama.\n\n\u201cTake a good look at her,\u201d Nancy Wanderer told her mother about her friend after Hillary Rodham finished her speech at commencement at Wellesley in May 1969, \u201cbecause she will probably be president of the United States someday.\u201d\n\nNever, though, would Wanderer have predicted her path to this point. Not Wanderer or any of her contemporaries or classmates who thought this was a possible destination for her almost half a century back.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d friend Ann Sentilles said.\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said Kris Olson. \u201cI never would have thought she would\u2019ve gone down to Arkansas.\u201d\n\nOr taken the name of a husband who would go on to become president first.\n\nIn conversations, though, with many of them over the past couple weeks, they all agreed: This, in the end, is probably how it had to be. A woman who operated purely as a feminist would have condemned herself to fighting a permanently outside fight. And a woman who never tested the limits of the role she agreed to play\u2014tested it over and over\u2014wouldn\u2019t have built the thick skin and the savvy needed to keep going.\n\n\u201cThose experiences and changes she made to forge a path are so reflective of women of her generation,\u201d said Sally McMillen, a 1966 Wellesley grad who recently retired as a professor of history, and women\u2019s history, at Davidson College in North Carolina. \u201cI have always maintained that our generation was the transition generation for women, pulled by traditions but grabbing for new opportunities as we could\u2014constant compromises and even reinventing ourselves as needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if she hadn\u2019t made some of those compromises along the way, she probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten as far as she has,\u201d said Suzanne Salomon, a classmate who lived in the same dorm on the same hall. \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t done some compromising along the way, she wouldn\u2019t be where she is today.\u201d\n\n\n\nPractical, pragmatic, ambitious women do what they have to do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt would be hard to find a woman our age who hasn\u2019t done these things to achieve what she\u2019s wanted to achieve,\u201d Sentilles said. \u201cPractical, pragmatic, ambitious women do what they have to do.\u201d\n\nThose who have worked alongside Clinton from Arkansas to Washington and beyond feel the same way.\n\n\u201cA lot of this is timing,\u201d said Caputo, her old White House press secretary. \u201cShe\u2019s been a transitional figure in our history. And I think that causes one to have to do a difficult navigation with each twist and turn because you\u2019re paving new ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou learn to adopt a more practical approach,\u201d Verveer said, \u201cto get done what you want to get done.\u201d\n\nWanderer, like so many of the women who have known her the longest, has watched her throughout.\n\n\u201cShe made her choices, just as we all do,\u201d she said. \u201cNo woman\u2019s career is straight.\u201d\n\nShe told me she followed along with some annoyance and exasperation as her college classmate made her way through the late \u201870s and the \u201880s and \u201890s, wishing that Clinton hadn\u2019t had to change her look and her name. But she came to understand, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all tried to figure these things out,\u201d she explained. \u201cHow much do we have to change to be acceptable? Can we be fully ourselves?\u201d Over the past decade and a half, she said, ever since Clinton stopped being first lady and started running for the Senate, even though she has remained careful, cautious and even wary, and cresting with this campaign, now closing in on Election Day, Wanderer has observed the self-possessed student she once knew re-emerge. \u201cThe old Hillary Rodham,\u201d she said. And last month, Wanderer, who lives in Maine, drove to New Hampshire for a rally. Her friend was introduced to the crowd. They said Clinton. She saw, underneath it all, Rodham.",
