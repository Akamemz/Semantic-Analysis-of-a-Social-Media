In one, Trump asked McGahn to remove Mueller and then, later, the president asked McGahn to cover up the earlier request.\n\nVote expected Tuesday\n\nNadler's committee has voted on contempt and, on Tuesday, the matter goes before all the members of the House. If the measure passes, it will authorize a civil lawsuit on behalf of the House.\n\nCommittee chairmen and women also would become empowered to file their own lawsuits in order to seek documents or testimony in investigations into Trump and administration officials.\n\nDemocrats are expected to support it. Republicans, who are a minority in the House, will oppose it. In fact, some Republicans may walk out in protest.\n\nWhat is contempt?\n\nA committee can issue a subpoena that's supposed to force a witness to give information or appear to testify. If a subject still doesn't agree, then that committee, or the full chamber, can find them in contempt.\n\nBut it isn't like a finding of contempt in court, in which a judge can order someone jailed if she or he won't cooperate. Capitol Police officers probably will not kick down Barr's door and haul him off to jail. Instead, the contempt vote means the House can file a lawsuit in which it asks a judge to order Barr to comply.\n\nWhy aren't Barr and McGahn cooperating?\n\nSeveral reasons. The attorney general says the Justice Department has made as many accommodations as it can to permit members of Congress to see the parts of Mueller's report that were withheld from public view. Beyond that, the department says, Democrats are just picking a fight.\n\nSpecifically, federal regulations require the DOJ to keep grand jury material secret, Barr argues \u2014 even from Congress.\n\nPolitics also is at play, naturally: Barr is an ally of the president.

So he's standing fast.\n\nWhat do the members in the House say?\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Nadler and others argue that Mueller's office uncovered not only questionable actions, but criminal activity by Trump \u2014 alleged obstruction of justice in his attempts to frustrate the special counsel investigation.\n\nThe president's refusal to cooperate with investigations and subpoenas also could be an \"impeachable offense,\" Pelosi has said.\n\nDemocrats' disagreements\n\nDemocrats, however, are divided among themselves about what action to take.\n\nSome in the House support an inquiry that could lead to impeachment, the procedure by which Congress can remove a president from office. Presidents have been impeached before but never removed.\n\nPelosi is trying to both placate her most liberal members and keep mindful that many mainstream voters do not support impeachment. The Senate, meanwhile, remains under the control of Republicans. In impeachment, the House serves as a grand jury that recommends whether a president should be tried in the Senate, in proceedings overseen by the chief justice of the United States.\n\nTrump enjoys support in the Senate\n\nRepublicans in the Senate probably would not vote to remove Trump from office. Some of Trump's supporters, in fact, believe that any impeachment process that did not result in removing Trump would be perceived as a victory for him \u2014 and a rebuke of Democrats.\n\nSo what Pelosi has chosen, in so many words, is a strategy in which Democrats try to inflict as much political punishment on Trump as they can short of impeachment, including with inquiries like the one that has brought the House to the brink of this week's contempt vote.\n\nSome critics of Trump and Pelosi argue that the president's actions have been so egregious that the Congress has a duty under the Constitution to hold him to account irrespective of the political consequences for either side.\n\nHas this ever happened before?\n\nBig disputes often flare up when one or both houses of Congress are controlled by the party opposite from the one that holds the White House.
