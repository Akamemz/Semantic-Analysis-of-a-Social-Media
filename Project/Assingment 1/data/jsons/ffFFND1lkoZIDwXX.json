    "content": "In late May of 2008 , there was a bit of a misunderstanding that briefly blew the tent off the circus that was the Democratic primary . The context was an interview where Hillary Clinton responded to criticism from unnamed Obama advisers ( hi , guys ) who accused her of dragging on a contest that had become virtually unwinnable : \u201c My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June , right ? And we all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California . \u201d\nNow , it \u2019 s clear with the benefit of eight years \u2019 hindsight that Hillary was merely pointing out that plenty of other primaries had lasted until June . I find it hard to believe that \u201c Hillary cites RFK assassination in explaining why she \u2019 s still in race \u201d was the headline that the Clinton brain trust was hoping for that day . I don \u2019 t think it was on the message calendar .\nTry telling that to 2008 Me . I was outraged . My colleagues were outraged . In fact , we reveled in our outrage , which is what both campaigns did best back then ( for laughs , we still send around timeless YouTube classics such as \u201c Your Slumlord Rezko , \u201d \u201c Change You Can Xerox , \u201d \u201c Talking Like She \u2019 s Annie Oakley , \u201d and my favorite , \u201c He Just Said Cocaine ! \u201d )\nAt that moment , however , a cooler head ( Barack Obama \u2019 s ) prevailed . Our statement referred to Clinton \u2019 s comments as \u201c unfortunate , \u201d she apologized , and we all moved on . Why ? Because both campaigns understood that it was time to stop ripping each other apart and turn to the greater , shared goal of denying Republicans a third term in the White House .\nEight years later , we \u2019 re approaching the endgame of another Democratic primary . For Bernie Sanders to overtake Hillary Clinton \u2019 s lead in pledged delegates\u2014which , at 239 , is more than double Obama \u2019 s 112-delegate lead in 2008\u2014he would have to win each of the remaining contests by about 18 points , a margin he has only reached in Vermont and New Hampshire . If he doesn \u2019 t , his only other option is to convince a few hundred superdelegates to back the candidate who has won fewer votes and fewer delegates .\nBernie faces long odds , but no good reason to drop out . And why should he ? Why not keep running through the final primaries in June , just like Hillary did in 2008 ? Along the way , Sanders will probably win a few more states\u2014especially in May\u2014and continue to build a following that should hearten everyone who wants to see a bigger , bolder progressive movement .\nBut it \u2019 s also in the interest of the progressive moment for both candidates and their campaigns to begin healing the rifts that have deepened over the course of the primary . Neither Sanders nor Clinton seemed very compelling when they were screaming at each other for two hours at the debate in Brooklyn . And no one benefits from another three months of ridiculous lawsuits , overwrought fundraising emails , and surrogates sniping at each other on cable . Already , this friendly fire has taken a toll\u2014in the latest NBC/WSJ poll , Bernie is viewed unfavorably by 20 percent of Clinton supporters , and Hillary is viewed unfavorably by 40 percent of Sanders supporters .\nI don \u2019 t want to exaggerate the challenge . I still think this primary is less nasty and divisive than 2008 , and exponentially less so than the cannibalism we may see in Cleveland . It \u2019 s also true that the percentage of Sanders and Clinton voters who say they won \u2019 t vote for the other candidate is fairly low . But a year in which Donald Trump or Ted Cruz could become president of the United States is not a year we can afford to have any pissed-off primary voters stay home in November .\nI \u2019 ve been on a campaign that was in a position similar to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s , and I \u2019 ve been on a campaign that had to reconcile with Hillary Clinton . So , for what it \u2019 s worth ( and I realize the answer may be a resounding \u201c not much , go to hell \u201d ) , here \u2019 s my advice to both sides :\nYou \u2019 re on the verge of winning . Do so gracefully . The burden of bringing the party together falls more heavily on its future leader . Hillary \u2019 s line in her New York primary night speech , \u201c I believe that there is much more that unites us than divides us , \u201d was a good start . I \u2019 d go further , though .\nIt \u2019 s not enough to just thank Sen. Sanders and his supporters . Show that you hear them ; that you \u2019 ve learned from them ; that they \u2019 ve made you a better candidate , and will make you a better president . Recognize what Bernie has achieved by speaking passionately about issues of economic inequality , and the gross amount of political money that gives a louder voice to richer people . Celebrate the fact that he \u2019 s inspired so many people to pay attention to politics for the first time\u2014especially young people , who you should work even harder to reach . Consider offering Sanders a prime-time speaking slot at the convention , and choosing an unapologetic progressive as vice president .\nFinally , don \u2019 t attack . And if Sanders surrogates or supporters attack , turn the other cheek . Be the bigger campaign . Don \u2019 t allow yourselves to get baited . Don \u2019 t drop snarky background quotes with reporters . Don \u2019 t allow every perceived slight and controversy to get to you ( like I did in 2008 ) . Don \u2019 t engage with the Bernie Bros ( like I did last weekend ) . Persuade the persuadables , turn your fire on the Republicans , and focus on Hillary \u2019 s vision for the future . You \u2019 re almost there .\nI know , I know\u2014I \u2019 m supporting Hillary Clinton . But there was also a time when I couldn \u2019 t imagine myself liking or voting for her . Maybe you don \u2019 t believe that she \u2019 s different from the caricature we \u2019 ve all helped perpetuate . But she is running a campaign with a policy platform that \u2019 s more progressive than her husband \u2019 s administration , her 2008 campaign , and\u2014in a few cases\u2014Barack Obama \u2019 s administration .\nGuess what ? Bernie Sanders helped make that happen . He helped push Hillary Clinton to the left . And he should keep pushing her if she becomes president .\nI don \u2019 t think Bernie should stop pointing out where he and Hillary disagree , or pull back on his criticism of the way money influences politics , but I do think he should start repeating a line that he \u2019 s already said once before : \u201c On her worst day , Hillary Clinton is a hundred times better than any of the Republicans . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s important for Bernie \u2019 s supporters to know that he believes this undeniable truth . It \u2019 s important for them to hear Sanders say that while he \u2019 ll keep fighting for a more progressive Democratic Party , the Democratic Party has been a vehicle for tremendous progress in this country\u2014especially over the last eight years . Denying or minimizing the achievements of the Obama presidency only deepens the cynicism of those who worry that change isn \u2019 t possible .\nPrimaries are often a clash of personalities and magnified policy differences . A general election is much different . The Democratic nominee will face a Republican who is more extreme , more dangerous , and more unpopular than any presidential candidate in history . A campaign against Donald Trump or Ted Cruz won \u2019 t just be a mission to save our country from something terrible , it will be an opportunity to elect a progressive majority and a progressive president who could tip the balance of the Supreme Court for a generation .\nSo keep your passion , your energy , and even your outrage .
