    "content": "The U.S. Treasury Department told Congress on Wednesday it will remove sanctions imposed on three Russian companies tied to an oligarch .\nThe companies\u2014aluminum giant United Co. Rusal PLC , its parent EN+ Group PLC and JSC EuroSibEnergo , a Russian energy company\u2014were put on the U.S. sanctions list in April because of their ownership or control by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska .\nMr. Deripaska remains under sanctions , but the companies agreed to a sweeping deal centered on severing his ties with them that will result in their removal from the blacklist , the Treasury said .\nThe removals , expected to take place in 30 days , are based on a change in factual circumstances \u201c in line with longstanding U.S. sanctions precedent \u201d that \u201c is not intended to significantly alter U.S. foreign policy , \u201d the Treasury said in a letter to Congress .\nThe removals come as the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions against 15 Russian agents , including a former Russian intelligence officer who the U.S. said reports to Mr. Deripaska and led business negotiations on his behalf .\nThe Treasury had issued licenses at least six times since April , allowing the companies to continue operating while they worked with the U.S. government to reach a satisfactory divestment plan . The deal would be a binding agreement between the companies and the Office of Foreign Assets Control , the Treasury \u2019 s sanctions office , the department said .\nThe agreement requires Mr. Deripaska to reduce his ownership stake in EN+ to 44.95 % from 70 % , and he is prohibited from increasing his stake . And in reducing his stake , Mr. Deripaska won \u2019 t receive cash for his shares nor from future dividends issued by the companies , according to the agreement .\nEN+ is \u201c the linchpin \u201d underlying the sanctions designations on all three companies , the letter said , because Mr. Deripaska has virtually no direct ownership in Rusal and none at all in EuroSibEnergo .\n\u201c These latest developments mark an important milestone \u201d in EN+ Group \u2019 s efforts to be removed from the sanctions list , the company said in a statement Thursday . The company also cautioned that Congress could still seek amendments to the conditions that could be \u201c material in nature. \u201d EuroSibEnergo could n't be reached for comment .\nThe agreement also requires sweeping governance changes . Mr. Deripaska \u2019 s voting rights in EN+ will be limited . EN+ will create a 12-person board mostly independent of him and he will be bound to commitments severing his ability to control the company . In addition , EN+ and Rusal agreed to a number of transparency measures , including the provision to the Treasury of quarterly earnings reports , board minutes and notifications of any change in board composition .\nEN+ will continue to control Rusal , according to the agreement , through a 56.88 % stake , and it will retain the right to nominate the chief executive . EN+ also will use that majority control to create a 14-person board , most of whom will have no ties to Mr. Deripaska . And Rusal \u2019 s current chairman will step down ; the new chair will be held by one of the new directors .\nEuroSibEnergo , which is wholly owned by EN+ , will provide the Treasury with monthly certifications they are not acting on behalf of Mr. Deripaska .\nThe companies will face severe consequences if they fail to comply with the agreement , including being put back on the sanctions list , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement .\n\u201c OFAC maintains the ability under the terms of the agreement to have unprecedented levels of transparency into operations , \u201d he said .\nThe deal provides a road map for other companies to pursue sanctions removal if they \u2019 re not actively involved in illicit conduct , said David Murray , a vice president at consulting firm Financial Integrity Network who previously served as the director of Treasury \u2019 s illicit finance office .\n\u201c What we have is an outline of expectations that OFAC may have for other companies targeted solely because they \u2019 re owned or controlled by someone on the sanctions list , \u201d Mr. Murray said .\nAluminum prices , which fell to a 16-month low before the sanctions announcement was made Wednesday , could head lower once the sanctions are lifted .\nSome analysts had predicted aluminum prices would rise again in 2019 , based in part on the sanctions against Rusal , the world \u2019 s second-largest aluminum producer .\n\u201c If ( the sanctions ) had not been solved , at least half of Rusal \u2019 s production would have had to shut down , \u201d said Lloyd O \u2019 Carroll , an independent analyst for the metals industry . \u201c That \u2019 s not happening now . \u201d",
