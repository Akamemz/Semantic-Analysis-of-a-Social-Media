Many House Republicans were skeptical of the plan while GOP members in the Senate said it was dead on arrival if it ever got to the upper chamber .\nIn April 2017 , President Trump Donald John TrumpFederal judge halts California law targeting Trump tax returns Trump agriculture chief : No guarantee small farms can survive Harris presses Twitter to 'do something ' over Trump 's 'coup ' tweet MORE huddled with his senior advisers on strategy . The White House was poised to release its own plan and the president 's team was debating whether they should hit the brakes . The one-page blueprint notably didn \u2019 t include border adjustment and there was some discussion of postponing release of the White House proposal .\n\u201c No , we 're moving forward , \u201d Trump said , according to a senior White House official . \u201c It 's time to move forward . \u201d\nThe White House 's action was the beginning of the end for the border adjustment idea , which attracted intense criticism from retailers and influential GOP donors Charles and David Koch .\nTrump \u2019 s plan \u201c broke the gridlock \u201d on border adjustment , the senior White House aide said .\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyTrump congratulates China on anniversary as GOP lawmakers decry communist rule \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Morning Report - Giuliani subpoenaed as Trump rages against Schiff , whistleblower Ocasio-Cortez blasts McCarthy as a 'bumbling , sloppy , dishonest mess ' over Trump defense MORE ( R-Calif. ) said he didn \u2019 t think the proposal would ever get off the ground .\n\u201c Paul [ Ryan ] was always for that , but I never felt that had the votes to pass , \u201d McCarthy told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nGary Cohn Gary David CohnTrump says US will hit China with new round of tariffs next month Gary Cohn bemoans 'dramatic impact ' of Trump tariffs Press : Acosta , latest to walk the plank MORE , who was Trump 's top economic adviser , said , \u201c We knew talking to Senate leadership there were virtually no votes in the Senate for a border-adjusted tax . \u201d\nOver the past several months , \u2588\u2588\u2588 has interviewed dozens of Trump administration officials , lawmakers , aides and stakeholders to report the behind-the-scenes stories of the most sweeping changes to the tax codes in decades .\nThe tax cuts are both Trump \u2019 s biggest legislative achievement to date and the most important bill passed during the retiring Ryan \u2019 s Speakership . Republicans promised they would further unshackle a growing economy , and they have been rewarded with economic growth of 4.2 percent in the second quarter of this year .\nBut the tax cuts have not paid big political dividends for Republicans to date , and there is a growing pile of evidence that suggests Democrats are winning the current political debate over the measure . A poll commissioned by the Republican National Committee on Trump 's tax law , obtained and published by Bloomberg last week , found that most voters say the tax law benefits corporations and wealthy individuals more than the middle class . The analysis on the poll concluded that the GOP has \u201c lost the messaging battle on the issue . \u201d\nOver the next week , \u2588\u2588\u2588 will delve into how a GOP tax bill evolved into a blockbuster legislative package that effectively ended the ObamaCare mandate that all Americans buy health insurance and opened a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to drilling .\nIt will examine how the law is playing out in the battle for Congress and the 2018 midterm elections , and how the legislative debate uniquely reflects the Trump era in Washington .\nFrustrated with the constant delays from the GOP-led Congress and its ultimate failure to repeal ObamaCare , Trump played a more hands-on role with taxes , according to several of his top advisers .\nHe constantly worked the phones , trying to nudge on-the-fence Republicans to get to `` yes .

And while Trump for the most part did n't make public remarks that surprised congressional Republicans who were working on the tax package , there were times when he weighed in on Twitter .\nIn fall of last year , lobbyists started hearing that Republicans were considering a sharp cut in pre-tax 401 ( k ) contribution limits . The idea immediately attracted negative media attention .\nAt 7:42 a.m on Oct. 23 , 2017 , Trump buried the idea with one tweet : \u201c There will be NO change to your 401 ( k ) . This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works , and it stays ! \u201d\nStill , the GOP-controlled Congress wrote the bill and rejected some ideas coming out of the White House such as then-Trump aide Stephen Bannon 's idea to increase taxes on the wealthy \u2014 which would have never gotten the votes to pass .\nIn the end , the bill Trump signed a few days before Christmas was in many ways a traditional Republican tax-cut measure .

And for the first time since 2006 , Republicans controlled the White House and Congress .\nFor years , Republicans had been pushing a revenue neutral tax reform and the Ryan/Brady border adjustment plan , first proposed in June 2016 as part of the Speaker \u2019 s \u201c Better Way \u201d agenda , would raise $ 1 trillion to pay for the entire package . Specifically , the Better Way plan aimed to stop companies from moving their headquarters , jobs and intellectual property overseas by pairing territoriality with a \u201c border adjustment \u201d provision to tax imports and exempt exports . Under the border adjustment proposal , goods consumed in the U.S. would be subject to U.S. taxes no matter where they are made .\nThe problem was it never had a chance to pass .\nSen.

The idea went over like a lead balloon .\n\u201c It was obvious to me after that retreat in Philadelphia , when I stood up and explained it to my Republican colleagues , \u201d Toomey said . \u201c I was not pitching it as an advocate but I was saying , \u2018 Here \u2019 s the mechanism , here \u2019 s the argument for it , \u2019 and everybody immediately said , \u2018 Oh my God , it \u2019 s going to destroy importers and retailers . \u2019\nToomey added that the hostility to the border adjustment proposal was \u201c widespread and very vociferous . \u201d\n\u201c It was immediately clear to me this has no chance of surviving , \u201d Toomey recalled . \u201c That also underscored , of course , the need for this to not be revenue neutral . That was a trillion dollars worth of revenue that in the House [ plan ] is not going to happen . \u201d\nSen. David Perdue ( R-Ga. ) , one of the earliest senators to come out against the proposal , said that he thought House members \u2019 explanation of why the border tax would work was \u201c not correct . \u201d\n\u201c There were a lot of people that didn \u2019 t know a lot about border adjustment tax , and once we had that kind of open dialogue in Congress , you saw a lot of people sort of gravitating to be against it , \u201d he said .\nIn February 2017 , Sen.

''\nRetailers mobilized quickly to advocate against the proposal because they were worried it would lead to higher prices on goods . By the end of February , retailers were confident that there were enough senators who opposed the tax to torpedo the idea .\nEven on the House side \u2014 and within the Ways and Means Committee \u2014 there were concerns with the proposal .\nIn summer 2016 , GOP Reps.

Kelly , a car dealership owner , said he started thinking about Monroney labels , which are stickers on new cars that mention the percentage of parts made in various countries . Kelly brought in the Monroney labels to show lawmakers that fall as part of an effort to express concerns about how a border adjustment tax might increase the price of cars .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not talking about dollars , we \u2019 re talking about thousands of dollars , \u201d Kelly said .\nIn March 2017 , Kelly went on TV and publicly came out against the tax . He told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he would never have been able to get to `` yes '' on the proposal .\nRenacci , who is running for the Senate , expressed reservations about the tax early on . He worried that it would hurt businesses in his state .\n\u201c I was willing to listen , \u201d he said . \u201c I was not comfortable with the border adjustment tax but I was not writing it off entirely . I had asked for a hearing at one point in time so we could get some outside information . \u201d\nBut at some point , Renacci said , he made it \u201c public within the family \u201d that he wouldn \u2019 t support the plan .\nFor the most part , Brady and Ryan stood firm in support of their proposal .\n\u201c We talked to Ryan and Brady frequently , we talked to their staffs frequently . They weren \u2019 t budging , \u201d said David French , senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation .\nClub for Growth President David McIntosh said Ryan and Brady were \u201c completely tone deaf \u201d to the arguments against the tax .\nBut a former senior House GOP aide countered that both legislators were open to letting go of the border plan if there was a viable alternative .\nRyan and Brady had hoped Trump would endorse it , but the White House was careful with what they said about the plan publicly . And behind the scenes , various Trump aides were divided about the proposal .\n\u201c It was too controversial to find 51 Republican senators to support that , '' former White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c So there is a policy argument about it , but there was also just the political reality that we can debate this all night long , but it 's not going to get 51 votes . So , why are we continuing to kick this around ? ''\nCohn opposed the border tax and opponents of the proposal got the sense from their meetings with him that he was in their corner .\nTrump held a series of meetings on an array of topics with business leaders during the early months of his presidency , including with retailers and major exporters .\nOn Feb. 15 , 2017 , Trump huddled with more than a half dozen retail CEOs . When one executive in the room said the border adjustment tax would make the company \u2019 s tax rate 120 percent , Trump replied something along the lines of , \u201c That \u2019 s not good , \u201d according to Brian Dodge , senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association , who was briefed on the meeting .\nExecutives who attended the meeting came away with the strong sense that Trump knew the difference between tariffs , which he was interested in , and Ryan \u2019 s idea . The president \u201c was not embracing border adjustment tax at that point , and ... we had an opportunity to keep the White House from embracing the idea , \u201d Dodge said .\n`` The president did n't support it . He made it very clear , and so , you know , that was initially a big part of paying for the bill . And ultimately he became very clear that was n't going to be in the bill , \u201d House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( R-La . ) said . \u201c And so Brady and his team went back to work . ''\nShortly before the White House 's one-page plan was unveiled in April 2017 , Mnuchin and Cohn briefed several groups about it . Mnuchin first gave a \u201c long , careful \u201d answer about why the Ryan/Brady provision wasn \u2019 t in the plan . Then Cohn said , \u201c It \u2019 s dead , \u201d a key source stated .\nAfter months of pushback on the tax from lawmakers , retailers and conservative groups , Brady proposed phasing in the proposal over five years . But that didn \u2019 t ease any of the opponents \u2019 concerns .\nBrady subsequently convened a hearing on the topic in May 2017 , which some involved in the tax process viewed as a turning point .\nBesides Renacci and Kelly , Tiberi and Rep. Erik Paulsen Erik Philip PaulsenTwo swing-district Democrats raise impeachment calls after whistleblower reports Hopes dim for passage of Trump trade deal Fight over Trump 's new NAFTA hits key stretch MORE ( R-Minn. ) , one of Brady \u2019 s roommates , expressed concerns about the concept at the hearing .\n\u201c Paulsen , that was the first time [ his opposition ] became public , \u201d Renacci said .\nDemocrats this fall are targeting Paulsen , whose district was won by Clinton in 2016 . Paulsen has doubled down on the tax cuts and has touted the new law repeatedly in his reelection campaign .\nBrady said he still thinks border adjustability is a \u201c game changing \u201d idea that would \u201c level the playing field for American companies. \u201d He added the plan might have gotten more support if lawmakers had several years to examine it .\nBut Brady said that by about June 2017 , it became clear that the blueprint was dividing the business community and lawmakers .\n\u201c It was clear it needed to be set aside , that we needed to find a way to level the playing field internationally without it , \u201d he said .\nBrady added that he and Ryan did n't shelve it until they got a commitment from the other key tax negotiators that there would be an alternative way to address the erosion of the U.S. tax base .\nThe border adjustment was formally scrapped in July 2017 in a statement released by the \u201c Big Six \u201d \u2014 Ryan , Brady , Mnuchin , Cohn , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison ( Mitch ) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell : Communist Party 's methods a 'tragedy ' for Chinese people Trump congratulates China on anniversary as GOP lawmakers decry communist rule Appeals court upholds net neutrality repeal but rules FCC ca n't block state laws MORE ( R-Ky. ) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchTrump to award racing legend Roger Penske with Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump awards Presidential Medal of Freedom to economist , former Reagan adviser Arthur Laffer Second ex-Senate staffer charged in aiding doxxing of GOP senators MORE ( R-Utah ) .\nRetailers and conservative groups that had focused their energy on killing the plan , switched gears and started to promote an overhaul of the tax code . And Republican lawmakers started to become more productive .\nThe Big Six statement came hours before Senate Republicans \u2019 efforts to repeal ObamaCare fell short . That failure prompted Republicans and outside groups to be even more motivated to enact tax legislation .\nRenacci recalled that when Ways and Means Committee Republicans held a retreat in September , \u201c you could start to see there were some principles that were starting to come forward . There were some agreements starting to be made on many of the issues between members of the Ways and Means Committee , and I think that it started to gel . \u201d\n\u201c I actually think once the border adjustment was taken out of the mix , you started to see this plan starting to gel more and more , \u201d he said .\nMembers of \u2588\u2588\u2588 's staff who have worked on this tax reform series over the past several months are Alexander Bolton , Juliegrace Brufke , Timothy Cama , Jordain Carney , Bob Cusack , Niv Elis , Naomi Jagoda , Mike Lillis , Peter Sullivan , Megan R.

And ultimately he became very clear that wasn't going to be in the bill,\u201d House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said. \u201cAnd so Brady and his team went back to work.\"\n\nShortly before the White House's one-page plan was unveiled in April 2017, Mnuchin and Cohn briefed several groups about it. Mnuchin first gave a \u201clong, careful\u201d answer about why the Ryan/Brady provision wasn\u2019t in the plan. Then Cohn said, \u201cIt\u2019s dead,\u201d a key source stated.\n\nAfter months of pushback on the tax from lawmakers, retailers and conservative groups, Brady proposed phasing in the proposal over five years. But that didn\u2019t ease any of the opponents\u2019 concerns.\n\nBrady subsequently convened a hearing on the topic in May 2017, which some involved in the tax process viewed as a turning point.\n\nBesides Renacci and Kelly, Tiberi and Rep. Erik Paulsen Erik Philip PaulsenTwo swing-district Democrats raise impeachment calls after whistleblower reports Hopes dim for passage of Trump trade deal Fight over Trump's new NAFTA hits key stretch MORE (R-Minn.), one of Brady\u2019s roommates, expressed concerns about the concept at the hearing.\n\n\u201cPaulsen, that was the first time [his opposition] became public,\u201d Renacci said.\n\nDemocrats this fall are targeting Paulsen, whose district was won by Clinton in 2016. Paulsen has doubled down on the tax cuts and has touted the new law repeatedly in his reelection campaign.\n\nBrady said he still thinks border adjustability is a \u201cgame changing\u201d idea that would \u201clevel the playing field for American companies.\u201d He added the plan might have gotten more support if lawmakers had several years to examine it.\n\nBut Brady said that by about June 2017, it became clear that the blueprint was dividing the business community and lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIt was clear it needed to be set aside, that we needed to find a way to level the playing field internationally without it,\u201d he said.\n\nBrady added that he and Ryan didn't shelve it until they got a commitment from the other key tax negotiators that there would be an alternative way to address the erosion of the U.S. tax base.\n\nThe border adjustment was formally scrapped in July 2017 in a statement released by the \u201cBig Six\u201d \u2014 Ryan, Brady, Mnuchin, Cohn, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell: Communist Party's methods a 'tragedy' for Chinese people Trump congratulates China on anniversary as GOP lawmakers decry communist rule Appeals court upholds net neutrality repeal but rules FCC can't block state laws MORE (R-Ky.) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchTrump to award racing legend Roger Penske with Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump awards Presidential Medal of Freedom to economist, former Reagan adviser Arthur Laffer Second ex-Senate staffer charged in aiding doxxing of GOP senators MORE (R-Utah).\n\nRetailers and conservative groups that had focused their energy on killing the plan, switched gears and started to promote an overhaul of the tax code. And Republican lawmakers started to become more productive.\n\nThe Big Six statement came hours before Senate Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal ObamaCare fell short. That failure prompted Republicans and outside groups to be even more motivated to enact tax legislation.\n\nRenacci recalled that when Ways and Means Committee Republicans held a retreat in September, \u201cyou could start to see there were some principles that were starting to come forward. There were some agreements starting to be made on many of the issues between members of the Ways and Means Committee, and I think that it started to gel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually think once the border adjustment was taken out of the mix, you started to see this plan starting to gel more and more,\u201d he said.\n\nMembers of The Hill's staff who have worked on this tax reform series over the past several months are Alexander Bolton, Juliegrace Brufke, Timothy Cama, Jordain Carney, Bob Cusack, Niv Elis, Naomi Jagoda, Mike Lillis, Peter Sullivan, Megan R.
