Ro Khanna ( D-CA ) unveiled on Wednesday legislation that will give substantial tax credits to low- and middle-income Americans . His goals include combating two of the most troublesome aspects of the American economy : income stagnation within the working class and rising instability caused by a shift from secure jobs with benefits to jobs ( or gigs ) lacking them .\nMore broadly , he \u2019 s motivated by surging interest in Silicon Valley in using income redistribution as compensation for the costs imposed on workers by increasing automation .\nThe ambitious proposal from the freshman representative , which could cost $ 1.4 trillion over 10 years , would turbocharge a program that has enjoyed an unusual amount of bipartisan support since it was introduced in 1975 : the Earned Income Tax Credit .\nSen. Sherrod Brown ( D-OH ) will introduce similar legislation in the Senate .\nThe EITC supplements the pay of low-earning households and incentivizes low-income people to work . ( It \u2019 s designed \u201c to make work pay , \u201d as President Bill Clinton famously put it . ) For tax year 2016 , 26 million people received about $ 65.6 billion in credits .\nThe program works by providing refundable credits that begin with a small subsidy for the first dollar of earned income and gradually rise until \u2014 for a two-parent family with two kids \u2014 the subsidy reaches a maximum of about $ 5,600 for an income of $ 14,000 . It stays at that level till income hits about $ 18,300 , then begins to phase out .\nFamilies with three kids get a little more , those with one a little less . Childless families get a very skimpy credit .\nIt 's a little tricky to describe in words ; below is a graph from the Tax Policy Center showing how the current credit phases in and out with various family sizes .\nThe Khanna-Brown proposal , the Grow American Incomes Now Act ( GAIN ) , would roughly double the current EITC for families with two kids , bringing it to a maximum of about $ 10,800 . The proposal would continue the policy of being less generous to childless workers , but it would quintuple their maximum credit , taking it from $ 510 to $ 3,000 .\n`` The large expansion of the EITC I am proposing would compensate for the loss of wages of the bottom 20 percent of wage earners since 1979 , '' Khanna told me , before his official announcement , scheduled for 12:30 pm Wednesday .\nTo give a sense of the level of subsidy we \u2019 re talking about , under Khanna \u2019 s proposal , a family with two kids earning a salary of $ 18,000 would get a credit worth more than $ 10,000 \u2014 a salary bump of some 55 percent .\nKhanna knows the bill is n't likely to pass a Republican-controlled Congress , but he \u2019 s hopeful that it could be serve as the basis of a Democratic plan to tackle inequality and the challenges of the new economy as we head toward the 2020 presidential race .

Now it \u2019 s a major anti-poverty program .\nThe EITC has undertaken an amazing journey from a wonky program introduced as a way to subsidize low-wage earners in the 1970s to one of the pillars of the American welfare state . It lifts an estimated 65 million people out of poverty . And Khanna \u2019 s proposal would take it to an entirely new level .\nThe tax credit enjoys broad bipartisan support : Liberal economists like its impact on reducing poverty through redistribution , while libertarian economists like it both because it spurs some people \u2014 particularly single parents \u2014 to enter the workforce and because it is inexpensive to administer . Overhead costs are under 2 percent , compared to 20 to 25 percent for a program like food stamps .\nThe policy grew out of debates in the 1960s over the best ways to combat poverty . The libertarian economist Milton Friedman championed a negative income tax , which he thought could outright replace many welfare programs of the day . A negative income tax would have , like the EITC , boosted the pay of low-income workers , but it would have gone farther by issuing payments to people with no income . ( It would therefore , unlike the EITC , be a form of guaranteed income . )\nPresident Richard Nixon went so far as to include a negative income tax \u2014 for families with children only \u2014 in his Family Assistance Plan of 1969 . It passed the House but died in the Senate .\nThe idea of a negative income tax was fought by legislators who worried about subsidizing the \u201c undeserving poor \u201d as well as discouraging work . They pushed instead for a \u201c work bonus \u201d that would be reserved only for the employed . The Earned Income Tax Credit was passed and signed under President Gerald Ford . It has been expanded several times since \u2014 most notably during the 1986 tax reform , under President Ronald Reagan , and during President Clinton \u2019 s first term .\nEconomists and other analysts have identified several benefits of the program :\nOne study found that a $ 1,000 increase in the EITC boosts employment a sizable 7 percentage points , and reduces the proportion of families below the poverty level , after taxes and other transfers , by 9.5 percentage points .\nA review of several studies of the effect of the EITC found that its approach of giving low-income parents a cash transfer \u201c produces substantially larger gains in children \u2019 s school achievement per dollar of expenditure than a year of preschool , participation in Head Start , or class size reduction in the early grades . \u201d\nThe liberal think tank Center for American Progress estimates that an EITC increase , even one on a scale much smaller than Khanna \u2019 s , could produce knock-on societal benefits of $ 1.7 to $ 3 billion , including crime reduction .\nThere is a body of research suggesting that giving the poor , or working poor , cash rather than specific services can be a more effective form of support . One longstanding concern about the EITC , however , has been that it delivers its payment in one lump sum , as a tax refund . That could invite splurges ( or lead to challenges with respect to \u201c income smoothing , \u201d in the economic jargon ) . But one study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago found that the poor used their windfall wisely : They bought cars they needed for work , for instance .\n`` Given the crucial role of access to transportation in promoting work , this leads to the conclusion that recipient spending patterns support the program \u2019 s prowork goals , \u201d the study found .\nOn the other hand , some economists find that the EITC discourages work for lower-earning spouses in families that are in the \u201c phase-out \u201d part of the tax-credit curve . It also does not help people who either can \u2019 t find work or whose work involves nonmarket activities , like child care or elder care .\nSome conservative critics point to a fairly high rate of error in EITC claims ( 20 to 25 percent ) , some of which surely includes some fraud : Determining which children count as \u201c qualifying \u201d can be tricky , particularly in nontraditional families , and the IRS is not well equipped to vet such claims .\n\u201c The credit creates a modest increase in workforce participation by single mothers , \u201d write the Cato Institute \u2019 s Chris Edwards and Veronique de Rugy , \u201c but that benefit is outweighed by the work disincentives during the phase-out range , billions of dollars of errors and fraud \u2026 and the damage caused by the higher taxes needed to fund the program. \u201d They conclude that the program should be cut back , not expanded .\nA proposal tailored for modern \u2014 or post-industrial \u2014 economic challenges\nSilicon Valley these days is full of heady talk about basic income programs , spurred by worries about automation , under which the government would guarantee a certain floor salary even for people who can not find work . Khanna \u2019 s program is not a basic income , but it could conceivably be a first step in that direction .\nA vastly bigger EITC would not help if you lost your job to a robot , but it could help if automation relegated you to a lesser-paying job .\n`` Robots and automation may lead to new jobs , but these jobs often pay less or are not unionized or are part time , '' Khanna told me .\nA foreshadowing of the automation trend can be seen in the offices of large tech companies , which tend to produce less employment than a previous generation of employer . Facebook has a workforce roughly 5 percent the size of General Electric \u2019 s , for example ( 17,000 versus 300,000 ) . Uber may have given millions of drivers gainful employment , but they lack the protections of worker benefits .\nKhanna presents his program as combating a range of modern economic ills , with wage stagnation near the top of the list . From 1948 to 1973 , productivity rose by 97 percent and hourly compensation rose about 91 percent , according to the Economic Policy Institute . Over that period , workers were capturing an impressive share of productivity gains .\nFrom 1973 to 2015 , however , productivity slowed a bit , rising at 73 percent , but hourly compensation cratered , rising 11 percent .\nA bigger EITC , or a similar kind of work-conditional cash transfer , could counterbalance some of those losses .\nAndrew McAfee , an MIT economist and author of a new book on automation , Machine , Platform , Crowd , has expressed enthusiasm for a larger EITC . \u201c The EITC is a direct incentive to enter the labor force , and to work more hours \u2014 up to a limit . The research is pretty clear that it works as designed , \u201d he told me . \u201c So I support expanding it : making it both bigger and available to more people . \u201d\nKhanna also presents his plan as a response to the rise of the \u201c gig economy \u201d an issue that overlaps with , but is not identical to , both the automation and wage-stagnation questions . It would help the growing legions of independent contractors , like Uber drivers , who are n't protected by minimum wage laws .\nThe economists Alan Krueger and Lawrence Katz estimate that almost all new net jobs have come in the gig economy , expanding from roughly 9 million to 14 million jobs between 2005 and 2014 .
