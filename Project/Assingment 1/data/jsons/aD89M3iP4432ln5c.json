    "content": "Gabrielle Giffords , founder of the eponymous gun control group Giffords , blames Congress for the shooting that killed five people at a newspaper in Annapolis , Maryland , yesterday . But it 's not clear what Congress should or could have done to prevent the shotgun attack on the Capital Gazette by a man with a longstanding grudge against the paper .\n`` Reporters should n't have to hide from gunfire while doing their jobs , '' says Giffords , a former U.S. representative who was gravely injured in a 2011 shooting that left six people dead in Tucson . `` A summer intern in the newsroom should n't have to tweet for help . We should n't have to live in a country where our lawmakers refuse to take any action to address this uniquely American crisis that 's causing so much horror and heartbreak on what feels like a daily basis . '' But Giffords ' indictment of her former colleagues does not identify any legislation they could have enacted that would have made a difference for the victims of yesterday 's attack :\nTime and time again , those representing us in Congress have failed to show the courage we need to keep us safe . Bump stocks are still legal . Background checks are still not mandatory for all gun sales . Americans are demanding that their lawmakers pass effective laws that can protect our communities and stop dangerous people from accessing guns , but this Congress refuses to listen . We should be outraged . And we should be making plans to hold them accountable . I 'm ready to stand with voters and make our voices heard loud and clear in November .\nBump stocks , which the Trump administration plans to ban by creatively reinterpreting federal law , played no role in yesterday 's crime or any other mass shooting , with the exception of last year 's attack in Las Vegas ( and it 's debatable whether they increased the death toll there ) . Nor did the Annapolis shooter use anything that would qualify as an `` assault weapon , '' another favorite target of gun controllers . Police say Jarrod Ramos , the man charged with carrying out the attack , legally bought the pump-action shotgun he used a year ago , which means he did not have a disqualifying criminal or psychiatric record . Mandating background checks for gun sales that do n't involve federally licensed dealers , as Giffords recommends , plainly would not affect someone who can pass a background check .\nAs for `` effective laws that can protect our communities and stop dangerous people from accessing guns , '' Giffords might have in mind gun violence restraining orders ( GVROs ) , which prohibit people deemed to be dangerous from possessing firearms . Maryland 's GVRO law , enacted in April , takes effect in October , so that option was not available to use against Ramos , who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment of a former high school classmate in 2011 and unsuccessfully sued the Capital Gazette for defamation after it covered the case . Ramos had a history of using the internet to pester and insult members of the paper 's staff . `` I was seriously concerned he would threaten us with physical violence , '' Thomas Marquardt , the Capital Gazette 's publisher at the time of the libel suit , told The Baltimore Sun . `` I even told my wife , 'We have to be concerned . This guy could really hurt us . ' ''\nThe Sun reports that Marquardt `` called the Anne Arundel County police about Ramos in 2013 , but nothing came of it . '' Marquardt also `` consulted the paper 's lawyers about filing a restraining order , but decided against it . '' Given that background , it 's not clear that police would have sought a GVRO if that option had been available at the time . In any case , Congress does not have the power to authorize GVROs in Maryland or any other state , although a bill introduced last year by Rep. Salud Carbajal ( D-Calif. ) would provide grants to states that enact such laws . The failure to enact that bill , which manifestly was not necessary for Maryland to pass a GVRO law , seems like a pretty thin pretext for blaming the Annapolis attack on congressional inaction .\n`` I remember telling our attorneys , 'This is a guy who is going to come in and shoot us , ' `` Marquardt told the Sun . The actions that led to Ramos 's criminal harassment conviction , which included emails urging the victim to kill herself and contacts with her employer that she believes led to her dismissal , reasonably aroused concern that his behavior might escalate . When you combine that history with Ramos 's frivolous lawsuit and his online taunts of Capital Gazette staff members , it is not hard to see why Marquardt was worried about him , although the fact that Marquardt decided not to seek a restraining order suggests his fear may have been magnified in retrospect by the knowledge of what Ramos ultimately did .\nUnder Maryland 's new law , law enforcement officers , mental health professionals , and various relatives , intimates , and associates can seek GVROs . A temporary GVRO , lasting up to a week , can be issued without giving the respondent a hearing if there are `` reasonable grounds '' to believe he poses `` an immediate and present danger '' to himself or others . A judge can extend that order for up to six months `` to effectuate service of the order where necessary to provide protection or for other good cause . '' A final GVRO , which lasts up to a year and can be extended for another six months , can be issued after a hearing based on `` clear and convincing evidence '' that the respondent poses a danger to himself or others .\nIn practice , getting a temporary GVRO against Ramos would have been easy , especially since he would have had no opportunity to rebut the claims against him . It also seems plausible that a police officer could have obtained a final GVRO , which would have prevented Ramos from legally buying a gun for as long as it was in effect . If police had sought a GVRO in 2013 , when Marquardt contacted them about Ramos , the order might have lasted until 2015 or so , assuming it was extended . According to police , Ramos bought his shotgun in 2017 .\nIn short , it 's not at all clear that a GVRO could have stopped Ramos , and the fact that the option was not available at the time had nothing to do with any failure on the part of Congress . Reflexively blaming congressional inaction for every mass shooting may be emotionally satisfying , but it does nothing to advance a rational discussion of policies aimed at preventing gun violence .",
