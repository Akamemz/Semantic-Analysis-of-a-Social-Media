    "content": "So . Here we are in the aftermath of yet another terrorist attack in America .\nNote well that in the earliest stage of the bombing in New York , Pittsburgh talk radio host Rose Tennent had by chance interviewed General Michael Flynn , the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency . Rose wrote up her conversation with Flynn this way , bold print for emphasis supplied :\nWhile Mayor de Blasio had declared what happened in Chelsea simply an \u201c intentional act , \u201d General Flynn has no doubt about the intent of the explosion and what it represents : \u201c Of course it \u2019 s an act of terrorism , \u201d he said . He pointed out that when the Mayor says there is no credible evidence of a terrorist attack , it is , in General Flynn \u2019 s opinion , \u201c a disservice to the people of New York . They have all kinds of credible evidence . What they didn \u2019 t have is any specific threat that there would be a bomb in the Chelsea area of NYC . We \u2019 ve got to be much more honest with the American people . The American people are not stupid. \u201d Flynn was in the city Saturday night when an explosive had gone off in the Manhattan neighborhood . He told me he feels it is imperative we understand why this is happening . He said , \u201c The American people want to know if our leadership is taking this threat as seriously as they should . I don \u2019 t see it . I really don \u2019 t see it . \u201c I \u2019 m actually fed up with it to be honest with you . I know that in my years of service going after this enemy that their goal is to strike fear in the hearts of their enemy . They have specific targeting and specific goals . We have to understand that this is a smart , cunning and vicious enemy . They represent an evil that is beyond what most people can understand . \u201d\nYet this latest attack \u2014 not to mention the stabbings in Minnesota \u2014 was preceded a few days back by Never Trumpers launching their own Twitter war on\u2026 Sean Hannity .\nYes , you read that right . And why a Twitter fusillade targeting Hannity ? Because Sean had the indelicacy to say this to the Never Trumpers , as reported by the Daily Caller , bold print for emphasis supplied :\n\u201c And if we elect a president because you are so stubborn , arrogant , and stupid , that can \u2019 t say \u2018 radical Islam \u2019 and can \u2019 t engage an enemy and identify it , that \u2019 s your fault as well , \u201d he continued . \u201c And if you help elect the single most corrupt person to ever seek the presidency , somebody who lies like she did , somebody who sold out her office for gain like she has , somebody who has failed on Iran and ISIS and radical Islam in general , and Iraq and Iran and Syria and North Africa and Libya , I \u2019 m blaming you ! \u201d \u201c And you are going to say , \u2018 Hannity , we blame you , \u2019 \u201d he said . \u201c \u2018 You gave Donald Trump time on your show. \u2019 And I gave every other candidate time. \u201d \u201c His agenda is infinitely better than hers , \u201d he added . \u201c And if you can \u2019 t see that , then that \u2019 s your problem . You own it. \u201d \u201c You own her , \u201d he continued . \u201c You own every dumb thing she \u2019 s about to do . I blame you. \u201d \u201c Got it ? I am going to name names regularly if she wins . \u201d\nAnd so he has . Among the names cited by Hannity over the last few weeks : Glenn Beck , Bill Kristol , Bret Stephens , Jonah Goldberg , Paul Ryan , Mitch McConnell , Lindsey Graham , John McCain , John Kasich , Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz . Some now appear to be \u2014 reluctantly \u2014 on the Trump train . Others , stoutly , flatly , and proudly refuse .\nAmong them is the baffling Bret Stephens , whose book America in Retreat I reviewed favorably back there in the mists of early pre-Trump 2015 . I certainly stand behind the review . But the Bret Stephens of that book seems to have an evil twin who has made Never Trumpism his task in life , attacking not only Trump but Hannity , calling the latter the \u201c dumbest anchor \u201d on Fox . As if boiling down Never Trumpism to ad hominems explains serious thought \u2014 unless of course it does .\nThose in a huff at Hannity are mad because he has made plain the blindingly obvious . To wit : If you choose to go out of your way to deliberately , with malice aforethought , sabotage the team that you have spent years claiming as your own \u2014 and the team loses as a result \u2014 then in fact you are at least in part quite obviously responsible for the other side \u2019 s victory and all that flows from that victory . Or , as Hannity has succinctly put it , you \u201c Own Hillary. \u201d If you chose the role of Benedict Arnold , you have to live with the results .\nThis isn \u2019 t rocket science . Yet the outrage from those Hannity targets is a wonder to behold . Some have treated Hannity as \u201c tragically unhip \u201d \u2014 to borrow a phrase from the movie Clueless . Clueless being an apt descriptive for those who seem to view this election as an in-the-club-versus out-of-the-club junior high school affair .\nNo better depiction of this junior high school mind set of the Never Trumpers is there than over at the Hill where reporter Jonathan Swan has this piece with the headline :\nYes , yours truly is quoted in the piece . But the most telling part of the piece was this concerning our friend Matt Schlapp . Wrote Swan :\nA few months ago , Matt Schlapp , the former White House political director under President George W. Bush , walked into a cocktail party and tried to join a conversation with Republican consultants he has known for years . \u201c The conversation quickly ended , \u201d Schlapp , the chairman of the nation \u2019 s oldest conservative grassroots organization , told The Hill in a recent interview . \u201c Everyone looked down at their expensive loafers. \u201d \u201c I hadn \u2019 t had that happen to me in a professional setting before , \u201d he added . \u201c It \u2019 s one of those moments when you wonder , \u2018 Hey , do I have something on my face ? \u2019 \u201d Schlapp \u2019 s decision to support Donald Trump for president has cost him friends in Washington \u2019 s elite Republican circles . Invitations he would normally receive no longer arrive . The vibe he says he \u2019 s getting is : \u201c You \u2019 re out of the club . \u201d\nFormer Bush 43 press secretary Ari Fleischer had this charming and quite similar experience :\n\u201c On May 3 , Ari Fleischer , the White House press secretary under Bush from 2001 to 2003 , tweeted : \u201c There \u2019 s a lot about Donald Trump that I don \u2019 t like , but I \u2019 ll vote for Trump over Hillary any day. \u201d A former colleague of Fleischer \u2019 s , Fratto , the Bush aide who criticized Christie \u2019 s support , replied in a tweet : \u201c Then we don \u2019 t have anything to say to each other. \u201d Fratto told The New York Times that Fleischer \u2019 s betrayal was \u201c unforgivable. \u201d \u201c You were the White House spokesperson when Trump said the president lied the country into the death and maiming of people unnecessarily , \u201d he told the Times of Fleischer . \u201c How can Ari be OK with that ? \u201d\nOne doubts that \u201c Ari is OK with that. \u201d Any more than as a Reagan White House political director I was happy with this , as reported in Angelo Codevilla \u2019 s classic The Ruling Class :\n\u2026 former Soviet dictator Mikhail Gorbachev has said that in 1987 , then-Vice President George H.W . Bush distanced himself from his own administration by telling Gorbachev , \u201c Reagan is a conservative , an extreme conservative . All the dummies and blockheads are with him . \u201d\nAs a Reaganite dummy and blockhead knowing this attitude about my boss and my colleagues I still voted for George H.W . Bush anyway , believing then and now that he would and did make a much better president than the lefty Michael Dukakis , the Hillary Clinton of 1988 .\nCodevilla goes on after citing this Bush story to say :\nThis is all about a class of Americans distinguishing itself from its inferiors . It recalls the Pharisee in the Temple : \u201c Lord , I thank thee that I am not like other men . \u201d\nExactly . The problem is that this Never Trump/Ruling Class resistance to owning Hillary and the consequences of a Hillary presidency would be hilarious if the consequences that flow from this utterly bizarre behavior were not so serious \u2014 as this latest terror attack in New York and New Jersey illustrates vividly . Trump states the obvious \u2014 that a bomber has struck New York . General Flynn , with the smoke still in the air , states the obvious that \u201c of course it \u2019 s an act of terrorism . \u201d\nAnd Hillary ? She released a statement cautiously parsing words about \u201c apparent terrorist attacks \u201d with the Washington Post reporting her reaction this way , bold print supplied :\nClinton \u2019 s statement Sunday followed remarks to reporters on her campaign plane Saturday night in which she cautioned against rushing to conclusions about the attacks and criticized her Republican opponent , Donald Trump , for quickly telling an audience that an explosion in New York was a bomb that served as a reminder for the United States to \u201c get very tough . \u201d\nThis is the attitude that killed four Americans in Benghazi when she was , as the saying goes , the responsible officer of the government . And if she is in fact elected then all of these Never Trumpers will find themselves owning the latest terror attack that her attitude will inevitably invite . And that \u2019 s before the Supreme Court appointees , the continuation of Obamacare , and the inevitable scandals that will accompany a second Clintonian presidency . In his \u201c Never Trump for Dummies \u201d column at the WSJ ( note that his use of \u201c dummies \u201d eerily parallels George H.W . Bush \u2019 s Ruling Class assessment of Reagan and his staff \u2014 hmmmm ) columnist Stephens says this : \u201c My fundamental objection to Mr. Trump is that he is unfit , as a person , to be president . \u201d\nBack there in 1997 , the Wall Street Journal issued a 500-plus page book titled : A Journal Briefing : Whitewater , edited by the paper \u2019 s legendary editor , the late Robert Bartley . Reprinting its editorials from the array of Clinton scandals in the day , the book provides chapter and verse that illustrates in detailed fashion just why Hillary Clinton is \u201c unfit , as a person , to be president. \u201d And this was long before her tenure as Secretary of State and the web of deceit that has been spun around the Clinton Foundation .\nNone of this will mean a thing to the Never Trumpers . Stephens makes plain he will vote for Hillary , while Jonah Goldberg says he will not , but he will not vote for Trump either .\nThe inimitable James Taranto , like Stephens a columnist for Bartley \u2019 s old paper , has this telling tell of the media world and their treatment of Trump in his own column at the WSJ . An excerpt that provides a clarifying look at how things work behind the scenes of what you see and read :\nFor some in the media , though , it may be more personal . Consider this exchange from NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d yesterday , between host Chuck Todd and New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd : Todd : New York Times , I think it was Saturday , Maureen , had a lead that said , basically interviewing all these Upper West Siders panicking now . And in fact I think referred to it as \u201c The polls are showing a \u2018 margin of panic \u2019 for Clinton supporters. \u201d Describe this east coast freakout that I feel like you \u2019 ve seen among the elites this week . Dowd : Right . Well my friends , one of my friends , Leon Wieseltier ( of the liberal New Republic , Brookings Institution and The Atlantic fame ) calls it a national emergency . And my friends won \u2019 t even read , if I do interviews with Donald Trump , they won \u2019 t read them . And basically they would like to censor any stories about Trump and also censor any negative stories about Hillary . They think she should have a total free pass . Because as she said at that fundraiser recently , \u201c I \u2019 m the only thing standing between you and the abyss. \u201d Oh , and they \u2019 re taking\u2014 Democratic strategists are taking antacids . In the Times today .\nThe Times story is well worth reading ; if it doesn \u2019 t make you laugh , you have a heart of stone . Imagine being a political reporter who sees the world in that Upper West Side way , and so do all your friends . But you operate under the professional constraint of being impartial , or at least appearing impartial . Suddenly Trump does something so dramatic that a signal goes through the media hive : The constraint of impartiality has been lifted .\nIn other words ? The media , the hive , a collection of pals , is desperate to defeat Trump and is now closing ranks . No wonder they hate Hannity !\nIn 1964 , all sorts of liberal Republicans renounced the conservative Barry Goldwater in language and tone not dissimilar to today \u2019 s Never Trumpers . In fact , Goldwater \u2019 s candidacy was a long shot from the start in a year following the assassination of JFK and with LBJ \u2019 s then-ascendant popularity . But without doubt , all that flowed from that LBJ landslide with the help of Republican saboteurs \u2014 the disaster of Vietnam , the wreckage that became the \u201c War on Poverty \u201d and the bureaucracy of the \u201c Great Society \u201d \u2014 can most assuredly be laid at the feet of those Never Goldwater types . In fact , the most prominent among them \u2014 Nelson Rockefeller and George Romney \u2014 wound up sabotaging their own once bright presidential prospects by their actions , with the party \u2019 s grassroots never forgiving them . There is no accident that the two people who either openly advocated for Goldwater \u2014 Ronald Reagan \u2014 or stoutly defended Goldwater on the campaign trail \u2014 Richard Nixon \u2014 both went on to the White House . And in fact , the Never Trump argument aside , the polls repeatedly show that Donald Trump can win this election .\nThe harsh fact of political life in this campaign season is that yes , of course Hannity is right . The Never Trumpers \u2014 and the list is longer than the names mentioned even by Hannity \u2014 will in fact own Hillary if she wins . From her Supreme Court appointments that promise decades of attacks from within on the Constitution to terrorist attacks on American soil to Obamacare to the inevitable parade of scandals , every last bit of it will rest on their shoulders .\nTo pretend outrage at the charge may make them feel better , but it doesn \u2019 t make the point any less true . And the only thing snarking on Twitter about Sean Hannity does is just underline the point of exactly how responsible for a Hillary presidency all of these Never Trumpers will be .",

From her Supreme Court appointments that promise decades of attacks from within on the Constitution to terrorist attacks on American soil to Obamacare to the inevitable parade of scandals, every last bit of it will rest on their shoulders.\n\nTo pretend outrage at the charge may make them feel better, but it doesn\u2019t make the point any less true. And the only thing snarking on Twitter about Sean Hannity does is just underline the point of exactly how responsible for a Hillary presidency all of these Never Trumpers will be.",
