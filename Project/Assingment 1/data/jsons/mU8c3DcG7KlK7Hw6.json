Fifty-six percent of Republican insiders said Trump \u2019 s speech \u2014 a forceful indictment of those responsible for what he perceives as a country in decline , along with an assurance that he is uniquely qualified to solve the nation \u2019 s ills \u2014 made them feel more confident in his candidacy .\n\u201c Trump gave a simple message and expanded the Republican Party : law and order , economic populism and defeat the rigged system , \u201d said one Iowa Republican \u2014 who , like all respondents , completed the survey anonymously .\n\u201c I felt Trump gave a very good speech and struck on issues and policies that people wanted to hear about , \u201d added a Colorado Republican . \u201c His family and friends did an excellent job of showing the softer side of Donald Trump and gave America a good view of his family , which says a lot about him as a person . I think he is absolutely right \u2014 this is a movement , not a \u2018 normal \u2019 campaign . People have had enough of tired politicians . I think they are going to give him the chance to run the country . \u201d\nAdded a Pennsylvania Republican : \u201c He talked to the people he needed to very effectively . The speech defined the race and made him a voice for the people \u2014 something he should have done months ago . \u201d\nFor many of the GOP insiders , Trump \u2019 s acceptance speech Thursday night helped overcome other , rockier moments this week , including Ted Cruz \u2019 s speech , in which the Texas senator declined to endorse Trump , despite angry protestations from the crowd at Quicken Loans Arena .\nFifty-nine percent of Republicans picked Trump \u2019 s acceptance speech as the \u201c defining moment \u201d of the convention , far more than the 28 percent who said Cruz \u2019 s televised snub defined the week .\nThe Cruz speech received poor marks from those same Republican insiders .

Cruz \u2019 s speech was a head-shaking moment . And , he 's toast in 2020 . Compare him to Ryan . \u201d\nTrump certainly still has his Republican critics : Twenty percent said the speech made them less confident in him . And a number of them were despondent in what they saw as an apocalyptic view of the country , when voters want to be inspired .\n\u201c It 's not morning in America ; it 's midnight in America , according to Trump , \u201d a Colorado Republican said . \u201c This was a long , depressing speech that did not focus on issues that most Americans are concerned about , specifically , the economy . \u201d\nAdded a New Hampshire Republican : \u201c We have handed our Party over to a narcissistic , feckless , classless RINO strongman wannabe who is the only candidate that actually gives the horrid Hillary Clinton a chance to win . \u201d\nDemocrats largely agreed : The consensus among insiders wasn \u2019 t that Trump will emerge from Cleveland as a stronger candidate .
