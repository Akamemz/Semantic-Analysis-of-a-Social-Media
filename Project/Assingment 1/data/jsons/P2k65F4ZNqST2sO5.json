    "content": "On Thursday night , the third Democratic debate will be the first to put all the major Democratic candidates on one stage together . But among the 10 candidates , only three have been consistently registering frontrunner status in the polls : Former Vice President Joe Biden , Sen. Bernie Sanders , and Sen. Elizabeth Warren .\nBetween the two rounds \u2014 and four nights \u2014 of debates , there have been a lot of break out moments for those three and some of the other seven candidates who will be on stage Thursday ( Sen. Kamala Harris , South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg , entrepreneur Andrew Yang , Sen. Cory Booker , former Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke , Sen. Amy Klobuchar , and former US housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro ) .\nThere was the time Harris took Biden to task over his comments about working with southern Democratic segregationists in the Senate . Booker tried to have a repeat viral moment over Biden \u2019 s criminal justice record in the second debate . O \u2019 Rourke surprised everyone by whipping out some broken Spanish . Sanders found a catch phrase when pushed back on criticism on his signature proposal , the Medicare for All Act , by declaring he wrote the \u201c damn \u201d bill . Or Warren asked why moderate John Delaney even bothered to run for president .\nBut these moments haven \u2019 t really changed the fundamental polling outcomes going into Thursday :\nJoe Biden is still leading nationally . Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are basically tied for second , and nipping closely at Biden \u2019 s heels in a few early states . Everyone else needs a break-through moment that will stick .\nThere have been ongoing trends that are worth keeping a close eye on . Warren \u2019 s upward trajectory in polling continues . Sanders , meanwhile has remained pretty stable , while showing some good showings in early state polls . And there are a lot of undecided voters among key demographics that could make or break these candidates chances .\nBiden is winning overall . Going into this week , an ABC/Washington Post from September 2-5 , found Biden with 27 percent of the vote , Sanders with 19 percent and Warren with 17 percent . None of the other candidates registered double digits . Biden was overwhelmingly seen as the most electable candidate against Trump in that poll . A CNN poll during the same time found similar results : Biden at 24 percent , and Warren and Sanders at 18 and 17 percent respectively .\nThat \u2019 s consistent with the polling averages overall , that puts Biden at roughly 28 percent of national support \u2014 roughly 10 points ahead of the rest of the field . Compared to the very beginning of his campaign , when he was polling in the low 40s , Biden \u2019 s clout in the field has dropped substantially , but he \u2019 s remained a stable lead throughout the summer . The exception is in South Carolina , where Biden has 43 percent of the support \u2014 a full 25 points ahead of second-place Sanders , according to the most recent late August , early September YouGov poll .\nBiden has been put on the defensive throughout the primary cycle as candidates across the ideological spectrum have attacked his record and past comments . Some of these moments have affected Biden \u2019 s poll numbers \u2014 he took a dip after Harris publicly called him out for his position on school busing in the 1970s \u2014 but he \u2019 s always bounced back . And despite talking himself into a seemingly never ending \u201c gaffe \u201d news cycle , Biden remains in the lead .\nThat said , Biden \u2019 s frontrunner status isn \u2019 t going unchallenged . Sanders and Warren are also registering double digits in the polls and they \u2019 ve increasingly seen their strength come in state polls in Iowa , New Hampshire and Nevada . The Real Clear Politics polling average puts the two in a dead heat , as did an early September YouGov poll which saw Warren and Biden in a tie at 24 percent and Sanders behind at 17 percent .\nA Franklin Pierce-Boston Herald New Hampshire poll this week , in fact , put Sanders up 7 points ahead of the rest of the field , with 29 percent of the vote . Biden came in second with 21 percent , followed by Warren ( 17 percent ) . Another YouGov New Hampshire poll from late August into early September put Warren ahead of the three , with 27 percent , with Sanders and Biden essentially tied for second and third . Sanders led the latest YouGov poll out of Nevada , another early state , by two points , with Biden and Warren trailing closely behind .\nSanders and Warren support similar policies and have occupied the most progressive flank of the Democratic party , but as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Andrew Prokop noted , they have had different trajectories in the race . Sanders , who had high name recognition going into this election from his 2016 run , has remained relatively stagnant in second place . Meanwhile , Warren has seen a steady rise .\nAbout a quarter of the Democratic electorate is still undecided \u2014 a share of voters that hasn \u2019 t substantially shrunk since April , when Biden first jumped in .\nPoll after poll has shown that Democratic voters are more willing to pick a candidate that they think will win against Donald Trump than a candidate they are more ideologically aligned to . In other words , electability matters to Democrats this election cycle , a lot .\nThe good news for the candidates in the Democratic field is that in hypothetical match-ups , Trump loses to almost all of them . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Sean Collins pointed out , a September 10 New Hampshire Emerson poll even found Yang \u2014 who hasn \u2019 t substantially topped 2 percent of support \u2014 defeating Trump comfortably . The ABC-Washington Post poll found Biden , Warren , Sanders , and Harris beating Trump by double-digit margins . But that doesn \u2019 t always match up with voters \u2019 perceptions .\nThe number of undecided voters could have interesting implications for some of the top candidates , particularly in demographics that represent a core part of the Democratic base . For example , an Essence poll of black women found while older generations primarily supported Biden , and younger black women supported Sanders , 26 percent were still undecided . In states like South Carolina , where black voters make up 60 percent of the Democratic base , that could make or break some candidate \u2019 s chances . Candidates like Warren who has struggled to shore up support among black voters so far .\nThere \u2019 s still a big field of candidates who haven \u2019 t had breakthroughs\nMeanwhile , the rest of the field needs a break out moment that will actually stick .\nHarris had some momentum after the first debate when she took on Biden . State polls in Iowa and South Carolina offered a little more light for Harris in July . She outpaced Warren and Sanders in a mid-July Monmouth poll of South Carolina voters and essentially tied with Warren in a YouGov poll of Iowa in July . But in national polls , that was a fleeting moment of electoral success , and in the past two months she \u2019 s slipped back solidly into fourth place .\nSimilarly , Buttigieg , who enjoyed a major media frenzy early on , hasn \u2019 t been able to substantially make a dent in the crowded field . And not far behind Harris and Buttigieg sit a tier of candidates , from O \u2019 Rourke , to Booker and Yang stuck at around 2 to 3 percent of the vote .\nThe debates , as always , give these candidates a chance to break out . But they \u2019 ll need to have a moment that actually sticks .\nCorrection : This article incorrectly identified the Franklin Pierce-Boston Herald New Hampshire poll as a poll with The Boston Globe .",
