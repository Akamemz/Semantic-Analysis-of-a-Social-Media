The average debt for a college graduate in Michigan is slightly more than $ 26,000 .\nNationally , there 's more than $ 1 trillion owed in student debt \u2014 more than what Americans owe on credit cards \u2014 with more than $ 180 billion of it in some type of default , according to government data .\n`` If everyone else is making a killing off of us , I 'm not the least bit surprised the government is angling to rake us all over the coals , '' said Nick Townsend , a senior at Ferris State University .\nIt 's going to take both Jennifer and Savannah St. Pierre of North Branch taking out loans to get Savannah through her junior year at the University of Michigan-Flint .\nSavannah will take $ 5,500 in Stafford loans \u2014 the maximum allowed .

That 's an increase of 2 percentage points over what would have been coming in had Congress not passed this law .\nThe government will particularly increase its profits on parent loans , with an average increase of 9 percentage points each year between 2013 and 2023 .\nAs a July 1 deadline to stop the interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans came and went , a number of plans were floated by members of Congress and the Obama administration .\nThey ranged from just freezing rates at the lower rate for a year to a complete overhaul of the system .\nBut in the process of coming to a compromise plan , it became clear that whatever was passed had to be revenue-neutral , several experts said .
