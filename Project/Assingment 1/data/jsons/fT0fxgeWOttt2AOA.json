The new statistics also confirm an increase in crime on the city 's subways , a longtime hot spot for violence that was thought to have cooled in the past two decades .\nThe new figures come as the city and state struggle with a controversial new bail reform law , which mandates the release of most nonviolent offenders before trial . The uptick in crime will likely add fuel to the fire for opponents eager to see Albany modify the law or scrap it altogether .\nIn total , New York City in January saw a 16.9 percent increase in `` index crimes '' ( the offenses tracked nationally to measure the crime rate ) compared with January 2019 . That figure includes an added 347 robberies , 116 assaults , 192 burglaries , 358 larcenies , and 243 car thefts . The city did see six fewer murders , but 15 more shooting incidents .
