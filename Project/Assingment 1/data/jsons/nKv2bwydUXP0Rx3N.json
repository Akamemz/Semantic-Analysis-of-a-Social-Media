Let's talk about fear and anger.\n\nThat message, coming out of a CNN interview with Vice President Joe Biden, perfectly captures the media's role in the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nBiden and Gloria Borger, CNN's chief political analyst, discussed the VP's future political ambitions and his take on whether the 2014 midterms will shift the balance of power in Washington in an interview that aired this morning.\n\n\u201cIf you look at every single major issue in this campaign, the American public agree with our position,\u201d Biden said, \u201cfrom federal support for infrastructure to minimum wage to marriage equality.\u201d\n\nBiden is right, and the numbers are staggering.
