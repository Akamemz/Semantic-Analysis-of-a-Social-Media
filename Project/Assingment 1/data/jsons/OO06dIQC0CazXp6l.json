I do n't really have time for that at the moment , '' Christie said in an interview on a local radio station .\nThe New Jersey governor said if he finds himself in Washington , `` I 'll certainly look him up .

''\nChristie gave Paul the brush-off after the Kentucky senator , in an interview with Fox News , offered Wednesday to make nice with the Garden State guv .\n`` I think with Governor Christie it 's gotten a little too personal , so we 're ready to kiss and make up , '' Paul told Fox News . He said `` anytime he would like to come down and sit at a pub right around the corner from the Senate -- we 'll have a beer . ''\nChristie 's response signals a resumption of the rather personal war of words between the two prominent Republicans . Both are considered potential candidates in the 2016 presidential race , and each represents a distinct wing of the Republican Party -- which has only heightened interest in their public spat .\nChristie said Thursday that he does n't understand why Paul is so `` out of whack '' over this , adding `` he 's just trying to get attention .
