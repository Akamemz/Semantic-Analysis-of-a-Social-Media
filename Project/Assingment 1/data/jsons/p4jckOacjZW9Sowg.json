On March 4 the City Council passed a resolution to that effect , though not without debate from residents . A particular point of contention : Should the city government be able to force residents to phase out their gas stoves and furnaces ?\nGina Mathias has what many would consider a dream job .\nA lifelong environmentalist , Ms. Mathias is the sustainability manager of Takoma Park . The leafy Maryland suburb is one of the most progressive cities in the United States \u2013 a place where residents boast about their town \u2019 s preponderance of solar panels and electric vehicles . They \u2019 re proud it was one of the first places in the country to declare itself \u201c nuclear-free . \u201d\nBut many of those same residents were in an uproar in February when Ms. Mathias brought a resolution to the City Council that laid out an ambitious agenda to combat climate change in the coming decades . The most contentious idea : making Takoma Park a fossil fuel-free community by 2045 , a feat that has not been done before in the U.S .\nBecoming fossil fuel-free would entail everything from retrofitting gas stations to retiring gas-powered water heaters and leaf blowers . The debate at the council meeting centered around the potential cost and timeline \u2013 and whether the Takoma Park city government should be able to force residents to phase out their gas stoves and furnaces .\nAs Ms. Mathias sees it , the question of whether such a program should be mandatory has already been answered .\n\u201c That \u2019 s why we \u2019 re in the climate crisis to begin with \u2013 voluntary programs . If they worked the way that we would hope they would , we wouldn \u2019 t be where we are today , \u201d she says .\nMichael Bonfigli/Special to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 This station , located on Carroll Avenue in Takoma Park , Maryland , and shown here on March 30 , 2020 , was the first in the nation to switch from gas pumps to electric vehicle chargers .\nThe council passed a revised resolution in early March , but the surrounding tumult made it clear that city leaders will have to carefully consider when to make mandates and how citizens will take the mandatory approach .\nTakoma Park \u2019 s experience is likely to be a precursor for other fights that could soon bubble up as more and more towns reckon with the climate crisis .\n\u201c What we do in Takoma Park makes its way around the country , \u201d says Ms. Mathias . \u201c We get calls pretty regularly from other cities looking to implement ... other environmental programs that we \u2019 ve implemented already . All the cities \u2013 we talk to each other , we share what we do , we learn from each other . \u201d\nIf governments want citizens to back their ideas and proposals , they will need to be savvy about how they frame the discussion , says Reuven Sussman , a social and environmental psychologist at the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy .\n\u201c Some people think that implementing policy is all you need to do in order to get the change made , \u201d he says , \u201c [ but ] if you \u2019 re able to create a situation where the default behavior is the one you \u2019 re trying to do as opposed to the default being something that people are already doing , you can get a lot done . \u201d\nLike many things today , Takoma Park \u2019 s fossil fuel-free moves are temporarily on the back burner as the coronavirus crisis commands attention . Mayor Kate Stewart noted in an email that amid the crisis , \u201c we are still figuring out how committees can meet . \u201d\nFor years , the environment has been a top issue in Takoma Park . In 2014 , the city entered a nationwide contest to reduce home energy use and placed third . The competition planted the seeds for this year \u2019 s resolution , as it helped the city determine the best emissions-cutting strategies .\nIt also exposed the limits of voluntary participation programs . Ms. Mathias struggled to get 20 % of the city \u2019 s homes to participate .\n\u201c We did direct mailing ; we did dozens and dozens of public education events , neighborhood meetings in people \u2019 s homes . We hit every single kind of public outreach over a two-year period , short of having a marching band go up and down every street at 6 a.m. to get people to wake up , \u201d she says .\nDespite the high-ranking finish in the contest , the city \u2019 s mobilization of resources has proved somewhat ineffective . Per capita emissions barely declined from 2012 to 2017 , and total emissions still increased for the 2-square-mile town . The tepid results have motivated city leaders to push for more aggressive measures , like hitting net-zero emissions by 2035 .\nTransportation is responsible for the bulk of those emissions , but the city has more control over housing . It is calling for building-based interventions like lighting upgrades , the establishment of minimum energy-efficiency standards , and the swapping out of gas appliances for electric ones .\nMore and more cities are considering such reforms , particularly after Berkeley , California , became the first American city to ban natural gas infrastructure in new buildings last year . A recent report suggests that expanding the renewable energy industry and aggressive electrification could reduce U.S. building emissions by nearly 80 % by 2050 .\nThe trend concerns Takoma Park residents like Ariel Woods , who worries that electrification costs will unfairly burden renters and low-income homeowners .\n\u201c We like saying that we \u2019 re nuclear-free , [ and ] I see the appeal of saying , \u2018 Takoma Park , a fossil fuel-free town ! \u2019 But I would rather be a town that has lower income inequality than be a fossil fuel-free town , \u201d says Ms. Woods , who used to rent and now owns a home in the city .\nIf residents had to replace every appliance at once , it would cost roughly $ 25,000 , says Ms. Mathias . However , the city is working on a sustainability fund , she adds , and still has funds left over from federal and state grants that not enough residents used \u2013 part of the reason they \u2019 re opting for requirements instead of more voluntary programs .\nHowever , forcing residents to give up their incandescent lightbulbs and gas stoves \u2013 albeit at the end of their natural life cycle \u2013 sparked heated discussions in council meetings and neighborhood online forums .\nMichael Bonfigli/Special to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 A sign along Carroll Avenue welcomes people to Takoma Park , Maryland , on March 30 , 2020 .
