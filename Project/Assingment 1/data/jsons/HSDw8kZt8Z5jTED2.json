These are some of the hyperventilating left \u2019 s overheated and ludicrous characterizations of President Trump \u2019 s remarks at his Helsinki press conference with Vladimir Putin .\nListening to the Democrats and their wholly owned media subsidiary , you would have thought that Trump had ( a ) smilingly handed Putin a large red \u201c reset \u201d button or ( b ) had been caught on a hot mic during a global nuclear security summit murmuring to Putin \u2019 s representative that , after the midterm elections , he would have more flexibility in his dealings with Russia or ( c ) had signed off on a deal to give the Russians control of 20 % of America \u2019 s uranium reserves in return for a $ 140,000,000 donation by Russian interests to his family \u2019 s foundation and a $ 500,000 fee paid to Melania for giving a speech in Moscow or ( d ) endangered national security by transmitting classified government documents over an unsecure private email server or ( e ) paid Russians for salacious , unverified slime to discredit Hillary Clinton or ( f ) during a presidential debate casually dismissed the Russian threat by joking that \u201c The 1980s called ; they want their foreign policy back . \u201d\nOf course , he did none of the above . So , what did Trump do that for the thousandth time has summoned the furies of Le R\u00e9sistance de la Gauche ?\nHe \u2014 gasp \u2014 declined to publicly scold and insult Putin to his face and questioned the probity of our intelligence community , i.e. , the deep state cabal who have been trying for the past three years to frame him for colluding with the Russians .

In August 2017 , he approved sanctions against Russia for its meddling in the 2016 election , human rights violations , annexation of Crimea and military operations against Ukraine .
