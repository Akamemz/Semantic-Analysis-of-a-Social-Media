But he was alone among regional leaders in praising the decision.\n\nQ&A Why is recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital so contentious? Show Hide Of all the issues at the heart of the enduring conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, none is as sensitive as the status of Jerusalem. The holy city has been at the centre of peace-making efforts for decades. Seventy years ago, when the UN voted to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, Jerusalem was defined as a separate entity under international supervision. In the war of 1948 it was divided, like Berlin in the cold war, into western and eastern sectors under Israeli and Jordanian control respectively. Nineteen years later, in June 1967, Israel captured the eastern side, expanded the city\u2019s boundaries and annexed it \u2013 an act that was never recognised internationally. Israel routinely describes the city, with its Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy places, as its \u201cunited and eternal\u201d capital. For their part, the Palestinians say East Jerusalem must be the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. The unequivocal international view, accepted by all previous US administrations, is that the city\u2019s status must be addressed in peace negotiations. Recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital puts the US out of step with the rest of the world, and legitimises Israeli settlement-building in the east \u2013 considered illegal under international law.
