    "content": "President Donald J. Trump has all but wiped the Islamic State off the face of the earth , a drastic change in the war on terror compared to the previous administration . In his administration 's first 11 months alone , the military has freed twice as many people and recaptured twice as much land as under the previous 18 months , reports the Washington Examiner .\nPresident Trump promised as a presidential candidate to \u201c bomb the hell out of ISIS \u201d and destroy the terrorist group once and for all . Since January , ISIS has dwindled from 35,000 members down to 1,000 . Perhaps more astonishingly is the decrease in amount of land that the Islamic extremist group controls . When Trump assumed office , ISIS controlled nearly 17,000 square miles of land . Today , they control only 1,900 square miles .\nMore specifically , U.S. backed forces have liberated nearly 5.3 million people . The pinnacle of this liberation was the fall of the self-proclaimed capital of ISIS , Mosul . The northern Iraqi city underwent what was described as \u201c the most significant urban combat to take place since World War II . \u201d\nWhen the western part of the city fell in June , thousands of civilians had died , but Iraqi forces prevailed and the will of ISIS had been broken . \u201c It just snowballed , and it turned into where we are right now , with a full liberation of Iraq , and in Syria , continuing to chase down ISIS elements , the remnants of ISIS elements , in Syria , \u201d said Col. Ryan Dillon , the chief U.S. spokesman for the U.S. led coalition , known as Operation Inherent Resolve .\nMany in the military credit what some may describe as a hands-off approach by Donald Trump . That is to say that rather than hamper the military and top commanders with bureaucratic politically correct nonsense , the commander-in-chief allows them to do what they do best- kill bad guys .\n\u201c We do n't get second-guessed a lot . Our judgment here on the battlefield in the forward areas is trusted . And we do n't get 20 questions with every action that happens on the battlefield and every action that we take , \u201d said Lt.
