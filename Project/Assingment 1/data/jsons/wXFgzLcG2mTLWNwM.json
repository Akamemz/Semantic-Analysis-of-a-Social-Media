    "content": "A federal judge has blocked a new Department of Labor regulation that would have made millions of middle-income workers eligible for overtime pay . The rule was scheduled to take effect on December 1 and it was expected to be a key part of President Barack Obama \u2019 s economic legacy .\nThe law gives workers making less than $ 47,476 a right to time-and-a-half overtime pay . The old rule had applied only to workers making less than $ 23,660 per year .\nBut Amos Mazzant , a federal judge in Texas who was appointed by President Obama just two years ago , has called the rule \u2019 s future into question . It \u2019 s just a preliminary ruling , but Mazzant \u2019 s opinion strongly suggested that he would ultimately hold that the Labor Department \u2019 s new rule was illegal .\nLabor rights groups blasted the ruling . \u201c Workers will continue to work longer hours for less pay thanks to this obstructionist litigation , \u201d said Christine Owens of the National Employment Law Project in an emailed statement .\nBecause the ruling overturns a regulation that was generally seen as giving workers more rights , it has been cheered by business groups . But ruling could lead to an outcome that \u2019 s not great for anyone . If nothing else , Obama \u2019 s rule \u2014 that everyone making less than $ 47,476 was entitled to overtime pay \u2014 had the virtue of simplicity . Employers would have grumbled , but at least it would have been crystal clear who was affected .\nBut now it looks like the Labor Department could be forced to adopt a more complicated rule that focuses on the specific details of each worker \u2019 s job . That \u2019 s going to force employers to spend more money on lawyers to figure out who is eligible for overtime . At the same time , it will make it harder for employees to figure out when their bosses are breaking the law .\nA judge says the law doesn \u2019 t allow a salary-based rule\nModern labor law dates back to 1938 , when Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act . A key requirement of that law was that workers receive time-and-a-half pay any time they \u2019 re asked to work more than 40 hours per week .\nStill , lawmakers understood that this requirement didn \u2019 t necessarily make sense for people in management , administrative , and professional positions who typically enjoy high levels of autonomy on the job . Managers and professionals are typically well-paid and have a fair amount of bargaining power , so there was less reason to worry about them being exploited on the job . And they typically don \u2019 t punch a time clock .\nSo Congress said that the overtime rule would not apply to \u201c any employee employed in a bona fide executive , administrative , or professional capacity. \u201d And it put the Labor Department in charge of defining who qualified as an exempt employee under these rules .\nEarly versions combined salary thresholds with tests that focused on a worker \u2019 s specific job duties . In 2004 , the Labor Department simplified the rule and placed a greater emphasis on the salary requirement . Workers making an annual salary higher than $ 23,660 could generally be considered exempt from the overtime requirement , while workers making less than that had to be paid overtime .\nThe Obama administration wanted to double that threshold so that anyone making less than $ 47,476 will be guaranteed overtime pay .\nBut Mazzant ruled that the Labor Department \u2019 s entire approach is a misreading of the law . \u201c Congress intended the exemption to apply to employees doing actual executive , administrative , and professional duties , \u201d he wrote .
