''\nIn many western European contests , the voting public does n't even know the names of the candidates ' families -- but that 's never been true in America . From the first , presidents ' wives have been the focus of the public eye , much to the chagrin of Martha Washington , who never wanted her husband to be the leader of the new republic . Abigail Adams , wife of the second president , John Adams , had no time for `` the people '' and their curiosity about the family that led the nation .
