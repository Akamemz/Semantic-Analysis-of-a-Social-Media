    "content": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 President Donald Trump has chosen Larry Kudlow to be his top economic aide , elevating the influence of a longtime fixture on the CNBC business news network who previously served in the Reagan administration and has emerged as a leading evangelist for tax cuts and a smaller government .\nKudlow told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he has accepted the offer , saying the U.S. economy is poised to take off after Trump signed $ 1.5 trillion worth of tax cuts into law .\n\u201c The economy is starting to roar and we \u2019 re going to get more of that , \u201d he said .\nKudlow will join an administration in the middle of a tumultuous remodeling as a wave of White House staffers and top officials have departed in recent weeks . Trump on Tuesday dumped his secretary of state , former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson .\nThe famously pinstripe-suited Kudlow would succeed Gary Cohn , a former Goldman Sachs executive who is leaving the post in a dispute over Trump \u2019 s decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum .\nWith Trump \u2019 s tax cuts already being implemented , Kudlow would be advising a president who appears increasingly determined to tax foreign imports \u2014 a policy Kudlow personally opposes . Kudlow said he is \u201c in accord \u201d with Trump \u2019 s agenda and his team at the White House would help implement the policies set by the president .\nTrump has promised to reduce the trade imbalance with China and rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico . Kudlow declined to say what advice he would give the president on trade issues , saying instead that Trump is \u201c a very good negotiator . \u201d\nKudlow , 70 , has informally advised the Trump administration in the past and he has spoken with the president \u201c at some length in recent days , \u201d so he is ready \u201c to hit the ground running . \u201d\nKudlow told CNBC on Wednesday that he will be going to Washington on Thursday to meet with Trump . White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration is preparing for an orderly transition and \u201c will keep everyone posted \u201d on when Kudlow officially assumes the job .\nFriends and colleagues say Kudlow possesses two critical attributes prized by the president : He is a bluntly spoken debater and is resolutely loyal .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a very sensitive man and a very logical man , which is exactly what Trump needs , \u201d said Arthur Laffer , a well-known economist and longtime friend of Kudlow .\nThe two men and their wives used to celebrate New Year \u2019 s Eve together outside San Diego , where Laffer lived at the time . In the Reagan administration , Kudlow worked in the White House budget office and Laffer served on an economic policy advisory board .
