The White House is backing a bill that would raise the federal minimum to just over $ 10 an hour , up from $ 7.25 .\nCritics of a minimum wage increase argue that it could have the perverse effect of hurting the economy , resulting in higher costs for consumers and fewer jobs to offset the cost of higher wages .\nBut Obama touted local efforts to address the minimum wage . Around the same time as Obama \u2019 s speech , the D.C. Council voted to give preliminary approval to hike the minimum wage to $ 11.50 an hour , which would be one of the nation 's highest .\nThe president called the growing income gap a `` defining challenge of our time . ''\n`` The basic bargain at the heart of our economy has frayed , '' the president said in remarks at a nonprofit community center a short drive from the White House in one of Washington 's most impoverished neighborhoods .\nHe was also in friendly territory , at an event sponsored by the Center for American Progress , a think tank with close ties to the White House . The president vowed to focus the last three years of his presidency on addressing the discrepancy and a rapidly growing deficit of opportunity that he said is a bigger threat than the fiscal deficit .\nBut Sen.
