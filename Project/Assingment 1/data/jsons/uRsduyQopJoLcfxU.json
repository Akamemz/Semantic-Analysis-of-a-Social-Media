They 'll have to win some Democratic support if they want to block any filibuster threats , and red-state senators up for reelection in 2018 are likely to be prime targets . And even a small number of GOP defections \u2014 particularly from the party 's dwindling moderate wing \u2014 could spell an early demise for overly ambitious proposals .\nEven when it comes to nominations , most of which can win Senate confirmation with a simple majority vote , Trump may have to mount an uncharacteristic charm offensive to keep Republicans united or enlist Democrats to back any particularly polarizing selections .\n\u201c In the past , when Republicans were challenging President Obama , it was kind of a categorical condemnation of everything , \u201d Sen. Bob Casey ( D-Pa. ) said in a brief interview last week . \u201c I don \u2019 t think we \u2019 ll do that . But we \u2019 re going to have some real fights . \u201d\nSo with an eye to when those fights start in earnest next year , here 's a look at the most powerful swing votes in the Senate in the next Congress \u2014 a combination of red-state Democrats on the ballot in 2018 and bluish-state Republicans who survived 2016 .\nManchin could easily be paired with fellow red-state Sens . Heidi Heitkamp ( D-N.D. ) and Joe Donnelly ( D-Ind . ) as a swing-voting bloc on this list . But among the 10 Senate Democrats facing reelection in 2018 in states that Trump turned red , Manchin faces the hardest road \u2014 the president-elect won West Virginia by 42 points . Manchin opposed the majority of his party on floor votes more often than any other Democrat so far this year , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis , with Heitkamp and Donnelly right behind him when it comes to splitting with the Democratic caucus .\nWhat \u2019 s more , Manchin \u2019 s new position in Democratic leadership gives him a high-profile platform to nudge incoming Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) toward compromise with Trump and the GOP . His early support for Sen. Jeff Sessions \u2019 attorney general nomination helped ensure the Alabama Republican \u2019 s apparent glide path to confirmation .\n\u201c I want the place to work , \u201d Manchin told reporters last week . He \u2019 s expected to align with Republicans on several early Trump priorities , including infrastructure and expanding domestic fossil-fuel production . On other thorny issues on which the GOP may lose a small number of votes from its own ranks , such as immigration and Obamacare , Manchin is a likely but less guaranteed get .\nThe libertarian and critic of what he perceives as excessive governmental power has already delivered Trump the senatorial equivalent of a brushback pitch , vowing early last week to oppose John Bolton or Rudy Giuliani if the president-elect taps either man as secretary of state . Paul later predicted that there are \u201c several potential Republican votes \u201d against either choice , forecasting \u201c a very close vote . \u201d\nThat won \u2019 t be the last time Paul , who often breaks from his party on foreign policy and electronic surveillance issues , makes trouble for Trump even after supporting him during his campaign . If Trump proposes to pay for the massive infrastructure package he \u2019 s proposed with new federal spending , Paul is likely to be on the vanguard of conservative resistance .

Mike Pompeo ( R-Kan. ) , over his support for the PATRIOT Act and expanded authority for the National Security Agency .\nPompeo is \u201c going to have to also answer to my liking whether or not he 's still for torture , whether or not he 's for waterboarding , '' Paul said during a Nov. 20 appearance on \u201c Face the Nation . \u201d\nIn an otherwise punishing 2018 map for Democrats , Nevada is the party \u2019 s best and perhaps only opportunity to take a Senate seat from the GOP . And Democrats have reason to be optimistic about their chances of toppling Heller , thanks to Sen.-elect Catherine Cortez Masto \u2019 s ( D-Nev. ) victory in a hotly contested race and their successful recapture of both houses of the state legislature .\nBecause term limits will stop Nevada \u2019 s popular Republican Gov . Brian Sandoval from running for reelection , Heller is occasionally talked about as an odds-on favorite to replace him .
