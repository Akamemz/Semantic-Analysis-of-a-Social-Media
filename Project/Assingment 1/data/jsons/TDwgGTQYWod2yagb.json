Send us your experiences , but please stay safe .\nCairo , Egypt ( CNN ) -- Egypt 's top prosecutor opened an investigation Thursday into claims that Mohamed Morsy and top leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood incited violence and the killing of protesters , a day after the military ousted the country 's first democratically elected president .\nThe prosecutor , Gen. Abdel Maquid Mahmoud , issued an order preventing Morsy and 35 others from leaving the country while they are under investigation , state-run Middle East News Agency and EgyNews reported .\nThe news came as the Muslim Brotherhood and others called for Morsy supporters to take to the streets Friday across Egypt to protest the military 's actions , while Egypt 's armed forces announced it would guarantee the rights of people to protest as long it did not result in violence or destruction of property .\nEven so , the military moved to arrest leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood who supported Morsy 's rule and to silence their communications outlets .\nMuslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad El-Haddad told CNN that Morsy was initially under house arrest at the presidential Republican Guard headquarters in Cairo and later moved to the Ministry of Defense ; the military has not commented on Morsy 's whereabouts .\nThe news from MENA and EgyNews appear to contradict reports that Morsy refused an offer by the armed forces to leave Egypt for Qatar , Turkey or Yemen . The state-run newspaper Al-Ahram reported Thursday that Morsy would not step down voluntarily and that his speech Wednesday -- shortly before his ouster -- represented a `` flagrant challenge to ( the military 's ) authority '' and a `` declaration of confrontation with it . ''\nA spokesman for Morsy 's Freedom and Justice Party said that what started as a military coup was `` turning into something much more . ''\nIn an interview in Cairo , El-Haddad cited the arrests as `` very , very questionable attempts by the military to dismantle the Brotherhood . ''\nThough El-Haddad has had no direct communications with Morsy , sympathizers within the military were giving information to the Brotherhood , he said .\nThe former head of the Muslim Brotherhood , Mohamed Mahdi Akef , and his bodyguards were arrested Thursday in Cairo with four weapons in their possession , according to MENA , which cited security sources .\nAlso arrested was the Muslim Brotherhood 's current leader Mohamed Badei , Egyptian state broadcaster Nile TV reported Thursday .\nBadei was arrested for `` incitement to murder , '' according to the arrest report cited by Al-Ahram .\nPolice are seeking another 300 members of the Muslim Brotherhood , Al-Ahram reported .\nOn Wednesday , police closed the studios of pro-Muslim Brotherhood television stations Misr 25 , The People and al-Hafez and arrested some of the journalists , according to Al-Ahram .\nThe Egyptian military also called Thursday for calm and unity , saying Egyptian values `` do not allow for gloating or revenge between different groups '' or for the destruction of private and public property , according to a statement posted on the Facebook page of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces .\nEven so , sporadic violence at times pitted Morsy 's supporters against the opposition and the military , raising fears of spiraling unrest .\nMore than 100 people were wounded and at least two people , believed to be children , were killed in clashes across the country on Thursday , according to state media .\nViolence was reported at a pro-Morsy rally Thursday in the northern city of Zagazig , Nile TV reported , citing security officials .\nAn Egyptian soldier was killed and two were wounded when rockets were fired at a police station in Rafah , on the border between Egypt and Gaza , news agencies , including Reuters and AFP , reported early Friday .\nRocket-propelled grenades were also fired at army checkpoints near the El Arish International Airport in the Sinai , near the border with Gaza , the agencies reported .\nIt was not immediately known if the attacks were connected to the overthrow of Morsy .\nOn its website , the Muslim Brotherhood declared `` our unequivocal rejection of the military coup against the elected president and the will of the nation and refuse to participate in any action with the authority that stole the power and dealt violently with peaceful demonstrators . ''\nIt added , `` Mohamed Morsy , president of Egypt , stresses that the measures that were announced by the General Command of the Armed Forces represent a full-fledged military coup which is unacceptable by every free person .

It said in a tweet that it had nominated Mohamed ElBaradei , an opposition leader , to become prime minister .\nElBaradei told CNN on Thursday that Morsy 's ouster was not a coup but was instead a `` correction of the uprising of 2011 .
