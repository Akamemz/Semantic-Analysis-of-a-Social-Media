We are working overtime to improve it every day.\" Hide Caption 2 of 18 Photos: Key players in the health care hearings Key players in the health care hearings \u2013 Amid Republican calls for her resignation, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius provided a personal mea culpa October 30 as she testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"In these early weeks, access to HealthCare.gov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans,\" she said. Speaking directly to Americans confronting the site problems, Sebelius added: \"You deserve better. I apologize. I'm accountable to you for fixing these problems.\" Hide Caption 3 of 18 Photos: Key players in the health care hearings Key players in the health care hearings \u2013 Marilyn Tavenner is the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which is part of HHS. Tavenner testified October 29 before the House Ways and Means Committee about the Obamacare enrollment website and became the first administration official to apologize for the site's performance problems. \"I want to apologize to you that the website does not work as well as it should,\" she said, adding that HealthCare.gov \"can and will be fixed.\" Hide Caption 4 of 18 Photos: Key players in the health care hearings Key players in the health care hearings \u2013 Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan, is the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the first congressional committee to hold hearings on the troubled Obamacare enrollment site.

Henry Waxman, D-California, is the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. During the committee's October 30 hearing Waxman said that \"the worst abuses of the insurance industry will be halted\" by Obamacare.

Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and is also the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

Frank Pallone, D-New Jersey, made waves on Twitter when he called the October 24 hearing on the Obamacare enrollment site's problems a \"monkey court.\" Pallone made the comment when a Republican lawmaker at the hearing interrupted Pallone and asked him to yield his remaining allotted time to speak. Hide Caption 9 of 18 Photos: Key players in the health care hearings Key players in the health care hearings \u2013 Cheryl Campbell is a senior vice president of CGI Federal, a contractor for the troubled website. \"In principle, it worked,\" Campbell said at the October 24 hearing when asked by a lawmaker about the product her company delivered for use by the public on October 1. \"It's not working great, and we're working to improve it. But it is enrolling people.\" After Campbell testified, CNN obtained a confidential September 2013 report from CGI to CMS that warned of a number of open risks and issues for the site even as company executives were testifying publicly that the project had achieved key milestones.

Aaron Schock, R-Illinois, confronted Tavenner on October 29 with anecdotal evidence from a constituent about changes to the individual insurance market linked to the implementation of Obamacare, changes that undermine Obama's oft-repeated pledge that \"if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\" \"She has health insurance that she likes. She's been paying her premium. She wants to keep it. But she can't,\" Schock said. \"Isn't that a lie?\" Hide Caption 16 of 18 Photos: Key players in the health care hearings Key players in the health care hearings \u2013 Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-New Jersey lambasted Republicans on October 29 for choosing to pile on the website woes instead of working with Democrats to improve Obamacare. Pascrell pointed out that his party worked with the GOP to improve the Bush administration's Medicare prescription drug benefit even though Democrats opposed the new program. \"We lost the policy fight\" then but chose to help make the program work instead of trying to discredit or undermine it. \"How many of you stood up to do that?\" the Democrat asked of his GOP colleagues, \"None. Zero. Zero.\" Hide Caption 17 of 18 Photos: Key players in the health care hearings Key players in the health care hearings \u2013 Jeff Zients, former acting director of the White House Office of Budget and Management, has been tapped by the administration to provide advice to HHS as the federal agency works to resolve the problems with the Obamacare enrollment site.
