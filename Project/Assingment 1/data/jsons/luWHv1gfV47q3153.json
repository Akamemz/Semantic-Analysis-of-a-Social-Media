But that can wait , \u201d she said in an interview with the Monitor . \u201c Right now there is an urgent need for people to be helped and saved . \u201d\nWith more than 140 people dying every day in the US from drug overdoses , addiction treatment has become a growth industry across the country . South Florida , in particular , is a national destination for those seeking treatment .\nIt isn \u2019 t just Florida \u2019 s warm and sunny weather . Those suffering under addiction are targeted by aggressive marketing tactics featuring national advertising and patient recruiters .\nIn the process , Florida has also become a prime location for unscrupulous drug treatment centers that seek to recruit young addicts covered by their parents \u2019 insurance policies . Many of the \u201c patients \u201d are allowed to continue to use drugs while the treatment center overcharges their parents \u2019 insurance policy for unnecessary drug tests and other unneeded services .\nFederal , state , and local authorities are cracking down , but the insurance scams continue .\nFlory says chief among her mistakes was assuming that everyone in the drug treatment industry was honest and actually cared about the well-being of her daughter .\n\u201c I think people need to know , there are scam artists out there , \u201d she says . \u201c Don \u2019 t just send your kid to Florida and expect a miracle . \u201d\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t know the industry wasn \u2019 t [ closely ] regulated . I didn \u2019 t know that addiction treatment wasn \u2019 t under the supervision of a doctor at all times , \u201d Flory says . \u201c I was picturing white lab coats and stuff like that . I didn \u2019 t know . I didn \u2019 t know any of it . \u201d\nInstead of being helped along a road to recovery to a new life , Flory \u2019 s daughter was recruited away from an effective drug treatment program and lured into a sham program .\nAs reported in the first part of this two-part series , the program , Reflections Treatment Center in Margate , Fla. , was set up largely as a mechanism to overcharge health insurance policies for unnecessary tests and treatments at inflated prices . As the operators of the treatment center grew richer , Flory \u2019 s daughter experienced relapse after relapse while living in a fake \u201c sober home \u201d where illicit drug use was permitted .\nIt was in one such sober home where , on Oct. 14 , Alison and one of her housemates , Nicole De La Pena , smoked crack cocaine laced with the synthetic opiate carfentanil . Alison passed out and never woke up . Nicole spent a week in the hospital and is suffering from memory loss .\nAlthough Reflections was later raided by the FBI and shut down , many other treatment centers and sober homes in South Florida are continuing to operate under a similar business model based on insurance fraud .\nCriminal investigations are ongoing . And a special task force is exploring how to reform the sober home industry to weed out bad actors .\nIn the meantime , parents are continuing to struggle to identify legitimate and effective treatment centers and recovery residences . Flory and other mothers of addicts are part of an informal support network that offers help and advice to those seeking to identify quality treatment centers and avoid the fraudsters .\nFlory and Johanna De La Pena , Nicole \u2019 s mother , both offer the same essential piece of advice to parents or loved ones of an addict seeking treatment : Talk to other moms of addicts .\nBoth of them say that parents and others researching rehab programs are at a significant disadvantage when trying to differentiate legitimate treatment centers and recovery residences from the bad actors in the industry .\nThe issue of selecting a treatment center and recovery residence arises at a time of crisis not only in the life of the addict , but also in the lives of those affected family members who are attempting to help the addict . In other words , the addict isn \u2019 t the only one whose life is in turmoil .\nThese vulnerable family members are confronted by a well-organized , well-funded , and in some cases highly deceptive marketing effort designed to attract and recruit new patients .

I would have researched the facilities more . I would have gotten references . \u201d\nShe says when her daughter agreed to enter treatment in Florida , she was so desperate to do something to help her daughter that she did not fully investigate the drug treatment industry .\n\u201c At the time my daughter was sent off to Florida I was still kind of in denial about her addiction , \u201d De La Pena says . \u201c In my hometown , we don \u2019 t really talk about this . \u201d\nExperts stress that not all drug treatment centers in Florida are engaged in health-care fraud . There are many long-established , reputable , and effective treatment facilities in the state . One key piece of advice offered by many experts and many parents of addicts : Find a reputable treatment center and stay there . Resist patient recruiters , they say .\nThe difficulty is being able to ignore fancy advertisements and slick website presentations to identify a truly reputable treatment center . Equally important is the ability to identify legitimate recovery residences and bypass fake sober homes , flop houses , and drug dens .\nAddiction recovery specialists suggest parents and other loved ones ask a few key questions :\nIs the recovery residence certified by the Florida Association of Recovery Residences ? If not , look elsewhere .\nDoes the sober home offer residents free rent and money for food ? Experts say residents should pay their own way . Offers of free rent or other benefits can be evidence of illegal patient brokering .\nIs the recovery residence coed ? Experts say sober homes should be segregated by gender and not facilitate dating-type relationships between patients , which in the early stages of drug treatment can take the focus off recovery and make relapse more likely .\nIs the staff of the sober home trained in CPR ? Do they have a supply of naloxone in the house for use as an emergency antidote in the event of an overdose ?\nAre random drug tests performed ? How much do they cost ? Such tests should cost $ 5 to $ 10 .\nAre referral fees paid to the sober home from a drug treatment center if residents enroll at that center ? If so , it suggests the presence of an illegal kickback scheme , specialists say .\nFor some parents , dealing with a child who is an addict requires not only fortitude but strategy and cunning .\nAfter spending a week at her daughter \u2019 s bedside at a South Florida hospital following Nicole \u2019 s overdose in October , De La Pena decided it would be best to take her daughter home to Texas .\nShe arranged for security officers to accompany them from the hospital to the airport until they safely boarded their flight . As they entered the line for TSA screening , Nicole saw an opening .\n\u201c She just started running and I couldn \u2019 t get to her , \u201d De La Pena says . Nicole apparently wanted to be with her boyfriend , who was also in a drug treatment program .\nIt took two months of pleading on the telephone before Nicole agreed to return to her mother \u2019 s house in Texas . Soon , Nicole began plotting her return to Florida .\nDe La Pena refused to pay for a flight to Florida . But that didn \u2019 t stop Nicole \u2019 s boyfriend from pulling strings to arrange a \u201c free \u201d Texas-Florida flight .\n\u201c These kids already know that they can get free flights back to Florida , so when she was here she was already planning it , \u201d De La Pena says .\nThe mother says she was able to intercept and stop attempts by two different treatment centers to send a free ticket to Nicole . It is a common recruitment tactic to offer to pay for airfare to Florida if the would-be patient has health insurance and is willing to enroll in their treatment program .\nMaureen Kielian is the Florida director of the anti-drug group Steered Straight and a member of the Sober Homes Task Force . She says there is a relatively easy way to determine if a treatment center is engaging in an illegal activity such as patient brokering \u2013 offering something to a prospective patient in exchange for their agreement to enroll in a particular treatment program .\n\u201c If they are being offered anything free , they are being brokered , \u201d she says . \u201c The way to think about it is if my son had leukemia , would this be happening ? \u201d she says . \u201c Would they be flying you in for treatment ? Would they be offering you free anything ? No . \u201d\nAfter dealing with her daughter \u2019 s overdose , De La Pena knew about patient brokering and was twice able to intercept and block free plane tickets meant for Nicole .\n\u201c Then one of them did purchase her a ticket , \u201d she says . \u201c It was late at night when I saw it and I personally contacted the person and told them they better cancel . They were really ugly and rude . So I told them I am canceling my insurance because I know that is the only reason they wanted her out there . They said , no , we \u2019 ve already verified the coverage. \u201d De La Pena upped the pressure . She told them what they were doing was illegal . They disagreed .\nAfter the telephone call ended , De La Pena sent them a text message with the business card of an official with an anti-fraud task force in South Florida . She repeated her statement that what they were doing was illegal . \u201c Within minutes he texted me back , saying that he had canceled the flight , \u201d she says .\n\u201c The next morning , my daughter did not know that I had canceled the flight , \u201d she says . \u201c I was asleep at six in the morning when she got a ride to the airport . \u201d\nDe La Pena sent a text message to her daughter who , by then , was stranded at the airport . The message : Give your mom a call when you are ready for a ride home . Nicole called her grandmother for a ride .\nThe time away from Florida has been good for her daughter , De La Pena says . Nicole has a job and has been drug-free for three months .
