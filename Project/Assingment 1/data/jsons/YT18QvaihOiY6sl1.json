They show a coronavirus germ superimposed over a world map , with slogans such as `` Together we fought the unseen enemy '' and `` Everyday heroes suited up '' . The site says profits will be donated to hospitals .\nSet up by President Harry S Truman in 1946 , the gift shop was transferred to a private company years ago , which now holds the trademark for `` White House Gift Shop '' .\nThe site previously came to media attention in 2018 when it sold coins commemorating Donald Trump 's Singapore summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un .\nA video in which two American doctors argue for an end to lockdown measures has sparked controversy .\nThe video of a press conference , broadcast on a local TV station in California , was viewed millions of times on YouTube and Facebook . It was Tweeted by Elon Musk , who has 33 million followers and is becoming increasingly vocal in his opposition to shutdown measures .\nIn the video Dr Daniel Erickson and Dr Artin Messihi argue for an end to the lockdown based on the data they have collected from their private clinics . They draw sweeping conclusions from their unrepresentative sample , and claim the flu is similar in prevalence and death rates .\nIt 's very hard to establish what proportion of people die after catching coronavirus because no country has yet carried out random testing on a scale that could help us understand how many people actually have it .\nYou certainly ca n't do it from the limited data you get from the people who were tested in a few clinics .\nThe best current estimates are that the Covid-19 death rate is just under 1 % and for flu it 's 0.1 % . These are estimates , which would need large-scale random testing to verify .\nOn Monday , as the video garnered more views , two professional medical associations , the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine , issued a joint statement condemning the doctors ' `` reckless and untested musings '' .\nThe medical associations said the conclusions reached in the doctors ' video were inconsistent with current science and epidemiology regarding Covid-19 , adding : `` It appears these two individuals are releasing biased , non-peer-reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the public 's health .
