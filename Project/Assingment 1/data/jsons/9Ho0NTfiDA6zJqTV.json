    "content": "Others argue that \u201c Biden was almost the only one on the stage who talked like a normal person . There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep \u2018 punching \u2019 at it\u2026 I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\nMany note that \u201c Biden \u2019 s opposition to [ marijuana ] legalization\u2026 puts him at odds with the great majority of Democrats , 75-plus percent of whom back legalization . Biden \u2019 s opposition even puts him at odds with the median Republican , with polls showing that even a majority of Republicans support legalization . Politically , then , legalization should be low-hanging fruit \u2026 Yet Biden is not quite there\u2026 It \u2019 s an especially bad look for Biden . He has a long record of pushing for punitive criminal justice and drug policies \u2014 not just supporting but actually writing many of the laws in the 1980s and \u2019 90s that helped shape America \u2019 s modern war on drugs . For Biden to hang on to marijuana prohibition , then , just reinforces one of the major concerns that criminal justice reformers like Booker have about him. \u201d German Lopez , Vox\n\u201c An important reason NATO has held together for 70 years is the common perception of the threat posed by the Soviet Union and , more recently , Russia . But core members of the alliance no longer agree on this . Turkey is buying arms from Moscow , including missile systems that endanger NATO defenses\u2026 Trump has been cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin at every opportunity , against the advice of his entire military and intelligence community . Macron is ambivalent at best . Nor is there consensus over the other threats to the West : terrorism , cyberwarfare , China\u2026 some NATO members see China more as a source of money than menace\u2026 \u201c Even if most member states were to agree on what constitutes a threat , it doesn \u2019 t automatically follow that NATO is the best shield . Cyberwarfare requires subtler , more secretive approaches than the alliance is capable of deploying , and counterterrorism calls for swift , supple responses \u2014 not the kind of thing you leave to a giant multinational bureaucracy . Taking on China may require a North Pacific Treaty Organization , in which European militaries would play only a small part . This doesn \u2019 t mean NATO is no longer relevant . It is relevant for the same reason it was at its founding : the potent threat of Moscow . Getting all the members to recognize this , and to act accordingly\u2026 will take political leadership of a high order from the most powerful members . Nothing said or done in London this week suggested such leadership is at hand. \u201d Bobby Ghosh , Bloomberg\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s most egregious mistake , though , was his failure to support clearly and unequivocally the key provision of the NATO treaty , Article V , which calls on member states to come to one another \u2019 s defense when attacked . He has had several opportunities to do so but has hedged each time . This is of major concern to allied leaders , who want NATO adversaries such as Vladimir Putin to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the U.S. and its allies will defend Estonia or Latvia should Russian forces cross their borders\u2026 \u201c Article V has been invoked just once in NATO history , when the European allies and Canada vowed to come to our defense after the 9/11 attacks\u2026 Each ally went into Afghanistan with us . They and other partner nations have suffered more than 1,000 combat deaths there , with many more thousands wounded\u2026 \u201c Trump appears entirely indifferent to the clear , decisive advantage over Russia and China that the United States enjoys because of our European ties . We have 28 allies in NATO , as well as treaty allies in Japan , South Korea , and Australia in the western Pacific , who will defend us when our backs are against the wall . This is the great power differential we enjoy with Moscow and Beijing . \u201d Nicholas Burns , The Atlantic\n\u201c Trump is right to push for greater financial commitment from NATO members , and he can rightly claim their increased defense spending as a foreign policy achievement . But he takes it a step too far when he mischaracterizes the expenditures as money for the United States\u2026 NATO has provided Europe decades of political and economic stability . The achievement comes at rock-bottom prices compared with cost of wars . Trifling with the alliance 's core principle of collective defense only makes matters worse . If 20th century history teaches anything , it 's that conflicts in Europe inevitably pull in the United States. \u201d Editorial Board , USA Today\n\u201c France is certainly not alone in its political frustration with NATO nor is it singularly disruptive . Turkey is an equally disruptive member of the alliance , as is the US of course . But vigorous and at times acrimonious political debates are what make NATO work -- despite the discomfort it brings to the mandarins -- during internationally transformative moments like the one we are living through at present\u2026 What has always set NATO apart as an alliance has been its political dialogue . Unfortunately , the depth and quality of NATO 's political dialogue has also been sacrificed at the altar of preserving NATO unity at all costs. \u201d Heather A. Conley , CNN\n\u201c Given Trump 's thin skin , he surely took Macron 's comments personally . And in fairness to Trump , Macron 's words could be read as \u2014 and likely were \u2014 a stab at Trump 's leadership within the organization\u2026 \u201c Is Trump the only one allowed to criticize NATO ? It was odd , not to mention hypocritical , to watch Trump \u2014 NATO slayer par excellence and critic of America 's freeloading allies \u2014 emerge as a seeming defender of the alliance against the \u2018 very , very nasty \u2019 and \u2018 very disrespectful \u2019 comments made by Macron in an interview with the Economist where the French president disparaged the organization . One can be forgiven for thinking about the proverbial pot calling the kettle black . Was n't this the same guy who has consistently blasted the alliance for no longer serving a purpose and being filled with members that are n't meeting their military spending obligations ? \u201d Aaron David Miller , CNN\nThe right sees the summit as a success and calls for European countries to spend more on defense .\nThe right sees the summit as a success and calls for European countries to spend more on defense .\n\u201c Despite hyperbolic media coverage which suggests the world 's most successful multilateral alliance is dying , the NATO summit in London , which concluded on Wednesday , was a huge success . First off , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan backed away from a previous threat to block improved NATO support for the Baltic states and Poland\u2026\n\u201c This is a positive development which suggests that Turkey might reconsider its increasing deference to Vladimir Putin . The Russian leader , after all , will be unhappy with Erdogan for backing NATO 's Baltic security strategy . Moreover , agreement on that security strategy is a big deal in and of itself . The primary threat to NATO 's security envelope is a potential Russian blitzkrieg combined arms offensive into the Baltics or through Belarus into Poland . With the 29-member alliance now unified in upgrading its support to those nations\u2026 Russia faces a new deterrent . \u201d\n\u201c The president should make clear to our NATO allies that they need to spend more on their defense to keep NATO relevant\u2026 Nations like Germany \u2013 which are among the richest on the planet and can surely defend themselves against Russia \u2013 need to meet such an obligation . If they can \u2019 t \u2013 or if they simply won \u2019 t \u2013 America has the right to reconsider its commitments to NATO , and whether NATO needs to exist\u2026\n\u201c Study after study shows that NATO , in many combat scenarios , would lose in a military conflict against Russia . This is absurd . NATO nations should have all of the resources they need to take on a Russia if necessary . Russia \u2019 s economy , after all , is roughly only the size of Italy . The good news is that Trump \u2019 s words have had an impact\u2026 [ As of 2018 ] NATO nations \u2013 excluding the U.S. \u2013 were on pace to spend $ 100 billion more on their own defense by the end of this year\u2026 Would any of this have happened if not for President Trump \u2019 s tough talk ? Likely not . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s really no good excuse for any member nation failing to hit that 2 percent threshold\u2026 What makes the low percentages particularly infuriating is that NATO allows countries to define \u2018 military spending \u2019 pretty broadly . A NATO country doesn \u2019 t have to spend more on fighter jets and tanks to hit that threshold ; the alliance guideline is to spend 20 percent of the military budget on equipment . If a country wants to spend more beefing up its capabilities in search-and-rescue or disaster response , or radar systems that would help with civilian air traffic control as well , they can do that\u2026\n\u201c Let \u2019 s say you \u2019 re a left-leaning European government that thinks guns are icky but likes spending more on government . Pay raises for military personnel and their pension systems counts as military spending ! Ammunition for training , petroleum products , spare parts , rents , engineering equipment , transport vehicles , research and development\u2026 all of that counts towards a country \u2019 s military spending under NATO rules . Come on , guys . Just a little effort , and you would leave the president with a lot less to complain about . \u201d\n\u201c Yes , [ Trump ] is unpopular in Europe , but his approval level among Europeans isn \u2019 t much different from that of George W. Bush in his day . And while Reagan was cheered for saying \u2018 tear down that wall , \u2019 he was also the target of anti-nuclear riots across Europe over the deployment of U.S. intermediate-range nuclear missiles\u2014criticism far more intense than anything faced by Trump . Whether it happens at home or abroad , trashing the U.S. president is par for the course . \u201d\n\u201c For those who cling to NATO as a bulwark against Russian revanchism , it is worth pointing out that Russia is not the Soviet Union . Before it collapsed , the Soviet Union had the second largest economy in the world , after the U.S. Today , Texas has a bigger economy\u2026 [ Moreover ] Europe is rich enough to provide for its own defense without American forces acting as a security blanket\u2026\n\u201c None of this necessarily implies that NATO needs to immediately dissolve , but at the very least it needs to be reformed . It should stop adding small , insignificant countries that bring more burden than defense \u2014 not to mention giving states like Montenegro the same veto power the U.S. has in the alliance . There needs to be a mechanism for expelling members , including Turkey , that are ostensibly acting contrary to the alliance \u2019 s stated purpose while flaunting their membership . The number of U.S. troops stationed in Europe needs to decline , so those nations will be incentivized to protect themselves\u2026\n\u201c The world is dynamic and context-specific . U.S. security alliances should be too . Viewing NATO and other treaties as sacred invites stale thinking and counterproductive policy while shutting out consideration of workable alternatives . The Cold War ended 30 years ago . It \u2019 s time western nations finally act like it . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
