    "content": "The 2018 midterms were a disaster for House Republicans . Democrats gained 40 seats , retook the majority , and , to our horror , Nancy Pelosi is speaker again . They were elected to stop Trump , to block him at every turn , and lead the effort for his impeachment and removal from office . Any Democrat who says otherwise is lying . The base demands Trump go at all costs . The younger , feistier Democrats say that openly . The older crew tries to downplay it , but ultimately that \u2019 s their goal . They \u2019 re banking heavily that the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller , who is leading the DOJ \u2019 s Russia probe , finds something impeachable . Don \u2019 t hold your breath on that ; the Russia collusion allegation has been what \u2019 s kept Democrats hopeful since 2016 . Yet , while doing battle with the Trump White House is a top priority , the progressive Left also wants to clean house in the Democratic Party as well . The party elite is reportedly trying to rein in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) , as they view her antics to be distracting , but they \u2019 re also not pleased that she \u2019 s willing to help boot fellow Democrats who are viewed as too moderate . Shots have been fired inside the ship ( via Politico ) :\nI \u2019 m sure Ms. Cortez means well , but there \u2019 s almost an outstanding rule : Don \u2019 t attack your own people , \u201d said Rep.

But their frustration goes beyond that : Democratic leaders are upset that she railed against their new set of House rules on Twitter the first week of the new Congress . Rank and file are peeved that there \u2019 s a grassroots movement to try to win her a top committee post they feel she doesn \u2019 t deserve .\nGQ added that the reason why the Democrats were so successful in House races in 2018 was due to candidates like Ocasio-Cortez :\nWhat Democrats like those quoted here still do not understand , apparently , is that Ocasio-Cortez 's failure to morph into a country club politician is the whole point : It is the reason people like her , and see her as perhaps capable of advancing policy proposals on which Democrats , despite their alleged best efforts , have not yet been willing or able to deliver . If she were another backslap-happy centrist who prioritized the accumulation of seniority above the promotion of an ambitious progressive agenda , she 'd be Joe Crowley . Voters in her district were tired of Joe Crowley , whose each term was the same as the last , which is why they did n't elect him again . Speaking of which : Sniping at Ocasio-Cortez like this is a habit that Democrats develop at their own peril .

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is poised to take seats on the powerful House Financial Services Committee , posing a big challenge for new Chairwoman Maxine Waters . Waters , a Los Angeles Democrat , is a liberal icon in her own right .
