    "content": "Winning has been Donald Trump \u2019 s cure for all of his failings this campaign . But while his failings have been on full display this week , a Wisconsin win on Tuesday looks unlikely .\nTrump trails Ted Cruz in each of the last six major polls , including a Marquette University Law School survey last week that put Cruz in first place with 40 percent of the GOP primary vote , leading Trump by 10 percentage points .\nIf those results hold , Cruz would not only win Wisconsin , but he \u2019 d take the lion \u2019 s share of the state \u2019 s 42 delegates thanks to Wisconsin \u2019 s \u201c winner-take-most \u201d primary rules . Those are delegates Trump badly needs to stay on a narrow path toward the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the GOP nomination before a possible contested convention .\nAnd Trump \u2019 s chase for 1,237 has taken on new urgency last week , as Trump \u2019 s rivals repeatedly outfoxed him in the behind-the-scenes struggle to install favorable convention delegates in state after state and Trump himself courted fresh controversy with Republican primary voters .\nNone of this is new for Trump . In the run-up to the election , Trump answered every critique with his surging poll numbers . And since the voting began , his string of wins and massive delegate lead has been an effective rebuttal to anyone attempting to pick apart his political heterodoxies and disorganized campaign . But his campaign faces fresh problems ahead of the only primary contest for the next two weeks .\nThe problems only got worse over the weekend . In Tennessee , where delegates will be able to vote freely after two ballots at the convention , the Trump campaign accused party officials of making a last-minute push to approve anti-Trump delegates . Trump supporters rushed a party meeting where delegates were being selected , but the party voted its slate through anyway .\nAnd in North Dakota , where delegates are free to vote how they want from the start , only one of the 25 delegates picked at the state party gathering this weekend is publicly supporting Trump . 18 of those 25 slots , however , were filled by candidates on Cruz \u2019 s preferred slate .\nWhile primary or caucus results determine almost all of the delegates \u2019 first-ballot votes , if that ballot fails to produce a winner , many of the delegates are free to vote how they choose in later rounds . And as \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported last week , those delegates are ready to flee Trump in droves .\nTrump did little to help himself in the past week , generating a string of controversies over his Twitter treatment of Cruz \u2019 s wife and whiplash-inducing shifts on punishments for women who have abortions . The businessman \u2019 s campaign did little to pick up the slack , with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski getting charged with simple battery over his rough treatment of a reporter on the campaign trail .\nRegardless of Tuesday \u2019 s results , Trump will end the day still firmly in first place , but the campaign foundation has worrisome cracks . And unless Trump can pull off a Wisconsin upset , he \u2019 ll end Tuesday with out a win to paper them over .\nWisconsin Republicans will dole out 42 delegates Tuesday . Here \u2019 s what to watch for .\nWisconsin uses a hybrid system to dole out its 42 delegates . The statewide winner gets 18 delegates . The other 24 are allocated based on the results in the state \u2019 s eight congressional districts , with the winner in each district claiming all three of its delegates .\nAs for the people who will actually fill those delegate slots and go to the Republican National Convention , that \u2019 s complicated too . Of the 18 at-large slots for delegates for the statewide winner , three are members of the Republican National Committee , while the other 15 are chosen at the state convention in May . The delegates for the 24 district-level slots will be filled at various district caucuses over the next month .\nWhen the chosen delegates arrive in Cleveland in July , they \u2019 re bound to vote according to the results of the primary . That \u2019 s true on the first ballot as well as subsequent ballots , barring two conditions : The delegates become unbound if the candidate releases them , and they become unbound if the candidate they \u2019 re standing for receives less than a third of the vote on any given ballot .\nIsn \u2019 t this like every other time Trump was supposedly \u201c in trouble ? \u201d\nTrump has continually disproven his would-be Cassandras , who in the campaign \u2019 s earlier stages were eager to declare each Trump controversy a fatal one . Those predictions , however , were largely based on a similar premise : that Trump \u2019 s latest flap would be the one to finally drive away his supporters .\nIn Wisconsin , however , Trump \u2019 s problem isn \u2019 t that he \u2019 s losing support . It \u2019 s that he \u2019 s not gaining any and his rivals are .\nWhen the Marquette University Law School poll surveyed state Republicans in February , Trump \u2019 s sat at 30 percent , good enough for an 11-point lead over Cruz . In Marquette \u2019 s latest poll , Trump was still at 30 percent \u2014 but now 10 points behind a surging Cruz .\nThe good news for Trump is that polls have him crushing the competition in the next contest , a New York primary on April 19 with 95 delegates at stake . But Trump \u2019 s safest path to the nomination is to clinch it with a majority of delegates , and poll results like Wisconsin \u2019 s make it unclear how he can do that without broadening his base of support .\nMeanwhile , Cruz \u2019 s identity as the lone candidate who can defeat Trump will be tested in Wisconsin .\nAt this point , the biggest risk to Cruz appears to be John Kasich , who , with poll support consistently in the high teens and low twenties , is unlikely to win . But he could still play Cruz spoiler , pulling anti-Trump votes away from Cruz and paving the way for the billionaire to once again take advantage of a fractured field .\nThe senator is bolstered by the state party \u2019 s anti-Trump movement , which has been almost uniquely unambiguous in favoring Cruz over Kasich . Cruz is also no longer splitting votes with Marco Rubio , his super PAC has attacked Kasich in the last week , he has the endorsement of Gov . Scott Walker and major party players , and he is benefitting from a primary immediately following one Trump \u2019 s most tumultuous weeks of the entire campaign .\nIf Cruz can \u2019 t win there and now , then where and when ?\nWisconsin boasts distinct strains of conservatism concentrated in the state \u2019 s different regions . They have put up a united front in recent elections , especially Democrats \u2019 efforts to oust Walker , but the divisions could show in the primary .\nThe establishment \u2019 s power is concentrated in the suburbs and counties surrounding Milwaukee \u2014 the state \u2019 s most populous area . It \u2019 s a political powerhouse filled with affluent conservatives , many of whom have united behind Cruz in an attempt to take down Trump ( though not without a wandering eye or two in the direction of Paul Ryan ) .\nTrump \u2019 s hope for overcoming that coalition is two-fold . He needs to turn out anti-establishment Republicans in the state \u2019 s rural areas , and , as Wisconsin Republicans have an open primary , he needs to rope in independents and new voters . Trump has long said that blue-collar independent voters will flock to him , and Wisconsin \u2014 with places like Milwaukee , Janesville , Racine and Beloit that have felt the sting of deindustrialization \u2014 would seem a solid place to back up that claim .",
