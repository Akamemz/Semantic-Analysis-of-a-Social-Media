    "content_original": "That\u2019s the context for President-elect Trump\u2019s statement after a man murdered Russian Ambassador Andrey Karlov at an art gallery last Monday in Turkey\u2019s capital, Ankara. Just before committing the act, the killer had shouted in Arabic: \u201cGod is great! [NOTE: \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d] Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!\u201d and then, in Turkish: \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo! Don\u2019t forget Syria!\u201d Trump immediately released a statement characterizing the assassin as a \u201cradical Islamic terrorist.\u201d\n\nHow did Trump know this right away?
