    "content": "Last week , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed a drastic change in the way students are admitted to the city \u2019 s elite high schools .\nStudents gain entry to one of these eight \u201c specialized \u201d schools by scoring high enough on a single exam called the Specialized High School Admissions Test ( SHSAT ) . De Blasio has called for phasing out the exam and instead admitting the top students from each middle school .\nThis has prompted protests from Asian Americans who feel this policy disproportionately hurts them , as well as hand-wringing from graduates of these schools , who believe the move will lower the quality of the education at these institutions .\nFor decades , these elite schools have been a prime example of what a great secondary education could offer \u2014 but also a symbol of how rigged the system is . Since the 1970s , students , school officials , and even the US Office of Civil Rights have said that the admissions process hurts students of color .\nToday , about 70 percent of New York high schools are black and Hispanic \u2014 but they account for just 10 percent of students in New York \u2019 s specialized high schools .\nBy phasing out the test , de Blasio \u2019 s plan starts a process that would eventually make these schools about 45 percent black and Hispanic \u2014 much closer to citywide demographics .\nAnd the city predicts it will offer fewer seats to white students \u2014 but also significantly fewer seats to Asian students .\nFor many Asian Americans , the entrance exam represents their best bet to get a fair shot . You don \u2019 t need connections , you don \u2019 t need to be socially adept , and you aren \u2019 t judged by vague and subjective standards . Ace this test and you \u2019 re in .\nBut it \u2019 s tough to argue the current admissions process is fair \u2014 and not only because of the disproportionate demographics . Testing may seem like an objective process , but it often replicates the inequalities that public education is supposed to remedy . Indeed , the current system was put into law in the 1970s when white parents urged the state to institute a test-only system \u2014 a campaign that itself was pushing back against proposed changes to the process that would have admitted more black and Puerto Rican students to the schools .\nThis tension often hides in the subtext of political debates . Now it \u2019 s being spoken out loud .\n\u201d [ De Blasio ] never had this problem when Stuyvesant [ High School ] was all white . He never had this problem when Stuyvesant was all Jewish , \u201d Kenneth Chiu , the chair of the New York City Asian-American Democratic Club , told NY1 . Stuyvesant is one of New York \u2019 s eight specialized schools .\n\u201d All of a sudden , they see one too many Chinese and they say , \u2018 Hey , it isn \u2019 t right . \u2019 \u201d\nUntil now , the affirmative action debate has been squarely focused on elite college admissions .\nFor decades , Asian Americans have been accusing top colleges of imposing illegal quotas on Asian students , limiting the number of spots for them even as those institutions sought to bring in more black and Hispanic students . Opponents of affirmative action have used these grievances to challenge the law . There is currently a lawsuit against Harvard University , as well as a Justice Department investigation into this matter .\nThe accusations that colleges have quotas often come with the complaint that it means Asian Americans have to compete for a set number of seats among themselves . But applicants don \u2019 t know everyone else who is applying to Harvard or Yale , and it \u2019 s hard to pin down where you are on that totem pole .\nWith de Blasio \u2019 s plan , however , students will know exactly whom they \u2019 re competing against , and exactly how the ranking system works .\nFirst , de Blasio wants to reserve 20 percent of seats in specialized schools for students from high-poverty schools who didn \u2019 t meet the exam cutoff . In the next three years , he wants to phase out the entrance exam entirely and grant admission to students who are in the top 7 percent of each middle school \u2019 s graduating class , as determined by a combination of grades and state standardized tests .\nThe plan integrates schools by taking advantage of New York \u2019 s highly segregated geography .\nStudents in poor , segregated neighborhoods wouldn \u2019 t compete against students in rich neighborhoods ; instead , they \u2019 d compete against their neighbors , which guarantees a certain number of seats for each middle school . This is similar to the way the University of Texas has achieved diversity goals , which survived Supreme Court scrutiny in 2016 . The change would also end up capping the number of students from any given school .\nAll of this is by design \u2014 and , in fact , it \u2019 s the narrow way in which the Supreme Court said districts could pursue diversity .\nIn recent years , the number of Asian-Americans students has grown sharply at specialized schools , and it \u2019 s left fewer seats for black and Hispanic students . This plan would push back against that trend .\nWhen New York City \u2019 s new chancellor , Richard Carranza , was asked whether this plan pits minority groups against each other , he said , \u201c I just don \u2019 t buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admission to these schools . \u201d\nBut Asian-American leaders who oppose de Blasio \u2019 s plan insist their presence in specialized schools isn \u2019 t a sign of privilege .\nSoo Kim , president of the Stuyvesant Alumni Association , told the New York Times , \u201c Stuyvesant is an option for those who have no option . They don \u2019 t know how to interview or influence their way into the right public schools or the right private schools . \u201d\nOne specialized high school student told the New York Times in 2012 , \u201c Most of our parents don \u2019 t believe in \u2018 gifted. \u2019 It \u2019 s all about hard work . \u201d\nThis narrative is one that so many immigrants children have heard . It \u2019 s about being told to work harder than everyone else , because we are perpetual foreigners who will never be gifted anything . It \u2019 s why an exam-only process is so appealing ; there are no subjective judgments of character or culture \u2014 just right or wrong answers no one can dispute . It \u2019 s the context behind the growth of test prep services .\nAs Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen puts it , \u201c They study . They study hard . \u201d\nThis way of thinking , of course , implies everyone else isn \u2019 t working hard enough \u2014 and that \u2019 s why everyone else isn \u2019 t getting ahead . And this test affirms that belief .\nIt \u2019 s worth taking a step back and remembering that there really is something awry with the admissions process at specialized schools .\nNot only does the data clearly show that the test-only system created a subset of highly segregated , elite schools , but this system was put into law by white leaders who specifically wanted to limit the number of black and Puerto Rican students .\nSo , as Nikole Hannah-Jones argues , if we believe that black and Hispanic children are just as intelligent as white and Asian children , what exactly does this test measure ?\nOne answer is that it measures who has the resources to prep for this test . Schoolwork isn \u2019 t enough to prepare you . A large portion of Asian-American students take courses to optimize their scores on the SHSAT , and later they will likely take prep courses for the SAT . This , of course , takes money , time , and access . ( These critiques almost invariably lead to other microaggressions against Asians \u2014 that we are too focused on tests and academics , and it doesn \u2019 t make us well-rounded . Of course , that \u2019 s exactly what the system incentivized . )\nThe broader answer is that the test measures how American policies have engineered these racial dynamics .\nAmerican policies segregated black and brown families into poor neighborhoods and inadequate schools \u2014 and they continue to do so today . These policies have also fueled a massive racial wealth gap that continues to widen .\nAmerican policies also created a relatively new Asian-American population . Before the 1960s , US immigration policy was largely anti-Asian . But as the US became more receptive to Asian migration , it favored certain people : relatives of US residents , those with specialized skills , and refugees .\nMost of these immigrants couldn \u2019 t be considered wealthy by any means \u2014 especially in New York , where Asians have the highest poverty rate of any racial group .\nBut most of our families weren \u2019 t subjected to the same discriminatory policies that have kept black and Hispanic families in intergenerational poverty .\nThis test , like so many others , appears to disproportionately measure these engineered gaps .\nThere are other good schools . Why is this fight so charged ?\nThere are eight specialized schools in New York City that base admission solely on the SHSAT score , the most well-known of which are the Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant High School .\nTogether , these eight schools educate just 5 percent of New York City \u2019 s 310,000 high school students . There are plenty of other great high schools .\nBut the fight about affirmative action , especially around elite schools , gets so charged because it \u2019 s not just about education . As Harvard education professor Natasha Warikoo wrote in her recent book The Diversity Bargain , \u201c [ These schools ] are especially important for our understanding of meritocracy , because many see admissions to those universities as the ultimate demonstration of merit . \u201d\nOf course , merit is a completely made-up standard . It \u2019 s not an objective metric ; rather , it reflects our ideals .\nAfter all , in the 1970s , white leaders defined merit to limit the number of nonwhite students at the specialized schools . They believed not abiding by these definitions of merit would \u201c destroy the quality and special character of the institutions , \u201d according to a 1971 New York Times story .\nBut as Politico \u2019 s Eliza Shapiro reports , the city \u2019 s analysis shows that this new system wouldn \u2019 t dramatically change the average test scores or GPAs for specialized school students . In other words , it won \u2019 t lower the quality of the student body .\nRemoving the test , however , will change the definition of merit to reflect more equitable ideals .\nFor decades , New York \u2019 s elite schools used an exclusionary system to define merit \u2014 and Asian Americans have been wildly successful within this system .\nNow , for the better \u2014 but without their consultation \u2014 the definition of merit is changing .",
