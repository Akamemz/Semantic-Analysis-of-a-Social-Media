Here 's a look at their similarities and differences . ( Dwight Adams/IndyStar ) Wochit\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Tim Kaine describes himself as `` boring . '' Mike Pence calls himself a \u201c B-list Republican celebrity . \u201d\nNo one expects Tuesday 's debate between the two vice presidential nominees \u2014 Kaine , a Democratic senator from Virginia , and Pence , the Republican governor of Indiana \u2014 to draw the record-breaking 84 million people who watched the first faceoff between presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump .\nBut viewers who do tune in could be rewarded with a clearer sense of the differences between the two parties than could be gleaned from the Clinton-Trump debate .\n\u201c The vice presidential debate will be two competent politicians discussing issues , \u201d said Elaine Kamarck , an expert at the Brookings Institution . \u201c There won \u2019 t be the distraction that Trump , especially , brought to the presidential debate . \u201d\nNeither Kaine , 58 , nor Pence , 57 , had large national profiles when they were selected as vice presidential candidates . And both have been overshadowed by their well-known \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 running mates .\nAs a result , polls show more than one-third of voters don \u2019 t know enough about either to form an opinion .\n\u201c To some extent , this is still their introduction to a big part of the public , \u201d Joel Goldstein , a vice presidential expert at the Saint Louis University School of Law , said of Tuesday 's debate . \u201c Clinton and Trump have clearly been the focus , and Kaine and Pence are less-captivating , ( less- ) exciting figures . \u201d\nBoth running mates have long records in government and extensive public speaking experience , although this will be their first nationally televised debate .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got a sitting United States senator versus a former House member who spent years as a radio talk-show host , \u201d said Jim Manley , a Democratic strategist and former aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. \u201c As far as I \u2019 m concerned , they \u2019 re coming into the debate pretty even . Both are articulate and think well on their feet . \u201d\nBoth are also well-matched in temperament . Kaine and Pence are affable with low-key , sunny demeanors . They \u2019 re known as nice guys , even by those on the other side of the aisle .\nBut despite the value they place on civility , they \u2019 re not pushovers .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a consummate gentleman , but that doesn \u2019 t mean he isn \u2019 t tough , \u201d Wayne Turnage , who served as Kaine \u2019 s gubernatorial chief of staff , said of his former boss .\nTom Rose , a close friend and adviser to Pence , called Indiana \u2019 s governor a gracious man who will be very respectful .\nAt the debate , Pence likely will be more focused than Trump was in attacking Clinton \u2019 s vulnerabilities , including her use of a private email server while secretary of State , her comment that half of Trump \u2019 s supporters were a \u201c basket of deplorables , \u201d and allegations that the Clinton Foundation was part of a pay-to-play scheme . Throughout the campaign , Pence has been the more disciplined messenger \u2014 as well as a `` clarifier in chief '' \u2014 for some of Trump 's controversial remarks .\n\u201c Pence is much more of a normal politician than Trump is , \u201d Kamarck said . \u201c I think Pence will be sort of steady and try to calm people \u2019 s worries . \u201d\nKaine likely will challenge Pence on Trump \u2019 s comments about women , his business practices and his refusal to release his tax returns .\n\u201c I \u2019 m looking for Sen. Kaine to find new and creative ways to try and make Pence defend all sorts of Trump \u2019 s controversial comments , \u201d Manley said .\nPence undoubtedly will be asked about Trump 's recent criticisms of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado 's weight gain and his tweet that people should check out a sex tape of her . ( There 's no evidence such a tape exists . )\nAsked how Pence will address the issue , spokesman Marc Lotter said the Indiana governor is focused on the clear choice the election offers between Trump 's and Clinton 's visions for the future .\nKaine could repeat criticisms he \u2019 s made on the stump about the controversial \u201c religious freedom \u201d law Pence signed as governor .
