    "content": "Some concerned Democrats are worried that their party may have lost the key blue-wall states because of its elitism , manifested as disdain for Americans between the coasts .\nPerhaps emblematic of their worry is the strange metamorphosis of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s two presidential campaigns . In 2008 , as Bill Clinton 2.0 , she drank boilermakers , bragged about bowling and shooting , boasted about her resonance with the \u201c white \u201d working class , and clobbered Obama on his Pennsylvania clingers speech .\nBut after Obama \u2019 s win \u2014 and his assumed new formula of registering record numbers of minority voters and seeing them often vote in a bloc on the basis of racial solidarity \u2014 Clinton thought she too could follow this new pathway to Democratic victories . So she made the understandable political contortions\nThis time around , Clinton was bent on out-Obaming Obama \u2019 s \u201c clingers \u201d with her own \u201c deplorables \u201d and \u201c irredeemables. \u201d Her campaign was based on pandering to identity-politics groups \u2014 while she had cashed in on Wall Street in what can be fairly called a payola scheme with Bill to enrich the Clinton Foundation and thus indirectly themselves . The result was both a cultural and economic affront to what used to be the bedrock of the Democratic party .\nAmericans neither hate nor envy meritocratic elites . Here in one of the poorer areas of the nation in rural southwestern Fresno County , the poor admire the skilled surgeons who operate on their children . Most of the new agri-barons are up-by-their-bootstraps ethnics : Basques , Punjabis , and descendants of the Okie diaspora and the 1960s waves of immigrants from Mexico who may now farm more than 2,000 or 3,000 acres of orchards and vineyards and on paper be worth $ 10 or $ 15 million , though they dress in old clothes and drive run-down pickups . They are looked upon as success stories worthy of emulation because most talk and act like the people who work for and with them .\nSo perhaps what drives proverbially average Americans crazy is not the success and money of others , but the condescension and hypocrisy of what a particular elite says contrasted with how it lives : The disconnect recalls the Reverend Jimmy Swaggart , the televangelist who on Sunday mornings three decades ago used to break into tears as he loudly condemned the sins of the flesh , while he privately indulged his worldly appetites .\nElites , whose lifestyles lead them to burn lots of carbon , rail about the Paris accords to those who get by burning lots less . What is galling is to see how little the elites \u2019 green rhetoric is backed up by their green behavior . Could Hollywood celebrities at least for a year swear off the use of their private jets that emit more carbon emissions in a year than entire small towns in Ohio ?\nWhy do not college professors who are strident activists for climate change agree to limit their intercontinental jet trips to one a year ? Could our pundits and politicians who warn Middle America to brace for radical changes in their lifestyles at least agree to live in houses smaller than 2,500 square feet ?\nCould Hollywood celebrities at least for a year swear off the use of their private jets that emit more carbon emissions in a year than entire small towns in Ohio ?\nHow do our elites square the circle of identity politics and big money ? The notion that reparatory admissions and hiring are based on race and gender presupposes that past endemic bias has led to oppression that in turn had hit hard the livelihoods of the Other . But what happens when after a half-century of affirmative action , many who receive preferences are richer than those whom they accuse of white privilege ?\nOr is it more ironic than that ? Wealthy white college kids chant about the demon white privilege , going so far as to help demand racially segregated safe spaces , dorms , and , in one case currently in the news , temporary expulsion of white people from campus . They rage against a privilege that they enjoy and that their perceived targets \u2014 the unenlightened middle of America \u2014 do not . Yet one easy way of ending white privilege , to the extent that it exists , among elite enclaves would be to send one \u2019 s children to public high schools rich in diversity .\nOne wonders how many hecklers and disrupters at Middlebury College , to take one example , chose prep school when there were better opportunities to mingle with minorities at inner-city schools ? And if they really wished to address culpable whites , shouldn \u2019 t the college sponsor field trips to rural Pennsylvania or southern Ohio where such chanting demonstrators might more directly address the targets of their ire ?\nIf one believes that charter schools and vouchers weaken the public-school system , then an effective way to counter such challenges would be to put one \u2019 s own children in public classrooms rather than to deny the poor the ability to disconnect from the public schools for the same reasons that so many elites have . One of the most surreal paradoxes of Washington , D.C. , is the number of progressives ( including the former president of the United States ) who put their children in Sidwell-Friends while passionately opposing charter schools and vouchers .\nThe list of progressive paradoxes is limitless : handgun possession by the law-abiding is a supposed catalyst for violence , but not for security details who surround Hollywood and political celebrities . Elites lecture Americans on their supposed \u2013 isms and -ologies ( sexism , racism , nativism ) , but when such sins are endemic to Middle Eastern societies abroad or indeed among immigrant communities inside the West , they are paternalistically excused or ignored .\nCommon themes in rap music are misogyny , racism and calls for violence against police \u2014 the sort of career-ending lyrics for most other entertainers .\nWho thought the liberal civil rights of the 1960s would end in the neo-segregationist movements of the 2010s ?\nThe media are overwhelmingly progressive and critical of America for its supposed backward and unprogressive values . Yet reactionary ideas are most evident on the coastal corridors and on supposedly tolerant and liberal campuses . Who thought the liberal civil rights of the 1960s would end in the neo-segregationist movements of the 2010s , most recently at Evergreen College , where all whites were asked to leave the campus for a day while minority students shut down the campus ?\nYet visit liberal Silicon Valley or Hollywood boardrooms , and a self-described and purported meritocracy rules , which so far has resulted in few minorities in those corridors of influence and power .\nAll these hypocrisies raise the question among fly-over Americans about the entire politically correct progressive agenda of elites : Has it become reduced to a cynical sort of indemnity insurance that elites take out to lubricate their own privilege ? ( Will Bill Maher survive his use of the N-word , given his loud liberalism ? ) Al Gore got rich by creating a veritable global-warming-alarmist industry , only to offload his largely failed cable channel ( in a fire sale timed to help him beat anticipated higher capital-gains taxes ) to the gas- and oil-exporting autocracy of Qatar .
