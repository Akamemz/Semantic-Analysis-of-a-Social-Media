Here \u2019 s why midterm elections and chamber control matters . \u2588\u2588\u2588\nPoliticians often claim that whatever election is coming up is the most important in our lifetime , and the 2018 campaign has been no different .\nBut this time , it 's not just campaign hyperbole . Races on the ballot this year \u2013 often far down the ballot \u2013 could define the national political landscape for the next decade or more .\nThat 's because governors and state lawmakers elected in 2018 and 2020 will redo the congressional maps in 2021 \u2013 the single greatest factor in determining who will control Congress in the decade to come .\nThe tea party revolution of 2010 ushered Republicans into control of statehouses across the country , allowing the GOP to draw much of the current map \u2013 and to control the U.S. House for most of the last decade .\nThis year 's election could determine whether Republicans maintain their advantage in congressional races through 2031 , or if Democrats can tip the scales in their own favor .\n`` Democrats have been in the wilderness the past decade because they fell asleep on redistricting in 2010 , '' said David Daley , a senior fellow at Fair Vote and author of a book about the last redistricting .\nThat means they 'll have to start even earlier this time around .\n`` The key elections having influence on that process are almost entirely this year , '' Daley said . `` In many ways , it \u2019 s going to be over after Election Day 2018 . ''\nThe former Obama attorney general heads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee , a one-stop shop for Democratic groups to coordinate their strategy .\nIts mission : Win a more favorable playing field for Democrats by ensuring a complete count in the 2020 Census , removing barriers to voting , supporting ballot initiatives for redistricting reform , electing Democrats and challenging Republican-drawn districts in court .\nHe sees all of these as related issues : `` You see the greatest amount of voter suppression where you have the most gerrymandered states . ''\nThere 's no comparable group on the Republican side . The National Republican Redistricting Trust is focused more narrowly on giving state Republican parties technical and legal support .\n`` People have characterized the NRRT as a response to Eric Holder 's group , which it is not , '' said Adam Kincaid , the group 's director . `` The reason is because we don \u2019 t do elections . We 're focused specifically on litigation and data . ''\nHe says other GOP committees \u2013 the Republican Governor 's Association and the Republican State Leadership Committee \u2013 worry about candidates .\nWhere Holder sees redistricting as fundamentally broken and in need of reform , Kincaid sees no easy fix .\n`` The process is dirty as it is , '' he said . `` And I don \u2019 t mean that in a negative way . It 's just messy .\n`` There 's not a perfect process \u2013 which is what the founders acknowledged when they designed it this way . ''\nThe 2018 battle for control over the next redistricting is being fought on at least four fronts :\nStates use different methods of drawing congressional districts . Thirty-four put the state legislature in charge . In 32 of those states , the governor has veto power .\nThirty-six states will elect governors this year . Most of them will serve four-year terms , so they 'll still be in office three years from now , when the maps are to be redrawn .\nNot all states give their governors a role in the process . And some low-population states have only one congressional seat , so they do n't do redistricting .\nBut that still leaves 20 states in which the governor elected this year will have significant influence over congressional map drawing . And they happen to include some of the most gerrymandered states in the union : Michigan , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin .\nThose five swing states go either way in presidential elections : Obama won them all in 2008 , and Trump won them in 2016 . But in the House of Representatives , Republicans have been able to hold a 27-seat advantage in those five states for a solid decade .\nIn states with one-party control of the state legislature , a governor of the opposite party can use his or her veto to force a compromise map . That can also be important for Republicans in blue states : Illinois , Maryland and Massachusetts all have Democratic legislatures with incumbent Republican governors running for re-election this year .\nBut for Democrats trying to compete in states that have been dominated by the GOP , that 's a key part of the strategy .\n`` We need to ensure that Democrats are at least at the table in a way that we were not in 2011 , '' Holder says .\nBut Republicans say divided government more often leads to gridlock than compromise .\n`` They \u2019 re not looking at a seat at the table , '' Kincaid said . `` They \u2019 re looking at getting governors so they can kick these maps to the court . They want a court-drawn map . ''\nWith the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh , the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 already reluctant to weigh into partisan gerrymandering cases \u2013 could be still more hostile to redistricting challenges .\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January struck down a Republican-drawn map . The court cited a provision in the state constitution that requires elections to be `` free and equal . ''\nAt least 25 other state constitutions require elections to be `` free and equal '' or `` free and open , '' according to Bernard Grofman and Jonathan Cervas , political scientists at the University of California , Irvine .\n`` So you 're likely to see more litigation at the state level , '' Cervas said . `` That had never been the route until Pennsylvania . '' One exception : Florida , where voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 explicitly banning partisan gerrymandering .\nSo now Holder 's group is looking to elect more Democratic judges . He 's endorsed Anita Earls , a candidate for the North Carolina Supreme Court .\nThough judicial canons prevent candidates for judge from discussing specific cases , there 's no doubt where the candidates there stand on gerrymandering : Earls represented the NAACP in a challenge to the North Carolina map in 2011 . Her opponent , Justice Barbara Jackson , was part of the majority that upheld the maps .\n( The U.S. Supreme Court eventually struck down the districts in a 9-0 vote . )\nFour states \u2013 Colorado , Michigan , Missouri and Utah \u2013 have redistricting initiatives on the ballot in November .\nThey 're part of a growing grassroots movement to take redistricting out of the hands of state legislatures \u2013 or , at least , to curb their more partisan impulses by requiring a super-majority of lawmakers to agree on any new map .\nIn Michigan , a proposal on the ballot would put redistricting in the hands of a 13-member commission made up entirely of volunteers whose names would be drawn at random . The only requirements : They must be voters , ca n't be politicians , lobbyists or their relatives , and have to be balanced by party : Four Democrats , four Republicans and five independents .\nEric Lupher is director of the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan .\n`` People have really grown a healthy distrust of elected officials , and not just our current elected officials but those who will come in the future , '' he said .\nBut he says every state has to decide for itself what kind of redistricting process works best , based on its unique history , political culture and geography .\nIn May , Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment that requires the approval of 60 percent of each legislative chamber , and a majority of each party , to establish a map . If they ca n't , the task goes to a bipartisan commission .\nIn Missouri , a proposal on the ballot Nov. 6 would give map-drawing powers for state legislative districts in the power of a `` non-partisan state demographer , '' subject to approval by a bipartisan commission .\nThe Utah proposal would have an independent commission propose boundaries to the legislature , and Colorado would give redistricting power to a commission made up of Democrats , Republicans and independents .\nUnder any of those systems , Lupher says , expect more lawsuits .\n`` This is something new , '' he said . `` Somebody 's ox is going to get gored , and they \u2019 re going to sue . That 's where we are as a culture these days : If you don \u2019 t like it , litigate . ''\nIn most state legislatures , members of the lower chamber \u2013 usually the house of representatives or house of delegates \u2013 are elected to two-year terms so there will be another election before redistricting in 2021 . But for the upper chamber \u2013 the state senate \u2013 terms are typically four years .\nThat gives Democrats a chance to become competitive in some states with big wins down the ballot in 2018 .\nBut because state legislatures often draw lines for their own members as well as for Congress , they 're starting those contests at a disadvantage .\n`` In many cases , you will have elections that will be conducted that were drawn by Republicans in 2011 , and that 's why turnout is so important , '' Holder said . `` The blue wave has to overcome this gerrymandered seawall that was constructed in 2011 .
