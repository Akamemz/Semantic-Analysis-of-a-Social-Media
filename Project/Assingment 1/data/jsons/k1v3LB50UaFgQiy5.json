    "content": "From left : Sen. Bernie Sanders , former Vice President Joe Biden , and Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democratic presidential debate in Houston , Texas , September 12 , 2019 . ( Mike Blake/Reuters )\nThere \u2019 s an old joke often expressed well into banquets and conferences , where a speaker says , \u201c We \u2019 re at the point where everything that needs to be said has been said , but not everyone has said it. \u201d We \u2019 re already at that point with the Democratic primary debates . Tonight was a three-hour ordeal , and candidates largely repeated the arguments they made in the previous two debates . There \u2019 s not much reason to expect tonight will generate any dramatic swings in the polling in the coming days or weeks . The conventional wisdom will remain that this is a three-person race , with Joe Biden , Elizabeth Warren , and Bernie Sanders having far and away the best shots at the nomination .\nPerhaps the most dramatic moment came when Julian Castro \u201c went there \u201d on Biden \u2019 s age . Discussing the government-based health insurance he envisioned , Biden \u2019 s verbiage was typically garbled , declaring , \u201c If you lose the job from your insurance company , from your employer , you automatically can buy into this. \u201d So is it a form of health insurance that you choose to buy into , or something you \u2019 re automatically enrolled in ? Earlier Biden had said , \u201c Anyone who can \u2019 t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have . \u201d\nCastro jabbed , \u201c You just two minutes ago said they would have to buy in . Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago ? \u201d Everyone knew what Castro was hinting at \u2013 forgetfulness , age , maybe even Alzheimer \u2019 s \u2013 and just in case anyone missed it , as the crowd either went \u201c oooh \u201d or booed , Castro repeated the \u201c are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago ? \u201d line . Whether or not you think Biden \u2019 s mental state and health are fair game for the public to consider , Castro \u2019 s attack will be seen by many as personal and over the line for a candidate to bring up . For what it \u2019 s worth , ABC News \u2019 s Matthew Dowd said he was hearing from other Democrats who thought the attack was a \u201c disqualifier , \u201d \u201c mean , \u201d and \u201c vindictive . \u201d\nIt was another just-good-enough night from Biden . He came out with vigor , and he seemed to be enjoying himself early on . But his answers got sloppy , choppy , and verbally messier as the night wore on . It wasn \u2019 t that his mind wasn \u2019 t working ; it was that he would start a sentence , he would think of another point , and then try to jump to explain that other thought without clearly finishing the first one . A lot of his later answers devolved into \u201c word salad. \u201d There \u2019 s good reason to wonder if he \u2019 s going to really falter in one of these debates some night . But Biden closed well by discussing resilience and discussing the tragedies in his life . Almost nobody \u2019 s backing Biden because they think he \u2019 s got the best policies , or that he \u2019 s the most articulate advocate for them . They \u2019 re backing him because he \u2019 s the person they connect with the most .\nWarren is playing it safe ; she may not be throwing haymakers against anyone for a while . Almost all of the candidates seemed to have gotten a memo about speaking more positively about President Obama . Someone must have told Warren to avoid any tone or comment that could be labeled \u201c shrill \u201d ; this was the softer , kinder , more uplifting Warren . This is probably exactly what you want to do when you \u2019 re in second place , there are still a lot of debates to go , and the guy in third is closer to you on policy . When pushed about her plan for withdrawal from Afghanistan , Warren answered that she traveled to that country with John McCain , she \u2019 s talked to a lot of experts , and three of her brothers served in the military . This is three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust debating .\nPoor Bernie Sanders . He desperately needed a throat lozenge tonight . He still shouts almost every answer , he still rattles off statistics , he \u2019 s still insisting that the United States has the highest rate of child poverty in the world . ( We don \u2019 t . It \u2019 s higher than it ought to be , but we \u2019 re not the highest . ) But this style , tiresome as it can be over three hours , got Sanders to this point , and he \u2019 s unlikely to ever change .\nA lot of these candidates have strengths on paper but just don \u2019 t shine on the stage , or they get lost in the crowd . Harris \u2019 s demeanor was a little different tonight , as if she had been coached to be warmer or funnier . She didn \u2019 t really go after Biden like she did in the first debate , and no one really went after her , either , now that she \u2019 s back in single digits .\nKlobuchar had some slightly better-than-usual moments , arguing that Sanders \u2019 s health-care proposals are simply unaffordable , but it \u2019 s the same story as the previous two debates . She \u2019 s soft-spoken , pleasant , a little corny with her jokes . . . and completely forgettable .\nThe big news before the debate was Publisher \u2019 s Clearinghouse Sweepstakes candidate Andrew Yang \u2019 s pledge to give $ 1,000 a month to ten families for a year . It \u2019 s gimmicky , but maybe Yang needed to do something like that .

Trump-bashing is a really convenient crunch for all of these candidates when they \u2019 re in a jam , and they use it when their proposals about what to do after Trump are fuzzy , excessively optimistic , or implausible .\nRemember when so many analysts said Cory Booker was one of the big winners of the last debate ?

A month from now , will anything change ?\nReports of the dramatic reinvention or relaunch of Beto O \u2019 Rourke are greatly exaggerated .
