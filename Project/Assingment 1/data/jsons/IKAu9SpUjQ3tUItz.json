The court is operating with only eight justices after the death of Scalia , who had been expected to rule against the unions .\nThe one-sentence opinion Tuesday does not set a national precedent and does not identify how each justice voted . It simply upholds a decision from the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals that applies to California and eight other Western states .\nStill , the original case challenged a system in place for more than 5 million workers in 23 states and Washington , D.C. , who are represented at the bargaining table by public sector unions . Labor officials worried the potential loss of tens of millions of dollars in fees would reduce their power to bargain for higher wages and benefits for government employees .\nThe union case is among a handful of high-profile disputes in which Scalia 's vote was expected to tip the balance toward a result that favored the conservative justices .\nSince Supreme Court decisions are not final until they are handed down , nothing Scalia did or said in connection with the case before his death mattered to the outcome .\nThe group of California teachers backed by a conservative group said being forced to pay union fees violated the free speech rights of nonmembers who disagree with the unions ' positions . They had urged the justices to overturn a nearly 40-year-old Supreme Court decision that allows the unions to collect the fees .\nThe high court had raised doubts about the viability of the 1977 precedent , Abood v. Detroit Board of Education , but it stopped short of overturning it in two recent cases . In Abood , the court said public workers who choose not to join a union can be required to pay for bargaining costs if the fees do n't go toward political purposes .\nThe lead plaintiff was Rebecca Friedrichs , a public school teacher from Orange County , California , who said she resigned from the California Teachers Association over differences but was still required to pay about $ 650 a year to cover bargaining costs .\nLabor leaders called the lawsuit part of a coordinated effort by conservative groups to weaken labor rights .
