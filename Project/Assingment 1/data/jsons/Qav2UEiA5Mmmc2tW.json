    "content": "U.S. House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , has always been , and continues to be , an aggressive opponent of the Affordable Care Act , commonly known as Obamacare . And yet , the conservative congressman \u2019 s latest budget actually relies on key components of the health care overhaul law to achieve its professed goal of balancing the federal budget in 10 years .\nThe 2014 budget , once again titled \u201c The Path to Prosperity , '' makes several references to the \u201c egregious \u201d and bankrupting policies supported by Obamacare , such as the law \u2019 s new health care exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansion for the poor . An enormous $ 1.8 trillion of the total $ 4.6 trillion in deficit reduction outlined by the plan comes from repealing the ACA .\nBut as pointed out by ThinkProgress on Tuesday , while the Ryan budget guts the law \u2019 s public benefits , it maintains the cost-saving measures and new revenue created by the legislation .\nFor instance , Ryan \u2019 s budget holds onto the $ 716 billion in Medicare cuts included in the ACA but , on page 40 of the proposal , simply writes those savings will be used \u201c toward shoring up Medicare , not paying for new entitlements. \u201d However , Obamacare currently does not remove money from Medicare to pay for itself .\nThat accusation , commonly thrown around by President Barack Obama \u2019 s 2012 challenger Mitt Romney , has been shown to be false by multiple sources . In August 2012 , the fact-checking website Politifact wrote the ACA does not rely on funding from the Medicare trust fund , but instead \u201c uses a number of measures to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending . Those savings are then used to offset costs created by the law -- especially coverage for the uninsured -- so that the overall law does n't add to the deficit . \u201d\nThe Ryan budget , while stating it will not raise \u201c more \u201d revenue than the \u201c current policy , \u201d still shows on page 78 that the GOP blueprint maintains the nearly $ 800 billion in revenue created by the ACA .\nLike his previous plan , the tax proposals included in Ryan \u2019 s newest budget don \u2019 t come close to generating the revenue needed to reach his professed goal of pushing government spending down to 19.1 percent of the GDP by 2023 .\nThe proposal includes the following tax cuts : Reduces the top marginal tax rate to 25 percent ( down from the recently reinstituted top rate of 39.6 percent ) and reducing the next rate to 10 percent ; reduces the corporate tax rate by 10 percentage points down to 25 percent ; and repeals both the alternative minimum tax and tax provisions included in the ACA .\n`` Because the Ryan plan would restructure the code but collect the same amount of revenue as today \u2019 s system , this budget would have to eliminate trillions of dollars in tax preferences , '' the Tax Policy Center reports . `` Ryan , like President Obama and most members of Congress , prefers to call these loopholes . But in reality , targets would almost certainly include popular preferences such as deductions for mortgage interest , state and local taxes , and charitable gifts as well as the exclusion of employer-sponsored health insurance from taxable income . ''\nAccording to an analysis by the Center for American Progress , the budget would almost certainly add to the federal deficit .\n\u201c Last year the Tax Policy Center estimated that these provisions would generate revenue equaling just 15.8 percent of GDP in 2022 . Extrapolating to 2023 suggests that Rep. Ryan is missing about $ 840 billion of revenue in 2023 alone , and approximately $ 7 trillion over the entire 10-year period from 2014 through 2023 . After accounting for the added interest costs from all of these unpaid-for tax cuts , Ryan \u2019 s budget would still be about $ 1.2 trillion in the red in 2023 , \u201d the organization wrote Tuesday .\nAs previously mentioned , the GOP budget aims to boost defense spending by $ 500 billion over a decade , which Ryan wrote is necessary to \u201c keep our safety by rebuilding our military. \u201d The U.S. currently spends as much on its military as the next five-highest-spending nations combined .\nBut because Americans ( according to the Ryan vision ) purportedly need to cure themselves of their addiction to government entitlements , the budget contains cuts to a category known as \u201c nondiscretionary spending. \u201d But that category , for which Ryan has called for $ 900 billion in reductions , includes cuts to programs such as : veterans \u2019 health care ; food , drug and consumer product safety ; federal law enforcement and several other public services . Nondiscretionary spending has never consumed more than 3.2 percent of the nation \u2019 s GDP .\nAs noted by Ezra Klein , the goal of Ryan \u2019 s budget does not appears to be deficit reduction . Instead , the former GOP presidential nominee \u2019 s plan \u201c is intended to do nothing less than fundamentally transform the relationship between Americans and their government . \u201d\nAt various points Ryan outlines the \u201c many challenges \u201d facing the U.S. \u2013 unemployment , the national debt , the housing crisis , gas prices , student loan debt .

Pressed for cash , the government will take the easy way out : It will crank up the printing presses . The final stage of this intergenerational theft will be the debasement of our currency .
