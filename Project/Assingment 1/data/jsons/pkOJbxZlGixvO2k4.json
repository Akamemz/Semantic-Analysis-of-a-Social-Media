James Mattis , chosen to run the Department of Defense , and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly , who is running the Department of Homeland Security .\nLate last week , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer left open the possibility that , by the end of the day Monday , the nominee to lead the CIA , Rep. Mike Pompeo , and some other `` non-controversial '' nominees may be confirmed as well .\nSchumer also said that the confirmation process would be expedited if the nominees all submitted their ethics paperwork and allowed `` a day or two '' for any questions . Of the 21 nominees who had been named by last Monday , required paperwork was still missing for seven of those .\nHere 's a list of the seven nominees approved by the end of Obama 's first full day in office ( Wednesday , January 21 , 2009 ) :\nAsked whether Trump feels he has a mandate to make major changes to Obamacare , Spicer said the health care law is not living up to its promises .\n`` You go around this country and look market after market , they are down to one plan , '' he said . `` That 's not what the American people were promised . Not only that , but in many cases , you are seeing the rates go up 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 50 % . That 's not what was promised either .

Five states -- Alabama , Alaska , Oklahoma , South Carolina and Wyoming -- have only one insurer , as do about one-third of all counties in the US , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation .\nAs for the increase in rates , the average monthly premium for the 2017 benchmark silver plan rose 22 % , according to Department of Health and Human Services statistics . But the average masks wide variations underneath . In some places it fell slightly , such as Vice President Mike Pence 's home state of Indiana , where it fell 3 % on average .

I 'm saying if you add up all of the various live streaming that we have information on so far , I do n't think there is any question -- it was the largest watched inauguration ever . ''\nAbout 30.6 million people tuned in to watch Trump 's inauguration live on television -- including networks and cable channels -- according to Nielsen ratings . That 's already less than the estimated 37.8 million who watched Obama 's 2009 inauguration , as well as the 41.8 million who viewed Ronald Reagan 's first swearing-in . ( Trump 's initial cable ratings are also less than the inaugurations of Jimmy Carter in 1977 and Richard Nixon in 1973 . )\nTrump 's ceremony likely did edge out Obama 's online .

If we add in these best available online numbers to the cable views , Trump 's inauguration had at least 37.5 million viewers , compared to the at least 42.9 million who watched Obama 's in 2009 . That 's not even counting the fact that physical attendance at Obama 's ceremony appeared much larger than Friday 's crowd . Based on that information , we 're rating Spicer 's claim as\nReality Check : Spicer claims that 'bilateral deals ' are mostly China 's focus\nSpicer defended Trump 's decision to back out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Monday by arguing bilateral agreements between two countries are more beneficial for American workers .\nSpicer went on to defend this decision by arguing `` bilateral deals are mostly what China has been engaging in . ''\nWhile China has sought to enter into a major trade deal that would act as a backup should the TPP fall through , the majority of trade deals China is either exploring or that it has entered into are bilateral .\nOf the trade deals China has signed and are in effect , 14 of 16 are bilateral , as are seven of the nine trade deals China is negotiating , according to the Asia Regional Integration Center .\nThat said , China has been a major driver behind the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership , a massive 16-nation proposed trade deal that would link sizable countries like India , China and South Korea with smaller countries like Cambodia , Indonesia and Laos .\nThe trade deal , which would be smaller than the TPP , would allow China to assert itself in the region , should TPP crumble .\nBecause the majority of trade deals China has either entered into or are in the process of negotiating are bilateral , we rate this claim true .\nReality Check : Spicer claims Trump 's executive action will curb 'dramatic expansion ' in federal employees\nTrump signed an executive action on Monday that implemented a hiring freeze for some federal workers in an effort to cut government payroll , and Spicer said the action would stop the `` dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years . ''\nFigures from the Office of Personnel Management show , however , the size of the federal employee workforce has declined under the Obama administration .\nTotal executive branch federal employment -- not including uniformed military personnel and legislative and judicial branch personnel -- has dropped dramatically since the high point in the late 1980s and early 1990s when it averaged about 3 million employees . In recent years ( such as 2009-2014 ) it has continued to decrease , at a slower rate , from 2.77 in 2009 to 2.66 in 2014 .\nTrump 's move is more symbolic than anything . The executive action makes good on a promise the Republican made on the campaign trail and mimics promises that Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan made .\nBecause there has n't been a `` dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years , '' as Spicer stated , but the number of executive branch federal employees has actually been decreasing , we rate Spicer 's claim false .",
