''\nThe partisan back and forth over the spending plan -- called a continuing resolution in legislative jargon -- came after the Senate on Friday restored funding for Obamacare that House Republicans stripped from their original version and sent the proposal back to the House .\nBoehner convened his caucus on Saturday to forge a counteroffer to the Senate changes .\n-- an amendment that will fund the government until December , a month longer than the Senate version .\n-- stop as much of the president 's health law as possible .\n-- repeal the medical device tax because they said it was sending jobs overseas .\n-- a `` conscience clause '' to the one-year delay amendment to allow employers and insurance plans to refuse to cover birth control .\nShowing that the House Republicans do n't expect the Senate to accept their changes , House leaders held a separate vote to ensure that the military gets paid in the event of a government shutdown .\nOfficials estimate the military pay could be affected by a shutdown as soon as October 14 , and the GOP move was considered a political gesture to shield the party from criticism that its brinksmanship could hurt U.S. fighting forces .\nIn further evidence of the political nature of the separate military pay proposal , Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said Democrats would likely support it .\nOn the spending plan , though , Reid said the Republican tactics amounted to what he described as extortion by `` tea party anarchists . ''\n`` To be absolutely clear , the Senate will reject both the one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act and the repeal of the medical device tax , '' Reid said in a statement . `` After weeks of futile political games from Republicans , we are still at square one . ''\nMeanwhile , the White House made clear on Saturday that Obama dismisses any effort to tie provisions undermining Obamacare to the spending measure needed to prevent a government shutdown .\n`` Republicans have tried and failed to defund or delay the health care law more than 40 times , and they know this demand is reckless and irresponsible , '' said the statement from White House spokesman Jay Carney , adding that Obama would not negotiate on Obamacare or spending issues `` under threats of a government shutdown that will hurt our economy . ''\nReid previously warned that any changes to the Senate 's version by the House would result in at least the start of a government shutdown because of the time it would take to reconsider the proposal .\nRepublican Rep. Michael Grimm of New York said Saturday a `` slight '' shutdown could occur due to the little time left to pass a short-term spending plan for the new fiscal year that starts Tuesday .\n`` I 'm hoping no , but just look at the timing , '' Grimm said , laying out a scenario in which the political wrangling leads to last-minute deliberations on Monday and beyond .\nThe prospect of a government shutdown caused by GOP tactics irked the longest serving member of Congress in history , Democratic Rep. John Dingell of Michigan , who said in a statement that `` this once-deliberative body has been taken over by knaves and know-nothings , content with putting partisan politics ahead of the American people . ''\n`` I 've said before that I believe that this current Congress would be incapable of passing the Ten Commandments or even the Lord 's Prayer , and today 's actions have only further galvanized that belief , '' said Dingell , who was first elected in 1955 and is serving his 30th term .\nThe legislative hot potato involving the spending plan began last week when the House stripped Obamacare funding from the proposal it sent to the Senate .\nOn Friday , the Senate voted on strict party lines to restore the Obamacare funding and send the measure back to the House .\nThat left Boehner with the choice of urging his divided Republican caucus to join Democrats in passing the Senate plan or to yield again to the tea party wing that seeks to undermine Obamacare .\nThe Senate began its votes Friday by easily overcoming a filibuster led by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas against the spending plan . Cruz waged a 21-hour floor speech this week against Obamacare , but 25 more moderate Republicans rejected his tactics in voting with Democrats on Friday to move ahead on the measure .\nJUST WATCHED What happens to workers during shutdown Replay More Videos ...
