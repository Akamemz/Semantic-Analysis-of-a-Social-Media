Currently , the federal law requiring background checks covers licensed firearms dealers , with private sales excluded .\nFierce opposition by the NRA and its allies in Congress -- mostly conservative Republicans but also some Democrats from gun-friendly states -- made clear that the universal checks sought by Obama had no chance of passing , leading to efforts by Manchin , Toomey and others to work out a compromise .\n`` The bottom line for me is this : If expanding background checks to include gun shows and Internet sales can reduce the likelihood of criminals and mentally ill people from getting guns and we can do it in a fashion that does not infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens , then we should do it , and in this amendment I think we do , '' Toomey told reporters on Wednesday .\nAsked later about criticism by the NRA and others , he told CNN that the proposed legislation was `` not a cure-all , but I think it would be some progress . ''\nManchin noted that the proposal meant that firearms buyers at gun shows would face the same background check currently required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers . In addition , it would close a loophole that exempts intrastate gun sales on the Internet from requiring a background check , he said .\nAddressing concerns of the NRA that expanding background checks would burden law-abiding gun owners seeking to trade or gift weapons in a personal transfer , Manchin declared that `` personal transfers are not touched whatsoever . ''\nAnother provision would recognize the legitimacy of concealed weapons permits across state lines .\nThe Manchin-Toomey compromise also would require states and the federal government to provide records on criminals and the `` violently mentally ill '' to the national background check system , addressing a criticism by the NRA and other opponents of gun laws that the existing system lacks substantive information .\nIn addition , the plan calls for a new National Commission on Mass Violence to report in six months on `` all aspects of the problem , including guns , school safety , mental health , and violent media or video games . ''\nThe NRA said rejection of the universal checks sought by Obama was `` a positive development , '' and it called for `` serious and meaningful solutions '' to gun violence instead of `` blaming law-abiding gun owners for the acts of psychopathic murderers . ''\nObama said there are aspects of the proposal that he would like to see strengthened .\n`` But the agreement does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress . It recognizes that there are good people on both sides of this issue , and we do n't have to agree on everything to know that we 've got to do something to stem the tide of gun violence , '' he said .\n`` Congress needs to finish the job , '' Obama added , saying he would continue `` asking the American people to stand up and raise their voices because these measures deserve a vote . ''\nThe Brady Campaign , named after the former White House press secretary wounded in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan , called the compromise a `` good step forward , '' while New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo described it as `` better than nothing '' but a sellout to the gun lobby .\n`` This is a Congress that is captive of the extremists and there is no clearer proof of that than this , '' Cuomo said on the `` Capitol Pressroom '' radio show , adding that the compromise meant `` we are not talking about a significant package of gun control anymore .
