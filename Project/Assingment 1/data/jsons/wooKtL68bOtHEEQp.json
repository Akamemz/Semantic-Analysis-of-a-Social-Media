    "content": "London Mayor Sadiq Khan slammed President Trump \u2019 s criticism of him as \u201c preposterous \u201d after allowing a giant Trump balloon at anti-Trump protests in London , but critics question whether the mayor should be devoting his energy to tackling crime rather than \u201c embarrassing \u201d the city in front of the whole world .\nTrump reignited the feud with Khan in an interview with The Sun newspaper , saying the Mayor of London \u201c has done a terrible job \u201d when it comes to terrorism and crime . \u201c I think he has done a bad job on crime , if you look , all of the horrible things going on there , with all of the crime that is being brought in , \u201d he said .\nKhan called the comments \u201c preposterous \u201d on the BBC \u2019 s Today program on Friday , claiming that violent crime has risen across the country and London has been forced to tackle the issue with a smaller police budget .\nBut crime in London persists on epidemic proportions as murder rate soared by 44 percent , with 157 homicides committed compared to 109 the previous year , according to official statistics from the Metropolitan Police .\nA former ambassador to the U.S. , Sir Christopher Meyer , was the victim of a violent attack against him at a central London underground station this week . \u201c I \u2019 m absolutely shocked by the level of the brutality , \u201d his wife , Baroness Meyer , told the Times of London . \u201c They really beat him . It \u2019 s appalling \u2014 like something you would see in a war zone .\nEarlier this year , for the first time in modern history , London overtook New York in the number of murders . In February , London \u2019 s police investigated 15 murders while New York saw 11 homicides . In March , the Metropolitan Police murder numbers increased further to 22 , while NYPD \u2019 s jumped to 21 . The City of New York has since taken back the lead however .\nLondon is also facing the rise of shocking acid attacks , skyrocketing by more than 78 per cent over the past two years , with 465 such offenses in 2017 , up from 260 in 2015 , according to police figures obtained by the Evening Standard .\nThis led to frustrated Londoners airing their concerns about the spiraling crime in the city , all while Khan remains preoccupied with feuding with Trump .\n\u201c This guy spends his week getting a balloon of Donald Trump in a nappy put in the air in central London instead of helping us with severe issues . I just think he \u2019 s so worried about himself , his reputation and PR rather than portraying the country , the city in the best way can be and making it safe for the citizens , \u201d London business leader Mark Wright , who won the UK 's version of The Apprentice , told Fox News .\n\u201c I think he embarrassed himself , he \u2019 s embarrassed Britain because no matter what you think of Donald Trump , it \u2019 s irrelevant . America is the most powerful country in the world , the office of president has got to be respected no matter who that person is and that wasn \u2019 t done and I was very disappointed , \u201d he added .\n`` This guy spends his week getting a balloon of Donald Trump in a nappy put in the air in central London instead of helping us with severe issues .
