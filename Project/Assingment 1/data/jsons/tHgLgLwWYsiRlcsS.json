'' After top Democrats left the bipartisan meeting with Trump , Pelosi told reporters that the president appeared `` shaken up '' by a House vote condemning his decision to remove U.S. forces from northern Syria . The House approved the resolution in an overwhelming 354-60 vote , as even a majority of Trump 's Republican Party supported it . `` That 's why we could n't continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it , '' Pelosi said outside the White House , in only the latest instance of a gathering between the president and Democrats blowing up . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , described the meeting as more of a `` nasty diatribe '' than a `` dialogue . '' He said Trump called Pelosi a `` third-rate politician '' \u2014 though Pelosi later clarified the president used the term `` third grade politician . '' House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , added that he had `` never '' seen a president `` treat so disrespectfully a coequal branch '' of government . House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , a Republican who voted for the House measure to oppose pulling troops out of northern Syria , told reporters that Pelosi `` stormed out '' of the meeting . He called her behavior `` unbecoming '' and argued Pelosi tried to make the gathering unproductive . The White House declined to comment on whether Trump called Pelosi a `` third-rate politician .
