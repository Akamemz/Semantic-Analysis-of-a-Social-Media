The total value of this year \u2019 s U.S. corn , soybean and wheat crops dropped about $ 13 billion , or 10 % , in June , said Chris Hurt , an agricultural economist at Purdue University . On Monday , U.S. soybean prices continued their downward spiral , heading toward the lowest level in a decade .\nThe planned tariffs on U.S. soybean exports come as farmers nationwide have boosted plantings of the crop , betting on the oilseeds to deliver stronger returns than corn during a yearslong slump in the farm economy .\nFor farmers like Mr. Smith , who grows corn and soybeans on 1,500 acres in Cotton Plant , Ark. , the 16 % decline in soybean prices alone translates into a nearly $ 100 per-acre drop in the value of his crop . \u201c That \u2019 s $ 100,000 that has disappeared into thin air , \u201d he said . \u201c We were already in the red , and now it \u2019 s even worse . \u201d\nChina Strikes Back Major products affected by Chinese tariffs in place and scheduled for July 6 , 2018 .

The loss would pressure farmland prices , they say , prompting a more than $ 500,000 decline in the farm \u2019 s net worth by 2021 .\nFarmers for Free Trade , an advocacy group , recently rolled out its third advertisement warning about the harmful consequences of trade fights for farmers . U.S. farm and agribusiness groups in June joined manufacturing , retail and technology organizations imploring Congress to step up oversight of the president \u2019 s actions .\nStill , many farmers say they support the Trump administration \u2019 s trade goals of modernizing Nafta , shrinking the U.S. trade deficit and combating what they see as unfair trade practices by China .
