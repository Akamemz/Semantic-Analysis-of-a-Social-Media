By the time the trial began , there were only two black people on the jury . When the defense accused prosecutors of racial discrimination in the selection process , they acted indignant . \u201c Somehow we \u2019 re just racists in this county , \u201d one told the judge .\nProsecutors presented a range of justifications . One black man , according to court documents , \u201c had once been a member of a gang in his youth. \u201d Another was eliminated for singing \u201c the sun will come out tomorrow , \u201d a line from the musical \u201c Annie , \u201d as he exited court . The judge allowed the jury to stand .\nIn February , Hobbs \u2019 attorneys argued at the Supreme Court of North Carolina that the selection process was part of a longstanding pattern in which prosecutors systematically exclude black people from juries , then argue race is not a factor . In briefs filed in support of Hobbs , a coalition of criminal justice advocates argued that implicit biases\u2014the notion that people can hold prejudices without being conscious of them\u2014 '' are no less entrenched and no less harmful to the criminal justice system '' than overt racism .\nIn early May , the court handed down its decision : it did not grant Hobbs the new trial his lawyers sought . But it found that the judge did not consider all the evidence of discrimination and told him to look again .\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court , which heard another case about racism in jury selection in August , isn \u2019 t the only one in the country reconsidering how race may affect jury selection . High courts in Washington , California and Connecticut have called for or implemented changes to address how implicit bias can keep black people off of juries unfairly .\nThe first state to do so was Washington , which in 2018 issued a rule requiring judges to consider \u201c implicit , institutional , and unconscious biases , in addition to purposeful discrimination . \u201d\nLast December , the Connecticut Supreme Court followed suit by announcing it would appoint a special task force to study implicit bias in jury selection . The Supreme Court of California made a similar announcement in January . These developments come amid a sharpened focus in the criminal justice system on implicit bias .\nRecent research has unveiled unconscious racism driving everything from police-involved shootings of black men to charging decisions made by prosecutors . Researchers have found that people are more likely to perceive black people as guilty , more likely to shoot them in police simulations and more likely to remove them from juries , even when their other demographics are identical to white potential jurors \u2019 .\nAt the core of recent arguments about racism in jury selection is the recognition that attorneys too often \u201c rely on stereotypes like who is going to be sympathetic or not \u201d says Catherine Grosso , a Michigan State University law professor who co-authored a seminal 2012 study of death penalty cases in North Carolina . The study found that black people were removed from juries at more than twice the rate of those of other races . The data undergirds Hobbs \u2019 appeal there . \u201c I think what we \u2019 re seeing is a recognition that even explicit racism doesn \u2019 t always have a smoking gun . \u201d\nThe U.S. Supreme Court established the foundation for challenging racial bias in jury selection in 1986 in the case of Batson v. Kentucky . At issue were \u201c peremptory strikes , \u201d the limited number of opportunities prosecutors and defense attorneys have to remove jurors without having to explain why .

To mount a Batson challenge , a lawyer\u2014most often for the defense\u2014argues that a strike is race-based . All opposing attorneys have to do is offer a reason that is supposedly race-neutral . Then the judge makes a ruling .\nPotential jurors have been rejected for having dyed red hair , or wearing a large white hat and sunglasses . In 1995 , the Supreme Court further said prosecutors need not even give \u201c a reason that makes sense , \u201d as long as the reason \u201c does not deny equal protection . \u201d\nStephen Bright , a Yale University law professor who has argued several Batson-related cases before the Supreme Court , says familiarity with prosecutors can affect the decisions judges make . \u201c A judge who deals with prosecutors every day is not going to say , \u2018 You intentionally discriminated on the basis of race , and you lied about it with pretextual reasons . \u2019 \u201d\nIn one Georgia case prosecutors systematically excluded black potential jurors by saying , for example , one was too close in age to the defendant ( she was 34 and he was 19 ) , and one had a son who had been convicted of \u201c basically the same thing that this defendant is charged with \u201d ( the son stole hubcaps ; the defendant was accused of murder ) .
