After watching a recording of the previous few minutes of Fox News , my hunch was confirmed : The president was live-tweeting the network \u2019 s coverage .\nThe president just threatened a nuclear strike while live-tweeting a Fox News segment .\nRight , Trump , 7:49 pm pic.twitter.com/vJciYH6LIA \u2014 Matthew Gertz ( @ MattGertz ) January 3 , 2018\nEveryone has a theory about Trump \u2019 s hyperaggressive early morning tweetstorms . Some think they are a deliberate ploy the president uses to distract the press from his administration \u2019 s potential weaknesses , or to frame the public debate to his liking . Others warn his rapid shifts from one topic to another indicate mental instability .\nBut my many hours following the president \u2019 s tweets for Media Matters for America , the progressive media watchdog organization , have convinced me the truth is often much simpler : The president is just live-tweeting Fox , particularly the network \u2019 s Trump-loving morning show , Fox & Friends .\nIt \u2019 s no secret , of course , that the president likes to tweet about what he sees on TV . Thanks to diligent reporting from the White House beat , we know Trump often watches several hours of cable news each day via the \u201c Super TiVo \u201d he had installed at the White House . And journalists at CNN , the Washington Post , New York magazine , among others , have compiled lists of Trump tweets they believe were inspired by Fox .\nBut here \u2019 s what is shocking : After comparing the president \u2019 s tweets with Fox 's coverage every day since October , I can tell you that the Fox-Trump feedback loop is happening far more often than you think . There is no strategy to Trump \u2019 s Twitter feed ; he is not trying to distract the media . He is being distracted . He darts with quark-like speed from topic to topic in his tweets because that \u2019 s how cable news works .\nHere \u2019 s what \u2019 s also shocking : A man with unparalleled access to the world \u2019 s most powerful information-gathering machine , with an intelligence budget estimated at $ 73 billion last year , prefers to rely on conservative cable news hosts to understand current events .\nI have long known that the president is a Fox & Friends superfan\u2014well before he ran for office , he had a weekly guest spot on the program for years , and since his election , he has regularly held the program \u2019 s co-hosts up as model journalists . But one morning in October , a colleague pointed out that Trump had tweeted an endorsement of a book minutes after the author , appearing on Fox & Friends to promote the work , praised him . Curious if there was a pattern , I examined the rest of the president \u2019 s tweets from that morning , and found that several others seemed to line up with the program , reacting or commenting on various topics raised by the broadcast\u2014from kneeling NFL players to negotiating with Democrats over immigration\u2014without ever explicitly mentioning the show itself .\nThe results were so striking that my morning routine quickly became a shadow of the president \u2019 s . I check Trump \u2019 s Twitter feed on my way into the office every day . If the president is tweeting\u2014those tweets often beginning soon after Fox & Friends \u2019 6 a.m. start\u2014when I get to my desk I pull up footage from Fox \u2019 s programming on our internal video archive , frequently comparing it with footage from CNN and MSNBC . I use Twitter as my notepad , sharing my reasoning with my followers as I go . When I change my mind about whether a Trump tweet corresponds to a particular segment , I explain why and show my work . Around 9 a.m. , when Fox & Friends \u2019 co-hosts sign off , the president usually moves on to the business of running the most powerful nation in the history of the world , and I can move on as well . ( Well , until the next tweet . )\nAnd sometimes the tweets fall into a gray area , covering the same broad topic as Fox \u2019 s programming but without any specific identifiers . Then I need to fall back on inference , and in those cases , it helps when Trump has tweeted several times over the morning . Do the topics of a series of tweets match the order Fox discussed them ? Does one tweet in a series have a strong tie to the network , suggesting that the other tweets were also reactions to Fox ?\nOn Tuesday morning , for instance , on his first morning back in Washington after an 11-day vacation , the president tweeted what I believe were five consecutive tweets based on Fox \u2019 s programming , though he specifically referenced Fox & Friends in only one of them . His tweet urging the imprisonment of Huma Abedin followed a Fox segment on the former Hillary Clinton aide .
