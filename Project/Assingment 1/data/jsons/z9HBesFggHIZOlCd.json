    "content": "The American-ordered drone strike that killed one of Iran \u2019 s most powerful military leaders , Qassem Soleimani , has triggered retaliation from Iran and put American troops in the Middle East on heightened alert . It has also brought foreign policy to the top of the news cycle . How events unfold from here is uncertain , but we leave that analysis to others with more expertise in world affairs . Instead , we \u2019 d like to take a step back and use political science and polling data to explore the question of how heightened tensions with Iran could affect the 2020 primary and general elections .\nFirst , most political science research has found that foreign policy doesn \u2019 t significantly affect people \u2019 s votes . But this isn \u2019 t always the case . For example , foreign policy can have more of an impact when it \u2019 s a big part of the national conversation and when the two parties have clearly contrasting positions on it \u2014 two conditions that this Iran episode could meet .\nWe don \u2019 t actually know that much about the role international affairs play in primaries , though , as it \u2019 s rare for a primary candidate to be experienced in foreign policy . But this year , we have such a candidate in former Vice President Joe Biden . And two recent polls say that Democratic primary voters do trust him the most on foreign policy . According to CNN , nearly half ( 48 percent ) of Democrats and Democratic leaners said they thought Biden could best handle foreign policy ; Sen. Bernie Sanders came in second place with just 14 percent . And in a poll taken immediately after the strike that killed Soleimani , HuffPost/YouGov found that 62 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners trust Biden on Iran , although Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren weren \u2019 t too far behind , with 47 percent trusting each of them ( respondents were allowed to select multiple candidates they trusted ) .\nBut even if the initial setup of the chessboard privileges Biden , how the candidates move on the issue could also be determinative . Someone like Sanders , who has been critical of Biden \u2019 s vote to go to war with Iraq , could seize the upper hand if the primary becomes a question of who is the most anti-war . Voters will likely be listening closely to what the candidates say about Iran in next week \u2019 s debate , and that could be a make-or-break moment for many of the candidates , as one theory of how foreign policy can affect primaries is that it serves as a litmus test that all serious candidates must pass .\nTake the 2016 Republican primaries , when Ben Carson may have flunked such a test when , after the coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015 , he struggled to articulate how he would combat terrorism . Even his own advisers said publicly how unprepared he was on the issue . And although it \u2019 s impossible to know exactly how much this hurt Carson in voters \u2019 eyes , he had been running even with now-President Trump in the polls at the time of the attacks , but he sharply declined thereafter and ceased to be a serious threat for the nomination .\nExtreme examples aside , though , Iran \u2019 s effect on the primary might be fleeting . News cycles move on , and past events touted as \u201c game changers \u201d have failed to permanently change the state of the race .

In theory , you might expect Republicans to have the advantage in an election focused around national security : The GOP has long been seen as better than Democrats at protecting the country from external threats , according to Gallup polling .
