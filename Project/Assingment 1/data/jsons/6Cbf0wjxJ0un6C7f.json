Roughly 90 percent of New Hampshire insiders picked Sanders and Trump to win their respective primaries on Tuesday , with only a handful giving Clinton or any of the other GOP hopefuls ( namely Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz ) much of a chance .\nThe insiders are closely watching the margins by which both front-runners prevail \u2013 they expect that Clinton will spin a closer-than-anticipated race as a moral victory in the Democratic race , and they anticipate that a close second-place finish from one of the GOP candidates could give that candidate momentum headed into South Carolina and the rest of the primary calendar .\n\u201c I am a realist , \u201d said one Democrat , who like all respondents completed the survey anonymously . \u201c As a strong Hillary supporter , I would love to say she will win ; but I think Bernie Sanders has the advantage . However , he will NOT win by the margins the polls are showing . I think it will only be 3 or 4 percentage points , which is great considering he is practically a native son in New Hampshire . \u201d\n\u201c This is a real test : voters taking ballots and voting in an election , \u201d a GOP insider said of Trump and the Republican primary . `` It will be interesting to see if survey voters turn into real voters .

I know he has drastically outspent her here . I know he 's able to fuel his ground operation with thousands of Vermonters getting bused in .

That being said , it does not feel that way on the ground . \u201d\n\u201c I still believe Bernie 's lead is single digits , \u201d another Democrat added , \u201c and I still believe that if it 's single digits , Hillary 's superior field operation can close the gap . \u201d\nBut would a close finish fuel Clinton 's efforts to beat back Sanders in other states , starting with the Nevada caucuses and South Carolina primary later this month ? One Democratic insider said Sanders would win New Hampshire , but the race would be \u201c closer than polls are showing and enough for Hillary Clinton to claim a strong comeback and get the resulting momentum . \u201d\nSanders \u2019 backers , meanwhile , insist that defeating Clinton in New Hampshire would be a momentous victory , regardless of the margin .\n\u201c This local \u2588\u2588\u2588 expects a Sanders victory to be in single digits , but his campaign has already won in New Hampshire , \u201d said one Democrat . \u201c Sanders has denied the Clinton coronation sought by Democratic Party leaders .
