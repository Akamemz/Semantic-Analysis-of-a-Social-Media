    "content": "It is the best and worst of times for progressives and liberals .\nPolitically , their obsessions with identity politics and various racial and gender -isms and -ologies have emasculated the Democratic party : loss of governorships , state legislatures , the House , the Senate , the presidency , and the Supreme Court .\nDemocrats , for the time being at least , are now reduced to largely a coastal , big-city party . It can certainly pile up lots of blue electoral votes . And , thanks to California , Democrats can capture the popular vote , without necessarily winning presidential elections .\nThe old liberal idea that the new demography is progressive destiny did not work out as planned . When the Blue Wall crumbled ; Hillary Clinton lost a sure-thing election . Large Latino populations in red Texas and blue California are not likely to turn either one into a swing state . Inner-city voters so far have not transferred prior record levels of turn-out and bloc voting to candidates of the Hillary Clinton sort . Identity politics did not ensure that the white liberals who created it were always exempt from the natural boomerang of their own ideology .\nYet culturally , the progressive octopus continues to recalibrate popular life according to the new orthodoxies shared by a minority of the population .\nIndeed , the octopus has formidable and far-reaching tentacles that reach into every crevice of modern American life . Our progressive mollusk is big , and he swims with us everywhere .\nMost Americans are quite willing to concede spheres of partisanship \u2014 but not lawlessness . Some colleges , such as Evergreen State or UC Berkeley , while public and tax-supported , are , by definition , leftist in the manner that a private Hillsdale College or Saint Thomas Aquinas are traditionalist and conservative . But whereas the latter are calm and tolerant of dissent ; the former , with public monies , are hysterical and often Stalinist when confronted by opposing views . That disconnect is unsustainable .\nMost citizens are fine with the fact that Fox News is the conservative cable-channel bookend to the progressive MSNBC . Americans realize that a different sort of crowd goes to a NASCAR race than watches the Tour de France .\nBut what is bothering half the country is not such ideological birds-of-a-feather tribalism per se . The rub instead is the progressive attempt to undermine all shared public institutions by turning them into left-wing megaphones and in the process condoning the use of violence , obscenity , and racialism .\nSo it is not quite accurate to complain of the \u201c politicization of everything , \u201d given that the phenomenon is largely a progressive project in which nothing is much sacred from left-wing political hectoring \u2014 our vocabulary , the very cars we drive , even the TV shows we watch .\nWhy are the major private research universities such as Yale , Harvard , Duke , and Stanford , not just liberal but fully in service to a left-wing social agenda ? Do they not all pile up huge billion-dollar endowments that are not taxed , thus robbing taxpayers of considerable annual revenue , while they turn out more biased yet less educated students ?\nNetwork news was always liberal . Yet in the last decade , ABC , NBC , and CBS , along with PBS and NPR , as well as their cable counterparts such as CNN , have become veritable progressive operatives . Mention of transgenderism , gay marriage , abortion , global warming , and identity politics will be massaged to promote a progressive position that was once held only by minority \u2014 until the position morphs into an intolerant mainstream orthodoxy that does not allow dissent .\nSometimes the scripted metamorphosis takes just a few years . Obama \u2019 s loud support of traditional marriage in 2008 changed to support for gay marriage in 2012 . And when he left office , he conformed to the idea that only homophobes agreed with the position he \u2019 d held a few years earlier . Bill Clinton \u2019 s stance not too long ago on legal-only immigration would reduce him to a nativist racist by today \u2019 s progressive standards .\nWhether it is a 2006 or 2016 Oscar ceremony , it matters little . Some actor , some screenwriter , some director is eager to lecture the audience ( to applause ) and a national television audience ( to mute disdain ) that George W. Bush or Donald Trump ( the conservative names come and go ; the progressive hysterical outrage stays the same ) , is a fascist , or a Nazi , or a buffoon , or a criminal .\nThe result is that increasingly millions of Americans do not watch the Oscars as they once did in the days of the liberal but mostly sensible Hollywood of Doris Day , Paul Newman , Gregory Peck , Sidney Poitier , Debbie Reynolds , Jimmy Stewart , and John Wayne . The Emmy Awards are even more polarizing in their lockstep messaging that resembles the dreariness of a May Day parade on a cold Soviet Moscow morning .\nHalf of America no longer goes to the movies , for reasons that transcend the advent of cable TV and computer viewing . They are bored with the latest predictable remake of a far better earlier movie \u2014 now updated with tattooed , white villains speaking in a Russian , South African , or southern accent , diabolically seeking to harm a young , picture-perfect progressive social-justice warrior as she uncovers the racist , sexist , and homophobic machinations of an evil corporation or government agency , run by a white male cabal , that aims to pollute the water , dirty the air , or rob noble progressive victims .\nMuch of America finds Hollywood a boring Pravda enterprise . It is hypocritical too in the Soviet style of a privileged apparat \u2014 given that movies are the products of huge corporations and multimillionaire actors who live apartheid existences .\nESPN op-eds dressed up as sports analyses are not subtle . The working-class audience is often assumed to be bigoted in some way ; the wealthy and elite sportscasters , athletes , and media celebrities imagine that they themselves are virtuous and exempt from their own criticism .\nColin Kaepernick was the straw that broke the viewing audience \u2019 s proverbial back . He is lionized as Martin Luther King Jr. rather than portrayed as a confused young man of so-so talent , pampered by a multimillion-dollar salary . He and his newfound followers will not stand for the anthem of the country that ensured that the National Football League would be the most ethnically diverse athletic corporation in the world , with the most highly compensated players , and dependent on fans who would scrimp to pay outrageously high sums for tickets and cable packages just to see a simple football game \u2014 only to be insulted as the supposedly guilty party .\nOne , the NFL is an admirably meritocratic enterprise , absolutely immune from the progressive dictums of \u201c proportional representation \u201d ( diversity in the workplace and university must reflect the race , gender , and ethnic ratios of the general population ) and \u201c disparate impact \u201d ( there is no need to show that the NFL is racialist in order to force it to diversify ) . Otherwise , the NFL , as in the case of universities or other publicly subsidized entities , would demand that player rosters \u201c look like us. \u201d That is , they \u2019 d make the necessary adjustments to ensure affirmative action for underrepresented Latino , Asian , and white players \u2014 in the manner that UC Berkeley currently takes steps apparently to keep it from becoming an Asian-majority university based on merit and skills .\nThe subtext of not saluting the flag seems predicated on the notion of a racist white America , which in overwhelming numbers watches , enjoys , and pays for a mostly black NFL .\nTwo , the subtext of not saluting the flag seems predicated on the notion of a racist white America , which in overwhelming numbers watches , enjoys , and pays for a mostly black NFL . Do the players , then , not wish their viewer base to keep watching , given its supposedly illiberal temperament and contemptible respect for the National Anthem ?\nMajor weather disasters are now almost immediately contextualized in progressive terms ( often on the air by news readers ) \u2014 and not just by politicians . ( Do we remember Barack Obama \u2019 s saying \u201c 10,000 \u201d died in a Kansas tornado because George W. Bush had shorted the National Guard ? )\nA drought is proof of climate change . But so is a deep freeze . Storms or the doldrums , it doesn \u2019 t matter : Greedy corporations and clueless , in-hock consumers are the carbon culprits . A tsunami or a receding sea , fog , or sun \u2014 climate change did it . When everything is proof of climate change , then nothing is .\nBefore 2017 there may have been a decade-long dearth of hurricanes into the Caribbean . There may have been a number of scientists who stated on the record that two large late summer storms in 2017 were not proof of global warming . Surely there is room for reasoned debate ?\nAgain , no . All the pop-culture talking heads , from somber pundits to late-night television hosts , explained Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in a drearily similar way : Americans \u2019 wasteful consumption of carbon energies had heated the planet and brought down upon them a Biblical retribution of bad weather .\nSome even went so far to point out that the work of divine retribution had deliberately targeted Florida and Texas . The reason was not the obvious one that coastal states have long shorelines on the tropical Gulf of Mexico . Instead , they were hit by Nemesis because they were red states with populations more likely to doubt theories of catastrophic man-made global warming . Even the telethon for victims of the hurricanes turned into yet another media event in which celebrities trashed Donald Trump and his supporters .\nWhen Facebook is caught censoring , when Google fires its employees for talking freely , the sanctimonious high hand predictably comes down on the values of Middle America .\nNothing is spared from rank politicization . Late-night TV ? Superman comic books ? Marquee chefs ?\nThe weary messaging is everywhere and always predictable : Superman now protects illegal aliens , so we are no longer to imagine him as an oversized cartoon hero but instead as a newly muscled Jorge Ramos .\nAs the progressive octopus squeezes the country , its dominance comes at a price . Lately fewer and fewer want to waste precious time watching the pampered adolescents of the NFL . Fewer wish to blow an afternoon viewing preachy mediocrities from Hollywood .\nMadonna is a tiring bore who needs to go away and age gracefully .
