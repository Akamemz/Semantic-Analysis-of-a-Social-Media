Obama owes his re-election victory in large part to Hispanics , who gave him 71 percent of their vote in November , according to exit polls .\nSince then , conventional wisdom in the media has held that the GOP is going to have to soften its stance on the immigration issue in order to have a chance in national elections .\n`` There are some Republicans who have read the results of the election to suggest that they need to change their position on immigration in order to have a hope of winning the votes in the future of Latinos , '' says Jessica Vaughan , director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies , which favors limits on immigration .\nBut the conventional wisdom could be wrong , Vaughan says . Not all Republicans have changed their minds \u2014 and not all Democrats , either .\nMany continue to believe the best way to curb the influx of undocumented immigrants is to make it more difficult for such people to get employment , housing and other necessities of life .\nThey will have to be convinced of the merits of the comparatively open approach favored by Obama and the bipartisan working group in the Senate , if such ideas are going to have a real chance of becoming law .\n`` I certainly believe that Republicans need to do a better job of appealing to Hispanics , '' says Republican Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas . `` But I believe we will be best served and the country will be best served by appealing to them on economic grounds , rather than giving amnesty to millions of people in the country illegally . ''\nA fair amount of Republicans support making life so uncomfortable for illegal immigrants that they will `` self-deport , '' as Mitt Romney said during last year 's GOP primaries . Such thinking has damaged the GOP brand among Hispanics , but some Republicans argue that it 's still the right approach .\nThe fact that net migration from Mexico has dwindled during the recession is proof that such tactics work , says Bob Dane , communications director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform , a group that favors immigration limits . `` If you dry up the jobs magnet [ through employment eligibility verification ] , that would solve the problem , '' he says .\n`` The economy will ultimately rebound , and if a major amnesty bill passes , it really will send a global message that America 's de facto immigration policy is occasional amnesty , '' he says . `` People will stand in line and wait for the next round of amnesty . ''\nThe last time Congress made a serious effort at addressing immigration came toward the end of George W. Bush 's presidency . Back then , the House and Senate made moves in different directions .\nThe House in 2005 passed a bill that would have , among other things , classified illegal immigrants as felons . The following year , the Senate passed a bill that closely resembles the proposal outlined this week , including an increase in guest workers and ways for people presently in the country illegally to gain citizenship . Senate sponsors tried again in 2007 but did n't get very far .\n`` We had an identical bill proposed , and the American people said , 'No , thanks , ' and that 's putting it nicely , '' Dane says . `` Nothing is different .

For one thing , it 's lost some salience among rank-and-file Republican voters who once viewed it as a top priority .\nSix years ago , illegal immigration was the second-leading concern among Republicans , after terrorism , according to the Pew Research Center .
