    "content": "Hillary Clinton surged to a broad advantage against Donald Trump in the latest \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll , capitalizing on Trump \u2019 s recent campaign missteps . Two-thirds of Americans see him as biased against groups such as women , minorities or Muslims , and a new high , 64 percent , call Trump unqualified to serve as president .\nThese and other doubts about Trump have produced a sharp 14-point swing in preferences among registered voters , from +2 points for Trump in mid-May , after he clinched the GOP nomination , to +12 points for Clinton now , 51-39 percent . That snaps the race essentially back to where it was in March .\nAdding third-party candidates Gary Johnson ( Libertarian ) and Jill Stein ( Green ) to the mix makes no substantive difference : a 10-point Clinton advantage , 47-37-7-3 percent among registered voters . Looking at those who say they \u2019 re certain to vote in November likewise produces a very similar result : +11 Clinton in the two-way matchup , +9 in the four-way .\nThe national poll , produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates , finds another apparent impact of Trump \u2019 s problems : Perhaps benefitting from comparison , Barack Obama \u2019 s job approval rating has gained 5 points , to 56 percent , matching its high since the early days of his presidency . That includes 55 percent approval specifically on handling the economy .\nTrial heats are hypothetical ; they ask which candidate people would support if the election were today \u2013 which it isn \u2019 t . At least as important are the underlying sentiments informing current preferences , and they show the extent of Trump \u2019 s troubles given his recent controversial comments . Among them :\n\u2022 The public by 66-29 percent think he \u2019 s unfairly biased against groups such as women , minorities or Muslims .\n\u2022 Americans by 68-28 percent think his comment about Judge Gonzalo Curiel was racist . Regardless of whether or not it was racist , 85 percent say it was inappropriate .\n\u2022 While most Americans disapprove of Clinton \u2019 s handling of her email while secretary of state ( 34-56 percent , approve-disapprove ) , they \u2019 re equally disenchanted with Trump \u2019 s handling of questions about Trump University ( 19-59 percent , with more undecided ) .\n\u2022 Most generally , the public by 56-36 percent , a 20-point margin , says Trump is standing against their beliefs as opposed to standing up for their beliefs .\nClinton , further , receives substantially better marks than Trump \u2019 s for her response to the lone-wolf terrorist attack June 12 in Orlando , Florida : Americans by an 18-point margin , 46-28 percent , say Clinton did a better job than Trump overall in responding to the attack .\nAnother result marks a rebuke to Trump in his own party . On June 15 , referring to Republican leaders , he said , \u201c Just please be quiet . Don \u2019 t talk. \u201d In this survey , however , Republicans and GOP-leaning independents by a wide 62-35 percent say party leaders should speak out when they disagree with Trump , rather than avoid criticizing their likely nominee .\nIndeed , Trump is supported by just 77 percent of Republican registered voters in the two-way test in this survey , compared with 85 percent in this group last month and , again , essentially back to his in-party support in March . In the four-way trial he \u2019 s at 74 percent among Republicans .\nResults of this poll temper the notion that last week \u2019 s Brexit vote in the United Kingdom marks a broader dissatisfaction with the status quo that advantages Trump on this side of the Atlantic . On one hand , nativist sentiment , populism and economic anxiety clearly benefitted Trump in the race for the Republican nomination . On the other , his general election campaign requires broader support \u2013 and he \u2019 s had a dreadful few weeks .\nDoubts about Trump are reflected in yet-sharper questions about his qualifications for office \u2013 perhaps the most basic hurdle for a candidate to clear \u2013 and continued widespread anxiety about a potential Trump presidency .\nSixty-four percent of Americans now see Trump as unqualified to serve as president , up 6 points from an already-high 58 percent last month . Thirty-four percent see him as qualified .\nClinton \u2019 s numbers are essentially the opposite , and unchanged : Sixty-one percent see her as qualified for the office , 37 percent as not qualified . Moreover , while 33 percent feel strongly that Clinton is not qualified , many more \u2013 56 percent \u2013 feel strongly that Trump doesn \u2019 t pass this test .\nClinton also continues to surpass Trump easily in views of which candidate has the better personality and temperament to serve effectively . Clinton \u2019 s vast 61-28 percent lead on this question is essentially unchanged from last month \u2019 s 61-31 percent .\nFor all this , Clinton is hardly beloved . Fifty percent of Americans say they \u2019 re anxious about the idea of her as president ( vs. 47 percent who are comfortable with it ) . When it comes to a Trump presidency , however , anxiety rises to 70 percent , with just 27 percent comfortable with the idea . These are about the same as when last asked in January , and the 70 percent anxiety number matches Trump \u2019 s unfavorability rating in an ABC/Post poll last week .\nDissatisfaction with Trump and Clinton alike raises the question of a third way \u2013 but partisanship is a strong anchor , and this poll indicates little traction to date for an alternative party . Just 18 percent of registered voters say there \u2019 s a third-party candidate they \u2019 re seriously considering \u2013 and when asked to name that candidate , a mere 2 percent offer Johnson \u2019 s name , and 1 percent mention Stein , a very low level of unaided recall .\nWhen presented directly with Johnson and Stein as alternatives , they receive 7 and 3 percent support , respectively , as noted \u2013 drawing similarly from both major-party candidates . Johnson \u2019 s selected by 6 percent of Trump \u2019 s supporters and 5 percent of Clinton \u2019 s in a two-way matchup ; Stein , by 4 percent of Clinton \u2019 s and 1 percent of Trump \u2019 s .\nThe president \u2019 s resurgent approval rating is particularly welcome for Clinton , given his reported eagerness to campaign for her .\nHis advance is broadly based , and political divisions remain high \u2013 88 percent approval for Obama among Democrats , 50 percent among independents and just 18 percent among Republicans . Tellingly , 85 percent of Obama approvers support Clinton , vs. just 8 percent of Obama disapprovers .\nObama \u2019 s approval rating is similar to both Bill Clinton \u2019 s 57 percent and Ronald Reagan \u2019 s 56 percent at about this point in their presidencies , and far better than George W. Bush \u2019 s 29 percent .\nThat said , discontent with the status quo does remain , and poses some risk for Clinton as the incumbent party \u2019 s nominee . Registered voters by 56-39 percent say they \u2019 d rather see the next president set the nation in a new direction from Obama \u2019 s rather than continuing his course . \u201c New direction \u201d voters favor Trump over Clinton by a wide margin , 64-26 percent \u2013 but those who want to stay Obama \u2019 s course back Clinton even more widely , 87-6 percent .\nIt \u2019 s notable , too , that the number of Americans who prefer a new direction is about the same now as it was at this stage of Reagan \u2019 s presidency \u2013 when the nation went on , nonetheless , to elect Reagan \u2019 s vice president George H.W . Bush , to the top job .\nPartisanship can follow political preferences , and in this poll Democrats account for 36 percent of all adults and 37 percent of registered voters \u2013 a non-significant ( +3 ) difference from last month . ( The former is numerically its highest since 2009 , the latter , since 2012 . ) Republicans account for 24 percent of all adults and 27 percent of registered voters , about their average in recent years , with the rest independents .\nThis accounts for little of the shift in voter preferences , however . Even using the same party divisions from last month \u2019 s ABC/Post survey , in which Trump was +2 , he \u2019 d now be -8 . The reason , mentioned above , is his comparatively weak performance among Republicans \u2013 77 percent support \u2013 compared with Clinton \u2019 s support among Democrats , 90 percent .\nObama \u2019 s gain in approval , similarly , is not fundamentally based on any change in partisanship \u2013 last month \u2019 s partisan divisions would put him at 54-42 percent now , vs. his actual 56-41 percent in this poll .\nThere are notable shifts among groups in the latest vote preference results . Largest is a 16-point loss for Trump , and 17-point advance for Clinton , among white Catholics , a potentially key group that accounts for one in seven registered voters .\nClinton , further , is now leading among young adults , a group in which Trump was surprisingly competitive last month . Trump is -11 , and Clinton +11 , among registered voters who don \u2019 t have a college degree , as well as among liberals and conservatives alike . And Trump is -10 , Clinton +11 , among white men .\nClinton continues to prevail mightily among nonwhites \u2013 by 77-15 percent now , vs. 69-21 percent last month ; that includes 90-8 percent among blacks and 69-20 percent among Hispanics . ( For an adequate sample size , this combines results among blacks , and separately among Hispanics , from May and June . ) Trump leads Clinton by 50-40 percent among whites , down from 57-33 percent last month .\nIn another division of potential interest , Clinton leads Trump by 57-33 percent in the states that Obama won in 2012 ( +24 points ) , while Trump leads more narrowly , by 51-41 percent ( +10 ) , in the states Mitt Romney won four years ago .\nThis \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone June 20-23 , 2016 , in English and Spanish , among a random national sample of 1,001 adults , including 836 registered voters . Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points , including the design effect , for the full sample , and 4 points for registered voters . Partisan divisions are 36-24-33 percent , Democrats-Republicans-independents , in the full sample , 37-27-30 among registered voters .\nThe survey was produced for \u2588\u2588\u2588 by Langer Research Associates of New York , N.Y. , with sampling , data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York , N.Y.
