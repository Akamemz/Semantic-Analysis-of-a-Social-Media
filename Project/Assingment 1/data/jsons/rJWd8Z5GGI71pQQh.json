As President Obama put it before he was elected :\n\u201c I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that , you know , Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not . \u201d\nThe election of Reagan signaled an end to the New Deal era , which had endured for nearly half a century . After the 1980s , American politics shifted steadily to the right of the political spectrum , with Bill Clinton accelerating the Reagan revolution with his bi-partisan neoliberal reforms . This is why Reagan remains such a beloved figure for those on the right . Even though he would be considered a RINO today , he is worshipped by Republicans , while loathed by progressives . ( And yet , most progressives would probably choose Reagan over any current GOP presidential candidate . )\nAfter serving almost as many years as Reagan , President Obama recently compared himself to the 40th president , more or less saying that he was the Democrat \u2019 s Reagan , while the next Democratic president ( i.e . Hillary Clinton ) by that logic would be Bush 41 . Unfortunately for progressives , however , Obama can not really be considered the Democrat \u2019 s Reagan . He has been much less transformative than supporters once expected him to be , and he has not fundamentally altered America \u2019 s trajectory , as Reagan undoubtedly did .\nSadly , this is partially due to him being a black man , which many white Americans simply weren \u2019 t ready for \u2014 but more to do with his politics , as I discuss below .\nThe most significant difference between Reagan and Obama is that the former was an idealist , while the latter is a pragmatist . Or , as Felix Salmon put it in a recent article : Reagan was a hedgehog and Obama is a fox . These labels were first popularized by the great philosopher , Isaiah Berlin , in his essay , \u201c The Hedgehog and the Fox , \u201d which divided historical writers and thinkers ( and human beings in general ) into the two categories , based on a line from the Greek poet , Archilochus , saying : \u201c The fox knows many things , but the hedgehog knows one big thing . \u201d\n\u201c There exists a great chasm between those , on one side , who relate everything to a single central vision , one system , less or more coherent or articulate , in terms of which they understand , think and feel \u2013 a single , universal , organizing principle in terms of which alone all that they are and say has significance \u2013 and , on the other side , those who pursue many ends , often unrelated and even contradictory , connected , if at all , only in some de facto way , for some psychological or physiological cause , related to no moral or aesthetic principle . \u201d\nReagan had a central vision and a rigid political philosophy , and was largely unconcerned with details \u2014 indeed , as William Leuchtenburg puts it in his new book , `` The American President , ''\n\u201c No one had ever entered the White House so grossly ill-informed . \u201d\nThe 40th president was the antithesis of a policy wonk , and often could not answer reporters basic questions about national security and other subjects of importance . For many , he was just plain dumb . Indeed , a decade before he entered the highest office in the land , President Richard Nixon and his then National Security Advisor , Henry Kissinger , discussed Reagan \u2014 then Governor of California \u2014 on the phone , saying that he was \u201c shallow \u201d and of \u201c limited mental capacity. \u201d But the real jewel comes in their contemplating a possible Reagan presidency :\n\u201c Can you think though , Henry , can you think , though , that Reagan , with certain forces running in the direction , could be sitting right here ? \u201d asked the president , to which Kissinger simply replied : \u201c Inconceivable . \u201d\nWhat Reagan lacked in brain power he made up with in grandfatherly charm and ideological persistence . Reagan put forth a vision that the government was not the solution , but the problem in need of a solution . He railed against the New Deal era , which had come about with the last genuinely transformative president before him , Franklin Roosevelt . Prior to FDR , the government had little place in making sure people were employed and treated and paid fairly as workers , as well as ensuring an economy and political system that was not entirely tilted in favor of the capitalist class .\nThis New Deal philosophy , which favored unions and economic regulation , came to an end under Reagan . ( As I have previously written , the most notable Republican president during the New Deal era , Dwight Eisenhower , wouldn \u2019 t dare go after New Deal policies , which were tremendously popular . ) The former B-movie actor took a stand against unions , slashed taxes on the wealthy , deregulated the financial sector , and so on . It was a pro-capital counterrevolution that ushered in what we now call the neoliberal era . After Reagan , the party of FDR shifted its philosophy to the right of Richard Nixon \u2019 s . Bill Clinton \u2019 s declaration that \u201c the era of big government is over , \u201d was a stark contrast to Nixon \u2019 s earlier claim that \u201c we \u2019 re all Keynesians now . \u201d\nWhile President Obama is certainly historic in being the first African American president , he has not ushered in any kind of paradigm shift , as Roosevelt and Reagan did before him . Sadly , we are still living in a broadly neoliberal , pro-capital country and world , and Obama has governed only slightly to the left of Bill Clinton . And , while Hillary Clinton has attempted to promote herself as a pragmatic populist , one would have to be awfully uninformed to expect any kind of political transformation with her at the helm . Clinton is more of a poll-driven political realist than Obama , without much of a discernible ideology . Using Berlin \u2019 s terminology , she is the epitome of a fox , and would almost certainly govern to the right of our current president .\nSo it is that Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt ) , who is a hedgehog like Reagan , is the only current presidential candidate who could potentially bring Reagan-style transformation if elected . Like Reagan , Sanders has a central vision , with policy ideas that wouldn \u2019 t stand a chance of passing in our current Congress . His goal is to bring forth a \u201c political revolution , \u201d just as Reagan did . When Reagan ran for president , he captured the vote of many former Democrats \u2014 namely , Reagan Democrats . Today , Sanders wants to recapture their vote . And , like Reagan , the idea of Sanders becoming president was \u201c inconceivable \u201d to the establishment not too long ago . For many , it still is .\nThe similarities don \u2019 t stop there . Reagan was one of the most personally liked presidents in recent history , and Sanders has the best favorability and trustworthy ratings of all the current presidential candidates , Democrat or Republican . He has a stubborn passion that Reagan once brought to the White House , though on the opposite side of the political spectrum . Of course , the fact that Sanders would overtake Reagan as the oldest president-elect in history is purely coincidental .\nIt should be recalled that , unlike FDR 's presidency , the Reagan was largely a failure when it came to enacting actual policy . After slashing taxes in his first year , he would go on to raise taxes seven times later on in order to make up for lost revenue ( although he refused to call them tax hikes , instead saying \u201c revenue enhancements \u201d ) . He promised to cut social spending and dismantle government agencies , yet ended up adding one of the biggest agency \u2019 s , the Department of Veterans Affairs . He also ran against abortion and advocated a constitutional amendment ending it , but never seriously attempted this once in office . The most successful aspect of Reagan \u2019 s presidency had less to do with policy , and more to do with shifting the debate and convincing American \u2019 s that the government was the problem . He forced Democrat \u2019 s to abandon the New Deal philosophy , and Bill Clinton led the way in reforming his party .\n\u201c The Presidency is not merely an administrative office , \u201d said FDR in 1932 , during his first presidential campaign . \u201c That is the least of it . It is pre-eminently a place of moral leadership . All of our great Presidents were leaders of thought at times when certain historic ideas in the life of the nation had to be clarified . \u201d\nSeven years ago , many believed that Obama would be the latest transformative president to lead America through a conversion of thought . As George Packer wrote in The New Yorker :\n\u201c The new era that is about to begin under President Obama will be more about public good than about private goods . The meal will be smaller , and have less interesting flavors , but it will be shared more fairly . The great American improvisation called democracy still bends along the curve of history . It has not yet finished astounding the world . \u201d\nToday , economic inequality has grown worse , political spending has skyrocketed , big banks are bigger than ever , and Obama is fighting hard for the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which some have called \u201c NAFTA on steroids . \u201d\nOne could argue that , if Sanders was elected president , he would inevitably disappoint , just like Obama . But he is a fundamentally different kind of politician . He is personally more like Reagan than Obama . And the differences don \u2019 t end with personality ; perhaps one of the biggest difference between Obama 2008 and Sanders 2016 is that Obama \u2019 s largest contributor was Goldman Sachs , while the average donation to the Sanders campaign is about $ 27 . Sanders believes in moral leadership , which starts with refusing to play by the current set of rules , where special interests hold politicians hostage . If that is not a sign of a transformative leadership , I don \u2019 t know what is .",
