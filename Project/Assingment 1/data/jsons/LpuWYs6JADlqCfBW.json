Trump delivered a fiercely populist and often dark address , promising to transfer power in Washington from political elites to the people and vowing to put `` America first . ''\nSurrounded by members of Congress and the Supreme Court , the nation 's 45th president repeated themes from his historic and divisive campaign message , describing children in poverty , schools in crisis and streets pocked with crime and `` carnage . ''\n`` For too long , a small group in our nation 's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost , '' Trump said . `` Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth . The establishment protected itself . ''\nIn his 16-minute remarks , he criticized an educational system `` flush with cash '' that fails to fulfill its mission to students . He lamented factories left to rust while jobs flowed overseas . And he decried crime and gang violence , despite reports from the FBI and criminologists that the U.S. crime rate remains near historic lows .\n`` This American carnage stops right here and stops right now , '' Trump said , amid cheers from the crowd .\nMoments earlier , with his hand on Bibles once used by Abraham Lincoln and his own family , Trump pledged to `` preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States , '' completing an unlikely trajectory from real-estate mogul to the nation 's 45th president .\nA crowd that stretched along the National Mall assembled under gray Washington skies to witness the ceremony . So did nearly every living former president , from Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush to Bill Clinton and his wife , Hillary , who was defeated by Trump last November after a costly and bitter campaign .\nAfterward , dozens of dignitaries walked through light rain into the Capitol for a three-course lunch program emceed by Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt . The menu included Maine lobster and Gulf shrimp with saffron sauce and peanut crumble , Angus beef with dark chocolate sauce and potato gratin , and chocolate souffle with cherry vanilla ice cream .\nTrump and his vice president , former Indiana Gov . Mike Pence , presided over the parade , which stretched a little under 2 miles from the U.S. Capitol to the White House . School marching bands , the Boy Scouts , veterans groups and 8,000 members of the military participated .\nAlso lining that route : Protesters representing 99 different groups . In sporadic exchanges at security check points across downtown Washington , protesters shouted : `` No Trump ! No KKK ! No fascist USA ! '' Others carried signs with such slogans as `` Fake 45 . ''\nBut , so far , skirmishes appeared to be mostly free from violence . Not far from the White House , several hundred protesters clad in black ran through the streets , breaking windows and knocking over trash cans . Police fired pepper spray to subdue demonstrators . The Metropolitan Police Department reported at least 95 arrests , mostly on charges of rioting .\nPreparations for the event had been under way for months . Around 28,000 officers are on hand to provide security for the event , including Secret Service , FBI agents , the Coast Guard , police departments and nearly 8,000 National Guard troops .
