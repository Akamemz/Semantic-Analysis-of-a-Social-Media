She doubled down on her call for him to resign afterward .\nStill , as with Booker , there is a distrust of Gillibrand in some quarters , rooted in her perceived penchant for self-publicity . Her willingness to buck the party line , as when she suggested former President Clinton should have resigned over his affair with Monica Lewinsky , has created enemies as well as friends .\nMore generally , the answer to how Gillibrand overtakes several of the names higher on this list remains a difficult one to answer .\nOther potential candidates outside the top 10 : Former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu , former Virginia Gov .
