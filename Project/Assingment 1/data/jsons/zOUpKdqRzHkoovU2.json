    "content": "Polls have consistently shown that President Trump is pretty unpopular , with only about 42 percent of the American public approving of the job he is doing as president . These numbers are much lower than what one might expect given the bustling economy .\nBut does the standard presidential approval question actually capture what voters think of Trump \u2019 s job performance ? There are several reasons it might not tell the full story . For one , in this hyper-partisan era , presidential approval numbers have become increasingly polarized and don \u2019 t move around all that much , so they may now say more about which \u201c side \u201d people are on ( pro-Trump or anti-Trump , Republican or Democrat ) than voters \u2019 actual evaluation of how the president is doing .\nSo we ( Enns and Schuldt ) have worked to develop a hopefully more nuanced approach to measuring presidential approval , where we ask respondents how favorably they feel toward Trump relative to other notable Republicans . By not explicitly asking respondents whether they approve or disapprove of the president , we avoid forcing respondents to take sides , as they do in the standard presidential approval question . Instead , respondents from both parties evaluate Trump in comparison to other Republicans , like former President George W. Bush , the late Sen. John McCain , McCain \u2019 s former running mate Sarah Palin , Vice President Mike Pence , and former President Ronald Reagan . ( We selected these specific Republicans because they range from the highly regarded Reagan , who is often viewed as the voice of modern conservatism , to Palin , the former Alaska governor whose time in national politics was much shorter and less influential . ) We \u2019 re most interested in how the public views Trump when they aren \u2019 t asked about the president in isolation . Do respondents rate him as highly as other Republicans ? Less highly ? And does this help clarify whether partisan cheerleading is masking respondents \u2019 actual assessments of Trump in the traditional presidential approval question ?\nThis is now our second survey where we \u2019 ve measured Trump \u2019 s favorability among likely voters , and in both surveys , we found that the standard presidential approval question may be overestimating Trump \u2019 s popularity . Our first survey was conducted before the 2018 midterm elections ( July 3 to July 12 ) and our second survey was conducted soon after the Dec. 18 House vote that formally impeached the president ( Dec. 20 to Dec. 22 ) , but in both instances , likely voters rated Trump toward the bottom of our list of Republicans .\nBefore the midterms , Trump \u2019 s favorability rating was statistically indistinguishable from Pence \u2019 s , and only Palin was rated less favorably .
