They also include all those courtesies that have traditionally been associated with ladylike and gentlemanly conduct .\nThe failure to fully transmit these values and traditions to subsequent generations represents one of the failings of what journalist Tom Brokaw called `` The Greatest Generation . '' People in this so-called great generation , who lived during the trauma of the Great Depression and fought World War II , not only failed to transmit the moral values of their parents but also are responsible for government programs that will deliver economic chaos .\nBehavior accepted as the norm today would have been seen as despicable yesteryear .

Foul language is spoken by children in front of and sometimes to teachers and other adults . When I was a youngster , it was unthinkable to use foul language to any adult . It would have meant risking a smack across the face . But years ago , parents and teachers did n't have `` experts '' on child rearing to tell them that corporal punishment was wrong and ineffective and `` timeouts '' would be a superior form of discipline .
