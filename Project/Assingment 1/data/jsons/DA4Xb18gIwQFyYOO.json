    "content": "The Court unanimously held that these actions were not criminal under federal law , because the officials did not obtain any money or property when they realigned the toll lanes . All they did , the Court observed , was exercise their governmental authority for corrupt and fraudulent reasons . Although the officials used government employees \u2019 time and money to carry out the realignment scheme , that time and money was not the purpose of the scheme . What the officials really wanted was to use government power for partisan aims\u2014to make life harder for the constituents of their political opponent . And that , the Court concluded , is not a federal crime .\nThe Court \u2019 s willingness to permit public officials to get away with concededly corrupt acts is nothing new . The Court previously\u201a and unanimously\u201a vacated the conviction of the former governor of Virginia , who gave out access to meetings in exchange for political donations . There , too , the Court accepted that that is just how government works : Even though the acts were \u201c distasteful , \u201d the Court expressed that the prosecution \u201c could cast a pall of potential prosecution over \u201d much of how the Court thought government works\u2014namely , doling out access for political favors .\nThese decisions unanimously concluded that federal criminal law does not currently prohibit the defendants \u2019 conduct . So could Congress pass a law criminalizing this sort of behavior ? That \u2019 s not clear\u2014the Court doesn \u2019 t seem to like that idea either . In the case involving the Virginia governor , for example , the Court intimated that there were \u201c significant constitutional concerns \u201d with the federal government \u2019 s attempt to prosecute a government official for taking a bribe , which the Court viewed as ordinary , if untoward , government conduct .\nSuch statements are not mere abstractions . The Court \u2019 s conservatives have invalidated several statutes that were designed to combat public corruption , on the grounds that money in politics is not only how government works , but perhaps even enshrined in the Constitution . Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission invalidated the federal limits on corporate campaign expenditures . The federal government argued that the limits were necessary to reduce quid pro quo corruption and the appearance of corruption ; the majority dismissed the idea that large campaign expenditures gave rise to the appearance of corruption . In a subsequent decision , McCutcheon v. FEC , the Court struck down related aggregate limits on campaign contributions that were designed to prevent the superrich from purchasing political favors , among other things .\nPart of what is striking about the Court \u2019 s decision in the Bridgegate scandal is that it comes at a moment of very public government corruption that jeopardizes Americans \u2019 health and safety during a dangerous pandemic . Take the press conference where the president claimed that he had instructed Vice President Mike Pence not to return the calls of unappreciative governors . Or when he claimed to send ventilators to Colorado because of Republican Senator Cory Gardner , who is up for a tough reelection fight this year . The Democratic governor of Michigan , Gretchen Whitmer , has alleged that the federal government has encouraged businesses not to provide any support to the state . The president and Senator Mitch McConnell have openly acknowledged that their views on coronavirus-relief packages are based on whether the states in need happen to be led by Democrats or Republicans . And the Department of Justice now refuses to prosecute the president \u2019 s formal national security adviser for lying to the federal government and secretly working for a foreign government .",
