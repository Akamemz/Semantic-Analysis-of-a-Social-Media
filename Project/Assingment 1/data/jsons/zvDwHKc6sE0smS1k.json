Its winds dropped to a potent 115 mph when it made its second landfall on Marco Island , down from its 185 mph peak .\nOverall , the storm submerged streets in Florida , caused power outages for millions and snapped huge construction cranes in Miami .\nBut faith was on display as the storm was threatening into Florida .\nPresident Donald Trump bowed in prayer with his Cabinet as Vice President Mike Pence opened an emergency planning meeting with prayer at Camp David on Saturday .
