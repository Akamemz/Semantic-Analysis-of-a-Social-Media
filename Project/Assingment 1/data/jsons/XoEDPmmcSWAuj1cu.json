For most , it is their first job ever . In House offices , one-third of staffers are in their first year , while only 1 in 3 has worked there for five years or more .\nAmong the aides who work on powerful committees where the nation \u2019 s legislation takes shape , resumes are a little longer : Half have four years of experience .\nWhen Americans wonder why Congress can \u2019 t seem to get anything done , this could be a clue . It \u2019 s also a sharp difference from the average government employee : Unlike many state and federal workers with comfortable salaries , pensions and seemingly endless tenures , those in the halls of power are more likely to be inexperienced and overworked .\nLow pay for high-stress jobs with less-than-stellar prospects for advancement takes a toll on institutional memory and expertise .\nWhile senators make $ 174,000 , staff assistants and legislative correspondents \u2014 by far the most common positions in the Senate \u2014 have median pay of $ 30,000 and $ 35,000 , respectively , significantly less than Senate janitors and a fairly low salary for college graduates in a city as expensive as Washington .\nHistorical pay records were transcribed from book form by the website Legistorm .\nThe size of committee and members \u2019 staffs have remained the same over the past decade , and salaries have often not risen with inflation \u2014 or at all .\nThe average legislative counsel in the House made $ 56,000 last year , less than in 2007 . While pay for parking-lot attendants in the House increased from $ 26,000 to $ 49,000 in the past decade , pay for staff assistants , who make up the bulk of the House \u2019 s workforce , rose from $ 26,000 to $ 30,000 . That puts them in the bottom fifth of the region \u2019 s college-educated workforce .\nIt means that young workers have proximity to enormous power while surviving on a meager budget \u2014 dual forces that come together to push congressional staffers through the \u201c revolving door \u201d to highly paid K Street lobbyists . In the revolving door , former congressional staff and members use their personal connections and insider knowledge to attempt to pull the levers of power on behalf of a paying client . A former congressional staffer is among the most valuable assets a company desiring legislative change can buy .\nBut it also means that staffers are often forced to rely on lobbyists while they still work for Congress , sometimes for the purest of reasons : While lobbyists with decades of experience in energy policy or other arcane areas are common , such depth of experience is nearly nonexistent on Capitol Hill . Though 10 years of experience in a home-state office , which handles constituent services and other less stressful concerns , is not rare , a person with a decade of experience is few and far between in Washington .\n\u201c Who are congressional staff going to turn to ? \u201d asked Daniel Schuman , a former Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) lawyer who now studies policy at the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation . \u201c The experienced staff aren \u2019 t there . But lobbyists and think tanks are beating down the door : \u2018 Here \u2019 s the legislation , here are the research materials and I \u2019 ve got the co-sponsors lined up . \u2019 \u201d\nAs policy questions more frequently hinge on the nuances of technical matters , members of Congress are operating without the researchers and topical experts on which they have relied to cast informed votes .\nWith the shuttering of the Office of Technology Assessment , a 200-member congressional support agency that closed in 1995 under House Speaker Newt Gingrich , members who are largely lawyers and rhetorical masters are asked to differentiate between competing proposals that only scientists might be able to evaluate effectively .\nThe technology office researched and summarized scientific and technological matters , ranging from acid rain to wireless phones , for members who , with an average age of 64 in the Senate and 58 in the House , are legislating on matters such as the Internet , which most spent much of their lives without . Typical of its work products was a decades-ago warning on the effect of technology on copyright law , a question lawmakers contentiously grappled with this year .\n\u201c It helped us to \u2026 better oversee the science and technology programs within the federal establishment , \u201d said then-Rep. Amo Houghton , New York Republican , who served nine terms before retiring in 2005 . The role of CRS , which provides research on topics beyond science and technology , has also been rolled back .\nBrian Darling , a former Senate staffer who is now senior fellow for government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation , said he strongly supports smaller government , but sometimes symbolic cuts can backfire .\n\u201c Cutbacks at CRS to me don \u2019 t make a lot of sense , with their institutional knowledge . They put out a great nonpartisan work product . When crafting the legislative branch appropriation bill , members of Congress are trying to show they want to cut spending , but there can be repercussions , \u201d he said .\nThough it seems paradoxical , a lack of knowledge and resources by congressional staffers can make for waste , Mr. Schuman said , citing an inability to conduct oversight , agency regulations that are left unchallenged , loopholes slipped into laws that are giveaways for special interests and poorly implemented programs .\nHe pointed to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security .\n\u201c The department is a mess because people didn \u2019 t understand what would happen when you merge so many different agencies with different cultures , \u201d he said . \u201c It is bloated , inefficient and maladroit . \u201d\nA failure by Congress to \u201c understand the laws it passed \u201d and \u201c innovations in the private sector \u201d also led ultimately to a huge crunch and the massive bailouts with taxpayer money , he said .\nConsider the class of 2005 .

Making that money for 10 years puts people behind for the rest of their lives in terms of retirement , \u201d Mr. Schuman said .\nMost college-educated workers in the D.C. area earn $ 81,000 or more , with an average salary of $ 93,850 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau . For college grads under 30 , the median salary is $ 42,000 .\nSome 300 staffers who started in 2005 or 2006 are already registered federal lobbyists , a Times review of records indicated .
