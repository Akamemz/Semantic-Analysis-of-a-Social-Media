    "content": "After two weeks of bleary all-nighters in Paris , diplomats from around the world have hammered out a major global agreement to address climate change . Here 's the full 31-page document , which was approved by 195 countries on Saturday .\nIt 's important to be clear on what this wad of paper actually does . The Paris climate agreement has n't saved the planet , and it has n't solved global warming . Not by itself . Instead , the deal is supposed to add structure and momentum to efforts that are currently underway around the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .\nThat 's a worthwhile task in its own right . Since 2014 , nearly every country has submitted a voluntary plan to the United Nations for tackling climate change . The US is reducing carbon dioxide from power plants . China is boosting wind and solar . And so on . But those pledges , in the aggregate , remain weak and inadequate . If you add them all up , global emissions are projected to keep rising through 2030 , putting us on pace for 2.7\u00b0C ( or more ) of warming by century 's end . That 's well above the 2\u00b0C threshold that many scientists argue is unacceptably risky :\nWhat this Paris agreement does , then , is provide a set of diplomatic tools to prod countries into cutting emissions even more deeply over time . The deal 's text starts with aspirational goals : The world should aim for an emissions peak `` as soon as possible '' and limit total warming to less than 2\u00b0C , or perhaps even to 1.5\u00b0C . ( The Earth has already warmed about 1\u00b0C since pre-industrial times . ) It 's a signal that countries at least hope to do more than they 're already doing .\nRelated The radical idea at the core of the Paris climate deal\nThe deal then adds transparency measures to verify that nations are actually restraining their emissions . Importantly , it requires that countries reconvene every five years to reconsider the ambition level of their pledges . And wealthy countries have set a goal of providing more than $ 100 billion per year in public and private financing by 2020 for poorer countries , to help them invest in clean energy and cope with sea-level rise , droughts , floods , and other ravages of climate change .\nThere are plenty of hard questions about how effective these diplomatic tools will be . Will the transparency measures work ? Will that climate aid actually materialize ? The basic reality , though , is that the Paris agreement can only encourage countries to step up their efforts . It ca n't force them to do so . That 's the hard part , the part that comes next . Further action will ultimately depend on policymakers and investors and engineers and scientists and activists across the globe , not the UN .\nIn other words , the Paris deal is only a first step . Perhaps the easiest step . To stop global warming , every country will have to do much , much more in the years ahead to transition away from fossil fuels ( which still provide 86 percent of the world 's energy ) , move to cleaner sources , and halt deforestation . Countries will have to pursue new policies , adopt new technologies , go far beyond what they 've already promised .\nThis @ rogerpielkejr chart is a good way to visualize the scale of the climate challenge . A * lot * more work to do : pic.twitter.com/HY96FyEPgJ \u2014 brad plumer ( @ bradplumer ) December 12 , 2015\nIf we want decent odds of staying below 2\u00b0C of global warming \u2014 the grandiose target laid out in the Paris deal \u2014 then most countries will have to make radical changes , and quickly . It 's an extraordinarily difficult undertaking , with no guarantees we 'll succeed .\nStart with this fact : The Paris deal , negotiated through the United Nations , does not legally require any emission cuts . Negotiators tried to craft an agreement like that back in 1997 , with the Kyoto Protocol , and it simply did n't work . It was infeasible to force countries to make sharp cuts they did n't want to make . ( See here for more on that history . )\nInstead , the Paris talks took a radically different approach . Every country started off by deciding for itself how it plans to tackle greenhouse gas emissions , taking into account its own unique domestic situation . Since 2014 , every single major emitter has submitted a climate pledge to the UN . A few highlights :\nThe United States is vowing to cut its greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 , through policies like the Clean Power Plan to decarbonize power plants .\nThe European Union will cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 .\nChina has vowed that its emissions will peak around 2030 and that it will get about 20 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources by then .\nBrazil will cut emissions 37 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 , with an emphasis on curbing illegal deforestation in the Amazon .\nIndia will continue to reduce its carbon intensity , or CO2 output per unit of economic activity , in line with historic levels ( though overall emissions will grow ) .\nThese pledges are all plausible , rooted in each country 's analysis of what 's politically possible and technologically feasible . But they 're also insufficient to avoid serious climate change . As noted earlier , if you assume every country follows its pledge to the letter , global emissions would nonetheless keep rising through 2030 , and we 'll be setting ourselves up for around 3\u00b0C of global warming by century 's end , well past the 2\u00b0C mark long considered bad news .\nSo that 's where this Paris agreement comes in . The goal was to provide a support structure that will , negotiators hope , allow these national pledges to get stronger over time . Key features in the final deal include :\nAn overall temperature goal . The Earth has already warmed about 1\u00b0C since pre-industrial levels , because of all the greenhouse gases we 've put into the air . As part of the Paris deal , countries are aiming to overall total global warming to less than 2\u00b0C , and possibly even keep it down to 1.5\u00b0C , in recognition that many dangerous impacts are likely to occur above that level . Of course , these goals are only aspirational , and they 'll be impossible to meet without policies to match .\nThe Earth has already warmed about 1\u00b0C since pre-industrial levels , because of all the greenhouse gases we 've put into the air .

Currently global emissions are n't expected to peak until 2030 or later , which would make it extremely difficult , if not impossible , to stay below 2\u00b0C . So as part of the deal , countries agreed on a vague goal of aiming for peak emissions `` as soon as possible . '' They will also aim to achieve net zero emissions by the second half of the century , though there 's no specific timeline .\nCurrently global emissions are n't expected to peak until 2030 or later , which would make it extremely difficult , if not impossible , to stay below 2\u00b0C .

''\nThe Paris deal will officially come into force when at least 55 countries accounting for 55 percent of global emissions have formally acceded . ( So , for instance , you 'd probably need China , the United States , Europe , India , and Russia to all come on board . )\nWill this climate deal actually work ? Can we stay below 2\u00b0C ?\nThere 's ample room for skepticism about this agreement . Countries are offering up entirely voluntary climate pledges that are , so far , awfully flimsy .

That 's the risk with any treaty based on voluntary actions . It 's why you see critics like James Hansen , a prominent climate scientist , calling these talks `` worthless . ''\nAgain , though , the rationale behind the Paris approach was that no one could ever get China , India , or the United States to agree to a legally binding UN deal that mandated deep cuts or global carbon taxes from the get-go . So instead , negotiators decided to start with voluntary pledges , ensure universal participation , and then try to iterate from there , through cooperation and political persuasion .\nAs political scientist David Victor told me : `` The encouraging precedent here is in trade \u2014 where you get a bicycle theory of cooperation . '' This is the idea that once the process of trade liberalization gets underway , it keeps gathering momentum in subsequent talks : `` You build credibility and trust over time and then move to bigger issues . ''\nOr , if you like metaphors : Think of the countries making climate pledges as a bunch of out-of-shape slobs trying ( and failing miserably ) to qualify for a relay event . The Paris agreement ca n't force these people to train harder . But it can put their names up on a whiteboard , track their progress , work out gym subsidies for those who ca n't afford it , and facilitate peer pressure . Obviously the exercise is the crucial part , and that ultimately depends on each individual . But that other stuff can help .\nSo it 's worth keeping these talks in perspective . The Paris agreement can support ongoing efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions and curb deforestation . But whether Earth warms 2\u00b0C or 2.5\u00b0C or 3\u00b0C simply wo n't be decided by this deal alone . That will depend on what future policies get enacted by individual countries , on how quickly we switch over to alternative energy sources , on how technology evolves .\nAnd the bottom line is that current policies will have to undergo a serious revision if we want to avoid drastic temperature increases . A recent report from MIT and Climate Interactive looked at how national pledges would have to be ratcheted up between now and 2030 to stay below 2\u00b0C of warming :\nThose are wrenching changes . China would have to do much more to ramp up low-carbon energy and shift away from coal so that emissions peak by 2025 instead of 2030 . The United States would have to double or triple its current climate policies . Coming even close to 2\u00b0C would involve far-reaching efforts to decarbonize homes , vehicles , power plants , and factories . Clean tech would have to proliferate far more rapidly . Plus , we 'd likely need to develop technology to suck massive amounts of CO2 out of the air by the latter half of the century . No one knows if that 's even feasible .\nBut that would be true with or without this agreement . Tackling climate change is a massive , herculean task , the work of generations . That was true before the Paris deal , and it 's just as true now .\nSome of the best , most detailed analysis of the Paris climate agreement is happening over at Carbon Brief . Check out its rundown of the final deal here .\nhere Here is my history of the 2\u00b0C global warming target , and here 's a look at how the math of meeting it looks increasingly brutal .\nmy history of the 2\u00b0C global warming target a look Robert McSweeney and Roz Pidcock looked at why negotiators adopted the even more stringent goal of 1.5\u00b0C in the final deal . Many of the risks of climate change , such as damage to coral reefs , are thought to happen even before we hit 2\u00b0C . The problem is that it 's extremely unlikely , at this point , that we can cut emissions enough to stay at 1.5\u00b0C .\nlooked at Michael Levi has a smart analysis of the final Paris climate deal , noting that many of the divisions and acrimony that plagued past climate talks could still resurface in the future . He also notes that public perception of the deal could matter a lot in determining its success .\nCoral Davenport of the New York Times argues that the Paris deal will be a success if it provides a signal to markets and investors that clean energy is the future . We 'll see if that happens , but that could end up being the deal 's most concrete impact .\nFinally , one thing the Paris deal did n't address was international shipping and aviation , which account for 4 percent of global emissions . That will be left for future talks . Read Julian Spector 's piece for a look at why this is such a tricky issue .",

That will depend on what future policies get enacted by individual countries, on how quickly we switch over to alternative energy sources, on how technology evolves.\n\nAnd the bottom line is that current policies will have to undergo a serious revision if we want to avoid drastic temperature increases. A recent report from MIT and Climate Interactive looked at how national pledges would have to be ratcheted up between now and 2030 to stay below 2\u00b0C of warming:\n\nThose are wrenching changes. China would have to do much more to ramp up low-carbon energy and shift away from coal so that emissions peak by 2025 instead of 2030. The United States would have to double or triple its current climate policies. Coming even close to 2\u00b0C would involve far-reaching efforts to decarbonize homes, vehicles, power plants, and factories. Clean tech would have to proliferate far more rapidly. Plus, we'd likely need to develop technology to suck massive amounts of CO2 out of the air by the latter half of the century. No one knows if that's even feasible.\n\nBut that would be true with or without this agreement. Tackling climate change is a massive, herculean task, the work of generations. That was true before the Paris deal, and it's just as true now.\n\nWhat else should I read about the Paris deal?\n\nSome of the best, most detailed analysis of the Paris climate agreement is happening over at Carbon Brief. Check out its rundown of the final deal here .\n\nhere Here is my history of the 2\u00b0C global warming target , and here's a look at how the math of meeting it looks increasingly brutal.\n\nmy history of the 2\u00b0C global warming target a look Robert McSweeney and Roz Pidcock looked at why negotiators adopted the even more stringent goal of 1.5\u00b0C in the final deal. Many of the risks of climate change, such as damage to coral reefs, are thought to happen even before we hit 2\u00b0C. The problem is that it's extremely unlikely, at this point, that we can cut emissions enough to stay at 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nlooked at Michael Levi has a smart analysis of the final Paris climate deal, noting that many of the divisions and acrimony that plagued past climate talks could still resurface in the future. He also notes that public perception of the deal could matter a lot in determining its success.\n\nCoral Davenport of the New York Times argues that the Paris deal will be a success if it provides a signal to markets and investors that clean energy is the future. We'll see if that happens, but that could end up being the deal's most concrete impact.\n\nFinally, one thing the Paris deal didn't address was international shipping and aviation, which account for 4 percent of global emissions. That will be left for future talks. Read Julian Spector's piece for a look at why this is such a tricky issue.",
