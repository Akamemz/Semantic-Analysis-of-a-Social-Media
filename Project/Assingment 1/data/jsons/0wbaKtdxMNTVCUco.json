''\n- Check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator and game out your own strategy for November .\nObama , along with other Democrats , pushed back , saying Romney was injecting politics during a time of still-developing international crisis . Like Romney , the president did not mince words about his political opponent .\n`` Gov . Romney seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later , and as president , one of the things I 've learned is you ca n't do that , '' Obama said during an interview with CBS . `` It 's important for you to make sure that the statements that you make are backed up by the facts and that you 've thought through the ramifications before you make them . ''\nRomney 's first statement came Tuesday night around 10 p.m . ET , as reports indicated an American diplomatic worker in Benghazi , Libya , had been killed in an attack on the consulate there . The Republican candidate 's statement was sent before news broke that the American ambassador to Libya , J. Christopher Stevens , had been killed in the attack .\nIn separate protests in Cairo , several men scaled the walls of the U.S. embassy and tore down its American flag . The violence in both Libya and Egypt stemmed from anger about an online film considered offensive to Islam .\nIn his statement , Romney said he was `` outraged '' by the attacks in Benghazi and Cairo , but took harsh aim at the Obama administration for what he characterized as a weak response to the violence .\n`` It 's disgraceful that the Obama Administration 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks , '' Romney wrote , an apparent reference to a statement from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo that denounced the anti-Islam film that is the source of the protesters ' anger . The embassy 's statement was released before protesters stormed the American embassy in Cairo on Tuesday .\nThe embassy in Egypt wrote that it `` condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims \u2013 as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions . ''\n`` Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy , '' the statement continued . `` We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others . ''\nA second statement , from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , said anger over the film did not justify the violence .\n`` The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others , '' Clinton wrote . `` Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation . But let me be clear : There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind . ''\nObama 's presidential campaign responded quickly to Romney 's statement , saying their rival was using events in the Middle East for blind political gain .\n`` We are shocked that , at a time when the United States of America is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in Libya , Governor Romney would choose to launch a political attack , '' Obama campaign press secretary Ben LaBolt wrote .\nIn his remarks Wednesday in Florida , Romney said it was `` never too early for the United States government to condemn attacks on Americans and to defend our values . ''\n`` I think it is a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values , '' Romney said . `` That instead when our grounds are being attacked and being breached that the first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation . And apology for America 's values is never the right course . ''\nThe fact that the statement came from the American embassy in Egypt , and not from the president himself , does n't negate Obama 's responsibility , Romney said .\n`` Their administration spoke .
