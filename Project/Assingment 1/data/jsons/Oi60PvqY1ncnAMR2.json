Tom Price ( R-Ga. ) , a physician by trade , introduced the Empowering Patients First Act in June , following up versions of the bill written in 2009 and 2011 , the two note.His new bill calls for repealing Obamacare and allowing insurance sales across state lines while allowing healthcare expense tax deductions , medical malpractice reform , and other options to reduce costs while increasing access to care . `` It \u2019 s important to move away from [ a ] employer-based health care system , and Price \u2019 s bill achieves this goal by providing portability , allowing coverage to be tied to an individual , not an employer , so that if workers change or lose their job , they can keep their insurance , '' note Norquist and Gleason.The Price bill also allows individuals , families , and small businesses to link together to make their healthcare costs more affordable . The two point out that Price 's bill would save $ 2.34 trillion in federal taxpayer dollars by eliminating new and higher taxes created by Obamacare , according to an estimate done by former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz-Eakin.Another Republican-sponsored alternative , the American Health Care Reform Act presented in September , is similar to Price 's bill and also allows individuals and families to deduct healthcare expenses , Norquist and Gleason say . `` Republicans do have their own health care reform proposals , '' the two conclude . `` In fact , '' they add , `` they \u2019 re in bill format , posted online , and can be accessed in a fraction of the time that it takes one to unsuccessfully log on to HealthCare.gov .
