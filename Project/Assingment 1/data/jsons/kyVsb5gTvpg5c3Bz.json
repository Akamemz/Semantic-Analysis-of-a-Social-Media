So does the rest of the GOP field .\nWith reliable polling so far virtually nonexistent here , the shrunken crew of Republican candidates descended upon the state on Wednesday , eager to make their pitches ahead of the Feb. 20 primary .\nIn a dirt-floor-covered rodeo arena on the outskirts of Clemson University , Trump boasted of his enormous New Hampshire victory .\n`` We won it big . ... We won by a lot \u2014 a really lot , \u201d he said to roaring applause from a crowd of about 3,000 . \u201c I got like one hour of sleep \u2026 because when you have victory you don \u2019 t need sleep . \u201d\nThe evening rally , hosted in the heart of a deeply conservative and religious district of rural South Carolina , began with a prayer \u2014 and a knock on the media . Almost every head was bowed as African-American evangelical Pastor Mark Burns told the crowd that Trump \u201c believes in Jesus Christ \u201d and is an authentic Republican . \u201c The media believe Trump is not a true conservative \u2026 but the devil is a liar . \u201d\nBut rather than talking about socially conservative issues , Trump launched into an attack on Jeb Bush , aiming to end the candidacy of a man who must win here to keep his bid alive . Bush , Trump noted , spent millions more than other contenders in New Hampshire . \u201c And what , is he fourth or fifth ? \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 ve spent less money than anybody else \u2014 but I \u2019 m No . 1 , '' Trump said . \u201c I feel bad for this guy because he \u2019 s not going to win . ''\nFor Bush , barely hanging on in the 2016 GOP race for the White House , South Carolina could be his last , best shot . Trump went time and again into a rant against the ex-Florida governor on Wednesday night , knocking him on everything from education to immigration .\n\u201c Jeb Bush loves Common Core and he loves weak borders . ... \u2018 They come as an act of love ? \u2019 \u201d he asked sarcastically , flicking at an often-repeated Bush comment about the reasons undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. \u201c Give me a break . \u201d\nSticking to his usual points , Trump warned the crowd that America is falling behind the rest of the world , in everything from infrastructure to schooling for the next generation : \u201c You go to some of these Asian countries , you go to Saudi Arabia , Qatar , different places in China , you see airports and infrastructure of the likes you \u2019 ve never seen \u2026 We \u2019 ve got trains , they \u2019 re like \u2026 150 years old ! We \u2019 re becoming a Third World country ! \u201d\nAnd he railed against \u201c political correctness , \u201d a point that delighted the crowd . \u201c You go to a department store and what don \u2019 t you see ? \u2018 Merry Christmas. \u2019 You don \u2019 t see \u2018 Merry Christmas \u2019 anymore .
