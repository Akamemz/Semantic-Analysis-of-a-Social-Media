Snapp & Son , Inc. v. Puerto Rico , Schmitt pointed out the legitimacy of his lawsuit : \u201c As a sovereign State , Missouri has \u2018 a quasi-sovereign interest in the health and well-being\u2014both physical and economic\u2014of its residents in general. \u2019 \u2026 A state like Missouri , through its Attorney General , may act as \u2018 a representative of the public \u2019 in \u2018 complaining of a wrong which , if proven , limits the opportunities of her people [ and ] shackles her industries . \u2019 \u201d\nHe also explained why the Chinese Communist Party was not immune from prosecution :\nDefendant People \u2019 s Republic of China ( \u201c PRC \u201d or \u201c China \u201d ) is a communist nation in Asia . Defendant Communist Party of China ( \u201c CPC \u201d or \u201c Communist Party \u201d ) is the sole governing party within China , and the Communist Party \u2019 s General Secretary becomes the president of the PRC . On information and belief , the Communist Party is not an organ or political subdivision of the PRC , nor is it owned by the PRC or a political subdivision of the PRC , and thus it is not protected by sovereign immunity .\nCOVID-19 has done irreparable damage to countries across the globe , causing sickness , death , economic disruption , and human suffering .

They must be held accountable for their actions .\nAn appalling campaign of deceit , concealment , misfeasance , and inaction by Chinese authorities unleashed this pandemic . During the critical weeks of the initial outbreak , Chinese authorities deceived the public , suppressed crucial information , arrested whistleblowers , denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence , destroyed critical medical research , permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus , and even hoarded personal protective equipment ( \u201c PPE \u201d ) \u2014thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable .\nThe lawsuit continues with more regarding the efforts by the Chinese government to suppress information regarding the coronavirus :\nWhen their actions began to kill hundreds of thousands of people across the globe , Defendants sought to minimize the consequences , engaging in a coverup and misleading public relations campaign by censoring scientists , ordering the destruction and suppression of valuable research , and refusing cooperation with the global community , all in violation of international health standards .\nSchmitt also noted that the Chinese government did not act to stop the spread of the virus soon enough :\nWhile denying human-to-human transmission , Chinese officials took little to no steps to contain the outbreak . By January 13 , the Chinese government was aware of spread to Thailand . For the next week , they began treating COVID-19 as a serious and contagious virus without advising the public . During that time , millions of people traveled through Wuhan , and many thousands were infected , making a worldwide outbreak almost inevitable .
