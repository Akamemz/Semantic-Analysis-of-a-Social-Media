    "content_original": "Expect to hear this charge -- and its extremely similar counter-charge -- a lot over the next six months or so. In an interview with CNN, presumptive Democratic nominee slammed her erstwhile friend and freshly-minted general election rival Donald Trump as \"divisive and dangerous,\" arguing that his conduct and comments demonstrate that \"he is not qualified to be President of the United States.\" That's an escalation from a previous assessment of Trump, in which she declined to take a definitive position on Trump's standing. Watch:\n\nClinton juxtaposes Trump's war of words with British Prime Minister David Cameron -- which may be of concern to conservatives who've lamented President Obama's strained relationships and high-profile snubs of key US allies -- with his stated willingness to meet with North Korea, one of the world's most heinous despots.
