    "content_original": "The debate Monday will be the last between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. 5 things to watch in Monday's debate\n\nThe greatest show on earth meets for one last time tonight in the Sunshine State.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have had two of the most memorable debates in modern presidential history, and they get together for the last one in Boca Raton, Fla. tonight.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama needs to keep Romney from looking like an acceptable alternative as president, as Romney has \u2014 to varying degrees \u2014 in the last two debates. Romney needs to narrow Obama\u2019s edge on foreign policy and national security with voters, and to argue that the president\u2019s policies in the Mideast have failed.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full coverage of the debate)\n\nBelow, POLITICO\u2019s five things to watch:\n\n1. Who\u2019s the first to bring home foreign policy\n\nThe issue of the day remains the economy, despite a final debate that is focused on global issues.\n\nThe candidate who is best able to relate the foreign policy questions back to jobs at home is likely to emerge with an edge in the final showdown.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: 6 questions that will settle the election)\n\nFor example, Paul Ryan was the first to raise John Kennedy\u2019s tax policies in the vice presidential debate \u2014 and was quickly mocked for it by Joe Biden in \u201cyou\u2019re no Jack Kennedy\u201d fashion.\n\nExpect either Romney or Obama to try to make the Kennedy case about U.S trade policy, such as China\u2019s effects on manufacturing in the Midwest. For Romney, this is an extension of an argument he\u2019s made on the campaign trail \u2014 and an opportunity to move away from an ill-phrased claim that Russia is the nation\u2019s greatest geo-political foe.\n\nObama\u2019s response on China in last week\u2019s debate was to point to Romney\u2019s personal investments in Chinese companies. A more specific case about how to address China \u2014 which Romney has dubbed a currency manipulator but hasn\u2019t detailed what he would do for an encore \u2014 will need to be made here, especially to lure an audience for a debate that, to quote Ryan, is likely to get \u201cwonky.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Romney's toughest debate)\n\n\u201cThis is not a foreign policy debate,\u201d said Republican strategist Alex Castellanos. \u201cThat\u2019s the trap for both these candidates. For Obama it is the natural urge to explain what he has done on foreign policy. For Romney it is the natural urge to prove he is competent on this turf and not just a businessman. Message to both candidates: Get over it. Don\u2019t worry about compensating for your weaknesses on foreign policy. Tell me how you would restore our economy at home so we can project American strength in the world.\u201d\n\n2. How they handle Libya\n\nEven without moderator Candy Crowley\u2019s controversial handling of a Libya question at last week\u2019s debate, there was general consensus among Republicans that Romney muffed a chance to make a broad case against the Obama administration.\n\nBut his rough outing last week doesn\u2019t mean Romney will leave Libya off the table tonight.\n\n( See also: Battleground tracking poll: Romney takes lead)\n\nThe drip-drip of information raising questions about the attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi continued up until the end of last week.",
