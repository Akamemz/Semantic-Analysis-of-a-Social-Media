There were some overlapping topics , so we grouped them into categories . Here \u2019 s a stroll down memory lane :\n1 . Ferguson : Not surprisingly , the shooting of Missouri teenager Michael Brown dominated much of the coverage and readers \u2019 interest . Three of the top stories were , \u201c What does Michael Brown \u2019 s official autopsy actually reveal ? \u201d , \u201c What do the newly released witness statements tell us about the Michael Brown shooting ? \u201d , and \u201c The country reacts to Ferguson decision. \u201d The shooting in Ferguson thrust the issue of race back into the national spotlight and put President Obama and his administration in a difficult position . The president and Attorney General Eric Holder have called for improvements in community policing , and Obama has called on Congress to allocate $ 75 million over three years for 50,000 new body cameras to be used by police . Activists still would like the president to visit Ferguson , and while he has shown sympathy for the protesters , he also urged , \u201c [ W ] e need to accept that this decision was the grand jury \u2019 s to make. \u201d By the way , despite everything in the massive end-of-the-year spending bill , funding for body cameras was not in there . It will have to wait until next year \u2013 if it passes at all .\n2 . Midterm election : The consequential midterm election that turned Senate control and , thereby all of Congress , over to Republicans , also dominated \u2014 as expected . Our election results live blog , live elections tracker , our live coverage , featuring two of your authors , our Morning Line about turnout being the lowest in 70 years , and even a Kentucky Senate debate between Sen. Mitch McConnell and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes , were among the top three purely political , non-Ferguson , stories on the site . It \u2019 s not clear exactly how McConnell , the incoming Senate Majority Leader , will run the Upper Chamber , but signs emerged in the lame duck of some of the fights \u2014 and political splits in both parties \u2014 ahead .\n3 . Polarization : The moderates are dying , if not altogether gone , in Congress . And Americans continue to be fascinated \u2014 or disgusted \u2014 by which corners we all fit into . Our Political Party Identification Quiz , which is still live and you can take here , was third only to election results and Ferguson . Right up there was our recap of how liberals and conservatives are worlds apart on issues beyond politics , like with whom they socialize , how big their house should be , or whether they should live near museums .\n4 . Health care : The health care law , Obamacare , or the Affordable Care Act \u2014 whatever you want to call it \u2014 continued to draw interest . There was more money spent against the law than on any other issue during the 2014 campaign . But the law \u2019 s future could , once again , hang in the hands of the nine Supreme Court justices next year when they take up whether federal subsidies for state exchanges are constitutional . It \u2019 s clear Americans are still very curious what will happen with the law , especially considering that one of the most clicked-on stories on the site was about a small change , or fix , to the law that Republicans were able to secure back in April . Just what will the new Republican-controlled Congress do about the health care law ? For clues , look no further than McConnell \u2019 s comments that even though he wants to repeal it \u201c root and branch , \u201d he knows the president holds a veto pen and won \u2019 t let that happen .\n5 . U.S. House sues Obama : Anger over immigration led to House Republicans suing President Obama\u2026 over health care ? Just as the unaccompanied minors crisis was boiling over in July , House Republicans \u2014 for the first time in U.S. history \u2014 passed a resolution authorizing the chamber to sue the president of the United States . The language of the bill , though , didn \u2019 t have to do with immigration at all , but instead with the health law \u2019 s mandate to buy insurance . The lawsuit also did not get filed for several months , but is now making its way through the courts . One of the other top stories was President Obama \u2019 s energized response in which he mocked Republicans and dismissed their lawsuit as a \u201c stunt . \u201d\n6 . What do 28 classified pages from a 9/11 report reveal : The details of 9/11 , the worst terrorist attack in this country \u2019 s history , continues to stoke interest . In particular , one of the most read/watched items on the site was the NewsHour segment featuring New Yorker writer Lawrence Wright , who investigated what could be revealed in 28 classified pages of a 9/11 report . What \u2019 s in them ? You \u2019 ll have to click for yourself\u2026\n7 . Immigration : The red-hot topic of immigration saw an unaccompanied minors crisis at the Southern U.S. border and even sparked a lawsuit ( OK , they say it was about health care ) and caused a conservative rebellion on the end-of-year government funding plan . But the story that stood apart was the one wrapping President Obama \u2019 s actual announcement of long-awaited executive action on immigration .\n8 . President Obama \u2019 s unpopularity : The president was in a tough spot during this election year . There were a myriad of issues that were out of his control both at home and abroad . But in his sixth year , he was in a familiar position for presidents , with all-time lows in approval . It got one of us asking in June whether Americans had simply tuned out the president .\n9 . Taxes : Death and taxes , they say , are the only things assured in life . And Americans want to know where they stand , which might help explain why a story from last January , \u201c Tax code changes will hit high income Americans hardest , \u201d was one of the top stories on the site for 2014 .\n10 . $ 18 trillion in debt : It \u2019 s a huge number . But just as Congress was moving toward passing a massive $ 1 trillion spending bill to fund the government for a year , the country \u2019 s debt moved past $ 18 trillion ( and then dipped below again ) . There are plenty of reasons for the debt increase \u2014 and both parties are at fault in one way or another . But Americans continue to be worried about the level of debt and what it will mean for the country \u2019 s future . The largest driver of the debt is entitlements and health care , but those are relatively apolitical , easy-to-tackle topics , right ?\nDaily Presidential Trivia : On this day in 2000 , President-elect George W. Bush nominated Colin Powell to be the first African American secretary of state . Who was the first African American to be appointed to a cabinet-level position and under which president ? Be the first to tweet us the correct answer using # PoliticsTrivia and you \u2019 ll get a Morning Line shout-out .
