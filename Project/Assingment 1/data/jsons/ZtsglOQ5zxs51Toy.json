The sticker patrol circled the room before Warren spoke \u2014 and afterward in the selfie line \u2014 just in case anyone happened to slip through .\nThe campaign \u2019 s hyper-vigilance about capturing data on every potential supporter isn \u2019 t unique to Iowa , but the sheer number of people dedicated to the task certainly is .

The national campaign said its Iowa payroll would total at least 60 after the additions .\nPlenty of other Democrats are investing heavily and ramping up their presence in Iowa , including Cory Booker , Beto O \u2019 Rourke , and Kamala Harris .

A win over Joe Biden and other rivals could also dispel doubts about her electability among some Democrats still traumatized by 2016 . As some of her staffers have noted , the best way to erase concerns about whether she can win is to win .\nBut the up-front investment by Warren \u2014 who so far has lagged behind Biden , Bernie Sanders , Harris , O \u2019 Rourke , and Pete Buttigieg in fundraising \u2014 is n't without risk .

Aides say they \u2019 ll have more than 50 staffers in New Hampshire by mid-June , and more than 30 on the ground in both Nevada and South Carolina by then as well .\nOther campaigns , of course , are also hiring staff and collecting voter data . What \u2019 s distinct about Warren \u2019 s Iowa effort is how early she built out an infrastructure here \u2014 embedding people in communities throughout the state who are organizing all manner of activities to draw voters into the fold .\nIf the rural issues roundtable didn \u2019 t strike one \u2019 s fancy , the campaign hosted a 5k run nearby that same morning . Warren aides and volunteers have also organized slam poetry sessions , movie nights , and a book club . ( First up : \u201c This Fight is Our Fight , \u201d penned by Warren in 2017 . )\nWarren has appeared at more campaign events in Iowa , 34 , than any other state .
