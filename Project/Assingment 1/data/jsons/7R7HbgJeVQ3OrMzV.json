    "content": "The media don \u2019 t know what to make of Andy Ngo . The New York Times calls Ngo an \u201c independent journalist. \u201d CNN describes him as a \u201c conservative journalist. \u201d Other outlets term Ngo a \u201c conservative writer \u201d to distinguish him from actual reporters .\nBut none of these labels get at who Ngo is . More importantly , they fail to define his role in far-right politics , media , and violence . An incident from October 2018 in Portland , Oregon , illustrates his role well .\nIt begins with Portland police killing Patrick Kimmons , a 27-year-old African-American male , in disputed circumstances . The Black Lives Matter\u2013style activist group , Don \u2019 t Shoot Portland , called for a protest on October 6 . Kimmons \u2019 s family members joined in what local media described as a \u201c peaceful \u201d and uneventful event .\nThere was one dicey moment during the march . A driver made an illegal right turn into protesters who were in a crosswalk and had the walk sign . A local TV station that recorded the incident wrote : \u201c driver plows through protesters. \u201d Video shows a man stopping in front of a silver Lexus that then strikes him and pushes him for more than thirty feet . Down the block , a brief confrontation ensues with a protester shoving the driver once and others hitting his vehicle . The driver left in his car without any more incident as protesters yelled , \u201c Get out of here . \u201d\nIt was unremarkable . But another video of the incident began circulating where it is difficult to see the protester being struck , enabling false claims such as , \u201c # ANTIFA Anarchists Threaten Elderly Driver in Portland ! \u201d The story jumped to Fox News with Tucker Carlson replaying the obscured video , blaming everyone from Antifa and Occupy ICE to the Washington Post , Maxine Waters , Hillary Clinton , and protesters yelling at Trump officials in restaurants . Carlson \u2019 s guest was Andy Ngo playing an expert on lax law enforcement in Portland in an affected British accent . The Wall Street Journal gave Ngo a platform where he omitted crucial evidence that the driver deliberately struck a protester , while hyping outrage of a \u201c mob \u201d of \u201c angry , agitated ingrates and criminals \u201d marching for a dead black criminal , attacking a lone elderly white victim .\nIt \u2019 s farcical . The only significant lawbreaking was by the driver , who could have been charged with vehicular assault . But in a city that \u2019 s become an epicenter of far-right violence , the white nationalist friendly Patriot Prayer leaped on the faux outrage for a \u201c Flash march for law and order in PDX \u201d a week later . The march degenerated into street battles between right-wing fighters and masked antifascists as downtown bargoers looked on confused . At least one right-wing brawler was caught on video stomping a person on the ground , but no arrests were ever made . One reporter said they were maced by Antifa for no reason .\nBut it didn \u2019 t end there . The flash march created new viral moments . A video of a left-wing activist harassing a woman claiming to be a 9/11 widow was posted days later to The Daily Caller , which was cofounded by Tucker Carlson . ( The woman appears to have lied about being a 9/11 widow . ) Efforts to doxx the man hurling invective resulted in a professional skateboarder from Portland being falsely identified and inundated with death threats . Eventually the man in the video was identified , which started a new round of harassment . One source says the social service agency that fired him over the video \u201c was flooded with hundreds of harassing calls and Facebook messages that were explicitly racist and threatening to harm and kill staff . \u201d\nCarlson credited Ngo with publicizing the videos . Ngo was a bit player , but the incident bolstered him . The incident was an example of a disturbing media model for the Trump era : opportunists using biased reporting , social media , and wild accusations inflame vigilante and digital mobs to target \u201c enemies \u201d such as the media , Democrats , and left-wing activists . Figures like Carlson and Ngo reap followers , prominence , and income from the outrage and threats of violence . But to keep the ratings and the money flowing , the outrage machine must be cranked ever louder , risking greater violence .\nOne political organizer in Portland who has received death threats stemming from Ngo \u2019 s work says , \u201c It \u2019 s an arms race for money , and the narrative isn \u2019 t the point \u2014 the grift is . The larger , more offensive thing you can do , the system rewards it . \u201d\nThis appears to be Ngo \u2019 s model . He uses social media to push biased opinions in conjunction with selectively edited videos that play to the bigotry of his audience . His followers get worked up , and this is often followed by a deluge of threats against his subject .\nJacobin has talked to six people in Portland , including journalists , political officials , and activists , who described harassing messages and threats of violence resulting from Ngo \u2019 s work or political involvement in Portland . Friends of two other activists claim they went into hiding after Ngo spread their names and they became targets of harassment . Some individuals who \u2019 ve tangled publicly with Ngo are reluctant to go on the record . They say they want to avoid the \u201c trauma \u201d of being subjected to a new round of death threats .\nIn fact , Ngo appears to rely on people not speaking up about his effect on them . He often writes of how activists won \u2019 t talk to him or they take down social media profiles after he focuses on them , seeming to imply they have something to hide . What he doesn \u2019 t mention is many say they are doing so to avoid harassment and threats of violence .\nMadison , a Portland activist who tracks Ngo , says , \u201c Ngo signals this is a person that should be targeted , should be harassed , and should be threatened . Andy puts a target on them and that results in the person being doxxed . Andy is giving people explicit permission to unleash hatred and violence on people . He absolutely knows what he is doing . \u201d\nNgo is so intertwined with the specter of violence I encountered it after just a Facebook post . I wrote a post with the headline , \u201c Andy Ngo is no journalist. \u201d The post was shared by notorious right-wing figure , Carl Benjamin , aka , \u201c Sargon of Akkad , \u201d who has been featured on Ngo \u2019 s podcast and was banned from YouTube for repeatedly \u201c joking \u201d about raping a British Labour MP . In the comments on Benjamin \u2019 s post were calls for violence against myself , Antifa , and others . Within hours I started receiving threats directly , such as \u201c You \u2019 re a bunch of retards and it will be a glorious day when you all are dealt with , \u201d and \u201c You are a disgraceful liar . If you or anyone of your ilk throws even a fucking tissue at me or my family watch what the fuck happens to your family lol . \u201d\nNow this model threatens to turn deadly . On June 29 , Andy Ngo was attacked in Portland while videoing a Patriot Prayer rally heavily outnumbered by Antifa . A video shows him being punched , kicked , and hit with coconut milkshakes and silly string by masked individuals . Within minutes , videos of the attack and of a beaten Ngo narrating the incident were picked up by right-wing media such as Breitbart that have a dodgy relationship to facts . Headlines screaming brutal assault , vicious assault , and vicious attack by Antifa on Ngo were pumped out .\nThe sensationalism breached the mainstream with CNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper sending out an ill-informed tweet above a video of Ngo being attacked , writing , \u201c Antifa regularly attacks journalists ; it \u2019 s reprehensible . \u201d\nIn a bizarre twist , the Portland police threw fuel on the fire by tweeting that some milkshakes thrown on June 29 \u201c contained quick-drying cement. \u201d The police never provided evidence and observers , including journalists , noted that many counterprotesters drank the milkshakes , making it extremely unlikely anyone could have laced them with concrete . But amplified by conspiracy theorists like Jack Prosobiec , the tweet went viral , whereupon right-wing media turned the disinformation into fact and the mainstream press treated it as a credible assertion . The police tweet incited the Right further and the group that made the milkshakes was deluged with death threats . It culminated in the city being flooded with death threats . Days after Ngo was attacked , City Hall was evacuated after a bomb threat . One source inside City Hall says the mayor \u2019 s office received \u201c insane vitriol \u201d and every office was receiving threats , including almost 100 harassing calls that tied up emergency service dispatchers .\nFar-right figures responded to the June 29 attack on Ngo with graphic threats , and plan to hold an \u201c End Domestic Terrorism \u201d and \u201c End Antifa \u201d rally in Portland on August 17 . Such is the level of far-right anger that many in the city fear the rally could become another Charlottesville , or worse \u2014 given the anti-Latino murder spree in El Paso and other foiled white nationalist plots since then .\nTo be clear , the attack on Ngo should be condemned . It serves no political purpose , and the Left should not be attacking media makers , even if they use dicey methods . Some Antifa activists in Portland also admit the attack played into right-wing hands by elevating him .\nThat is exactly what \u2019 s happened . Trump has beatified Ngo as one of his sinless followers \u2014 \u201c A single man standing there with a camera who never got hit and never hit back before in his life \u201d \u2014 under assault from the \u201c evil \u201d Antifa full of \u201c sick , bad people . \u201d\nBut it would also be a mistake to see Ngo as an innocent or as a journalist , considering that whoever he turns his camera , social media , or pen on is at significant risk of being inundated with violent threats from the far right .\nShane Burley is author of Fascism Today : What It Is and How to End It , and a Portland-based journalist who covered the June 29 rally . He says , \u201c I would never condone what happened to Andy Ngo , but I think there is a reason why he got in a conflict with protesters and dozens of other reporters present seemed to be left alone . \u201d\nBurley says , \u201c One way to think of Andy Ngo is he is part of a far-right mediasphere that creates victimization narratives of conservatism and profit from it . It \u2019 s all about the embattled American man who is under siege at every turn , whether its trans children , immigrant criminals , anchor babies , or dangerous college campuses . \u2018 They are all out to destroy us and our values. \u2019 It \u2019 s an entire infrastructure that \u2019 s moved from commentary like National Review to populist media hucksters drumming up a controversy . Ngo doesn \u2019 t seem to have many real journalistic credentials , and any he does is from creating controversy . He gets in the Wall Street Journal and New York Post from being a conservative celebrity . His actual reporting is very infrequent and sparse . \u201d\nNgo adds a new element in facilitating violence , intentionally or not . Burley says , \u201c He appears to target ideological opponents , which can make them fair game for harassment and violent confrontation. \u201d The scale of the threats keep escalating .
