But it also serves as a contrast to a significant but less-sensational development : cops in some cities have begun to walk more softly on their beats .\nThe Justice Department report on police in Ferguson , where the death of Michael Brown last August led to months of raucous protests , came two days after President Obama released a slew of recommendations from a federal policing task force , including using less confrontational tactics and reining in creeping militarism .\nBut even as those recommendations sink in , there \u2019 s evidence that , at least in some neighborhoods , beat cops are already implementing reforms designed to promote more empathetic dealings with the public . That shift has , in a very short time , contributed to a \u201c watershed moment \u201d for policing in the United States , says Lewis Walker , a Western Michigan University sociologist who studies policing trends .\nTo be sure , a lot of beat cops shrug at efforts to eliminate ticket quotas and to curb street searches as \u201c liberal mumbo jumbo , \u201d says Peter Moskos , a sociologist at John Jay College in New York who turned his experiences as a Baltimore beat cop into the book \u201c Cop in the Hood . \u201d\nYet police chiefs in cities such as Atlanta and Kalamazoo , Mich. , are making profound changes . And for all the station house grumbling about cops being blamed for society \u2019 s problems , the emerging reforms do , at their heart , touch a libertarian , anti-statist streak found among many American cops , where focus on arrests for minor drug violations and crimes like \u201c manner of walking in roadway \u201d are seen as counterproductive state meddling , say Mr. Moskos and others .\n\u201c Officers on the whole are well-intended , they don \u2019 t feel they \u2019 re intentionally targeting anybody , just being hypervigilant in those neighborhoods and digging , \u201d says Kalamazoo Police Chief Jeff Hadley . \u201c But there are unintended consequences to that type of policing , which is why police departments have begun to challenge assumptions in terms of style and how implicit bias plays into our decisionmaking . \u201d\nBroadly speaking , American policing is at a difficult juncture .
