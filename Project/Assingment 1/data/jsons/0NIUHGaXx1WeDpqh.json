Trump has overreached in his victory statement . Democrats are demanding the release of the report before accepting its conclusions . Serious allegations about the President \u2019 s alleged obstruction of justice remain . An epic fight over what Congress can see of Mueller \u2019 s work is all but inevitable .

Glasser , New York Magazine\nMoreover , \u201c Barr \u2019 s poor reasoning in the four-page summary will reinforce the conclusion that he prejudged the matter . For example , he claimed that because Mueller was unable to establish that Trump was \u2018 involved in an underlying crime , \u2019 that suggested that he lacked the intent to obstruct justice . That will come as a surprise to Martha Stewart and many other defendants who were convicted of obstruction of justice but not of any underlying crime . Simply put , that is a fragile reed upon which to support a finding that there was no obstruction. \u201d Renato Mariotti , Politico\nRegarding the conclusion reached by Attorney General Barr that Trump did not obstruct justice , the fact that he did so \u201c within 48 hours of receiving the report ( which pointedly did not reach that conclusion ) should be deeply concerning to every American\u2026 Mr. Barr says that the government would need to prove that Mr. Trump acted with \u2018 corrupt intent \u2019 and there were no such actions . But how would Mr. Barr know ? Did he even attempt to interview Mr. Trump about his intentions ? What kind of prosecutor would make a decision about someone \u2019 s intent without even trying to talk to him ? \u201d Neal K. Katyal , New York Times\n\u201c As Americans have waited for Mueller to complete his work , there \u2019 s been a consistent question that some have argued implied some level of guilt : Why did so many people lie about what happened ?

Why ? Different reasons for each ? A common interest ( as at least two suggested ) in buffering Trump ? \u201d Philip Bump , Washington Post\nMany point out that \u201c when prosecutors say that an investigation \u2018 did not establish \u2019 something , that doesn \u2019 t mean that they concluded it didn \u2019 t happen , or even that they don \u2019 t believe it happened . It means that the investigation didn \u2019 t produce enough information to prove that it happened .
