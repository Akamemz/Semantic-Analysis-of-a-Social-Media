    "content": "When Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner James O \u2019 Neill announced this week that New York had once again recorded one the lowest crime rates the city has ever seen , they symbolically stood near an exhibition of sepia-toned photos from the city \u2019 s notorious past .\n\u201c This is extraordinary in comparison to that past , and this exhibit is so powerful , \u201d Mayor de Blasio said at the news conference at the Brooklyn Museum . \u201c I urge everyone to really look at it because it reminds us of all of the work that went into changing things . \u201d\nIn 2016 , the NYPD reported 998 shootings \u2013 the fewest since the city started tracking them , officials said . The rate of major felonies in New York , too , fell 4.1 percent from 2015 , also to the lowest level ever recorded . The department reported 335 murders in 2016 \u2013 a drop from the 352 in 2015 , and just short of the record low of 333 in 2014 .\n\u201c Absolutely amazing , \u201d said de Blasio , who has had a stormy relationship with the NYPD \u2019 s rank and file during his three years in office . \u201c And to give you a perspective , just 25 years ago there were over 5,000 shootings in a single year in the city , \u201d as well as over 2,000 murders . \u201c Look how far we have all come together , \u201d he said , noting that in 2016 the city also saw the fewest number of robberies and burglaries , ever .\nYet even as New York sets record lows , for many other American cities , comparisons to their pasts have been more ominous . Many have seen dramatic spikes in violence over the past two years that echo the 1990s \u2013 especially Chicago , which , though one third the size of New York , saw more than 4,300 shootings and 750 murders last year .\nIndeed , 16 of the nation \u2019 s 20 largest police forces battled increases in homicides last year , according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal . In Memphis , Tenn. , there were a record 228 homicides in 2016 , eclipsing the previous record of 213 set in 1993 . Baltimore , Milwaukee , and St. Louis continued to see spikes in violent crime , and Las Vegas and San Antonio each saw the highest numbers of homicides in 20 years .\nScholars point out that , despite the current spike in violence in some cities , crime remains near historic lows throughout the United States .\n\u201c But , in the case of New York City , there is clearly something special going on , \u201d says Richard Rosenfeld , professor of criminology at the University of Missouri , St. Louis , who studies the social sources of criminal violence . Even as crime throughout the US fell by nearly half since the 1990s , he notes , New York \u2019 s transformation has always been a particular wonder .\nAnd among the swirl of causes behind the fluctuation in crime rates , one of the reasons New York has sustained such low crime rates , many experts say , is indeed the policing innovations long pioneered by the NYPD .\nLast month , a delegation from the Chicago Police Department , including Superintendent Eddie Johnson , came to observe some of the NYPD \u2019 s methods , said Commissioner O \u2019 Neill during the museum press conference .\n\u201c It \u2019 s now much more than answering a traditional 911 call , \u201d O \u2019 Neill said . \u201c It \u2019 s about a deeper problem-solving. \u201d He and other NYPD officials described the further evolution of the department \u2019 s long-vaunted CompStat analysis , which is now pinpointing gang members and habitual criminals .\nSuch efforts , however , have in the past included an aggressive \u201c broken windows \u201d focus on penny-ante crimes , and the department 's notorious stop-and-frisk tactics were ruled unconstitutional in 2013 . Both have been dramatically curtailed , however , and the department has dedicated itself to working with affected communities after every criminal takedown .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve held community meetings there with the people who live and work there , so they can ask questions about what our teams were doing there that morning \u2013 about exactly who we arrested and why , \u201d O \u2019 Neill said . \u201c We \u2019 re overwhelmingly being told , \u2018 You got the right people. \u2019 We \u2019 re also being told thank you . \u201d\nYet experts say that policing is just one part of the nation \u2019 s fluctuating long and short term crime rates , and many criminologists say it \u2019 s enormously difficult to locate precise reasons crime rates rise and fall .\n\u201c Crime follows what statisticians refer to as a random walk , \u201d says Shawn Bushway , a criminal justice policy expert at the University of Albany \u2019 s Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy in New York . \u201c Another famous random walk is the Dow Jones average . You can explain what happened a bit in retrospect , but it \u2019 s hard to model going forward . \u201d\nThe recent spikes fueled worries during the election that the nation may be heading back toward those crime-ridden eras in the 1980s and early 1990s .\nAnd it didn \u2019 t help that , as a candidate , President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly made false claims about the nation \u2019 s crime rates .\n\u201c You won \u2019 t hear this from the media : We have the highest murder rate in this country in 45 years , \u201d the president-elect said during a rally in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , at the end of last October . \u201c You don \u2019 t hear that from these people . They don \u2019 t want to talk about it . \u201d\nThat is not true . In fact , in 1971 the homicide rate in the U.S. was 8.6 per 100,000 people , rising to a peak of 10.2 homicides per 100,000 in 1980 and then again to 9.8 in 1991 . By 2015 , however , the homicide rate fell dramatically : to 4.9 homicides per 100,000 , according to FBI data .\nTo be charitable , the president-elect , who often speaks off-the-cuff and tends toward hyperbole , was probably referring to the spike in murders in 2015 , which jumped nearly 11 percent -\u2013 indeed the largest single increase since 1945 , according to FBI statistics .\nBut during the election , nearly six out of 10 voters believed crime had gotten worse since 2008 , including nearly 80 percent of those who supported Mr.Trump , and nearly 40 percent of those who supported Hillary Clinton , according to a Pew Research survey in November last year .\nIn fact , overall violent crime in the United States has fallen 19 percent over the past eight years . Property crime , too , has fallen 23 percent since 2008 , according to the FBI \u2019 s Uniform Crime Reporting Program .\nSome scholars have tied the nation \u2019 s decades-long drops in crime to the ban on the use of lead-based materials in the 1970s , which were tied to aggressive behavior and cognitive delays . Others have tied it to the growth in attention-deficit medications . Looking back , Professor Rosenfeld , also chairman of a National Academy of Sciences roundtable on crime trends , sees at least one deeper reason for New York \u2019 s special drop in crime over the past few decades : a \u201c virtuous cycle \u201d of crime reduction and economic development .\n\u201c What we had in New York City was a pent up demand for new housing , a pent up demand for development ... because , among other things , high crime rates were in the way , \u201d he says . \u201c But as crime rates came down , that dam broke . \u201d\nCities like Miami and San Francisco saw a similar cycle , Rosenfeld says . \u201c Initially you need some break in crime for the investment to begin , but then what you get is one of these virtuous cycles in which reduced crime invites greater investment , and greater investment reduces crime even further .
