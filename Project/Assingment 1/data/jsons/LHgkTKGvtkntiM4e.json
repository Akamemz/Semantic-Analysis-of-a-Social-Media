    "content": "YouTube has been removing videos of a press briefing in which two doctors criticize the sweeping \u201c shelter-at-home \u201d edicts that governments have imposed throughout the world in response to the COVID-19 outbreak . One of the videos had over 5 million views before it was taken down .\nThe original videos were posted by an ABC news affiliate in Bakersfield , California . When the affiliate reached out to YouTube about the removal , a company spokesperson issued a statement that offered the following justification :\n\u201c We quickly remove flagged content that violate [ sic ] our Community Guidelines , including content that explicitly disputes the efficacy of local health authority recommended guidance on social distancing that may lead others to act against that guidance . ( ... ) From the very beginning of the pandemic , we \u2019 ve had clear policies against COVID-19 misinformation and are committed to continue providing timely and helpful information at this critical time . \u201d\nThe claims of the physicians ( Dr. Daniel W. Erickson and Dr. Artin Massihi , owners of Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield ) have been the subject of furious debate . Many health experts and organizations have denounced their remarks as unscientific and reckless . Even fellow critics of shelter-in-place who agree with much of the rest of their analysis have questioned some of their statistical inferences .\nWhatever the veracity of the doctors \u2019 claims , YouTube \u2019 s censorship of unorthodox ideas in the name of protecting the public from misinformation is misguided and counter-productive . Sheltering the public from ideas , even bad ones , only makes society more susceptible to dangerous error .\nOne of the censored doctors \u2019 critiques of shelter-at-home provides an apt metaphor for the folly of censorship . Dr. Erickson said :\n\u201c I \u2019 d like to go over some basic things about how the immune system functions so people have a good understanding . The immune system is built by exposure to antigens : viruses , bacteria . When you \u2019 re a little child crawling on the ground , putting stuff in your mouth , viruses and bacteria come in . You form an antigen antibody complex . You form IgG IgM . This is how your immune system is built . You don \u2019 t take a small child , put them in bubble wrap in a room , and say , \u201c go have a healthy immune system . This is immunology , microbiology 101 . This is the basis of what we \u2019 ve known for years . When you take human beings and you say , \u201c go into your house , clean all your counters\u2014Lysol them down you \u2019 re gon na kill 99 % of viruses and bacteria ; wear a mask ; don \u2019 t go outside , \u201d what does it do to our immune system ? Our immune system is used to touching . We share bacteria . Staphylococcus , streptococcal , bacteria , viruses . Sheltering in place decreases your immune system . And then as we all come out of shelter in place with a lower immune system and start trading viruses , bacteria\u2014what do you think is going to happen ? Disease is going to spike . And then you \u2019 ve got diseases spike\u2014amongst a hospital system with furloughed doctors and nurses . This is not the combination we want to set up for a healthy society . It doesn \u2019 t make any sense . \u201d\nJust as \u201c local health authorities \u201d are ostensibly trying to protect the public from COVID-19 through \u201c shelter-at-home \u201d policies , YouTube is seeking to shelter the public from \u201c misinformation. \u201d The following characterizes the perspective of YouTube and the \u201c health authorities \u201d that YouTube is serving in a metaphorical nutshell :\nTheir message \u201c may lead others to act \u201d against official guidance ; in other words , their bad ideas are contagious .\nThe video had already \u201c gone viral \u201d ( over 5 million views ) and risked becoming a misinformation pandemic which could result in worsening the physical pandemic .\nBy cutting the doctors off from communicating their message to the public , YouTube is quarantining them to limit the public \u2019 s exposure to their \u201c mind viruses \u201d and to nip the misinformation pandemic in the bud , or to at least \u201c flatten its curve . \u201d\nThis is in keeping with the policy that YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced days ago , that YouTube would remove any content that contradicts the World Health Organization on COVID-19 .\nEven assuming all the doctors \u2019 ideas are indeed bad , such a policy doesn \u2019 t work , and only makes things worse .\nJust as human immune systems are built up through exposure to viruses and other pathogens ( as Dr. Erickson explained above ) , our intellectual defenses against error are strengthened through exposure to bad ideas .\nWhen you encounter a bad idea , what can conceivably happen ? You can :\nReject or ignore it . Investigate it . Adopt it . Adopt it and implement it .\nIn the case of # 1 , there is no problem . Next , let \u2019 s consider # 4 , since that is the outcome that censors are most trying to avoid .\nWhat happens when you adopt and implement a bad idea in your life ? In the worst-case scenario , it could destroy you . But that is far less common in life than scaremongers would have us believe . More often , we suffer but do not die . And that is a very memorable way to learn that the idea implemented was indeed bad . We learn from experience , from failure , from the \u201c school of hard knocks. \u201d That is one of the reasons why \u201c what does not kill you makes you stronger , \u201d as the saying goes .\nBut not everybody needs to suffer to benefit from the lessons of suffering . That brings us to # 2 : we can investigate the idea . Through investigation , we can discover the accounts ( whether first- or second-hand ) of experiments with the bad idea and their bad results . Ideally , these would be rigorously scientific experiments whenever possible .\nFinally , we have # 3 , which is adopting the bad idea without implementing it . What would be the point of doing that ? Well , it could mean adopting it just enough to advocate it . And arguing for an idea is one of the most efficient ways to investigate it ( making # 3 really a subset of # 2 ) . That is because argument elicits counter-argument . And true , effective counter-arguments are , by definition , antithetical to bad ideas . Even if the apologist of the bad idea holds fast to his belief , the counter-arguments that emerge can arm debate spectators against error .\nIn all of the above cases , exposure to bad ideas strengthens our defenses against bad ideas . We come away equipped with truths\u2014facts , information , and counter-arguments\u2014drawn ultimately from experience , whether our own or that of others . These good counter-ideas are like antibodies that we develop through exposure to bad ideas . Bad ideas are not just pathogens , but antigens . We thus develop immunity , not only to those specific bad ideas , but to similar ones , because we learn to recognize the basic logical fallacies that they share .\nThe mind , like our immune system and our muscles , is \u201c antifragile \u201d to use the term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb . It grows stronger through exposure to adversity .\nThe flipside of that is also true . Just as sheltering from antigens can lead to immunodeficiency , sheltering from bad ideas ultimately makes us more susceptible to them .\nWhen paternalistic censors seal us up in a sterile bubble of ideas for our own \u201c protection , \u201d they deprive us of the chance to develop through experience our own ability to identify and grapple with bad ideas . As soon as a bad idea penetrates our bubble , we have no defences against it . Our lack of experience with the responsibilities of intellectual independence has left us naive , credulous , and gullible .\nThe more that self-appointed gatekeepers like YouTube and its allied \u201c health authorities \u201d \u201c protect \u201d us from ideas they disapprove of , the more susceptible we will be to falsehood and error ( including falsehoods foisted on us by our \u201c protectors \u201d themselves ) . This vulnerability will in turn be used to justify still more such \u201c protection. \u201d Such is the vicious cycle of sheltering .\nIronically , many secular leftists who support public-health \u201c influence sheltering \u201d probably fully understand the dangers of that practice in another instance .\nThe classic critique of a sheltered upbringing is that it deprives the child of experience grappling with potentially \u201c bad influences \u201d and so ultimately leaves her more vulnerable to them . The stereotypical example of this is a child raised in an exclusively religious and traditional environment , without exposure to non-traditionalist peers , popular movies and music , and tempting situations . Once this naif inevitably leaves home , perhaps to go off to college or \u201c the big city , \u201d she has no defenses against the wave of \u201c bad influences \u201d that she must then face all at once with little support , and so the wave engulfs her .\nThe same principle applies generally : sheltering backfires , whether the \u201c bad influences \u201d are cultural or medical .\nThis is one reason why open discourse is so important and censorship is so debilitating and disrespectful . We need to be allowed the responsibility and practice of identifying and guarding against falsehood to be any good at it .\nNow , all of the above takes for granted , for the sake of argument , that the purported \u201c bad ideas \u201d are in fact bad , and that the censors are in possession of good ideas . However , that is often not the case . Heresies often turn out to be right , and orthodoxies often turn out to be wrong : and this includes scientific paradigms that wound up in the ash heap of history . Our \u201c protectors \u201d may be sheltering us from the truth and forcing falsehood upon us . Wrong orthodoxies are far more dangerous than wrong heresies , simply as a matter of the scale of the error \u2019 s impact .\nThat is yet another reason why open discourse is so vital . For the sake of human welfare , orthodox falsehoods need to be overthrown , and heretical truths need to spread .\nThe remarks of the Bakersfield doctors are probably a mix of good ideas and bad , truths and falsehoods . Taking down the video does us a disservice regarding both sides of the coin .\nTo the extent that they are wrong , their errors should be aired out and refuted . Any mistake the doctors made will probably be made again , since the human mind tends to fall prey to the same basic fallacies . By developing and disseminating counter-arguments ( mental antibodies ) to them , we develop our immunity to these and similar errors .\nBy taking down the videos , YouTube has limited the extent to which that social learning can happen and insulated the error from debunking . If anything , YouTube \u2019 s censorship has lent additional credence to whatever mistakes they made by feeding into the narrative that the powers-that-be fear its truth . The debunking is being drowned out by outrage over the censorship . And the Streisand Effect ( how censorship can boost something \u2019 s publicity ) is causing it to spread even more .\nMoreover , even if the physicians are wrong in some ways ( like in their statistical claims ) , they may be right in other important ways .\nWhether or not sheltering bodies is a wise policy for the spread of COVID-19 , sheltering minds is surely a bad policy for the spread of ideas .",
