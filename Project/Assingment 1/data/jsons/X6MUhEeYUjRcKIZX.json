    "content": "In 1868 , President Andrew Johnson was impeached for violating the Tenure of Office Act that had been enacted by Congress over his veto in 1867 . Defying the law , Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton , without getting Senate approval , as the act required him to do .\nIn his 1956 Pulitzer Prize-winning book , John F. Kennedy made Edmund Ross one of the Senate 's `` Profiles in Courage '' for his decisive and heroic vote not to convict and remove Johnson .\nRepealed in 1887 , the Tenure of Office Act was later declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court .\nBut while the act was the lethal instrument to be used in the political assassination of a president whom the Radical Republicans meant to terminate , Stanton 's ouster was not the primary cause of their fury .\nWhat truly enraged the Radical Republicans was Johnson 's resolve to be more magnanimous toward the defeated South than they meant to be . Johnson had in mind an earlier end to the military occupation of the South and a more rapid return of the seceded states to the Union .\nThe story is told in the 1942 Hollywood film `` Tennessee Johnson , '' starring Van Heflin , which has since gone down the memory hole along with Woodrow Wilson 's White House favorite , `` Birth of a Nation . ''\nAs historians concede , the impeachment of Johnson was about Reconstruction and who would remake the South .

So severe were aspects of the occupation that Gen. Robert E. Lee reportedly said if he had known what was coming , he might not have quit fighting .\nSo , too , the impeachment of Donald Trump is not really about his 10-week delay in shipping arms to Ukraine or his postponing of a visit by Ukraine 's president until he announced an investigation of Burisma Holdings and Joe and Hunter Biden .\nEven before the 2016 election , Democrats , collaborating with a like-minded media , were using the instruments of power they possess , to first prevent and then to overturn the election results of 2016 .\nRussiagate , the James Comey FBI investigation , the Mueller probe \u2014 aborting a Trump presidency has always been the goal .\nSaturday , White House counsel Pat Cipollone succinctly described to the Senate the bottom line :\n`` They 're asking you to remove President Trump from the ballot in an election that 's occurring in approximately nine months . . . .
