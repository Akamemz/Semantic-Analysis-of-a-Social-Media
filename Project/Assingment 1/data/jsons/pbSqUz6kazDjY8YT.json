It doubled down .\nBy 2014 , \u201c those were the very qualities that made the Islamic State so successful , \u201d says Dr. McCants , author of the new book , \u201c The ISIS Apocalypse . \u201d\nIt is well known that the Islamic State is now governing a wide swath of Syria and Iraq through a modern-day reign of terror . What is less well-known is why that approach has been so successful \u2013 even attracting tens of thousands of foreigners .\nThe answer appears to be in how that brutality takes shape .\nToward local populations that have little choice but to obey , the Islamic State can promise \u2013 and carry out \u2013 untold savagery . On Sunday , the Islamic State killed some 70 members of a tribe in Iraq that had tried to rise up against the group . To the foreign fighters who pledge their lives to the cause , by contrast , the Islamic State promises lakeside homes in Raqqa , Syria , and high salaries .\nThe campaign of fear and intimidation that hangs over locals works largely because there are no other options . Sunni Muslims in IS-held territory trust the Syrian and Iraqi governments \u2013 which are run by other religious groups \u2013 even less than they trust the Islamic State . And no foreign power is likely to step in and tip the power balance toward local tribes , as the US did in the Sunni Awakening .\nThe result is a pseudo-state that breaks all the modern rules \u2013 governing through a very calculated mix of opportunism and oppression .\n\u201c It was a tough thing for me to see , because I had bought into the idea , put around by the western analytical community \u2013 but also by [ former Al Qaeda leader Osama ] bin Laden himself \u2013 that if you \u2019 re going to wage an insurgency and create a long-lasting state , you need to win over popular support , \u201d says McCants .\nFor all its wanton spectacle , the brutality of the Islamic State is not random . It is part of a carefully calibrated state-building strategy that the group has been ramping up for years .\nThe group \u2019 s approach to establish control \u201c began with infiltration and ended with conquest , \u201d as a Rand Corporation report released this month put it . \u201c Time after time , place after place , the group would establish an intelligence and security apparatus , target key opponents , and establish extortion and other criminal revenue-raising practices , \u201d it noted . \u201c Clandestine campaigns of assassination and intimidation have been part of the group \u2019 s playbook for more than a decade . \u201d\nReports from groups on the ground , as well as social media , show that \u201c ISIS does rely on brutality much more than Al Qaeda , \u201d says Harleen Gambhir , a counterterrorism analyst with the Institute for the Study of War , using a common acronym for the Islamic State .

This in turn \u201c eliminated all hints of social rebellion . \u201d\nWhat the Islamic State has shown is that , in the short term , \u201c brutality \u2026 can be much more effective than worrying about others , \u201d McCants says . \u201c If you look at what IS has done , you can see examples where control has been established by extreme brutality and kept up by extreme brutality . \u201d\nThe question is whether the Islamic State can maintain such a state over the long term .
