Its wiring , plumbing , and foundation are shot , but the majestic structure , when given a thin coat of new paint by the seller , proudly goes on the market as \u201c restored \u201d \u2014 at least until the new buyer discovers that the Potemkin fa\u00e7ade is about to collapse from lax maintenance and deliberate indifference . In other words , Obama \u2019 s periodic declamations , Nobel Prize , and adulation from a toady press are all veneers of shiny paint ; the Middle East , Russia , China , Iran , and ISIS terrorism are the insidious frayed wiring , corroded pipes , and termites that are about to take down the entire structure from the inside out .

Anthony Eden remarked at the time that British statesmen thought Hitler and Mussolini were like typical British elites with whom they could do business ; the British diplomats mistakenly believed they could appeal to the dictators \u2019 reason and common interests , and thus they were bound to be sorely disappointed .
