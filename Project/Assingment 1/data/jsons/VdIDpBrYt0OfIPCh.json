    "content": "As Mr. Coates testified before Congress one year ago , the real question of reparations is \u201c not whether we \u2019 ll be tied to the somethings of our past , but whether we are courageous enough to be tied to the whole of them . \u201d\nFinding a consensus on Black reparations is challenging . Varying surveys and polls suggest that while Americans may be ready to address grievances against Black people in America , they may not be ready to redress those grievances .

William Sherman in 1865 that affected the Georgia , South Carolina , and Florida coasts .

The three parties named will subdivide the land , under the supervision of the Inspector , among themselves and such others as may choose to settle near them , so that each family shall have a plot of not more than ( 40 ) forty acres of tillable ground , and when it borders on some water channel , with not more than 800 feet water front , in the possession of which land the military authorities will afford them protection , until such time as they can protect themselves , or until Congress shall regulate their title .\nAs previously expressed , 1865 was a pivotal year in regards to Black liberation .
