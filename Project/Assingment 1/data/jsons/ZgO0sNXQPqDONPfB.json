Devin Nunes , his Republican ally from California and was frustrated that Democrats would be able to use the information against him , a source told CNN . A more conventional reaction by the commander-in-chief given his institutional responsibilities might be anger that again a foreign power was trying to manipulate US politics -- however it might affect his own fortunes .\nThe uproar over Russia 's disinformation drive to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Trump four years ago cast a cloud that the current President has never been able to escape . The President 's defensive response to a new Russia interference drama , colored by his belief that all such revelations as a `` Deep State '' assault on his own legitimacy , already appears to be exacerbating the damage caused by Moscow 's meddling .\nIf his reelection bid is tainted in the same way , his conduct could become even more erratic at a time when he is already mounting an assault on US institutions like the Justice Department and acting with unbridled power following his acquittal in an impeachment trial .\nAnd the new revelations about Russia are certain to further damage the tenuous relationship between a President who denies election meddling ever happened , and an intelligence community that is charged with detecting such threats and countering them -- but is ultimately under Trump 's control and susceptible to his political pressure .\nPartisan uproar over the new claims , meanwhile , suggests that the alleged operation is again delivering for Russia on its intended goals : sowing distrust in the US system and turning Americans against themselves in a way that weakens national unity .\nSigns of Russian hacking , social media meddling and attacks on US infrastructure and the resulting confusion and controversy in Washington raise a sobering possibility : the second US election in a row risks being besmirched in the eyes of millions of voters at an already corrosive moment for US democracy .\nSources told CNN that the President was irate that intelligence community briefers told House lawmakers about Russia 's new threat in a meeting last week . Trump was especially frustrated that House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff , who led impeachment hearings against him , was given the information .\nSchiff was quick to respond to the public reports , first published by The New York Times , about last week 's classified briefing .\n`` We count on the intelligence community to inform Congress of any threat of foreign interference in our elections , '' Schiff tweeted . `` If reports are true and the President is interfering with that , he is again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling . Exactly as we warned he would do . ''\nThe President was frustrated that he had to learn about the briefing from a lawmaker and not from one of his officials , the person familiar with the situation told CNN .\nHe expressed frustration that `` it 's happening again , '' the person said , referring to his perception that political rivals were able to weaponize intelligence related to Russia . The Washington Post first reported the involvement of Nunes .\nThe partisan divide that hampered efforts to respond to Russian election meddling in 2016 is already reemerging .\nRepublicans in the hearing reportedly pushed back against the revelations of new Russian election meddling , in a sign of how intelligence -- that can only be effective if its regarded as nonpartisan -- is being politically tainted .\n`` The briefers were not ambiguous about the Kremlin having a preference for Trump , '' said a source familiar with the classified briefing .\nTexas Rep. Will Hurd , a former CIA officer , asked Nunes for some time for questioning and pressed the briefer about what led to the statements that Russia preferred Trump as President . The briefer responded that they did not have the underlying data , just the assessment .\nTrump 's allies like Utah 's Chris Stewart and Brad Wenstrup of Ohio started arguing that the assessment can not be true because no President has been tougher on Moscow than Trump -- a highly subjective assessment , especially given the President 's repeated and puzzling deference to Putin .\nThe accounts being described by sources suggest that Trump was more interested in suppressing the information for his own political gain than acting to protect the election . And the drama raises the question of whether his replacement of the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire with a political acolyte , Richard Grenell , this week is an attempt to appoint an ally to ensure such politically damaging information does n't get out .\nThere has been no public reaction so far from Trump to the latest Russia controversy .\nBut he 's likely at some point to go on a prolonged tear over the new revelations since he 's never really gotten over the 2016 election 's Russia storm .
