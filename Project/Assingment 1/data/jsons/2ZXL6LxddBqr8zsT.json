    "content": "In the latest twist on the weirdest campaign ever , Donald Trump seems to have encouraged supporters to kill Hillary Clinton . Trump said , \u201c By the way , if she gets to pick her judges , nothing you can do folks . Although , the Second Amendment people maybe there is . I don \u2019 t know. \u201d Of course in the immediate aftermath of the loony homicidal comment , the Trump campaign is now saying that the \u201c dishonest media \u201d is misreading his claim . That might hold water if it weren \u2019 t actually the second time that his campaign has supported killing Trump \u2019 s competition in the last month .\nThis latest attack also comes on the heels of Trump \u2019 s crack at Clinton \u2019 s mental state last week in a rally in New Hampshire . `` She is a totally unhinged person . She 's unbalanced . And all you have to do is watch her , see her , read about her . She will cause \u2014 if she wins , which hopefully she wo n't \u2014 the destruction of our country from within . '' If you didn \u2019 t know better , you \u2019 d think he was talking about himself .\nTrump has spent his whole campaign attacking his competition . Name-calling , insulting , and bullying have been campaign staples . But calling Clinton \u201c unbalanced \u201d is more than a simple tactic ; it is a strategy that reverses one of the most pointed attacks on Trump\u2014whether or not he might be well enough to serve and whether or not his limited mental capacity might lead to the destruction , not just of our country , but of the entire planet .\nThere has been a recent flurry of news media coverage that has focused on whether or not Trump might not be well , whether he might suffer from dementia or Alzheimer \u2019 s , and whether or not his thin skin and uncontrollable temper might be a problem for a president . Even more disturbing we learned of his inability to understand why we should not nuke Europe . Then -- after all that -- we get the frightening and unhinged 2nd Amendment comment . Clearly we have reason to question whether or not he has the ability to do the job .\nAnticipating that concern , Trump released a letter from his physician back in December attesting that \u201c if elected , Mr. Trump , I can state unequivocally , will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. \u201d When the letter was first released many laughed it off . It seemed like yet another sign of a bombastic and surreal campaign . But now that we are only months away from the general election it is time to return to that letter and wonder if it is further proof that Trump is scamming the US public .\nExperts have mixed opinions on whether or not candidates should be required to release medical records . Does a candidate have an expectation of privacy or does the public have the right to know about the health of their president ? According to CNN , \u201c In 2008 , a high-profile panel of doctors recommended that presidential and vice-presidential candidates be required to undergo a health exam by an independent team of doctors from the American College of Physicians. \u201d That effort failed , though , when it became clear that such a practice would become immediately politicized .\nSo , even though we require physicals of pilots , it is still not a requirement that a candidate for president release a full medical report .\nThat means Trump \u2019 s letter was optional , which makes it even more odd , given the fact that he isn \u2019 t interested in voluntarily releasing his tax returns . What could have been the motivation for releasing what may well be the weirdest medical report in the history of presidential elections ?\nThe letter does not uphold even the flimsiest medical standard and it uses hyperbolic language that has no connection at all to facts . Aside from making the outrageous and completely unverifiable claim that Trump would be the healthiest president ever , it makes other odd statements . We read , for instance , that he has had a medical exam that revealed \u201c only positive results. \u201d In the medical community a \u201c positive result \u201d means a bad prognosis . What we want are \u201c normal \u201d results . The letter uses the word \u201c excellent \u201d twice in relation to medical tests\u2014another oddity since again the standard would be to say \u201c normal. \u201d The letter also states that Trump \u2019 s only medical issue was an appendectomy but there is no mention of the bone spur , which kept him from serving in Viet Nam .\nApart from the lack of scientific rigor , the letter starts with \u201c To Whom My Concern. \u201d It is worth pausing to worry that the physician who has been taking care of Trump since 1980 has such a poor command of the English language . In fact , the language in the letter mirrors the same sort of bombastic language common to Trump-speak . The writing was so bizarre that it led Robert Reich to wonder if it had been written by Trump himself .\nSo who exactly is the doctor that signed this letter ? Well , as if the letter weren \u2019 t strange enough , Trump \u2019 s post on Facebook said it had been \u201c written by the highly respected Dr. Jacob Bornstein of Lenox Hill Hospital. \u201d But , Trump can \u2019 t even seem to get the name of his physician right , since the letter states it was written by Jacob \u2019 s son , Dr. Harold Bornstein who took over care for Trump after his father retired .\nBornstein junior is a gastroenterologist , hardly the sort of specialty designed to offer a comprehensive overview of a patient \u2019 s health . The irony that Trump \u2019 s bill of good health comes from a doctor who specializes in the gastrointestinal tract should not be missed . Recall that when Stephen Colbert introduced \u201c Trumpiness \u201d to his viewers while covering the RNC , he explained that \u201c Trumpiness \u201d was a lot like \u201c Truthiness \u201d \u2014except that rather than describe truth coming from the gut , \u201c Trumpiness \u201d comes from lower down the digestive track . If Trump gets all of his ideas from his bowels , then maybe a gastroenterologist is exactly the sort of doctor he needs .\nBut all kidding aside , Bornstein \u2019 s specialty simply doesn \u2019 t qualify him to speak of the fitness of Trump overall . He attests to facets of Trump \u2019 s health that are well outside of his area of expertise . Even more bizarre , since the letter went public , Bornstein has stayed mostly under the radar . His websitehas been pulled down . And his Facebook account is mostly inactive .\nIf you want to check out the doctor , your best shot is this wacky profile picture .
