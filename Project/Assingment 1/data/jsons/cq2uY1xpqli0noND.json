But think again , says Lee Adler , editor of The Wall Street Examiner newsletter.First , he says the jobless claim data are actually stronger than it might appear . `` The mainstream media is reporting this as if the record low is something new . That \u2019 s because they look at the seasonally-adjusted fictitious data only , '' Adler writes . `` The actual , not seasonally-finagled number has been at a record low relative to total employment since September 2013 . `` Still , the seasonally adjusted number is `` remarkable , '' especially given that the workforce was much smaller 41 years ago , he says.But here 's the problem . `` The current numbers are well beyond the bubble record lows of 1999-2000 and 2006-07 , '' Adler states . `` The implication is that this time really is different . It is the bubble to end all bubbles . `` Recall that the stock market crashed both in 2000-01 and 2008-09 . `` Employers in some sectors are hoarding workers , '' Adler says . `` Similar behavior in the past has been associated with bubbles , and has led to massive retrenchment , usually within 18 months or so . `` Elsewhere on the equities front , while U.S. stocks stand at historically high valuations , valuations in foreign markets are much lower , and that makes them attractive , says MarketWatch columnist John Coumarianos.The S & P 500 index carried a trailing price-earnings ratio of 21.24 July 17 , up from 19.54 a year earlier . And Robert Shiller 's cyclically-adjusted price earnings ratio ( CAPE ) for the S & P 500 , which includes 10 years of earnings , stands at 26.9 . For months it has hovered at its highest levels excluding the pre-market crash periods of 1929 , 2000 and 2007 . `` If the current level of U.S. stock prices is concerning , consider leaving home .
