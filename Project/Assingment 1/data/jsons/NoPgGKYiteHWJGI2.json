    "content": "Venezuelan security forces clash with demonstrators during a protest against President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas , July 22 , 2017 . ( Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters )\nThe two are not as completely different as we \u2019 d like to think .\nThe United States has resigned in protest from the UN Human Rights Council , which has a long and ignominious record of protecting the world \u2019 s worst abusers of human rights . The proximate cause of the U.S. resignation was the council \u2019 s unwillingness to act on the matter of Venezuela , where the socialist government of Nicolas Maduro is engaged in political massacres and the use of Soviet-style hunger-terror against its political enemies . Venezuela remains , incredibly enough , not only protected by the Human Rights Council but an active member of it , an honor shared Vladimir Putin \u2019 s Russia and its political assassins , the People \u2019 s Republic of China and its organ harvesters , and the Castro dictatorship in Cuba with its torturers and al pared\u00f3n justice .\nVenezuela and North Korea could not be more dissimilar in terms of their respective cultures , peoples , and histories . And yet they have arrived in approximately the same place : at the terminus of F. A. Hayek \u2019 s \u201c Road to Serfdom . \u201d\nI have long argued that about half of our political disagreements are simply cases of failing to agree about the meaning of a word . By \u201c capitalism \u201d libertarians mean the free enterprise of Adam Smith and Milton Friedman , while our friends on the left mean by \u201c capitalism \u201d the shenanigans of the United Fruit Company in Guatemala ( it \u2019 s always the United Fruit Company ! ) , the crimes of Enron , the purported misdeeds of Halliburton , etc . Libertarians might respond that lobbying the CIA to knock over unfriendly tropical governments is not exactly what we mean by free enterprise , but the conversation rarely advances much beyond that , in part because of the emotional resonances of certain words , e.g . \u201c neocon , \u201d \u201c corporation , \u201d \u201c exploitation , \u201d etc .\nThere are many important differences between the U.S. model and the Nordic or Western European models , and tax rates and social spending are only part of that .\nSocialism is defined by central planning , which is to say by the subordination of the economy to political discipline . When U.S. progressives talk about socialism , what they usually mean is those nice democratic welfare-statists in Denmark or Sweden , or maybe Germany if they are particularly interested in industrial policy and labor power . European welfare statism has its ups and downs ( the occasional bout of right-wing hysteria notwithstanding , it is not obvious that the Norwegians inhabit a post-apocalyptic hellscape ; if Oslo represents the end of the world , then Armageddon is shockingly expensive ) , but those welfare states are attached to largely free economies . Sweden arguably has a more liberal trade regime than does the United States , and most of the Nordic countries had lower corporate tax rates than did the United States until the 2018 tax reform . There are many important differences between the U.S. model and the Nordic or Western European models , and tax rates and social spending are only part of that . We tend to talk about those disproportionately because they are easy to quantify , whereas effectiveness of government and public institutions ( which is one place where the Swiss , Canadians , and Germans really outperform the United States ) is difficult to evaluate in empirical terms . In spite of our political rhetoric , the debate about whether the top U.S. personal-income-tax rate is going to be 39 percent or 33 percent is not about taking a step toward socialism or a step away from socialism .\nProgressives will consider the case of Venezuela or North Korea ( the American Left \u2019 s longstanding admiration of Castro \u2019 s Cuba , and its celebration of Hugo Ch\u00e0vez only a few years ago , has been memory-holed ) and say that the problem with those countries is not socialism but a lack of democracy , political violence and instability , etc .

Lenin , Stalin , Mao , Castro ( and Castro ! ) , Ch\u00e0vez , Maduro , Honecker , Ho Chi Minh , Pol Pot , the Kim dynasty , Shining Path : No ideology is that unlucky . Violence and oppression is not something that just happens to accompany efforts to impose political regimentation on the economy \u2014 which is to say , on private life \u2014 but is an inescapable accompaniment to it .\nThe Venezuelan case is a textbook example of the evolution of socialism . While the Soviets and the Maoists had intricate five-year plans , Venezuela had essentially one big plan : Use the profits from state-run oil companies to fund a massive welfare state , and use the leverage thus gained to fortify support for Hugo Ch\u00e0vez and his political party until they achieved power sufficient to move Venezuela \u2019 s assets and its people around like pawns on a chessboard . The problem is that people are not chessmen . Ch\u00e0vez et al . turned out to be pretty poor chess players , but even if they had been grandmasters , it would not have been enough .
