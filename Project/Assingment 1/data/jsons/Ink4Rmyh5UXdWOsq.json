    "content": "Wisconsin Republicans like to say Gov . Scott Walker is unbeatable . The 2018 midterm elections will be the biggest test yet of that theory .\nIf Walker wins reelection in November , it will be the fourth time the state has elected him to the governor \u2019 s mansion \u2014 and he \u2019 s only running for his third term . Walker , who was first elected in 2010 , is probably best known for being a conservative union buster , stripping public employee unions of their collective bargaining rights in 2011 . The fallout was enough for Democrats to force a recall election the next year .\nBut Walker won anyway . Two years later , he went on to win reelection for a second term . Now he wants a third . It \u2019 s a history that \u2019 s made Walker one of the Democratic Party \u2019 s biggest white whales anywhere in the country .\nNow in 2018 , with another chance to take Walker down , Democrats don \u2019 t have a clear star within their ranks to mount the challenge .\nMore than eight Democrats have filed to run in Wisconsin \u2019 s gubernatorial primary , which will be held August 14 . Democrat Tony Evers , the state \u2019 s public education chief , is in the lead , but polling has been scarce and other candidates have pulled in notable Democratic endorsements . Mahlon Mitchell , the president of the Professional Fire Fighters Association , has the support of California Sen. Kamala Harris . Kelda Helen Roys , a former state Assembly member , has the backing of New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( and Wisconsin \u2019 s most famed indie band , Bon Iver ) .\nWhoever wins the primary will have to face not only an incumbent Republican but also the impressive party machine Wisconsin Republicans have built around Walker in the better part of a decade that they \u2019 ve run the state .\nWalker could still be in trouble in this historically purple state . In February , a Morning Consult poll found Walker among the 10 least popular governors in the country . A Marquette University poll in June had Walker only up 4 points ahead of Evers . And a recent NBC News/Marist College survey put Evers ahead of Walker with a 13-point lead \u2014 54 versus 41 percent \u2014 a position Walker never faced in either of his past two elections .\nIf Democrats can rally around their candidate in the final months of this election , and energize an already eager voter base , 2018 might finally be the year Democrats actually beat Scott Walker .\nDemocrats didn \u2019 t come into the governor \u2019 s race with a frontrunner\nDemocrats are getting their third chance to unseat Walker . But this year is notably different than past elections , when there was a party-picked candidate who went through the primary almost as a formality .\n\u201c There is clearly no coronation going on \u2014 it \u2019 s a bit more of a free-for-all , \u201d Barry Burden , director of the University of Wisconsin \u2019 s Elections Research Center , said . \u201c That reflects Democrat frustration . They have not been able to work in advance . \u201d\nIn a field of eight major Democrats candidates running for governor , all of the candidates have a name recognition problem .\nWithin the group , Tony Evers , Wisconsin \u2019 s superintendent of public instruction \u2014 a position he has held since 2009 and was most recently reelected to in 2017 \u2014 is the most familiar face . Still , 61 percent of voters hadn \u2019 t heard enough about Evers in a June Marquette poll to decide what to make of him . Evers has been running far ahead of the other Democrats in the polls , but he could still be beaten on Tuesday .\nTwo progressive groups , the Bernie Sanders-inspired progressive group Our Wisconsin Revolution and the Working Family Party , banded together with the intent to endorse a candidate . But they only managed to narrow the field to the top four \u2014 and Evers wasn \u2019 t on that list . Instead , it includes firefighter union chief Mahlon Mitchell , state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout ( who has run in a Democratic gubernatorial primary before ) , political activist Mike McCabe , and former state Rep. Kelda Roys . None of these candidates has ever topped a poll or showed formidable fundraising prowess .\nSome of them have gained notable endorsements . Emily \u2019 s List , the group that promotes female candidates , backed Roys . But Democratic campaign operatives in the state noted the group didn \u2019 t put many resources behind her to raise her profile .\nAll the candidates are essentially running on the same platform . They all oppose Walker \u2019 s $ 10 billion Foxconn Technology Group project , which has earned President Donald Trump \u2019 s support , and they oppose Walker \u2019 s union-busting measure that restricted public employee \u2019 s bargaining rights . They all differ slightly on how they would address higher education tuition fees \u2014 some arguing to keep current freezes , others claiming they \u2019 d cut tuition fees and increase state funding . They all want to either phase out , limit , or end school voucher programs , and are considering ways to boost infrastructure investments \u2014 like new tolls or a gas tax .\nEven in such a big primary field , the candidates have stayed away from negative mudslinging against their own . Instead , they \u2019 ve attacked Walker and tried to differentiate themselves on policy . The result : Going into primary day , most voters don \u2019 t know who the Democratic candidates are .\n\u201c The question is whether the party will be able to come together behind their candidate , \u201d Burden , the elections researcher , said .\nAs Democrats look for a challenger , Walker has had the airwaves to himself for the year . And he \u2019 s had a lot of work to do to fix his image ahead of the election .\nWalker was once seen as the future of the Republican Party , the seemingly invincible conservative leader of a Midwestern state . But his foray into national politics was an incredible dud ; his 2016 presidential campaign burned through its scant fundraising cash early , and Walker dropped out of the running in September 2015 with his operation nearly broke . His popularity in the state tanked , something that highlighted several of his vulnerabilities .\nThe governor is not particularly charismatic , yet he is a relentless campaigner . He \u2019 s had an aggressive campaign schedule visiting factories and schools across the state .\nWisconsin Republican strategist Brandon Scholz told me the governor \u2019 s strategy so far has been to \u201c load in \u201d economic messages in the lead-up to his election . But there are still several policy areas Democrats are likely to attack . \u201c I think transportation can be one of those gnawing things that can turn a scratch into a cut . But it \u2019 s not just Walker \u2014 it \u2019 s the legislature , \u201d Scholz said .\nEducation , transportation , health care , and economic investments will be among the biggest policy issues Wisconsin Democrats are sure to hit Walker on .\nThe unemployment rate in Wisconsin sits at a low 2.9 percent , but Democrats point out that wages haven \u2019 t kept up with the rate of inflation in lower-income sectors of the job market . Walker \u2019 s deal to give a Chinese company Foxconn Technology Group $ 3 billion in tax breaks in exchange for their $ 10 billion factory has come under major attack after Wisconsin \u2019 s Legislative Fiscal Bureau reported that the state wouldn \u2019 t break even on the investment until 2043 \u2014 and possibly not even then .\nWhile Walker likes to say he has spent more on education and transportation than his Democratic predecessor , those claims are mostly false ; Walker \u2019 s numbers don \u2019 t count the rate of inflation and double-count investments made in transportation .\nLikely in anticipation of a run against Evers , Walker has been emphasizing public education on the campaign trail , releasing ads on the issue and prioritizing school photo ops . But the anti-collective bargaining law he signed has had a lasting impact on public school teachers , and the governor has been accused of underfunding public schools . If Democrats nominate Evers , education is guaranteed to be a major issue in the governor \u2019 s race .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear he knows what his weaknesses are , trying to run these glossy positive ads with female public school teachers , \u201d one Democratic campaign operative said . \u201c He \u2019 s trying to rewrite history with these TV ads . \u201d\nWalker \u2019 s approval numbers in the state have largely stabilized since his presidential run . But he still doesn \u2019 t hold a comfortable lead ahead of Evers in the early polling , which should be a point of concern for the two-term governor .\n\u201c Walker is a terrific candidate ; he is a good messenger , \u201d Burden said . \u201c But he has always benefited from having a tailwind . 2018 will be the first time that Republicans will be facing an election with a Republican president . \u201d\nThis election will be a real test of the Democratic Party\nWalker has said outright that he \u2019 s worried about the potential for a \u201c blue wave \u201d in the 2018 midterms .\nIn Wisconsin , hints of a Democratic landslide have already appeared in state special elections , in which Democrats picked up two previously Republican-held state seats . In January , Democrats flipped a rural Trump +17 state Senate district with a comfortable 10-point margin of victory \u2014 a loss Walker called \u201c a wake-up call for Republicans in Wisconsin. \u201d Liberals also won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court by a huge margin in April .\nWalker has some clear advantages in the state . The Wisconsin Democratic Party has gone through years of devastating losses ; Republicans control the state legislature , one of the state \u2019 s US Senate seats , five of its eight congressional seats , and the governor \u2019 s mansion . In 2016 , President Donald Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to win the state since 1984 , beating Hillary Clinton by fewer than 30,000 votes .\nDemocrats concede that Walker will undoubtedly out-fundraise them in the governor \u2019 s campaign . But the party is trying to set up their candidate for success ; the Democratic Governors Association has already committed $ 4 million in air time to whoever wins the Democratic primary , and the state party is building a ground game .\nThe midterms will be the ultimate test for Democrats in the state .
