''\nLike her Republican counterparts in Iowa and other states , Freundlich declined to share early voting targets and program specifics . But Democrats are doing well , increasing their early voting turnout from the 2010 midterm as Democratic ballot requests already account for more than half of all requests .\nAnd in Georgia , Republicans have spent months in the ramp up to early voting season building what Georgia GOP spokesman Ryan Mahoney called `` the largest grassroots operation the party has had in modern history . ''\n`` This is by far the most infrastructure that we 've had in place , '' Mahoney said . `` In years past , this would be the point where everyone would start opening up headquarters and making calls . ''\nInstead , Republicans in the state have already cranked out about 700,000 calls and have about 1,000 `` grassroots leaders '' working a strengthened fieldwork operation thanks to smartphone `` walk apps '' that have replaced bulky walk books that had to be manually logged into the database .\nCompounded with a `` robust mail program , '' automated phone calls , emails and a social media push , Republicans in the state are hoping to mobilize more supporters to vote early for Gov . Nathan Deal and Republican Senate candidate David Perdue , who are both locked in competitive races .\nThose efforts have helped Republicans identify those supporters in a state with no partisan voter registration -- and now the race is on to turn them out , and early .
