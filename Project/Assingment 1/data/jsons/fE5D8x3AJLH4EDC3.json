It also orders him to come up with a plan to try to push Syria \u2019 s warring parties into a final negotiated settlement .\nOne part of the agreement even presses the administration to devise a strategy for arming moderate rebels to strengthen them in their battle against Mr. Assad . Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have accused the Obama administration of being too reticent to take that step .\nMr. Menendez scheduled a committee vote for Wednesday , marking the first step in what is likely to be a tough path to getting a final authorization through both chambers of Congress and back to Mr. Obama .\nOne key to the agreement was to insist on strict checks to make sure Mr. Obama doesn \u2019 t have the authority to put U.S. troops on the ground in Syria , which senators felt was a gateway to getting more involved than what Americans are ready for .\nSEE ALSO : Majority of Americans don \u2019 t want Syria intervention : poll\n\u201c Together we have pursued a course of action that gives the president the authority he needs to deploy force in response to the Assad regime \u2019 s criminal use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people , while assuring that the authorization is narrow and focused , limited in time , and assures that the armed forces of the United States will not be deployed for combat operations in Syria , \u201d Mr. Menendez said in a statement .\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry landed in hot water hours earlier when he said he didn \u2019 t think a resolution should rule out putting American boots on the ground in Syria .\nAfter realizing he had erred , the former senator feverishly worked to backtrack .\n\u201c Be crystal clear \u2014 there \u2019 s no problem in our having the language that has zero capacity for American troops on the ground within the authorization the president is asking for , \u201d Mr. Kerry said as he tried to build backing for strikes to uphold Mr. Obama \u2019 s \u201c red line \u201d against use of chemical weapons .\nThe president \u2019 s chances for victory in Congress rest on the specific wording of the resolution .\nIndeed , even if there ends up being majority support for taking some action , that coalition still could splinter on the details , leaving the president with a devastating defeat .\nThe office of House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said Mr. Obama faces an \u201c uphill battle \u201d in winning the votes needed to get a resolution through Congress , though others predicted better chances for success .\nTo get a resolution through the Senate and House , analysts said , Mr. Obama likely will have to accept revamped language \u2014 possibly driven by the leadership of both parties \u2014 that would likely include specific timetables and other limits on what the U.S. military can do .\n\u201c I wouldn \u2019 t be surprised if they tried to pin down the administration on a strategy , and also to pin down the limits , how long can this occur ?

And what does \u2018 limited \u2019 mean ? \u201d Lara Brown , program director at George Washington University \u2019 s Graduate School of Political Management , said Tuesday afternoon . \u201c I would imagine there \u2019 s going to be more specificity \u201d in Congress \u2018 updated resolution .\nTwo key House Democrats began circulating a letter soliciting support in their chamber for that kind of limited approach .\nThey proposed limiting the president \u2019 s strikes only to deter \u201c the repeated use of chemical weapons \u201d rather than preventing proliferation or transfer , saying that while the broader goal is worthy , now is not the time to authorize anything that broad .\nThere is also fear that the continued debate in Washington over how to punish Mr. Assad \u2014 weeks after his use of sarin gas \u2014 will drag on so long , and the resolution be diluted so much , that the eventual U.S. response won \u2019 t achieve the objectives . Analysts say the specifics matter and argue that weak intervention by American forces could embolden Mr. Assad .\n\u201c It matters very much what is done . If something is done only to show that something was done , [ Mr. Assad ] gets the message .

John McCain , Arizona Republican , who has criticized the administration for waiting so long and for not doing more to aid the Syrian rebels .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s draft resolution asked for authority to use the military \u201c as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in connection with the use of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in the conflict in Syria. \u201d It said the president should take action to deter their use or transfer .\nOverhanging the entire discussion were the 2001 and 2002 resolutions that President George W.
