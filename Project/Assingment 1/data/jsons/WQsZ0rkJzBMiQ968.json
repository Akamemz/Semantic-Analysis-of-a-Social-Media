In honor of Cinco de Mayo, Mr. Trump posted a photo on Twitter of himself digging into a taco bowl \u2014 made in the Trump Tower food court, of course \u2014 and included in the caption \u201cI love Hispanics.\u201d\n\nA party nominee has never failed to gain the support of a House speaker or majority leader from his party in modern times.
