The calling is serving a cause greater than ourselves.\n\nThis was the essence of John McCain\u2019s message to our nation: that we must join together, shaped by our deepest values of liberty, equal justice and respect for the dignity of all people, hardened by unwavering courage and integrity, and step into the arena to fight for a greater cause.\n\nJohn did this every day. Whether it was to demand the best possible leadership and support for our armed forces, or to empower freedom fighters against dictators around the world, or to demand that perpetrators of torture and human rights abuses be punished, or to make sure our native American communities are treated with dignity and respect. John McCain fought for others every day of his life, whether he was wearing a uniform or standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\nWith his passing, America inherently understood that this is the kind of leadership we want. That this is the kind of country we want to be. And that it is now up to us \u2014 all of us \u2014 to get into the arena and fight. Each of us must do something to fight for a greater cause. We can lead, we can support, we can contribute, we can donate \u2014 but we must do something.\n\nJohn\u2019s memory inspires me to be in the arena every day. Thank you for all the kind messages about my husband. I am grateful. Since his passing, thousands of people have asked how they can do something to honor Sen. McCain. I\u2019ll tell you how: Join me in the arena. Fight for a greater cause.\n\nThe McCain Institute for International Leadership is now my home, and my mission. Through the McCain Institute, we will fight for all those values that animated my husband throughout his life. With your support we will pay his legacy forward.\n\nI urge you to support the McCain Institute, and join me in the arena.\n\nCindy Hensley McCain is a trustee of the McCain Institute.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
