    "content": "Days away from selecting a new speaker of the House , Republicans are locked in an increasingly personal battle for power , as former allies snipe at one another even as they promise to reform their fractured party \u2014 and institution .\nCalifornia Rep. Kevin McCarthy is facing a new challenge from his former ally Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz , who is criticizing the majority leader in sharp terms . Chaffetz says McCarthy ca n't get the 218 votes on the floor needed to become speaker , while McCarthy allies privately bash the Utah Republican as woefully unprepared to lead the House Republican Conference .\nAt the same time , McCarthy is privately planning for a more inclusive leadership structure that incorporates more input from all groups within the conference , including the House Freedom Caucus .\nBut meanwhile , in a nod to the ongoing war for control of the House GOP , Speaker John Boehner is considering delaying the election for majority leader and whip , a blow to Reps. Steve Scalise ( La . ) and Tom Price ( Ga. ) , but a boon to conservatives who are looking to run a candidate against the pair of Southerners . It would also aid members seeking to change the Republican Conference rules to force candidates to resign other leadership posts and chairmanships while they run for new posts . Those changes would be debated before the election .\nFor now , the closed , secret ballot Republican leadership elections are officially scheduled for Thursday . And the race for speaker and House majority leader are far from settled .\nMollifying the loud conservative faction within the Republican Conference is the overwhelming theme of this marathon election . McCarthy , the front-runner for speaker , has begun to devise plans to decentralize power away from the leadership . The 50-year old California Republican has reached out to groups like the Freedom Caucus to institute a weekly gathering of leaders of the various House caucuses to devise the party \u2019 s legislative strategy , according to multiple sources familiar with the plans .\nThe Freedom Caucus , led by GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio , would have a seat at the table , as would the moderate Tuesday Group and the conservative Republican Study Committee , among other GOP groups . This regular confab would either come as an additional meeting of House Republican leadership , or a discussion between the group leaders and McCarthy . It \u2019 s a clear attempt to give the party \u2019 s warring factions more say over governing \u2014 and is in line with McCarthy \u2019 s style .\nFurthermore , the Freedom Caucus has been pushing for more representation on the elite House Republican Steering Committee ; additional slots on prime committees like Energy and Commerce , Ways and Means and Financial Services ; and support from the National Republican Congressional Committee .\nMcCarthy is working to address their concerns , but these kinds of seismic changes require the support of the majority of the conference . A large swath of the GOP membership does not want to hand out \u201c goodies , \u201d as one source put it , to trouble-making lawmakers who have caused headaches for the party , and helped topple Boehner .\nMcCarthy \u2019 s allies believe he has the speaker election wrapped up and will easily win the party \u2019 s nomination to replace Boehner in one ballot on Thursday \u2014 and the floor vote to become the 54th speaker later this month .\nYet while the California Republican \u2019 s ascent is likely , it \u2019 s far from certain . He faces Florida Rep. Daniel Webster \u2014 a definite long shot \u2014 and Chaffetz .\nWhile Republicans brushed Webster off , the bid from Chaffetz is raising some eyebrows . Few Republicans think Chaffetz , the Oversight and Government Reform chairman , can win the speakership , but his unfiltered criticism of McCarthy is somewhat unusual . In a letter to colleagues Sunday morning , Chaffetz said there are \u201c already more than 50 Republicans who have indicated they can not or will not vote for a current member of our leadership team to be the speaker . \u201d\n\u201c Given that reality , uniting behind a candidate that can get to the 218 votes necessary to win the Speakership is critically important , \u201d Chaffetz said . \u201c I am confident I can bridge this divide and work effectively together with all members of our conference . \u201d\nMcCarthy allies doubt Chaffetz \u2019 s math , and question his motives .

In a widely criticized TV interview last week , McCarthy seemed to say the GOP leadership created a committee to investigate the Benghazi terrorist attacks to politically damage Hillary Clinton .
