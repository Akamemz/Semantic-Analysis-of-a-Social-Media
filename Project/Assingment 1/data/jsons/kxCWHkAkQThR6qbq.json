    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Rick Perry , the former Texas governor who insisted he learned lessons from his disastrous 2012 presidential campaign , dropped his second bid for the White House on Friday after just 100 days .\n`` Today , I am suspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States , '' Perry said in an address in St. Louis that virtually mirrored his standard stump speech until the very end . `` Life is good . I am a blessed man . ''\nThe departure of Perry , who had little support in early-voting states or among the GOP donor class , is unlikely to alter the contours of the Republican race . But Perry nevertheless implored his supporters in an email to back a candidate who embodies the principles of conservatism .\n`` The conservative movement has always been about principles , not personalities , '' Perry said , before making a not-too-veiled swipe at Donald Trump , the GOP 's current front-runner . `` Our nominee should embody those principles . He -- or she -- must make the case for the cause of conservatism more than the cause of their own celebrity . ''\nFor almost two years , the swaggering Texan had prepared and studied for a second shot at the presidency . But in a 17-candidate field , Perry found himself weakened by fundraisers who ditched him for his rivals and by top surrogates who defected as his campaign crumbled . He raised only about $ 1 million in the first fundraising quarter , and he never had enough supporters for him to earn a spot in the premier GOP debates . Back in Texas , he remained under indictment on an abuse-of-power charge .\nAnd as it became increasingly clear that the campaign would n't be able to overcome deep financial problems that left him without enough money to win a competitive race , he became the first GOP candidate to leave it .\nStill , Perry 's exit still comes surprisingly early . He was scheduled to appear next week at CNN 's Republican debate , which his allies hoped would be a turning point for his troubled campaign . His super PAC sat on more than $ 17 million that it was investing in Iowa to fill the void created by his Austin-based campaign as its financial difficulties mounted . And Perry acted very much the candidate all day on Friday , authoring an opinion piece about terrorism in National Review in the morning and sharing his vision for his presidency for a half hour in his St. Louis speech in the afternoon .\nSome of his top supporters expressed shock that Perry bowed out so early . David Johnson , an Iowa state senator and the candidate 's top backer in the Hawkeye State , said Perry may have prematurely pulled the plug .\n`` Perhaps Governor Perry sees something that I do n't , '' Johnson said , explaining that he heard about Perry 's decision from the other Texan in the race -- Ted Cruz . `` I was certainly ready to go . ''\nPerry was unable to reassemble the Texas political and financial base that made him , at one point , the party 's front-runner in the last presidential cycle . In the 2012 race , his campaign was dogged by questions about his readiness , punctuated by an embarrassing moment in a debate when he could n't name the third agency he planned to eliminate as president .\nAnd just as in his first campaign , the man who was once governor of the largest Republican state for 14 years , leaves the campaign trail disappointed and also politically damaged .\nThe second campaign began to unravel this summer , with the operation essentially abandoning its efforts in Iowa and New Hampshire . Doug Deason , the son of a $ 5 million donor to the Perry super PAC , said Perry 's campaign had only raised $ 100,000 in the two months since the last reporting period . Deason said Perry delivered the news of the suspension to him on Thursday .\n`` He felt it coming . He knew there 's only so much the super PAC can do , '' explained Deason , a powerful Texas donor who is part of the Koch Brothers ' political network . `` After the word got out they were struggling , they did start getting donations in -- but it just was n't enough to really make a difference . ''\nDeason expects to get his millions of dollars returned next week .\n`` The beauty , of course , of investing in a super PAC is you get the money back that does n't get spent , '' Deason said .\nBut Austin Barbour , the group 's top operative , said it was not immediately clear if the law allowed the donations to be refunded .\nNevertheless , other campaigns Friday evening were moving rapidly to poach top financial and political backers of Perry . Deason dined with Cruz a few evenings ago . Even while Friday 's speech was going on , Deason was contacted by Cruz finance director Willie Langston and lieutenants from the Jeb Bush and Scott Walker campaigns . Johnson said in the hours after Perry 's decision , he heard from aides representing Walker , Cruz and Rick Santorum .\n`` Would you consider another Texan for president ? '' asked Bryan English , Cruz 's Iowa state director , according to Johnson .\nThe departure of Perry speaks in part to the limitations of super PACs , which had been expected to save the cash-strapped campaign . Perry 's well-funded group , Opportunity and Freedom PAC , depended heavily on a small group of Texas families , and the organization had indicated it was willing to hire field operatives and launch an aggressive advertising campaign .\n`` In It For The Long Haul : Opportunity and Freedom PAC Is Back On The Air In Iowa , '' the group announced at 9 a.m. on Friday .\n`` We all felt like we had really turned a corner in the past few days , '' said a disappointed Barbour , whose super PAC had knocked on 10,000 doors in Iowa so far . `` We wanted to fight . We felt like there was path , but again , it 's not up to us . ''\nBut despite the super PAC 's intentions , it can not pay filing fees in early states or help the candidate raise the hard money needed to travel or operate a headquarters . The campaign had only raised $ 1.2 million in the first three months of the campaign , Deason said .\nEarlier this week , Perry shuttered his South Carolina campaign headquarters in the capital city of Columbia . And field staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire went without pay this month as the campaign tried to salvage its operation . About a month ago , Perry 's campaign announced that it would no longer be paying staff across the country .\nSome Perry staffers had remained loyal to the campaign , and his super PAC was expected to play a growing , if not unprecedented , role in resuscitating the official campaign . Perry 's support barely registered in polls , but his departure will likely create an intense fight for the dollars that have flooded his big-money group , which must spend the money independently .\nIt is unclear which candidate , or candidates , will inherit the support of Perry 's backers . In the past , Perry has repeatedly gone out of his way to lavish praise on another candidate with Texas roots : businesswoman Carly Fiorina .\nSoon after Perry announced the end of his bid , a flood of warm wishes came from his now-former GOP presidential rivals on Twitter -- perhaps in an effort to court his support , or that of his backers .\n`` . @ GovernorPerry is a terrific guy and I wish him well- I know he will have a great future !

Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 11 , 2015\nCruz said he donated to The Lone Survivor Foundation and the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation , two of Perry 's favorite charities , and praised his one-time boss .\n`` The entire GOP field was unquestionably made stronger by the experience & wisdom @ GovernorPerry brought to the race , '' he tweeted .\nThe entire GOP field was unquestionably made stronger by the experience & wisdom @ GovernorPerry brought to the race https : //t.co/IR5amYIHv7 \u2014 Ted Cruz ( @ tedcruz ) September 12 , 2015\n`` . @ GovernorPerry has dedicated his entire life to his family , friends , and Jesus Christ , '' Florida Sen.
