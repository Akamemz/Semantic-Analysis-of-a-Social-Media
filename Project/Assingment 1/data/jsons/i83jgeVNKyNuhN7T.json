His comments were reported by The Blaze . `` Within five years , the congregations , 50 percent of the congregants will fall away from their church because they won \u2019 t be able to take the persecution , '' Beck said.The nine-member court heard arguments Tuesday on whether to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states . Same-sex couples now can marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg has indicated her support for same-sex marriage , and both she and Justice Elena Kagan have officiated at gay marriages . Justice Anthony Kennedy is expected to be the swing vote in the court 's ruling , which is expected later next month.Beck , who has long railed against government involvement in marriage , predicted that an affirmative decision from the court would force churches to shut down \u2014 or see their memberships plunge because people will stop attending due to the pressure to marry gays and lesbians . `` What does your church do if they are currently saying , 'No , we aren \u2019 t going to marry same-sex couples .
