Bobby Jindal says he 's still a few months away from an announcement about his potential 2016 presidential campaign , but the Republican state leader told \u2588\u2588\u2588 TV Thursday that he 's convinced Americans want an outsider to come in and `` make big changes , not incremental changes . `` `` We need a president who wants to do something , not be somebody , '' said Jindal , in an interview with `` MidPoint '' host Ed Berliner before his slated appearance later in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference Jindal said he has spent the past year with a group , America Next , to discuss policy on healthcare , education , energy and more , and admits he 's biased toward a governor becoming the next president . `` They 've run things before , they want somebody who 's bold enough to tell the truth even if you get criticized by the left and the media who will stick to their guns , stick to their conservative principles , '' said Jindal , pointing out that he 's reduced the size of government in his home state and led to budget cuts of 26 percent that resulted in `` 30,000 fewer state government employees than the day I took office .

If you do n't call it for what it is , how can we beat this enemy ? Secondly , he seems more intent on bringing up things like the crusades and criticizing America . `` Jindal said he 'd be willing to make a deal with Obama : `` I 'll keep an eye out for medieval Christians if he will as commander-in-chief take the fight to the radical Islamic terrorists , hunt them down and eliminate them . `` The war against the Islamic State wo n't be over , Jindal said , until `` we 've finished hunting them down and killing them . `` There ca n't be a political timeline to appease the left , said Jindal , but still Congress needs to give Obama more authority on ISIS than he 's asking for.Obama also does not like to say the words `` radical Islamic terrorism '' and acts like terrorists ' actions are matters for the criminal justice system , complained Jindal.Jindal said he is also concerned about long-term threats , including the potential for Iran to become a nuclear power . `` I worry that this president 's hesitancy to take on ISIS fully may be tied to his desire to get an overarching deal with Iran , '' said Jindal . `` The reason I say that , I believe Turkey would be willing to commit more ground troops , support and resources if they were convinced that America was truly committed to removing Assad in Syria .
