    "content": "Donald Trump has been claiming , of late , that if he loses in November , it will be because the election was \u201c rigged. \u201d After all , he says , look at the big , enthusiastic crowds he attracts at his events .\nOf course , massive crowds do not necessarily foretell victory . Often they are more a sign of passion and devotion , or the entertainment value of a candidate , and don \u2019 t guarantee success \u2013 as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders saw in his losing battle for the Democratic presidential nomination .\nMr. Trump , it appears , is preparing the groundwork to lose , as his poll numbers in key electoral battlegrounds sink . In the meantime , he \u2019 s calling on his supporters to register online as volunteer election observers , and in the process is also gathering voter contact information and asking for contributions . So in a way , the \u201c rigged election \u201d cries are just another avenue for voter engagement .\nBut more ominously , Trump threatens to delegitimize the outcome in November , if he loses and convinces his supporters that Hillary Clinton stole the election . That could undermine the very fabric of American democracy .\n\u201c Something like this is unprecedented , as far as I know \u2013 where a major presidential contender openly raises doubts about the legitimacy of an election before the vote , and without any evidence , \u201d says Matthew Kerbel , political science chairman at Villanova University in Pennsylvania .\nWhat \u2019 s more , it would be \u201c extraordinarily difficult \u201d to rig a presidential election in the way Trump suggests , Professor Kerbel says . \u201c You \u2019 re talking about rigging an election in the Electoral College , where you would have to rig a combination of states . ''\nPerhaps the biggest protection to US elections is their decentralized nature . The US Constitution and federal law give states broad leeway in how they run elections , resulting in a multitude of voting systems , even within states . So to rig the results of a national election at the ballot box or with absentee ballots , a vast conspiracy would be required .\nTrump has centered his allegations of planned cheating in a handful of key states . In Pennsylvania , he has bemoaned the fact that the commonwealth does not require a voter to present photo identification to cast a ballot .\n\u201c We do n't want to see people voting five times , folks , \u201d Trump said last Friday in Altoona , Pa. \u201c I don \u2019 t even know , maybe you should go down and volunteer or do something . But without voter ID , there 's no way you 're going to be able to check it properly . \u201d\nEarlier in the week , in Wilmington , N.C. , Trump suggested that Clinton supporters could now vote \u201c 15 times \u201d for her , given the federal appeals court ruling last month rejecting the state \u2019 s voter ID law . The law , which also ended same-day registration and shortened the state \u2019 s early-voting period , had a racially \u201c discriminatory intent , \u201d the ruling said .\nTrump has also raised the prospect of voter fraud in Ohio , another critical battleground state .\nBut the kind of cheating Trump envisions on a mass scale is virtually impossible to pull off \u2013 including in states that don \u2019 t require the showing of a photo ID . Even in such states , to vote 10 or 15 times , one would have to go to 10 or 15 different polling places and provide the names and addresses of people who live in those precincts and had not yet voted .\nThe call for \u201c Trump Election Observers \u201d creates the appearance that in-person voter fraud is common . But election experts call the rate of such fraud vanishingly small . In 2014 , an investigation by Justin Levitt , a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles , found only 31 credible incidents of voter impersonation out of 1 billion votes cast in the US between 2000 and 2014 .\nTo put that number in perspective , someone is more than three times more likely to win the jackpot in Pennsylvania 's Cash 5 lottery as they are to have impersonated another voter .\nWhat \u2019 s more , Professor Levitt points out , people in states with voter ID laws did not have greater confidence in the integrity of their elections than voters in states without such laws .\n\u201c The factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair ? Whether their preferred candidates win , \u201d Levitt writes .\nAnother issue for the Trump campaign is the matter of a 1982 court order that limits the Republican National Committee \u2019 s ability to challenge the eligibility of voters at polling places . The order bars the RNC \u201c and its agents \u201d from engaging in voter intimidation , especially in areas with large minority populations . The Trump campaign could plausibly be judged \u201c an agent \u201d of the RNC , says election law expert Rick Hasen of the University of California at Irvine , and thus the Trump observers \u2019 activities could risk violating the order .
