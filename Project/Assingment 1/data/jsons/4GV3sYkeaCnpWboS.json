    "authors": "Vladimir V Putin",
    "content": "The potential strike by the United States against Syria , despite strong opposition from many countries and major political and religious leaders , including the pope , will result in more innocent victims and escalation , potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria \u2019 s borders . A strike would increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism . It could undermine multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and further destabilize the Middle East and North Africa . It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance .\nSyria is not witnessing a battle for democracy , but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multireligious country . There are few champions of democracy in Syria . But there are more than enough Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government . The United States State Department has designated Al Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant , fighting with the opposition , as terrorist organizations . This internal conflict , fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition , is one of the bloodiest in the world .\nMercenaries from Arab countries fighting there , and hundreds of militants from Western countries and even Russia , are an issue of our deep concern . Might they not return to our countries with experience acquired in Syria ? After all , after fighting in Libya , extremists moved on to Mali . This threatens us all .\nFrom the outset , Russia has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future . We are not protecting the Syrian government , but international law . We need to use the United Nations Security Council and believe that preserving law and order in today \u2019 s complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos . The law is still the law , and we must follow it whether we like it or not . Under current international law , force is permitted only in self-defense or by the decision of the Security Council . Anything else is unacceptable under the United Nations Charter and would constitute an act of aggression .\nNo one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria . But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian Army , but by opposition forces , to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons , who would be siding with the fundamentalists . Reports that militants are preparing another attack \u2014 this time against Israel \u2014 can not be ignored .",
