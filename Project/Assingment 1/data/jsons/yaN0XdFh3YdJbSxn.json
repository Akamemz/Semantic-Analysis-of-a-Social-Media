This is \u201c The Daily. \u201d Today : A Times investigation reveals that the United States is actively infiltrating Russia \u2019 s electric power grid . David Sanger on what that means for the future of cyber warfare . It \u2019 s Tuesday , June 18 .\nSo what happened in 2008 was the Russians did something pretty brilliant . They dropped a bunch of USB keys \u2014 you know , the kind you might get at a convention or maybe that \u2019 s given to you at a hotel \u2014 in parking lots around American bases in the Middle East . People would pick these things up , bring them into work , and , believe it or not , put them in their computers at work .\narchived recording Somebody got away with the most serious breach of Defense Department computer networks ever .\nAnd what happened was those keys essentially put some malware into computers that got the Russians inside something called SIPRNet .\narchived recording The drive contained malicious coding that spread through classified files and stole information .\nThe official name is the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network , but the main thing to know is it \u2019 s the Pentagon \u2019 s secret network .\narchived recording We didn \u2019 t think that was possible because it \u2019 s completely separate from the internet .\nAnd suddenly , they were able to drain out of the Pentagon some of its most secret communications , all because somebody picked up a USB and stuck it in their machines . And one day , a woman named Debbie Plunkett came into the office at the N.S.A . Remember , this was just ahead of President Obama \u2019 s election . And she discovered this breach , and basically she said , we \u2019 ve got to get them out . And this started a massive effort secretly inside the N.S.A . to clean out the Department of Defense \u2019 s systems . In fact , after a while , people began using superglue to seal the USB ports on Pentagon computers \u2014\n\u2014 so that no idiot would go pick up a USB from someplace and put it in . It was a low-tech solution , Michael , but it worked .\nSo beyond supergluing the USB ports on computers inside the Defense Department , what is the response from the U.S. to this incursion ?\nThe response was near-panic . I mean , think about what had happened just in that year or two . The Chinese had gotten inside Lockheed Martin and stolen many of the designs for the F-35 , the most expensive fighter jet that you \u2019 ve ever paid for . And that \u2019 s why the Chinese today are producing what looks like an F-35 , although it \u2019 s a lot cheaper than ours . The United States was launching its own big , sophisticated cyber operation against Iran \u2019 s nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz . And the Russians , of course , were coming inside the Pentagon . And everybody realized , this is now not just a big intelligence problem . This is a big military problem , and we don \u2019 t have a military unit of size and sophistication to deal with it . And that was the birth of what is now United States Cyber Command .\nSo what does this newly established Cyber Command do about Russia , the culprit of this really damaging attack on the Pentagon ?\nInitially , Michael , not much . U.S. Cyber Command was just getting organized . It didn \u2019 t have many troops . It didn \u2019 t have much expertise . It was based at Fort Meade , but it was highly dependent on its next-door neighbor , the National Security Agency , for most of its capability to look inside networks , much less attack back . So they spent years sort of watching the Russians and building their forces , building cyber sort of expeditionary teams that they could put out with American Army units and Navy units and the Air Force and others . But the big concern was what do you do in time of warfare when the Russians or the Chinese or some other adversary might do more than just get into your communications networks ? They might go in to try to change data , like supposing they altered the targeting on a missile . Supposing they just got into the medical database and changed the blood type of every soldier and sailor , you can imagine the havoc that they would bring about . So the question was how would you find them , how would you counter them , and then , what \u2019 s the right retaliation ? What \u2019 s the deterrent to keep them from doing that ? Of course while the U.S. was having this debate , there were some real attacks happening .\narchived recording 1 The White House is considering a response to the crippling cyberattack on Sony Pictures . archived recording 2 Federal officials are pointing right at the source . They say the attack was launched from inside North Korea .\nThe North Koreans went into Sony because they didn \u2019 t like a bad movie called \u201c The Interview , \u201d and they took out 70 percent of Sony Pictures Entertainment \u2019 s computer systems .\narchived recording 1 It raises huge questions about vulnerability and national security . archived recording 2 They call this new kind of attack cyber extortion .\nAnd suddenly the Obama administration had a debate . What do we do in retaliation ? Well , the answer was they put a few sanctions on the North Koreans , and they cut off their internet access through China for a day or two , but not much . And then , of course , the Chinese came in , and they stole 22 million security files from the Office of Personnel Management . That \u2019 s the office that does security reviews for everybody applying for a clearance .\narchived recording O.P.M . did not specifically say what information the hackers got their hands on , but it could include everything from names to Social Security numbers .\nSo suddenly the Chinese had all this information about 7 percent of the U.S. population , a very elite 7 percent .\narchived recording 1 We \u2019 ve learned the breach goes back 30 years to 1985 and affects nearly every government agency . archived recording 2 One of the largest thefts of U.S. government data ever .\nAnd no one knew what to go do in response other than try to negotiate some agreement about not stealing intellectual property with the Chinese . But all this was very frustrating inside Cyber Command and inside the N.S.A. , because the number of attacks on the United States was expanding like mad . It reached its high point , really , in 2016 , when the election attacks happened from Russia . And it wasn \u2019 t just the election system they were into , because at the same time that the Obama White House was beginning to understand what was happening as the Russians got into the registration systems in Illinois and Arizona and all that , they were getting this other stream of intelligence about much more aggressive attacks on nuclear power plants , on regular power plants . The Russians got into a communications system in a nuclear power plant that \u2019 s in Kansas that caused all kinds of disruption . And suddenly we were beginning to see warnings coming out of the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. , saying , hey , every utility in America \u2014 not just the power companies , but people who ran gas pipelines and water systems and all that , had to be on the lookout for malware , and that could cripple you . It \u2019 s not that the Russians had used that to go turn off the lights yet . They hadn \u2019 t , at least in the United States , but that they were prepared to do so .\nSo David , you \u2019 ve described a series of cyberattacks against the U.S. by its adversaries that are escalating in their brazenness . So why does it seem that this Cyber Command , which was created specifically to defend the U.S. against these kinds of attacks , isn \u2019 t doing very much about it ?\nWell , for a couple of reasons . First , the primary defense for the United States is supposed to come from the Department of Homeland Security . The Pentagon was only supposed to get into this game when the attacks became so severe that they threatened the viability of the United States . The second reason is that Cyber Command didn \u2019 t really have the authorities to do much more than defend the Pentagon . That \u2019 s what its legal authority was . And there was this great frustration , because everybody inside Cyber Command and the N.S.A . and many others realized that no foreign adversary was paying much of a price for attacking the United States . But then this remarkable moment came , because President Trump ended up nominating \u2014\narchived recording The meeting will come to order . The committee meets today to \u2014\narchived recording \u2014 consider the nomination of Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone to be commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director \u2014\nHe was nominated as the new head of the United States Cyber Command and the director of the N.S.A . One person holds both jobs .\nAnd he came up in March of 2018 for his confirmation hearing , and he is asked by Senator Dan Sullivan from Alaska \u2014\narchived recording ( dan sullivan ) What do you think our adversaries think right now ? If you do a cyberattack on America , what \u2019 s going to happen to them ?\nSo what do you think our adversaries think about us right now ?\narchived recording ( paul nakasone ) They do not think that much will happen to them . archived recording ( dan sullivan ) They don \u2019 t fear us . archived recording ( paul nakasone ) They don \u2019 t fear us . archived recording ( dan sullivan ) So is that good ?\narchived recording ( paul nakasone ) It is not good , Senator . archived recording ( dan sullivan ) So will you \u2014\nWell , he didn \u2019 t say this in public , but what he had been proposing for years was a concept really drawn from American Special Forces , which is defend forward . Don \u2019 t wait to get attacked . You know , the Special Forces has learned in the war on terror that if you \u2019 re going to stop a terror attack in Times Square , you better go hit the living room in Pakistan where it \u2019 s being planned . And Nakasone sort of had the same concept , which is the United States has to have what he called persistent presence in foreign computer networks around the world , because if you aren \u2019 t already buried inside that network , you were never going to see an attack coming , and you wouldn \u2019 t have any way to retaliate .\nIn other words , you have to go on the offense to really be on the defense .\nAnd you have to live in your adversaries \u2019 networks . You have to be inside their computers before they attack you , not after . And he was confirmed , and that began a real new era for how Cyber Command went on the offense .\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . So David , you \u2019 ve spent the past few months trying to understand what it means for the Trump administration to go on the offense when it comes to cyber . What exactly have you found ?\nWell , the first thing I found was that the Trump administration and Congress enabled Cyber Command to go on the offense much more aggressively than they had been before . In August of 2018 , President Trump signed a long-awaited executive order . It was called National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 . Its contents are still classified , but essentially it allows the Cyber Command to go ahead and conduct all kinds of operations inside foreign networks without going back to the president for prior approval . Our computer networks around the country were under such a constant barrage of attacks that Cyber Command needed much more freedom to be able to get inside those foreign networks and begin to combat it and that it couldn \u2019 t be going to the White House every time it wanted to do this , just the way the Navy doesn \u2019 t go to the White House every time it wants to go run a group of destroyers down through the South China Sea or go do patrolling along the DMZ in South Korea .\nIn other words , it \u2019 s an acknowledgment that cyber is such an active place that the president could spend his entire day signing off on every decision that needed to be made .\nThat \u2019 s right , and Congress authorized Cyber Command to do even more . It basically said these kind of operations in cyberspace are part of traditional military activity , and you \u2019 re authorized to go ahead and do them the same way that you would do ordinary patrols .\nAnd so what does this newly empowered Cyber Command do with this authority ?\nWell , the first thing it did was go after those units in Russia that were responsible for a lot of the election-hacking . They shut down the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg , which , of course , had designed many of those Facebook ads and other social media ads , for a couple of days right around the midterm elections . They went after the G.R.U. , the Russian military intelligence unit that had been responsible for breaking into the D.N.C . and then making public much of that data . They sent text messages to individual Russian officers and hackers saying , we know who you are . We know where you live . We know your phone number , and if you mess with us , you \u2019 re going to pay a price . So a lot of that action to counter the election malfeasance was made public . What wasn \u2019 t made public was a parallel effort to go inside the Russian power grid , to put some code in places where the Russians would see it as a warning , but put other code in places where the Russians wouldn \u2019 t see it , in case the U.S. ever needed to act against Russia \u2019 s utilities as the Russians were putting malware in our systems .\nSo the U.S. now has the ability to interfere with the Russian power grid in the same way that Russia can already interfere with the U.S. power grid .\nThat \u2019 s right . The U.S. wanted to get deep inside the Russian systems , this time not just for surveillance but to be able to place malware there , basically ticking time bombs or what you might think of as digital landmines that they could set off if we got into a broader conflict with the Russians .\nDavid , how significant is it that the U.S. took this step of basically infiltrating Russia \u2019 s electric grid ?\nOh , I think it \u2019 s a big step , Michael , but it \u2019 s also a pretty risky one . So classic deterrence theory would tell you , do like in the nuclear age , right ? If they can hit you , show them you can hit them back . But I think the Russians have some doubts that we \u2019 d really be willing to pull the plug . They know that we \u2019 re limited by all kinds of legal and ethical considerations and that unplugging a country , except in the midst of a war , would cause a lot of civilian deaths . The people who are most vulnerable if you unplug the grid are people in hospitals or nursing homes . So there \u2019 d be a great reluctance to cause civilian casualties .\nIt might be , but one of the remarkable things about cyber is how well you can go hide the causes of a cyberattack . Most cyber is used in short-of-war conflicts , not full-scale war , but instead this quiet war of attrition where countries are trying to seek advantage or gain power by manipulating the data in your financial systems or making A.T.M.s unavailable or turning off the power in certain parts of the city , but maybe not in others . So it \u2019 s pretty subtle . And the Russians are really smart . They do not want to trigger a general military conflict between the U.S. and Russia . Most other countries don \u2019 t either . So they want to use their cyber capability in the most subtle way possible .\nDavid , given that , as you just said , the battlefield is much more subtle when it comes to cyber than traditional warfare , but the consequences just as significant , at what point does Cyber Command , do all these officials with these new powers granted by the Trump administration , at what point do they need to seek the approval of the president and of Congress to conduct these operations , like entering the Russian electrical grid , in the way that they would for traditional warfare ?\nIt \u2019 s a fascinating question , because if you look at the law , and from what we \u2019 ve heard about the presidential order , they have the authority to do this themselves . Now the law does require them every quarter to bring their congressional overseers up to date with what they \u2019 re doing . So they \u2019 d have to report what they \u2019 re doing in the grid maybe after the fact , but they \u2019 d have to report it . The big question that we were trying to answer is did anybody go to the president to tell them that we were conducting this traditional military activity inside the Russian grid ?\nWhat we found was a lot of people saying to us , we don \u2019 t think the president knows very much about it . He may have been told generally that of course we \u2019 re doing cyber operations , but there \u2019 s a great reluctance inside the intelligence community and certainly inside the U.S. military about what they tell the president about operations against Russia . And that \u2019 s because every time the president hears the words Russia and cyber , his mind immediately goes to the charge that the Russians put him in office or somehow were responsible for his election because of what they did in 2016 , and that sets him off . So we \u2019 ve seen time and time again that people sort of avoid the topic .\nSo it \u2019 s quite possible that the president learned about this operation to get inside the Russian electrical grid from your reporting .\nWe think that \u2019 s possible . He issued two tweets the night that it came out , on Saturday night . The first suggested that publishing it was perhaps an act of treason .\nYes . And then in the second tweet he said , and it \u2019 s all wrong .\nDavid , the treason charge seems worth asking you about . Did the people you talked to inside the U.S. military , Cyber Command , the intelligence community , did they discourage you from reporting on any of this ?\nThey didn \u2019 t . They refused to comment on the specifics that we had found about the U.S. operation . But you know , we \u2019 ve been doing this for a long time , and we \u2019 re accustomed to going to the government and saying , here are the facts we \u2019 re going to lay out . And if you have any national security objections to our publishing this , let us know now before we print , and we \u2019 ll make some judgments about whether to hold back some details . And over the years I have held back details , including about some American cyber operations , when the government made the case that the adversary didn \u2019 t know about it . But in this case , they came back and said , we have no national security objections .\nIn fact , it may be that people in the Trump administration , perhaps not the president himself but those around him , may have wanted you to report this .\nOr certainly they didn \u2019 t see a downside to it . There \u2019 s this great scene at the end of \u201c Dr . Strangelove \u201d when they \u2019 ve been building this huge nuclear gadget and they \u2019 re keeping it a deep secret , and the whole premise of the end of the movie is if you don \u2019 t tell them about the gadget , what good is it ? So we have sort of the same problem in cyber .\nDavid , from everything you \u2019 ve explained , the U.S. goal here is deterrence , and it reluctantly entered a more aggressive phase in its approach to cyber with the goal of preventing our adversaries from attacking us . But at what point does a strategy of deterrence inevitably lead to an arms race , where you have to keep up with your enemies and their approach to cyber , and on and on it goes , until eventually , we \u2019 re in a deeper phase of cyber conflict ?\nMichael , we \u2019 re deeply into that arms race already . We \u2019 re building up new weapons . Everybody else is building up new weapons , but there \u2019 s a lot of discussion these days about whether you should have something akin to a digital Geneva Convention . The real Geneva Conventions protect civilians from being gassed , tortured or starved . In the digital Geneva Convention , you might say there are some systems that are so critical to civilian life that we have to protect them \u2014 power grids because they power hospitals and nursing homes . You might say that election systems should be off limits . You might say that emergency communication systems , communications to ambulances or the police or the fire department , are off limits . And these all seem like pretty attractive ideas , and a lot of countries have signed on to them , although not the United States so far . And one reason , I think , is that many in the U.S. , inside the government , believe we have a big advantage and that we don \u2019 t want to give that advantage up and deprive a future president of the United States of the ability to use one of these weapons that we \u2019 ve spent billions of dollars developing . They might want to be able to go to a president and say , you know , it would be better to manipulate the results in this election than end up with another Nicol\u00e1s Maduro , the dictator in Venezuela , or it might be better to be able to go into the central bank of this country and drain a dictator \u2019 s bank account or keep a terrorist organization from being able to spend any money . So if we \u2019 re going to be able to do those things , we probably wouldn \u2019 t want to sign up to an agreement that prohibits them . And that \u2019 s the big argument we need to have as a country , which is what cyber capability are we willing to give up in order to begin to set some norms of behavior that we \u2019 re hoping other countries will adhere to as well ?\nOn Monday afternoon , a spokesman for Russian president Vladimir Putin said that Russia was confident it could repel U.S. attempts to hack into its electrical grid but warned that such attacks could eventually escalate into a cyberwar with the U.S. We \u2019 ll be right back . Here \u2019 s what else you need to know today .\nOn Monday , the Chinese government expressed strong support for Hong Kong \u2019 s chief executive , Carrie Lam , after days of massive protests against her by hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents . But the support from China could ultimately backfire by reinforcing protesters \u2019 fears that Lam is acting on China \u2019 s behalf . The protests began after Lam pushed for a law that would allow Hong Kong residents to be prosecuted in China , a plan she has since suspended in response to the protests . And \u2014",

If you do a cyberattack on America, what\u2019s going to happen to them?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nSo what do you think our adversaries think about us right now?\n\narchived recording (paul nakasone) They do not think that much will happen to them. archived recording (dan sullivan) They don\u2019t fear us. archived recording (paul nakasone) They don\u2019t fear us. archived recording (dan sullivan) So is that good?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nAnd his answer was essentially not much.\n\narchived recording (paul nakasone) It is not good, Senator. archived recording (dan sullivan) So will you \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did he propose to do about that?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWell, he didn\u2019t say this in public, but what he had been proposing for years was a concept really drawn from American Special Forces, which is defend forward. Don\u2019t wait to get attacked. You know, the Special Forces has learned in the war on terror that if you\u2019re going to stop a terror attack in Times Square, you better go hit the living room in Pakistan where it\u2019s being planned. And Nakasone sort of had the same concept, which is the United States has to have what he called persistent presence in foreign computer networks around the world, because if you aren\u2019t already buried inside that network, you were never going to see an attack coming, and you wouldn\u2019t have any way to retaliate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn other words, you have to go on the offense to really be on the defense.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nAnd you have to live in your adversaries\u2019 networks. You have to be inside their computers before they attack you, not after. And he was confirmed, and that began a real new era for how Cyber Command went on the offense.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So David, you\u2019ve spent the past few months trying to understand what it means for the Trump administration to go on the offense when it comes to cyber. What exactly have you found?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWell, the first thing I found was that the Trump administration and Congress enabled Cyber Command to go on the offense much more aggressively than they had been before. In August of 2018, President Trump signed a long-awaited executive order. It was called National Security Presidential Memorandum 13. Its contents are still classified, but essentially it allows the Cyber Command to go ahead and conduct all kinds of operations inside foreign networks without going back to the president for prior approval. Our computer networks around the country were under such a constant barrage of attacks that Cyber Command needed much more freedom to be able to get inside those foreign networks and begin to combat it and that it couldn\u2019t be going to the White House every time it wanted to do this, just the way the Navy doesn\u2019t go to the White House every time it wants to go run a group of destroyers down through the South China Sea or go do patrolling along the DMZ in South Korea.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s an acknowledgment that cyber is such an active place that the president could spend his entire day signing off on every decision that needed to be made.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThat\u2019s right, and Congress authorized Cyber Command to do even more. It basically said these kind of operations in cyberspace are part of traditional military activity, and you\u2019re authorized to go ahead and do them the same way that you would do ordinary patrols.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so what does this newly empowered Cyber Command do with this authority?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWell, the first thing it did was go after those units in Russia that were responsible for a lot of the election-hacking. They shut down the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, which, of course, had designed many of those Facebook ads and other social media ads, for a couple of days right around the midterm elections. They went after the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence unit that had been responsible for breaking into the D.N.C. and then making public much of that data. They sent text messages to individual Russian officers and hackers saying, we know who you are. We know where you live. We know your phone number, and if you mess with us, you\u2019re going to pay a price. So a lot of that action to counter the election malfeasance was made public. What wasn\u2019t made public was a parallel effort to go inside the Russian power grid, to put some code in places where the Russians would see it as a warning, but put other code in places where the Russians wouldn\u2019t see it, in case the U.S. ever needed to act against Russia\u2019s utilities as the Russians were putting malware in our systems.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the U.S. now has the ability to interfere with the Russian power grid in the same way that Russia can already interfere with the U.S. power grid.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThat\u2019s right. The U.S. wanted to get deep inside the Russian systems, this time not just for surveillance but to be able to place malware there, basically ticking time bombs or what you might think of as digital landmines that they could set off if we got into a broader conflict with the Russians.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDavid, how significant is it that the U.S. took this step of basically infiltrating Russia\u2019s electric grid?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nOh, I think it\u2019s a big step, Michael, but it\u2019s also a pretty risky one. So classic deterrence theory would tell you, do like in the nuclear age, right? If they can hit you, show them you can hit them back. But I think the Russians have some doubts that we\u2019d really be willing to pull the plug. They know that we\u2019re limited by all kinds of legal and ethical considerations and that unplugging a country, except in the midst of a war, would cause a lot of civilian deaths. The people who are most vulnerable if you unplug the grid are people in hospitals or nursing homes. So there\u2019d be a great reluctance to cause civilian casualties.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut wouldn\u2019t that presumption be true on both sides?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nIt might be, but one of the remarkable things about cyber is how well you can go hide the causes of a cyberattack. Most cyber is used in short-of-war conflicts, not full-scale war, but instead this quiet war of attrition where countries are trying to seek advantage or gain power by manipulating the data in your financial systems or making A.T.M.s unavailable or turning off the power in certain parts of the city, but maybe not in others. So it\u2019s pretty subtle. And the Russians are really smart. They do not want to trigger a general military conflict between the U.S. and Russia. Most other countries don\u2019t either. So they want to use their cyber capability in the most subtle way possible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDavid, given that, as you just said, the battlefield is much more subtle when it comes to cyber than traditional warfare, but the consequences just as significant, at what point does Cyber Command, do all these officials with these new powers granted by the Trump administration, at what point do they need to seek the approval of the president and of Congress to conduct these operations, like entering the Russian electrical grid, in the way that they would for traditional warfare?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating question, because if you look at the law, and from what we\u2019ve heard about the presidential order, they have the authority to do this themselves. Now the law does require them every quarter to bring their congressional overseers up to date with what they\u2019re doing. So they\u2019d have to report what they\u2019re doing in the grid maybe after the fact, but they\u2019d have to report it. The big question that we were trying to answer is did anybody go to the president to tell them that we were conducting this traditional military activity inside the Russian grid?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did you find?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWhat we found was a lot of people saying to us, we don\u2019t think the president knows very much about it. He may have been told generally that of course we\u2019re doing cyber operations, but there\u2019s a great reluctance inside the intelligence community and certainly inside the U.S. military about what they tell the president about operations against Russia. And that\u2019s because every time the president hears the words Russia and cyber, his mind immediately goes to the charge that the Russians put him in office or somehow were responsible for his election because of what they did in 2016, and that sets him off. So we\u2019ve seen time and time again that people sort of avoid the topic.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo it\u2019s quite possible that the president learned about this operation to get inside the Russian electrical grid from your reporting.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWe think that\u2019s possible. He issued two tweets the night that it came out, on Saturday night. The first suggested that publishing it was perhaps an act of treason.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHe called you a traitor, basically.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nYes. And then in the second tweet he said, and it\u2019s all wrong.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDavid, the treason charge seems worth asking you about. Did the people you talked to inside the U.S. military, Cyber Command, the intelligence community, did they discourage you from reporting on any of this?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThey didn\u2019t. They refused to comment on the specifics that we had found about the U.S. operation. But you know, we\u2019ve been doing this for a long time, and we\u2019re accustomed to going to the government and saying, here are the facts we\u2019re going to lay out. And if you have any national security objections to our publishing this, let us know now before we print, and we\u2019ll make some judgments about whether to hold back some details. And over the years I have held back details, including about some American cyber operations, when the government made the case that the adversary didn\u2019t know about it. But in this case, they came back and said, we have no national security objections.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn fact, it may be that people in the Trump administration, perhaps not the president himself but those around him, may have wanted you to report this.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nOr certainly they didn\u2019t see a downside to it. There\u2019s this great scene at the end of \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d when they\u2019ve been building this huge nuclear gadget and they\u2019re keeping it a deep secret, and the whole premise of the end of the movie is if you don\u2019t tell them about the gadget, what good is it? So we have sort of the same problem in cyber.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDavid, from everything you\u2019ve explained, the U.S. goal here is deterrence, and it reluctantly entered a more aggressive phase in its approach to cyber with the goal of preventing our adversaries from attacking us. But at what point does a strategy of deterrence inevitably lead to an arms race, where you have to keep up with your enemies and their approach to cyber, and on and on it goes, until eventually, we\u2019re in a deeper phase of cyber conflict?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nMichael, we\u2019re deeply into that arms race already. We\u2019re building up new weapons. Everybody else is building up new weapons, but there\u2019s a lot of discussion these days about whether you should have something akin to a digital Geneva Convention. The real Geneva Conventions protect civilians from being gassed, tortured or starved. In the digital Geneva Convention, you might say there are some systems that are so critical to civilian life that we have to protect them \u2014 power grids because they power hospitals and nursing homes. You might say that election systems should be off limits. You might say that emergency communication systems, communications to ambulances or the police or the fire department, are off limits. And these all seem like pretty attractive ideas, and a lot of countries have signed on to them, although not the United States so far. And one reason, I think, is that many in the U.S., inside the government, believe we have a big advantage and that we don\u2019t want to give that advantage up and deprive a future president of the United States of the ability to use one of these weapons that we\u2019ve spent billions of dollars developing. They might want to be able to go to a president and say, you know, it would be better to manipulate the results in this election than end up with another Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the dictator in Venezuela, or it might be better to be able to go into the central bank of this country and drain a dictator\u2019s bank account or keep a terrorist organization from being able to spend any money. So if we\u2019re going to be able to do those things, we probably wouldn\u2019t want to sign up to an agreement that prohibits them. And that\u2019s the big argument we need to have as a country, which is what cyber capability are we willing to give up in order to begin to set some norms of behavior that we\u2019re hoping other countries will adhere to as well?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDavid, thank you very much. We appreciate it.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday afternoon, a spokesman for Russian president Vladimir Putin said that Russia was confident it could repel U.S. attempts to hack into its electrical grid but warned that such attacks could eventually escalate into a cyberwar with the U.S. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\n[chanting]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, the Chinese government expressed strong support for Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, after days of massive protests against her by hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents. But the support from China could ultimately backfire by reinforcing protesters\u2019 fears that Lam is acting on China\u2019s behalf. The protests began after Lam pushed for a law that would allow Hong Kong residents to be prosecuted in China, a plan she has since suspended in response to the protests.
