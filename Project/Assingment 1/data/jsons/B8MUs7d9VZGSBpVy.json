    "content": "Testing the assumptions behind the headlines Nuclear negotiators from Iran and six world powers on Sunday cleared a second hurdle on the path to reaching a permanent nuclear accord , despite objections by hardliners on all sides . But the agreement made yesterday is no big deal : It simply codifies the deal reached in Geneva on Nov. 24 \u2013 the first hurdle \u2013 by naming Jan. 20 as the start of the six-month window to implement the accord . What is a big deal is that the timeline agreed to yesterday was achieved in the face of strong opposition in the US , Israel , and Iran . The deal requires Iran to cap its uranium enrichment and to convert its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium , which is a few technical steps from bomb-grade . In exchange , it will receive $ 4.2 billion in cash from its own oil sales that have been frozen by sanctions in foreign banks , with a first tranche of $ 550 million unfrozen in the first days of February . The purpose is to \u201c stop the clock \u201d on Iran 's nuclear program for six months so that a final deal can be hammered out without Iran simultaneously making nuclear advances . The final deal would prevent Iran from being able to make a nuclear bomb without being detected \u2013 an aim that Iran says it rejects . Iran has repeatedly denied any intent to acquire nuclear weapons . Iranian and P5+1 officials have emphasized any steps they take are reversible . Yet as many as 59 US senators have signed on to new legislation that would further restricting Iranian oil exports if the Geneva pact is violated . That sparked a row with the White House , which argues that Iran is already at the negotiating table \u2013 and that more sanctions could derail the process and lead to far more costly alternatives . President Barack Obama stated yesterday that he would veto any new sanctions , which \u201c will only risk derailing our efforts to resolve this issue peacefully. \u201d Iran sees any new sanctions vote in Congress as a violation of the Geneva accord and diplomats say the US measure would \u201c kill \u201d the talks . Some Iranian lawmakers vowed that they would respond to any congressional action with their own law requiring Iran to boost enrichment levels to 60 percent , a step closer to the weapons grade of 90 percent , and far higher than Iran has enriched to date . Last week , in a strongly worded speech , Iran \u2019 s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blasted American policies but said Iran would \u201c negotiate with this Satan [ the US ] in order to ward off its evil and resolve the issue . \u201d",
