    "content": "The Obama administration quietly has been forcing new gun buyers to declare their race and ethnicity , a policy change that critics say provides little law enforcement value while creating the risk of privacy intrusions and racial profiling .\nWith little fanfare , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) in 2012 amended its Form 4473 \u2014 the transactional record the government requires gun purchasers and sellers to fill out when buying a firearm \u2014 to identify buyers as either Hispanic , Latino or not . Then a buyer must check his or her race : Indian , Asian , black , Pacific Islander or white .\nThe amendment is causing a headache for gun retailers , as each box needs to be checked off or else it \u2019 s an ATF violation \u2014 severe enough for the government to shut a business down . Many times people skip over the Hispanic/Latino box and only check their race , or vice versa \u2014 both of which are federal errors that can be held against the dealer .\nRequiring the race and ethnic information of gun buyers is not required by federal law and provides little law enforcement value , legal experts say . And gun industry officials worry about how the information is being used and whether it constitutes an unnecessary intrusion on privacy .\n\u201c This issue concerns me deeply because , first , it \u2019 s offensive , and , secondly , there \u2019 s no need for it , \u201d said Evan Nappen , a private practice firearms lawyer in New Jersey . \u201c If there \u2019 s no need for an amendment , then there \u2019 s usually a political reason for the change . What this indicates is it was done for political reasons , not law enforcement reasons . \u201d\nATF said the change came about because it needed to update its forms to comply with an Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) reporting standard put into effect during the Clinton administration . The ATF declined to comment on why race and ethnicity information are needed in the first place or what they are used for . On its prior 4473 forms , the bureau had been collecting race data .\n\u201c OMB \u2019 s race and ethnicity standards require agencies to ask both race and ethnicity in a specific manner ( as done on [ Form 4473 ] ) , and agencies may not ask for one without asking for the other , \u201d wrote Elizabeth Gosselin , a spokeswoman for the ATF , in an emailed response to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . She did not say why the agency suddenly made the change in response to a rule that was more than a decade old .\nFor ATF to ask for a purchaser \u2019 s race and ethnicity is not specifically authorized under federal statute , and since a government-issued photo ID \u2014 like a driver \u2019 s license \u2014 and a background check are already required by law to purchase a gun , the ethnicity/race boxes aren \u2019 t there for identification reasons , Mr. Nappen said .\n\u201c There is nothing [ in ATF or OMB \u2019 s website links addressing the change in policy ] that supports the requirement that ATF collect race-based information . The OMB guidance merely describes what categories of race should look like if information is collected , \u201d Laura Murphy , the American Civil Liberties Union director for legislative affairs in Washington , said in an emailed statement .\nIn addition , Mrs. Murphy notes , the OMB guidance was supposed to be implemented by 2003 ; there \u2019 s no information given why ATF decided to make this change almost a decade later , she said .\n\u201c If there is a civil rights enforcement reason for the ATF to collect this data , I have not heard that explanation from ATF or any other federal agency , \u201d said Mrs. Murphy .\nBoth the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza \u2014 the nation \u2019 s largest national Hispanic civil rights group \u2014 declined comment .\nThe 4473 form is supposed to be kept in a gun retailer \u2019 s possession at all times \u2014 allowing ATF agents to inspect the form only during the course of a criminal investigation or during a random audit of the dealer . The form is to be kept out of the hands of the government , hence the distinction between \u201c sales/transaction form \u201d and \u201c registration form. \u201d But that isn \u2019 t always the case , gun rights advocates say .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been contacted by several dealers saying ATF is or has been making wholesale copies of their 4473 forms , and it \u2019 s just not legal , \u201d said Erich Pratt , spokesman for Gun Owners of America , a gun advocacy group . \u201c If this is what they \u2019 re doing somewhat out in the open , what \u2019 s going on behind closed doors ? Are these names and demographic information getting phoned [ in and ] punched into a government computer ? Do they ever come out ? \u201d\nDuring the time ATF revised its 4473 form to include Hispanic or Latino as an ethnicity , the Obama administration was building gun control cases by saying U.S. firearms dealers were supplying Mexican gangs with weapons and that violence related to the sales was seeping across the border .\nIn March 2009 , then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Mexico City and gave a speech against American gun stores and owners \u2014 blaming them for the drug cartels \u2019 violence . Mrs. Clinton subsequently told CBS News that \u201c 90 percent \u201d of the \u201c guns that are used by the drug cartels against the police and military \u201d actually \u201c come from America . \u201d\nAbout a week later , Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. made the same points at a gun trafficking conference outside of Mexico City . In April , the president himself flew down to Mexico to inform President Felipe Calderon that Mr. Holder was going to review U.S. law enforcement operations , according to a 2011 report by the American Thinker .\nThis political worldview may have fueled decision-making at ATF , Mr. Nappen suggests . Around the same time that ATF started specifying \u201c Latino/Hispanic \u201d on their U.S. purchasing forms , they also required border firearms dealers in Texas , Arizona , California and New Mexico to start reporting multiple rifle sales .\nIn 2012 , when ATF made the Form 4473 modification , they insisted their new reporting requirement for multiple rifle sales in those border states had led to \u201c follow-up investigations involving transactions that might indicate firearms trafficking activities . \u201d\n\u201c Was it coincidental [ that ] about the time the form changed the requirements came in that border states had to report multiple rifle sales , and there was a push in the antigun movement to claim American guns were arming Mexican cartels south of the border ? \u201d asked Mr. Nappen .\nAlthough gun advocates speculate on the reasoning behind changing the form , on one thing they are clear : Requiring ethnicity and race to purchase a gun is a clear government overstep , violating Second Amendment rights .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an overreach , not authorized by Congress , taken upon [ by ATF ] unilaterally , \u201d said Mr. Pratt . \u201c The president has said his biggest frustration has been not getting gun control enacted \u2014 but we can see he \u2019 s been very active with his phone and his pen .
