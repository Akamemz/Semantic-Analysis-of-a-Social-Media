    "title": "The strange death of GOP libertarianism: Rand Paul's collapse and the fading of a political moment",

    "content": "In a recent article , Jerry Taylor , president of the Niskanen Center , Washington 's newest libertarian think-tank , discusses the collapsing presidential campaign of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and what it means for the larger libertarian movement in the United States . As I pointed out last month , Taylor concludes that the sudden rise of Donald Trump , who may just be the least libertarian of all GOP front-runners , is not a good sign for the libertarian movement , which not too long ago seemed poised to take over a large segment of the Republican Party . Today , this optimism had been shattered . Taylor writes :\nIf there were any significant support for Libertarian ideas in the GOP\u2014any at all\u2014Rand Paul would be near the top of an otherwise crowded , fragmented field that is fighting over every non-libertarian voter in the party . Yet he \u2019 s polling at a mere 1 percent among Republican voters nationwide and has a higher unfavorability rating than anyone else in the GOP race .\nThe news gets worse for Paul . Last week , it emerged that he was taking a break from his presidential campaign to fundraise for his simultaneous Senate reelection bid , although one person with close ties to Kentucky politics warned that he was not giving up on his presidential run just yet . ( Paul has repeatedly stated that he will not be dropping out any time soon , and that his message is necessary at the debates . ) Meanwhile , Trump has been bragging as usual that he alone has destroyed the senator \u2019 s chances , tweeting last week :\nWhile Trump is simply being his arrogant self , he is not wrong . In fact , some of Trump \u2019 s biggest supporters are self-described Tea Partyers ; the same people who are supposed to be small government conservatives supporting Rand Paul . Supposed to be , that is , but not in reality . I take the same view as Michael Lind , who last month described in Politico what many of us on the left have always felt about the Tea Party .\n\u201c The success of Trump \u2019 s campaign has , if nothing else , exposed the Tea Party for what it really is , \u201d writes Lind . \u201c Trump \u2019 s popularity is , in effect , final proof of what some of us have been arguing for years : that the Tea Party is less a libertarian movement than a right-wing version of populism . \u201d\nIn other words , Trump has vindicated the left \u2019 s suspicion that the Tea Party is not a small government libertarian movement , but a kind of white-identity populism akin to the 1960s reactionary movement led by politicians like George Wallace . Right-wing populists have long been dubious of foreigners , immigrants , minorities and elitists -- both in the intellectual and monied sense . Sound familiar ?\nTrump has taken advantage of the fears and insecurities of a significant portion of white Americans , who see the influx of non-white immigrants -- Hispanic , Asian , Muslim -- as a threat to their way of life . In their view , Muslims are terrorists ( i.e. , Syrian refugees are members of ISIS -- even though half are children ) , Mexicans are rapists and job-stealers , foreigners are cheaters , black people are lazy , and so on . They also distrust intellectuals and experts . Consider , for example , the denial of scientific realities like climate change and evolution . Even though the vast majority of scientists agree that human beings are warming the planet with their carbon output , most Republican supporters simply refuse to believe . Overall , the Tea Party movement appears to be a combination of white-identity politics and anti-intellectualism . Even Glenn Beck , the former patron saint of the Tea Party , has called Trump 's Tea Party supporters racists . ( I guess he never interacted with supporters at those rallies of his . )\nWhat does all this say about a great percentage of Republican voters ? First of all , it reveals that many are ideologically inconsistent ( except when it comes to their social views ) and politically ignorant . After all , Trump is no small government conservative , and as former congressman Ron Paul said recently , he sounds increasingly authoritarian . It also reveals that most GOP voters are not libertarian like Rand Paul , and that his honesty on certain issues , especially when he speaks out against war , advocates diplomacy , and criticizes the government spying on its own citizens , hurts his standing in the Grand Old Party .\nIn closing , Jerry Taylor writes about issues that libertarians have been successful with over the past few years :\nLibertarians ... can take heart from the fact that political sentiment is moving their way in some areas . Gay rights , drug decriminalization , increasing outrage over heavy-handed police tactics , growing concern over an unjust legal system , disgust over crony capitalism , and opposition to military deployments abroad all suggest that libertarian arguments can have political force .\nThe thing is , these issues are all areas where libertarians and those on the left agree . Indeed , liberals and libertarians tend to see eye to eye on somewhere around half of the issues ( typically relating to civil rights ) , while they disagree on other things like the free market and income inequality . These issues -- war , civil rights , criminal justice reform -- are what make Paul an outsider in the Republican Party .\nWhether you agreed with him or not during the last two debates , Paul did bring substance to otherwise fruitless events . But it seems that most GOP voters do not care about substance , and prefer entertaining and pompous loudmouths who embrace their irrational fears , insecurities and prejudices . One can disagree with a political opponent and still have great respect for him or her , but only when real substance and debate is involved . How can one have respect for an opponent like Trump , who makes outlandish claims without any evidence and popularizes untrue and dangerous generalizations about entire segments of the population ? How can one respect someone who operates in fear-mongering and embraces some of the darkest qualities of human beings , like racism , to get ahead in the polls ?\nUnfortunately , the GOP is headed in this ugly direction , and the fall of Rand Paul , who is one of the few Republicans with a consistent and discernible philosophy -- wrong as it may be -- reveals this crude drift towards a political movement that will inevitably leave many victims in its wake .",
