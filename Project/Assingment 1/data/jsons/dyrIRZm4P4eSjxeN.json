    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\nSome note that Warren \u201c portrays herself as the candidate of dreaming big and fighting hard . That is working well when it comes to her signature promise of fixing what she calls a rigged economic system that favors rich people and corporations at the expense of much of the rest of America\u2026 [ Her ] support for \u2018 Medicare for All \u2019 and the phaseout of almost all private insurance , however , is working much less well\u2026 \u201c There are lots of people with marginal insurance or no coverage at all . But there are also lots of people [ who like their insurance plans ] . That has become increasingly clear as unions , a core Democratic constituency , defend the private health insurance plans they have negotiated , sometimes giving up higher wages in exchange\u2026 This may be a matter of trying to keep the focus on the highest , most aspirational goal , much as Republicans did when they ran on killing the ACA while Obama was in the White House with a veto pen . The difference is that their rallying cry mobilized the GOP base . Warren \u2019 s runs the risk of alienating even many liberal Democrats. \u201d Jill Lawrence , USA Today\n\u201c Among all the 2020 Democratic candidates , [ Warren ] is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters ( 17 % ) are \u2018 enthusiastic \u2019 about . While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March , the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26 % . Biden , however , has seen the opposite trend . In March , 17 % of voters were enthusiastic about him , but now the former VP has slipped to 12 % \u2026 Donald Trump has every reason to be concerned about taking on former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election\u2026 But Trump 's greatest threat may in fact come from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren . \u201d Dean Obeidallah , CNN\n\u201c Warren has cultivated a reputation as a smart , detail-oriented policymaker , and on the 2020 campaign trail she \u2019 s rolled out a litany of policy blueprints\u2026 But her time at the CFPB reveals a fundamentally more ideological , confrontational figure who did not come to Washington to make friends . The federal government had , in her eyes , let big business run wild for decades , and that had wreaked havoc on everyday Americans . Wall Street had just gotten away with murder , and she wasn \u2019 t going to let that happen again \u2014 even if that meant alienating powerful members of the party establishment\u2026 \u201c Her supporters and detractors describe her as ruthlessly committed to her ideals \u2014 and ruthlessly effective at making them real . \u201d Emily Stewart , Vox\n\u201c Biden is trying to bridge reassurance to the wealthy with outreach to energized progressives\u2026 If two Obama terms were not enough for you , he \u2019 s offering something resembling a third \u2014 Obamacare Plus ; a possible increase in capital-gains tax to address inequality\u2026 \u201c Will this fine-tuning be enough in an agitated America , whiplashed by President Trump ? I doubt it . The under-30s , maybe under-40s , are underwhelmed by Biden , even angry that this honorable man has not chosen dignified retirement . He \u2019 s the emblem of the permanent political class , the one thatcreated the conditions for Trump\u2026 What created Trump can not oust Trump . It will demand a new politics , and a new integrity , such as the one Warren has set out and embodied with greater vigor , persuasiveness and coherence than anyone else. \u201d Roger Cohen , New York Times\n\u201c Biden has three advantages in this primary : association with former president Barack Obama , relative policy moderation and perceived electability . It \u2019 s basically impossible for anyone to detract from or surmount those first two qualities\u2026 But Biden \u2019 s other strength \u2014 electability \u2014 is assailable . The easiest way to prove that a candidate isn \u2019 t electable is to beat them in an election . And Warren could do that in Iowa\u2026 \u201c Warren tends to do well with white voters who think of themselves as more liberal . Contrary to farm belt stereotypes , the Iowa Democratic Party is full of the sort of white liberals who might like Warren . If Warren were to follow up an Iowa win with a victory in New Hampshire , another state with a solid number of white liberals , she might be able to simultaneously drive her opponents on the left out of the race and damage Biden \u2019 s electability argument. \u201d David Byler , Washington Post\nThe headlines \u201c largely focus on the fact that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now at the top tier of the 2020 field in the crucial Iowa caucuses . That notion drastically undersells how strong a position Warren is actually in\u2026 Warren gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll . Biden , meanwhile , has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now\u2026 \u201c Warren is [ also ] the first or second choice of 42 % of those polled . That 's well in front of Biden ( 30 % first/second combined ) , Sanders ( 21 % ) , South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg ( 18 % ) and California Sen. Kamala Harris ( 16 % ) \u2026 Iowa is now Warren 's to lose. \u201d Chris Cillizza , CNN\nThe right is skeptical of claims that Warren is now the frontrunner , and critical of her policies .\nThe right is skeptical of claims that Warren is now the frontrunner , and critical of her policies .\nWarren \u2019 s \u201c poll lead is not large \u2014 22 percent to 20 percent \u2014 but it gives those covering the race their first significant lead change to hype , and those not-so-closeted Warren fans who have been itching to write their \u2018 Warren is now the real frontrunner \u2019 column now have the excuse they \u2019 ve been looking for\u2026\n\u201c In addition to whatever other conscious and subconscious biases are at work in those covering the race , reporters , editors , and producers in the national news media desperately want an exciting Democratic primary race to cover . Twists , turns , lead changes , surprises , drama , suspense \u2014 they want an ongoing news story that is unpredictable and exciting that gets viewers , listeners , and readers to tune in day after day . This primary has been , by many measures , something of a dud . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 re still a long way from fully consolidating the Democratic vote in Iowa , and around the country for that matter . In Iowa , Harris , along with Pete Buttigieg , Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker still account for a combined 21 % of the total . And there \u2019 s an additional 24 percent scattered among the rest of the massive field . When larger numbers of [ candidates ] begin following Bill de Blasio out the door , they \u2019 ll all have to go somewhere\u2026 Biden and Warren may be leading with around 20 % , but that \u2019 s not going to tell us a thing until the rest of the Democratic chickens come home to roost . \u201d\nRepublican political advisor Sarah Isgur notes that \u201c unlike Elizabeth Warren , who has developed her following based on her progressive appeal and solid debate performances , Biden 's standing with the Democratic electorate seems largely driven by fear\u2014fear of losing again to Donald Trump . If she can assuage that fear\u2014or if another candidate can prove more viable\u2014Joe Biden could be looking at a swift and total collapse\u2026 but the growing partisan divide around Donald Trump and the fear of losing to him in 2020 means electability will only grow in importance to Democratic primary voters . And that 's bad news right now for every candidate whose name does n't rhyme with Schmiden . \u201d\n\u201c Warren \u2019 s recent rise and the persistence of \u2018 Bernie or Bust \u2019 voters says more about the Democratic Party than how left-wing it has become\u2026 the Democratic campaign is being shaped significantly by populism . That Sanders is not only a socialist but also a populist was well-understood during the 2016 primary campaign\u2026 Warren had a rocky start , but has risen as her campaign has become more overtly populist . She may market herself as the candidate with plans for everything , but she does so within the frame that her plans are needed to address a system rigged in favor of the wealthy , big corporations and their lobbyists\u2026\n\u201c The culmination of these populist trends is a Democratic Party whose candidates are largely beyond its control\u2026 It would be tough to top the chaos of 1968 , and the odds of an actual contested convention are probably less than one-in-three , but Democrats should be uncomfortable with those odds . \u201d\n\u201c One of [ Warren \u2019 s ] latest plans would restrict corporate takeovers and restructurings . It 's similar to a plan that caused the largest stock market crash in our history the last time it was considered by Congress\u2026 Her plan would place restrictions on corporate takeovers and restructurings and repeal the tax breaks related to mergers and acquisitions . This same type of plan was responsible for the stock market crash of 1987 . On Monday , Oct. 19 , 1987 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed 508 points , a 22.6 % drop . That 's the equivalent to a more than 6,000-point drop today\u2026\n\u201c Although some blamed the crash on program trading , trade deficits , or other factors , a study by economists from the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1989 found that \u2018 the fundamental factor that initially started the market decline \u2019 was the takeover restriction in the proposed House bill . \u201d\nWarren \u201c was a Harvard law professor and prizes her reputation as a very serious policy wonk . And yet vast swaths of her proposed agenda are either illegal or unconstitutional . For instance , she has vowed to implement a total ban on fracking once she \u2019 s elected . The only problem : The president doesn \u2019 t have that power . Congress passed a law in 2005 giving wide latitude to states to allow fracking\u2026 Warren \u2019 s wealth tax is almost surely unconstitutional , so is her plan for creating a national statutory right for abortion\u2026\n\u201c None of these sweeping promises has any chance of surviving contact with Congress , never mind the voters . But that \u2019 s beside the point . The Democratic primary is an emotive contest to prove who cares the most\u2026 One of the reasons our politics are so ugly is that politicians and activists insist the impossible is not only possible , but easy . When the inevitable failure materializes , the same politicians blame it on nefarious special interests and a rigged system . This in turn , leads not just to more cynicism but a desire for leaders who will tear down everything , the Constitution be damned . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
