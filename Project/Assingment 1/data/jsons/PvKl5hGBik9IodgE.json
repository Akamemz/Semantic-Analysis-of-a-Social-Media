    "content": "Despite what political leaders want them to say , COVID-19 models will become less predictive exactly when we need them most .\nIn the continuing drama of America \u2019 s coronavirus response , statistical models play the role of Hamlet \u2019 s father : foreboding , influencing the action on the stage but unable to speak for themselves .\nSome health leaders have said that various COVID-19 models \u2019 worst projections \u2014 such as the Imperial College London model that predicted that 500,000 Britons would die \u2014 were overly dire . That skepticism about what the models truly say will play a growing role in the discussion about when and how to \u201c re-open \u201d the country . But the idea that the worst of the pandemic is behind us \u2014 and that the models prove it \u2014 is misleading at best and dangerous at worst , say experts .\nRight now , the world is eager for news that the crisis is abating and that economic and social life can \u201c return to normal. \u201d Largely as a result of massive social distancing efforts , new infections in New York and other hotspots are going down . Some , like Andrew McCarthy at the National Review , feel like they \u2019 ve seen enough to toss the modelers out on their rears . \u201c There is no shortage of government spin , regurgitated by media commentators , assuring us that the drastic reductions in the projections over just a few days powerfully illustrate how well social distancing and the substantial shuttering of the economy is working . Nonsense , \u201d McCarthy writes .\nWhat the models are , in fact , is poorly represented by the policy makers touting them . The vast majority of them aren \u2019 t built to project infection rates out beyond a few weeks , so they don \u2019 t tell us anything about the resurgences that may come . Some of the most influential models , such as the University of Pennsylvania \u2019 s COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics , or CHIME , were designed to help hospital managers stock up for worst-case scenarios . Yet , in the Washington , D.C. , mayor \u2019 s office , CHIME is the model of choice .\nCHIME is an SIR model , which stands for susceptible , infected , recovered . They \u2019 re hardly perfect and they don \u2019 t pretend to be , as Michael Z . Levy , an associate professor in the Department of Biostatistics , Epidemiology & Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania , recently said in an online lecture . You can change the outcome drastically with small changes to various parameters . For it to be of the most use , you need to be seeking the answer to a specific question , like , \u201c How many beds will this hospital need in May ? \u201d\nSIR models assume that \u201c everyone is bumping into everyone else like perfect spheres in a vacuum , \u201d Levy said . \u201c We didn \u2019 t act like that even before social distancing . \u201d\nSuch models are \u201c fine for short-term forecasts , but it becomes problematic when you start to ask different questions \u201d \u2014 like what will happen if social distancing is implemented in some places but not others ? What happens if infections go down but testing is still inadequate ? What changes if therapeutic drugs are available only in some places ?\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation , or IHME , model used by the White House is a more general public-health model . It predicted peak hospital resource use during the second week in April along with ICU and hospital overcapacity . But it showed those outcomes could be mitigated through social distancing measures . When most people talk about \u201c flattening the curve , \u201d they \u2019 re referring to this model .\nBut the model \u2019 s creators admit to a big limitation that doesn \u2019 t make it into the White House briefings . It was originally designed only to track infection rates and hospital use through June . And while its creators at the University of Washington are constantly using new data to improve it , these updates don \u2019 t provide high-confidence predictions about the fall or next year because the number of variables is growing as new measures are implemented in lots of different ways across varied locations .\nAnother example : a March 25 article in the New York Times was intended to show the effects of two months of social distancing to \u201c flatten the curve. \u201d But it doesn \u2019 t extend past October . Wesley Pegden , an associate professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University , recently took to Medium to point out that two months of lockdown won \u2019 t end the pandemic , and people who say otherwise are mistaken or lying . In fact , a two-month lock down that isn \u2019 t followed by a uniform strategy to manage new infections without overwhelming the health system leads to a fall resurgence that eclipses the spring \u201c peak . \u201d\n\u201c Two months of mitigations have not improved the outcome of the epidemic in this model , it has just delayed its terrible effects , \u201d Pegden wrote . \u201c In fact , because of the role of weather in the model presented in the [ New York Times ] article , two months of mitigations actually results in 50 % more infections and deaths than two weeks of mitigations , since it pushes the peak of the epidemic to the winter instead of the summer , whose warmer months this model assumes causes lower transmission rates\u2026No model whose purpose is to study the overall benefits of mitigations should end at a time-point before a steady-state is reached . \u201d\nIn a conversation with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Pegden said that the messaging around these models has left the public ill-informed . \u201c People have not been given enough sense of the uncertainty . They have not been given a sense of how a lockdown will not fix the problem . \u201d\nWhen he tells people this , he finds them \u201c surprised and disturbed that a two-month lockdown was not going to fix the problem , \u201d he said .\nPegden \u2019 s concerns are much more in line with a model produced by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London . It predicts resurgent infection spikes until a vaccine becomes widely available in a year or so .\nEven the most dire projections remain a possibility despite the recent slump in new cases , Ferguson said .\n1/4 - I think it would be helpful if I cleared up some confusion that has emerged in recent days . Some have interpreted my evidence to a UK parliamentary committee as indicating we have substantially revised our assessments of the potential mortality impact of COVID-19 . \u2014 neil_ferguson ( @ neil_ferguson ) March 26 , 2020\nPegden says that a lockdown from March to May could wind up making the situation much worse later precisely because policymakers overpromised on its effects . A lockdown only buys you time , time to get nationwide testing in order , ventilators to more places , and hospitals ready for a coming surge in patients . In the United States , that hasn \u2019 t happened to the extent it needs to .\n\u201c It is not true , a priori , that every transmission you avoid today is saving lives , \u201d says Pegden . \u201c You can save lives by having more transmissions among more people in the short term . \u201d\nHe acknowledges that the idea of exposing more people to the virus is counterintuitive , but , he says , \u201c It \u2019 s not always the case that the most conservative thing you can do will save the most lives . If transmission levels revert to normal over the next year\u2026then it would turn out that being locked down was a mistake . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s now up to policymakers to find a coherent way to reopen the country , guided by strategy and not models that will start to fall apart as more and more variables are introduced . A total lockdown until a vaccine arrives is neither politically nor economically viable . The question is how to ease the lockdown without overwhelming the healthcare system . Pegden put out a preprint paper looking at how to do just that . In essence , he says , you want to start lifting restrictions on people who are younger , a population that is less likely to need ICU care . But you don \u2019 t want to lift restrictions on all of them since some of them may live with someone in the more vulnerable 60-plus age group .\n\u201c Age-targeting has the potential to greatly reduce total mortalities compared with optimum choices for homogeneous measures . At the same time , we see that the best strategies for age-targeting are sensitive to the fraction of the younger population which can be released . In general , if too few people are released initially , a second wave occurs when transmission levels return to normal , \u201d they write .\nA visual representation of the effects of relaxing social distancing rules for some individuals under the age of 50 versus the entire U.S. population , from \u201c Modeling strict age-targeted mitigation strategies for COVID-19 \u201d\nPolicy-makers should also begin to prepare for the illness to start having a much worse effect on people with lower incomes . Reports show that they are more likely to have underlying health conditions and are less likely to be able to work remotely or to maintain social distance , said Levy . That diversity of health outcomes is already occurring to some extent , but it \u2019 s likely to get worse . A new visualization tool shows which areas are going to be more affected based on the demographics of the population .\nLevy , in his lecture , pointed out that trying to tweak models to reflect the arrival of anti-COVID drugs won \u2019 t much improve them , since there are still too many variables to control for . \u201c To really affect transmission dynamics , \u201d he said , a potential drug \u201c would need to affect these other parameters . You would need an over-the-counter-cold-sniffy-nose-and-COVID drug . \u201d\nOne thing we probably should begin to model for now is mutation , since that \u2019 s going to affect the efficacy of drugs , vaccines , and other measures later on . That \u2019 s going to be more useful than trying to forecast infection and recovery among a population in an environment where that will become more difficult .\nA recent paper by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University offers an interesting and useful take on precisely that very hard problem .\nPredicting when a virus mutates into another virus is more challenging than mapping the spread of a contagion among a group . But looking at how information spreads and mutates online in social networks can provide some insight into how viruses spread and mutate in the real world .\n\u201c There is some similarity from an evolution perspective via the mechanism of natural selection . A virus may go through a number of mutations ( mostly a random process ) . However , among a large number of these , the mutation that leads to highest infectiousness will be \u2018 naturally selected \u2019 i.e. , it will be the one that we will see most commonly . For information it is also similar , \u201d Osman Ya\u011fan , an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon \u2019 s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an email . \u201c Several people can attempt to modify a piece of information to make it more attractive . It will be the audience who will then \u2018 select \u2019 the most appealing one and that particular version of the information will be much more prevalent ( say in Twitter ) than others . \u201d\nYa\u011fan says that the research could help epidemiologists better prepare in case the virus goes through a rapid mutation process , as well as to understand the effects of protective measures in a new way . \u201c We believe that there is some similarity between \u2018 a virus mutating and becoming less easy to infect individuals \u2019 and \u2018 people being careful about social-distancing and thus becoming less easy to get infected. \u2019 The analogy here is strengthened by the fact that those who do not obey social-distancing are more likely to infect each other ( a la carrying a second-strain of the virus ) than those who are obeying the guidelines . \u201d\nThe work is partially funded by the U.S. Army . Edward Palazzolo , program manager for the Social and Cognitive Networks Program at the Army Research Office , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that it \u2019 s his job to bring people together across different disciplines to find new approaches to problems , which is what they did here . \u201c We \u2019 re always supporting basic research \u201d he said , and it \u2019 s a long-term effort . They began funding Ya\u011fan \u2019 s work in 2017 .\nSpeaking in a personal capacity and not as a representative of the U.S. Army , Palazzolo said that he was heartened to see more people learning some of the elementary basics of data science . But he said that contract tracing \u2014 a key to other countries \u2019 successful approaches \u2014 will be especially difficult in the United States because of the privacy implications of contact-tracing apps .\nPalazzolo warned that leaders should avoid treating models like crystal balls . They \u201c should never take a model and say , \u2018 This is the truth \u2019 , \u201d he said .\nMore importantly , they need to work with scientists to understand statistical terms \u2014 for example , what a confidence interval is . ( It \u2019 s the specific range of numbers the modeler is confident that the value falls within . ) \u201c Having the right people on the team will make all the difference . \u201d\nOf course , having the right people only matters if you listen to them \u2014 lest we rely on models that seem to predict a recovery on the basis of assumptions that are no-longer true , like a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing .",
