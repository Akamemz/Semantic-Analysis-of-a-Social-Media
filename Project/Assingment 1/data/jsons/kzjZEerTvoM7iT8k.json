    "content_original": "House and Senate budget negotiators in Washington have reached a deal to fund the federal government and avoid a government shutdown on Jan. 15. It comes after much fiscal turbulence, including the first government shutdown in 17 years in October.\n\nHere are the basics:\n\nQ. Does this mean the budget drama is over?\n\nA. If the House and Senate approve of the deal, which was hammered out by budget negotiators Rep. Paul Ryan (R) of Wisconsin and Sen. Patty Murray (D) of Washington, the government will be funded for the next two fiscal years. That means a reprieve from budget brinkmanship \u2013 and shutdown. But another fiscal landmine could explode. The United States will hit its debt ceiling in the first half of next year. If lawmakers refuse to raise the ceiling, the US could face the possibility of defaulting on its debt \u2013 sending economic shockwaves around the world.\n\nQ. This is a relatively small deal. So why is it important?\n\nA. This agreement is more important for its politics than for its numbers. The compromise is indeed small, funding the government at $1.012 trillion annually \u2013 about halfway between the Senate budget of $1.058 trillion and the House budget of $967 billion. It softens the automatic spending cuts, known as the \u201csequester,\u201d by only $63 billion, but doesn\u2019t get rid of it. It splits the sequester relief evenly between the Pentagon and nondefense programs. [Editor's note: The original version has been changed to give the correct dollar amount for the original House budget.]\n\nIts significance is that there is a deal at all. The House and Senate have not been able to agree on a budget since 2009. The haggling, brinkmanship, and uncertainty, not to mention the October government shutdown, have had a drag effect on the economy, tarnished America\u2019s reputation overseas, and fed the partisanship that has Americans now so disgusted with Congress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good step in the right direction that can hopefully rebuild some trust and serve as a foundation for continued bipartisan work,\u201d said Senate Budget Chairman Murray in a statement.\n\nQ. You said it\u2019s a small deal. What\u2019s missing?\n\nA. This is no \u201cgrand bargain.\u201d It does not trade tax increases \u2013 as Democrats want \u2013 for significant cuts to the expensive programs that drive long-term debt, such as Medicare and Social Security. That\u2019s what Republicans wanted. In fact, it doesn\u2019t really deal with long-term debt at all. What it does do is put a small dent in the deficit, reducing it by between $20 billion and $30 billion.\n\nQ. Given the polarization in Washington, how was it possible to reach this agreement?\n\nA. It\u2019s precisely because its scope is so narrow that Ryan and Murray were able to come to agreement. They knew they would not be able to get their respective caucuses to agree to the big stuff, or even what some consider medium stuff \u2013 such as closing corporate tax loopholes or using a less costly method of figuring Social Security checks.\n\nThe other reason they could agree is because they were the ones working it out. They may be ideological opposites, but they are both highly pragmatic. And they adhered to that warning about too many cooks in the kitchen spoiling the broth. This was a Ryan-Murray creation, which certainly makes it easier to actually put a deal on the table.\n\nQ. What happens next?\n\nA. The House is expected to take up the agreement, called the Bipartisan Budget Act, before its recesses for the Christmas holiday on Friday. Then it\u2019s the Senate\u2019s turn. But it\u2019s still not certain that the bill will pass both houses. Democrats will be upset that the deal does not include an extension of jobless benefits, set to expire later this month. Conservatives will be upset that the full sequester is not in force, and that a more serious attempt at debt reduction was not made.\n\nSome conservatives have already begun lining up against the deal.
