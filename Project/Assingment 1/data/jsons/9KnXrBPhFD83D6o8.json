    "content": "White House Touts 'Historic ' 28 Laws Signed By Trump , But What Are They ?\nEven though President Trump calls the 100-days measure `` ridiculous , '' the White House is still touting what one press release called the president 's `` historic accomplishments '' \u2014 including 28 laws he has signed since taking office .\nBut when it comes to legislation , political scientists say it is better to measure significance than to simply add up the number of bills . It is better , they argue , to ask whether a law changes the status quo or introduces a new policy idea .\nBy that measure , there is not as much to show legislation-wise for Trump 's first 100 days .\nOf the 28 new laws signed by Trump , two name Veterans Affairs clinics in honor of people , one adds National Vietnam War Veterans Day to the list of days people and businesses are encouraged to fly American flags , five are related to personnel matters ( including the waiver allowing James Mattis to become secretary of defense ) , and one extends an Obama-era policy allowing veterans in some circumstances to get health care outside of the VA system .\n`` Congress passes laws all the time , naming post offices after people , doing minor things that they can get through , '' said Leon Panetta , who served as defense secretary in the Obama administration and as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton . Panetta does n't see any major legislation in this administration 's first 100 days .\n`` Presidents throughout history are acknowledged as a success when they get legislation passed through the Congress \u2014 major legislation that affects the lives of people . And that ultimately will be the test for this president , '' Panetta said .\nDuring the campaign , Trump signed a `` Contract With the American Voter , '' in which he promised to work with Congress to introduce 10 bills `` and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration . ''\nOf those 10 , only one \u2014 the American Health Care Act \u2014 has made it into legislative form , and it has not yet gotten a vote . The Trump administration did announce broad outlines of a tax system overhaul this week , but it is n't expected to be written into legislation until later this year .\nIn a briefing with reporters on Tuesday , Trump 's legislative affairs director Marc Short was asked to name the new president 's most significant legislative accomplishment \u2014 to name one major new law \u2014 but he took issue with the question .\n`` I would say that confirming a Supreme Court justice of the United States who will probably be there for 30 years is a big legislative achievement , '' said Short . `` I would say the regulatory impact we 've had on the economy is a big legislative achievement . And we look forward in the coming days to hopefully continue to make progress on the appropriations process and on health care . ''\nWhen he talks about `` regulatory impact , '' Short is referring to the 13 laws passed under the Congressional Review Act . Before Trump , the 1996 law had been used only once before , by George W Bush . But with GOP in control of both the House and the Senate , the Trump White House had a rare chance to significantly roll back rules written by the previous administration .\nThe Congressional Review Act allows Congress to reverse rules within 60 legislative days of their submission , requiring only a simple majority in the Senate . In the current Congress , that means Democrats are not able to block the rollbacks .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan touted the 13 laws as `` measures to take excessive regulations off the book so we can grow this economy . ''\nThey included a rule meant to protect streams from pollution , which opponents argued hurt the coal industry ; and a rule requiring financial advisers to put consumers ' best interests ahead of their own , which critics said would hurt retirees .\nRounding out the 28 laws , three modify existing programs and two encourage agencies to try something new .\nBut in the realm of legislation , 100 days is a short period of time . Significant bills take a long time to complete , often measured in years rather than days .\nPresident George W. Bush 's first tax cut and No Child Left Behind initiative did n't pass in the first 100 days . The Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank financial industry regulations did n't become law in President Barack Obama 's first 100 days either , though he and Congress did pass a nearly $ 800 billion stimulus bill . Other than that , Obama signed several program re-authorizations , the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act ( that had been in the works in the previous Congress ) and a bill naming a post office .\nTime frame aside , Trump learned with the health care bill he hoped to pass and sign weeks ago that having the president 's party control both the House and the Senate does n't guarantee the numbers needed for priorities to breeze through .\n`` President Obama faced a lot of the same problems , '' Panetta noted .\nPanetta said Trump will be judged on whether he can put together a working coalition , which will most likely require reaching across the aisle . Thus far Trump has tried to do everything with one-party rule \u2014 not even attempting to win Democratic votes ( not that they would have been forthcoming ) .\nIf this year ends and Trump has n't found a way to work with Congress and pass significant legislation like the health care bill or his tax plan , he wo n't be judged kindly .
