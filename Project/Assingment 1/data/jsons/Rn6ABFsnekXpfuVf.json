    "content": "Anyone who opposes same-sex marriage is wrong , says the \u201c gay mafia \u201d \u2014the term the liberal TV personality Bill Maher gave to homosexual activists who \u201c whack \u201d dissenters . According to them , same sex marriage is now not only a \u201c right , \u201d no one has the right to oppose it . This new right is so powerful it has completely wiped out the old rights that our founding fathers enshrined in our Constitution : freedom of religion , freedom of speech , freedom of association .\nBut we saw in the first column , same sex marriage is not really a right but a preference . Some call it a \u201c right \u201d but they are actually stealing the authority of rights from God and misapplying it to sexual behavior . They have invented a new moral \u201c right \u201d and are attempting to legislate acceptance of it on everyone else ( actually , they are trying to have their new morality imposed by liberal judges ) .\nNow , I \u2019 m sure you \u2019 ve heard , \u201c you can \u2019 t legislate morality. \u201d The truth is , all laws legislate morality . Morality is about right and wrong and all laws declare in a legal sense one behavior right and the opposite behavior wrong . So the question is not whether we can legislate morality , but \u201c Whose morality will we legislate ? \u201d\nMany don \u2019 t realize this because they lump morality and religion together . But laws can and do legislate morality without legislating religion . Few people in the political process are trying to tell others what church to go to or what religious rituals to observe . That would be legislating religion . But everyone is trying to tell others how to treat one another . That \u2019 s legislating morality . While religions may teach that people have certain moral rights ( like a right to life or property ) , you don \u2019 t need to be religious to know those rights or to support them . You need God to justify them , but not to legislate them .\nLiberals can \u2019 t justify why same-sex marriage is right . Nevertheless , they want to legislate it as a right and will convict you of heresy if you fail to bow to it . Florists , bakers , photographers , Internet CEOs and speakers like myself have all discovered personally that the people who say they are fighting for \u201c tolerance \u201d are often the most intolerant . In the name of \u201c inclusion and diversity , \u201d those of us who have a diverse view are being excluded because we don \u2019 t exhibit lock-step conformity to their intolerant agenda . We are being fired and fined for exercising our real God-given rights . How can this be ? We can \u2019 t work because of our political views\u2014views that are firmly rooted in the biological facts of nature . Is this still America ?\nAt least one advocate of same sex marriage has a real problem with this . Homosexual author Andrew Sullivan expressed revulsion for the intolerance gay activists expressed to former Mozilla CEO Brandon Eich , which ultimately forced his resignation . Sullivan wrote , \u201c The whole episode disgusts me \u2013 as it should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society . If this is the gay rights movement today \u2013 hounding our opponents with a fanaticism more like the religious right than anyone else \u2013 then count me out . If we are about intimidating the free speech of others , we are no better than the anti-gay bullies who came before us. \u201d ( Maybe Sullivan is speaking of another time , but most \u201c religious right \u201d people I know are tolerant\u2014they would never usurp the free speech or freedom of association rights of those with whom they disagree . )\nAs headlines nearly every day affirm , there \u2019 s a growing clash between real rights and the new invented right of same sex marriage . Can anyone see any middle ground between 1 ) you must celebrate my same sex marriage , and 2 ) God or my conscience prevents me from doing so ? There is none . So which \u201c right \u201d will take precedence : the real right or the invented right ?\nAccording to lesbian activist Chai Feldbaum , who was appointed by President Obama to the EEOC , it \u2019 s not the real right . Speaking about this inevitable conflict between homosexuality and religious liberty she said , \u201c I \u2019 m having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win . \u201d\nSo the true rights of freedom of religion , speech and association must give way to the invented right of same sex marriage . Your right to live Christianity , or any other faith , must give way to those who demand that you affirm their lifestyle . That isn \u2019 t tolerance . That \u2019 s totalitarianism . Conform or else !\nJesus loved sinners , which is why He wouldn \u2019 t affirm their sin . Neither can Christians . If we celebrate harmful behavior we are being unloving . Love requires we tell people the truth , even if it upsets them .\nIn fact , if you are upset with me for the thoughts I \u2019 ve expressed in these three columns , it means that in an important sense you agree with me . If you don \u2019 t like the behaviors and ideas I am advocating here , you are admitting that all behaviors and ideas are not equal\u2014that some are closer to the real objective moral truth than others . But what is the source of that objective moral truth ? As we saw in the first column , the source can \u2019 t be changeable you or me . It can only be God\u2014the author of Nature \u2019 s Law .\nSince no one can reasonably show that same sex marriage is a right according to Nature \u2019 s Law ( the only objective standard ) , the \u201c gay mafia \u201d resorts to the tactics of intimidation to silence and punish dissenters . They can \u2019 t win using sustained reason and arguments .
