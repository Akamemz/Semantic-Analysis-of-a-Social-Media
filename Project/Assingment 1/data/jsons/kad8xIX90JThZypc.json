Cory Booker listen at the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami , Fla. , June 26 , 2019 . ( Mike Segar/Reuters )\nMiami \u2014 It was supposed to be Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s night to shine , but it didn \u2019 t quite work out that way . Now in third place behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in the national polls , Warren was the only candidate on stage Wednesday night polling in the double digits ( with her Democratic rivals registering somewhere between 0.4 percent and 3.3 percent ) . Nevertheless , both Cory Booker and Beto O \u2019 Rourke persisted in speaking more than Warren during the debate . Many more viewers were googling Booker \u2019 s name than Warren \u2019 s .\nThat \u2019 s not to say that Warren had a bad night .

She went after Big Tech and gave a forthright defense of abolishing private insurance and replacing it with a government plan . \u201c Yes , I \u2019 m with Bernie on Medicare for All , \u201d she said . Her defense of abolishing private insurance gave heartburn to some liberals worried about how it will play in a general election . \u201c I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years , \u201d Amy Klobuchar said at the debate . But Warren \u2019 s stance will probably help her continue eat into Bernie Sanders \u2019 s base in the primary .\nYet at other times Warren didn \u2019 t seem like quite so bold of a progressive . She dodged a question from moderator Chuck Todd about whether the federal government should do anything more than pass an assault-weapons ban to confiscate guns . \u201c Treat it like a serious research problem , \u201d Warren said after Todd pointed out she didn \u2019 t answer the question .\nThe most surprising thing to happen at Wednesday \u2019 s debate was that Warren was asked a simple but challenging question about abortion .
