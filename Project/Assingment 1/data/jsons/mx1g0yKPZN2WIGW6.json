    "content": "In the years before the Boston Marathon bombings , Tamerlan Tsarnaev fell under the influence of a new friend , a Muslim convert who steered the religiously apathetic young man toward a strict strain of Islam , family members said .\nUnder the tutelage of a friend known to the Tsarnaev family only as Misha , Tamerlan gave up boxing and stopped studying music , his family said . He began opposing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . He turned to websites and literature claiming that the CIA was behind the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , and Jews controlled the world .\n`` Somehow , he just took his brain , '' said Tamerlan 's uncle , Ruslan Tsarni , who recalled conversations with Tamerlan 's worried father about Misha 's influence . Efforts over several days by The Associated Press to identify and interview Misha have been unsuccessful .\nTamerlan 's relationship with Misha could be a clue in understanding the motives behind his religious transformation and , ultimately , the attack itself . Two U.S. officials say he had no tie to terrorist groups .\nThroughout his religious makeover , Tamerlan maintained a strong influence over his siblings , including Dzhokhar , who investigators say carried out the deadly attack by his older brother 's side , killing three and injuring 264 people .\n`` They all loved Tamerlan . He was the eldest one and he , in many ways , was the role model for his sisters and his brother , '' said Elmirza Khozhugov , 26 , the ex-husband of Tamerlan 's sister , Ailina . `` You could always hear his younger brother and sisters say , 'Tamerlan said this , ' and 'Tamerlan said that . ' Dzhokhar loved him . He would do whatever Tamerlan would say .\n`` Even my ex-wife loved him so much and respected him so much , '' said Khozhugov . `` I 'd have arguments with her and if Tamerlan took my side , she would agree : 'OK , if Tamerlan said it . ' ''\nKhozhugov said he was close to Tamaran when he was married and they kept in touch for a while but drifted apart in the past two years or so . He spoke to the AP from his home in Almaty , Kazakhstan . A family member in the United States provided the contact information .\nTamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a police shootout Friday . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged Monday with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill , and he could face the death penalty if convicted .\n`` Of course I was shocked and surprised that he was Suspect No . 1 , '' Khozhugov said , recalling the days after the bombing when the FBI identified Tamerlan as the primary suspect . `` But after a few hours of thinking about it , I thought it could be possible that he did it . ''\nBased on preliminary written interviews with Dzhokar in his hospital bed , U.S. officials believe the brothers were motivated by their religious views . It has not been clear , however , what those views were .\nAs authorities try to piece together that information , they are touching on a question asked after so many terrorist plots : What turns someone into a terrorist ?\nThe brothers emigrated in 2002 or 2003 from Dagestan , a Russian republic that has become an epicenter of the Islamic insurgency that spilled over from the region of Chechnya .\nThey were raised in a home that followed Sunni Islam , the religion 's largest sect . They were not regulars at the mosque and rarely discussed religion , Khozhugov said .\nThen , in 2008 or 2009 , Tamerlan met Misha , a slightly older , heavyset bald man with a long reddish beard . Khozhugov did n't know where they 'd met but believed they attended a Boston-area mosque together . Misha was an Armenian native and a convert to Islam and quickly began influencing his new friend , family members said .\nOnce , Khozhugov said , Misha came to the family home outside Boston and sat in the kitchen , chatting with Tamerlan for hours .\n`` Misha was telling him what is Islam , what is good in Islam , what is bad in Islam , '' said Khozhugov , who said he was present for the conversation . `` This is the best religion and that 's it . Mohammed said this and Mohammed said that . ''\nThe conversation continued until Tamerlan 's father , Anzor , came home from work .\n`` It was late , like midnight , '' Khozhugov said . `` His father comes in and says , 'Why is Misha here so late and still in our house ?

It upset his father because Tamerlan would n't listen to him as much , '' Khozhugov said . `` He would listen to this guy from the mosque who was preaching to him . ''\nAnzor became so concerned that he called his brother , worried about Misha 's effects .\n`` I heard about nobody else but this convert , '' Tsarni said . `` The seed for changing his views was planted right there in Cambridge .
