    "content": "The federal government has a \u201c powerful interest \u201d in a single , uniform definition of marriage , even if it excludes gay unions that are legal in individual states , the lawyer defending the federal Defense of Marriage Act said Wednesday as the Supreme Court concluded two days of landmark arguments on gay marriage .\nBut Paul D. Clement , hired by the House of Representatives to argue for DOMA after the Obama administration refused to do so , faced often skeptical questions from the justices in nearly two hours of arguments centering on the clash between the law \u2019 s traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman and a growing number of states that now sanction gay unions .\nThe justices , in particular key swing vote Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , seemed to be struggling with the impact that DOMA had in an area traditionally reserved for the states . As several justices noted , the DOMA statute affects more than 1,100 federal laws , programs , taxes and benefits that differ for married and single people .\nThe broad sweep of DOMA \u201c in our society means that the federal government is intertwined with citizens \u2019 day-to-day life , \u201d Justice Kennedy said . This puts the federal law \u201c at real risk of running in conflict with what was always thought to be the essence of state police power , which is to regulate marriage , divorce , custody . \u201d\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg added that for the federal government to tell legally married , same-sex couples they \u2019 re ineligible to file a joint tax return , take marital deduction or have surviving-spouse Social Security benefits , \u201c One might well ask , what kind of marriage is this ? \u201d The result , she said , would be \u201c two kinds of marriage : the full marriage and then this sort of skim-milk marriage . \u201d\nBut as with Tuesday \u2019 s equally dramatic arguments over California \u2019 s Proposition 8 statute that bans gay marriage , the justices gave no clear indication of how they would rule on these gay marriage cases . And as in Tuesday \u2019 s arguments , the justices spent a considerable amount of time considering legal off-ramps that would allow them not to decide the cases , or to issue a far less sweeping ruling than many gay marriage advocates had hoped .\nSEE ALSO : LATEST UPDATES : Supreme Court weighs gay marriage , DOMA on second day\nThe justices are expected to issue their rulings by June .\nThe session again inspired colorful , sign-filled demonstrations for and against gay marriage on the plaza outside the Supreme Court building .\nAlexandria lawyer Jim McDonald said he would not oppose civil unions for same-sex couples , but not marriage : \u201c I think whatever my wife and I are doing is not the same to what a homosexual couple does , whether they were involved in a wedding or not . I don \u2019 t think the word marriage is appropriate for the coupling of people of the same sex . \u201d\nBut Dalton Collins , a gay rights activist studying law at the University of the District of Columbia , argued that \u201c every American deserves to be treated equally under the law . \u2026 Justice is supposed to be blind . \u201d\nWednesday \u2019 s case , United States v. Edith Windsor , revolves around an estate tax bill levied by the IRS against Ms. Windsor , now 83 , after the death of her lesbian partner . Ms. Windsor was forced to pay $ 363,000 in federal estate taxes because the government would not recognize her 2007 Canadian marriage to her late partner , Thea Spyer .\nMr. Clement said rationale behind the traditional marriage definition approved overwhelmingly by Congress and signed by President Clinton was \u201c all it has ever purported to be \u201d \u2014 a definitional provision .\n\u201c When Congress passed every one of the 1,100 statutes affected by DOMA \u2019 s definition , the Congress that was passing that statute had in mind the traditional definition , \u201d he said .\nDOMA tells states \u201c we \u2019 re going to stick with what we \u2019 ve always had , which is traditional definition \u201d of marriage , he said . \u201c No state loses any benefits by recognizing same-sex marriage . Things stay the same . \u201d\nBut it appeared that at least five justices \u2014 Justice Kennedy and the court \u2019 s four more liberal members \u2014 had great difficulty accepting Mr. Clement \u2019 s line of reasoning , even as nine states and the District of Columbia have now legalized same-sex marriage .\n\u201c What gives the federal government the right to be concerned at all with what the definition of marriage is ? \u201d asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor .\nAnother issue explored by justices was the \u201c sea change \u201d in the popular attitudes about gay marriage since 1996 , and whether that was the result of the \u201c political effectiveness \u201d of gay-rights advocates .\nAttorney Roberta Kaplan , representing Ms. Windsor , downplayed the influence of advocates . The nation \u2019 s sea change on gay marriage is due to a \u201c societal understanding \u201d that came from places beyond political power of gay people , she said .\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was skeptical : \u201c As far as I can tell , political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case . \u201d\nThe political-power question is important because one of the tests to give sexual orientation a heightened level of scrutiny is that the group is politically powerless .\nThe impetus for DOMA \u2014 especially the extent of \u201c moral disapproval \u201d noted in a 1996 House report accompanying its debate on the measure \u2014 was also examined .\n\u201c Is that what happened in 1996 ? \u201d Justice Elena Kagan pointedly asked Mr. Clement .\nSuch language appears in the House report , he replied , \u201c and if that \u2019 s enough to invalidate the statute , then you should invalidate the statute . But that has never been your approach . \u201d\nMs. Kaplan agreed that \u201c moral disapproval \u201d was a factor in the 1996 vote \u2014 DOMA \u201c was enacted to defend against the marriages of gay people , \u201d she said . But when asked by Chief Justice Roberts if she believed that 84 senators who voted for DOMA based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people , she softened her response . \u201c I \u2019 m not saying it was animus or bigotry ; I think it was based on a misunderstanding of gay people . \u201d\nEarlier in the session , the court queried Mr. Clement and two other attorneys on whether the Windsor case was properly before them , and whether the House of Representatives had legal \u201c standing \u201d to defend DOMA in light of the Obama administration \u2019 s refusal to do so .\nMr. Clement argued that the House has historically had the ability to defend its laws , especially when the executive branch declines to do so .\nBut court-invited amicus Harvard Law School professor Vicki C. Jackson said the House of Representatives had no \u201c injury , \u201d and the Obama administration wasn \u2019 t asking the court to redress any injuries either . \u201c There is no justiciable case before this court , \u201d said Ms. Jackson , adding that it should \u201c await another case , another day to decide this question . \u201d\nDeputy Solicitor General Sri Srinivasan , arguing for the administration , said the high court should issue a ruling on DOMA , and that there is precedent for the executive branch to not defend a law even while it was enforcing it . But Chief Justice Roberts challenged that line of argument , saying the high court was being asked to do something \u201c totally unprecedented . \u201d\nJustice Kennedy also objected , saying , \u201c I \u2019 m wondering if we are living in this new world where the attorney general can simply decide , \u2018 Yeah , it \u2019 s unconstitutional , but it \u2019 s not so unconstitutional that I \u2019 m not willing to enforce it . \u2019 \u201d\nAfter Wednesday \u2019 s session , Ms. Windsor told reporters she thought the arguments over her case \u201c went beautifully . \u201d\nThe justices took the case \u201c very seriously , \u201d she said , adding that the session was a \u201c spectacular event for my life . \u201d\nMs. Kaplan said she was \u201c hopeful \u201d following the oral arguments , and expressed skepticism that \u2014 as many legal observers have speculated \u2014 the high court might avoid a sweeping decision .\nThe court \u201c has an obligation to decide \u201d such momentous legal and social questions , Ms. Kaplan told reporters , adding she did not see evidence in the questioning that the justices were shying away from a decision .\nMr. Clement did not talk to reporters after the arguments .\nMs. Windsor repeatedly remarked on the significance of the day , noting that she still had not publicly revealed her sexuality when she married her late partner .\n\u201c I \u2019 m talking to you guys freely , \u201d she told reporters . \u201c I \u2019 d have been hiding in the closet 10 years ago . \u201d",
