And they \u2019 ve managed to grow despite that . \u201d\nThat growth shows up particularly in the NRA \u2019 s claims of membership . Wayne LaPierre , who as the group \u2019 s executive vice president and CEO has long served as the public face of the group , boasted this week that membership rolls have swelled to almost 5.5 million \u2014 the largest in its history .\nStill , the group created shock waves when it filed a lawsuit this month against Ackerman McQueen , its longtime advertising firm , which the NRA accuses of withholding documents .\nThe lawsuit says the NRA \u2019 s aggregate payments to the firm and Mercury Group , a subsidiary , totaled nearly $ 40 million annually by 2017 . Now the NRA says the firm is refusing to turn over financial documents that the group says it needs to comply with its legal obligations .\nAckerman McQueen disputed the charges and called the NRA \u2019 s action \u201c frivolous , inaccurate and intended to cause harm to the reputation of our company and the future of [ a ] 38-year relationship . \u201d\nAckerman was a major force behind the iconic \u201c I \u2019 m the NRA \u201d campaign from the early 1980s that helped bolster the group \u2019 s image as a major political and cultural force .\nMore recently , it has been involved with NRATV , a streaming channel that showcases personalities such as NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch but has faced internal questions about its long-term value .\nThe firm has done some \u201c great work \u201d over the years and \u201c no one \u2019 s suggesting otherwise , \u201d said Richard Feldman , a former NRA regional political director who broke with the group \u2019 s leadership in the past but remains a longtime member .\n\u201c I think the problem is that when you have an ad agency in-house , you have an immediate and constant conflict of interest , \u201d he said . \u201c How can you be paying an ad agency $ 40 million and you \u2019 re going broke ? \u201d\nA person familiar with the inner workings of the group said things aren \u2019 t that gloomy . The person said that with some cost-savings measures under its belt , the NRA is poised to meet its financial expectations for the first quarter of 2019 .\n\u201c If we stay on track , we \u2019 ll be in good shape \u00ad\u2014 we \u2019 ll recover , \u201d the person said . \u201c We \u2019 ve been through this kind of thing before , where we went into presidential election years , general election years where we have to spend an awful lot of money , and Wayne has worked tirelessly to recoup that money and he \u2019 s doing it again . \u201d\nThe NRA also has been fending off congressional scrutiny from Democrats who have suggested links to Russia during the 2016 campaign .\nThat scrutiny was fueled by Maria Butina , a Russian who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to influence U.S. politics .
