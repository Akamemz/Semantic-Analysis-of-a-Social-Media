    "content": "President Obama is facing intense criticism for admitting Thursday `` we do n't have a strategy yet '' for dealing with Islamic State militants in Syria , despite warnings from top military advisers and others that the group must be confronted on that side of the border .\nThe president made the comment during a briefing with reporters in which he overtly played down the prospect of any imminent military action in Syria . He tried to temper speculation that he was about to roll out a `` full scale '' strategy , one that might expand the current , limited airstrike campaign in northern Iraq .\n`` I do n't want to put the cart before the horse . We do n't have a strategy yet , '' Obama said .\nAs the White House later clarified , he was talking specifically about a military strategy for Syria . But Republican critics pointed out that the ISIS presence in Syria has been festering for a long time , and is only growing in strength .\nSen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , one of the toughest critics in Congress of the administration 's Middle East policies , tweeted the president 's quote with a reminder : `` # ISIS is largest , richest terrorist group in history & 192,000 dead in # Syria . ''\nKarl Rove , Fox News analyst and former George W. Bush administration adviser , said he was `` appalled '' by the president 's comment .\n`` He was warned about the role that ISIS was playing inside Syria , and he has had all that time to develop a strategy about what to do about ISIS in Syria and he still does n't , '' Rove told Fox News .\nRep.

The administration is clear that they have a strategy for Iraq -- which , for now , involves limited airstrikes and humanitarian missions -- and are working on one for Syria .\nFollowing a late afternoon meeting of the National Security Council , the White House put out a statement saying they discussed `` our comprehensive strategy to counter the threat posed by ISIL in Iraq and Syria . ''\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest also tweeted , amid criticism of the president 's comment : `` In his remarks today , POTUS was explicit -- as he has been in the past -- about the comprehensive strategy we 'll use to confront ISIL threat . ''\nEarnest said Friday , when pressed on the president 's remarks , that `` I think the president was pretty explicit that he is determined to make sure that every element of his national security strategy is thought through .
