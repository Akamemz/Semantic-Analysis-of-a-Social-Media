The story is clearly meant to further the \u201c Trump colluded with Russia \u201d narrative the media has pushed for months , although it \u2019 s as yet totally unsubstantiated .\nTheNYT lead builds an atmosphere of wrongdoing around Trump and his campaign aides using important sounding buzzwords and phrases . \u201c Spies \u201d and \u201c revealing \u201d information and big-time Russian officials who \u201c exert influence. \u201d It \u2019 s quite official sounding and obviously intended to sow suspicion .\nBut the ( few ) readers who make it to the fifth paragraph and are paying attention will realize there \u2019 s not actually much meat to the report . That paragraph hedges on the information collected by the spies , and notes the reporter has no real clue whether Russian officials actually made any attempt to influence the Trump aides in question . Oh yeah and the Trump campaign as well as both aides have consistently denied the longstanding accusations of collusion with Russia .\n\u201c The information collected last summer was considered credible enough for intelligence agencies to pass to the F.B.I. , which during that period opened a counterintelligence investigation that is ongoing , \u201d the paragraph reads . \u201c It is unclear , however , whether Russian officials actually tried to directly influence Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn . Both have denied any collusion with the Russian government on the campaign to disrupt the election . \u201d\nWhat this report really boils down to is the \u201c revelation \u201d that senior Russian officials are interested in influencing important U.S. actors , and that American spies are mostly sure they had a conversation about it . Maybe newsworthy , but hardly a bombshell .\nA buried explanatory paragraph that deflates the lead is a constant in report after report on the Russia collusion narrative .\nWhen The New York Times reported the FBI was investigating collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia , it was not until the tenth paragraph readers were informed of an important fact : \u201c American officials have said that they have so far found no proof of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia . \u201d\nBut the report adds there is evidence Trump \u2019 s associates were in \u201c repeated contact \u201d with people linked to Russian intelligence officials .\nSome months later Reuters dropped an important sounding report on some of those contacts .
