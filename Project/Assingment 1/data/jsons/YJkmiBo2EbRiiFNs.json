    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Forget the first 100 days . It 's only been a week and Donald Trump is reinventing the presidency .\nAmid a torrent of action , disruption and protest , the new President 's moves on trade , immigration and foreign policy have honored his campaign promises -- and dramatically reshaped Washington 's role in national and global affairs .\nSome things are clear at the end of this jarring week . Trump wo n't have an epiphany and suddenly embrace Beltway conventions . As president , he will keep conjuring his own reality and is happy to use the backdrop of the White House to advance his many rhetorical wars .\nHis staff is learning how to work together as they jockey for power . And amid it all , Trump still manages to surprise : Lawmakers and business leaders say the larger than life president and former reality show star listens more than he talks .\nBut his unorthodox style is also raising questions about whether a presidency built on creative destruction will simply exhaust the political system . Trump 's conveyer belt of executive orders is an effective symbolic device , but they are noticeably lacking in details and actionable plans . Sooner or later , he will have to show proficiency in the harder task of shepherding his agenda through Congress .\nTrump 's first week in office leaves one fundamental question in its wake : Can he successfully govern a complicated and divided country without bringing his erratic behavior under control ? For now , there is no answer .\nTrump is making no secret of his top priority : Pay back the disgruntled voters who sent him to Washington to blow things up .\n`` Think of everything we can achieve and remember who we must achieve it for , '' Trump told Republican lawmakers Thursday in Philadelphia . `` Now we have to deliver . Enough all talk , no action . We have to deliver . ''\nTrump signs an executive order to withdraw the US from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact .\nHe also hauled business and auto executives into the West Wing and warned they will pay a heavy price for manufacturing abroad . With another sweep of his pen , Trump moved forward trans continental oil pipelines and smashed Obama-era environmental regulations .\nEvery new administration makes splashy executive actions aimed at appealing to the base . Former President Barack Obama quickly signed an order in 2009 ordering the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility -- something that never fully became reality .\nJUST WATCHED Executive orders : one thing you need to know Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Executive orders : one thing you need to know 00:53\nBut the determination to keep campaign promises is verging on an obsession inside the Trump White House . Those close to the President believe that despite the uproar in Washington , the actions are being well received .\n`` If you are somebody sitting at home , you say , 'Wow , there 's a lot going on here . ' The media bubbles on the coast are not the people Trump is talking to , '' said a senior aide . `` The people that Donald Trump is talking to are the thousands of counties that he won . ''\nBut Trump is n't dispensing with the Washington game entirely . He spent considerable time with congressional leaders this week , a big departure from Obama , who once joked to journalists who criticized his reluctance to socialize with top Republicans : `` Why do n't you get a drink with Mitch McConnell ? ''\nIt took one day for Trump to shatter the norms of presidential behavior .\nOn Saturday , his first full day in office , Trump caused offense by boasting about his election win against the somber backdrop of the CIA 's wall honoring fallen heroes . ( He later told ABC News the speech was a `` home run . '' )\nThe day ended with the new administration escalating a feud with the media over the size of Trump 's inauguration crowd .\nTrump sent his press secretary , Sean Spicer , out to deliver an extraordinarily explosive statement about the episode packed with untruths .\nOver the course of the week , Trump tweeted castigations of `` celebs , '' apparently piqued that a massive women 's march last weekend drew more people than his own inauguration . He accused an academic researcher of `` groveling '' after he said Trump misrepresented his study by claiming that up to five million people voted illegally in the election .\nTrump 's ego is the common denominator in all these eruptions . The first week of his presidency has proven the ultra sensitivity to criticism he displayed on the campaign trail has carried over to the White House . In each case , the facts in question also clash with the version of reality that Trump prefers .\n`` He feels vulnerable when other people have access to facts and when he can be measured against something objective , '' said Michael D'Antonio , author of the recent book `` The Truth About Trump . '' `` His favorite thing is to game a system or defy a norm and if he ca n't do that , he does n't feel as powerful . ''\nAfter his highly criticized statement at the CIA , Trump 's more measured performance early in the week sparked hopes that the initial storm had passed .\n`` He looked like a president today , '' one Republican close to the White House said on Monday as Trump pulled out of trade deals , met with executives and watched as Spicer delivered a far more measured press briefing . `` Let 's hope it lasts . ''\nBy mid-week , Trump revived debunked claims that millions of illegal voters cost him the popular vote during a meeting with congressional leaders . He 's now pushing to spend taxpayer cash on an investigation into nonexistent allegations of wrongdoing , suggesting an open and public contempt for facts rarely seen from a White House .\nStill , those who hope against hope that Trump 's more extreme instincts will be mollified by the responsibilities of his office might take succor from his clear pleasure at the trappings of the White House and Air Force One .\n`` He continues to react the same way he has throughout his time in his presidency , in awe of the splendor of this plane and what the White House represents , '' Spicer told reporters during Trump 's first ride on the presidential jet .\nCount this as another campaign promise Trump has lived up to : Being unpredictable . Washington now braces early each morning for the first blast from Trump 's Twitter account .\nA series of tweets by Trump about street violence in Chicago showed how he is changing the way the presidency interacts with the American people .\n`` If Chicago does n't fix the horrible 'carnage ' going on , 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings ( up 24 % from 2016 ) , I will send in the Feds ! '' Trump tweeted on Tuesday .\nThe tweet caused uproar in Chicago , sending law enforcement and local political officials scrambling to work out what Trump meant . Was he planning federal funds for Chicago , to deploy the FBI or even taking the highly unusual step of sending the National Guard on a law enforcement mission ? Should his warning be taken seriously or was it simply a throw away tweet that represented a whim not a new policy ?\nJUST WATCHED Mayor Rahm Emanuel : You are welcome in Chicago Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mayor Rahm Emanuel : You are welcome in Chicago 01:23\n`` I would welcome , always have , welcome federal participation in working with local law enforcement to dealing with guns and gangs , '' Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel responded .\nIn other administrations , such an explosive intervention would only have come after serious internal debate . Temperatures would have been taken locally .\nHis approach is sparking questions not just in Washington but in foreign ministries abroad , which are already trying to work out exactly what to make of Trump 's idiosyncratic and unilateral tweets on key national security issues .\nThe business chieftains left the West Wing fearing new tariffs that could hurt their bottom lines . Democrats were put in a tough spot by his destruction of the TPP and vow to renegotiate NAFTA , moves that fall in line with much of the party 's progressive base . In a sign of how he is scrambling political calculations , the AFL-CIO , which backed Hillary Clinton last fall , welcomed Trump 's moves .\nThose who see Trump 's ignition of controversies as a distraction from the real work of governing miss the point -- his behavior is an intrinsic part of his method . Trump is leaving rival centers of power uncertain about his motives and unsure of his red lines , putting everyone off balance and increasing his own influence as the only stable force in the chaos .\nThe first week of the Trump administration tested one of the biggest questions about his presidency : How will his disruptive , impulsive political style play out in foreign relations ?\nJUST WATCHED Mexico 's president : We will not pay for wall Replay More Videos ...

The foreign policy establishment in Washington is dreading the first serious national security crisis and worrying that Trump 's unpredictability and rash rhetoric could lead to miscalculations .\nTrump 's policy track is also causing alarm . His musings about a return to waterboarding for terror suspects has sparked widespread condemnation and marked a break with some defense and national security figures in his own Cabinet .\nIsrael , however , is wasting no time in seizing on Trump 's arrival , announcing the construction of 2,500 new homes in West Bank settlements .
