    "content": "Most people imprisoned in Nepal for wildlife crime share two things in common : they did not understand the seriousness of their offense , and they had little conception of how profoundly it would impact not only their lives but also the lives of their families . In interviews with more than 100 people convicted of illegally killing or trapping wildlife , researchers found some lost their businesses and land following their imprisonment . A dozen men \u2019 s wives left them . Many respondents \u2019 children had to drop out of school , and family members of some took jobs in other countries to survive . One man \u2019 s daughter found herself unable to marry because of the stigma of his crime , and another said his mother committed suicide out of shame .\n\u201c People really underestimate the risk of getting arrested and all of the social harm that comes from that punishment , \u201d says Kumar Paudel , who led the research and is co-founder and director of Greenhood Nepal , a science-driven nonprofit organization that focuses on the human dimensions of conservation . He is also a graduate student in conservation leadership at the University of Cambridge .\nPaudel and his colleagues uncovered these gaps in awareness of the punishments for poaching as part of an effort to better understand the motivations of , and impacts on , the people who are arrested and prosecuted for wildlife crime . Such information is critical for designing effective deterrent strategies yet is often lacking , despite the hundreds of millions of dollars governments and nonprofits have poured into combatting the illegal wildlife trade worldwide .\nThe researchers also took their findings , published Friday in Conservation Science and Practice , a step further : they teamed up with a well-known local musician to create awareness-raising songs that share key messages from their study . They hope this effort will ultimately benefit both people and wildlife . \u201c I don \u2019 t think scientists should wait for decision makers to come and read their paper , \u201d Paudel says . \u201c They should find ways to inform policy and undertake conservation interventions on the ground . \u201d\nPrakash Gandharva performing \u201c Ban Ko Katha \u201d at Bharatpur , Chitwan , Nepal .

Nearly 7,000 military personnel patrol the country \u2019 s protected areas , and wildlife-crime-related arrests increased more than eightfold between 2009 and 2014 . Official data now report around 2,000 such arrests annually , and these efforts do seem to be helping . Nepal celebrated zero rhino poaching for the first time in 2011 and has repeated that achievement several times since . Yet the possible social harms of the nation \u2019 s militarized conservation approach have gone unexplored . \u201c This is a country that \u2019 s going full force , but we don \u2019 t know who they \u2019 re going full force against , \u201d says Jacob Phelps , an environmental social scientist at Lancaster University in England and senior author of the new study .\nPaudel , who has worked in conservation in his native Nepal since 2010 , wanted to tackle this question to help develop targeted , fairer ways to combat poaching .

Most respondents were from poor backgrounds , but surprisingly , nearly 90 percent of them said they resorted to breaking the law to make some extra money\u2014not to meet basic economic and nutritional needs . \u201c A really popular narrative in conservation is that poor people poach , but this overlooks other motivations by just blaming poverty , \u201d Paudel says . A lack of awareness also factored in the decision to do so , he found . More than 90 percent of the interviewees said they knew wildlife poaching and trade were illegal , but just 30 percent understood the steep penalties involved , such as the possibility of a five- to 15-year prison sentence . Nearly half of the respondents said their imprisonment had negatively impacted their families \u2019 livelihood , their children \u2019 s education or both .\nCommunities near protected areas have been particularly affected . For example , more than 20 percent of inmates in one prison near Chitwan National Park were jailed for wildlife crime , compared with about 3 percent of Nepal \u2019 s total prison population . \u201c That \u2019 s mind-boggling , especially if you consider that many people are from the same communities that were originally expropriated \u201d from their land to make way for the park , Phelps says . \u201c We \u2019 re hitting them twice . That \u2019 s a huge social cost . \u201d\nBasudev Dhungana , who lives near Chitwan and is former chair of the Mrigakunja Bufferzone User Committee ( which works with communities to use park revenue for local development ) , says he has seen firsthand the impacts described in the study .
