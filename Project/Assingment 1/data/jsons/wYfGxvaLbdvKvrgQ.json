His eyes and voice lit up with excitement as he promised to \u201c hit the ground running \u201d and \u201c to go big , to go bold . \u201d\nOver in the Senate , Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell was also cheery , in his taciturn sort of way . The Kentuckian is looking forward to working with a President Trump on a Supreme Court nominee , tax reform , and border security .\nBut he threw out this caution in answer to a reporter \u2019 s question about the early Obama administration \u2019 s unilateral moves on issues such as health care : Don \u2019 t overreach , or you may face electoral defeat , as President Obama did when Republicans took over the House in 2010 .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s always a mistake to misread your mandate . And frequently , new majorities think it \u2019 s going to be forever , \u201d Senator McConnell said . Republicans have been given a temporary lease on power , with the next election only two years away . Americans want results , he said , and to get those in the Senate \u2013 where a 60-vote threshold is now the norm to pass any major legislation \u2013 some Democratic cooperation will be needed .\n\u201c We are going to be looking for bipartisan support , \u201d he said .\nThe president-elect can come to Capitol Hill , as he did on Thursday , and sing in harmony with the GOP leadership about his priorities : jobs , immigration , repealing Obamacare , and taxes . But implementing the details of any plans will require coalition building \u2013 within the GOP , and with Democrats . That \u2019 s where the \u201c pragmatists \u201d in both parties in Congress ( they don \u2019 t always fit the \u201c moderate \u201d label ) will have an important role to play . They can act as bridge-builders but also as a check on the new administration .\nWith the Senate having lost two Republicans , giving them a narrower 52-48 margin , McConnell will have to win over more Democrats to overcome any threatened filibusters , points out Sen. Susan Collins ( R ) of Maine , one of several congressional pragmatists interviewed by the Monitor since the election .\n\u201c I believe that the majority leader was trying to dampen expectations somewhat because the legislative process is still like making sausage , and we still have to go through the deliberative process , which is neither easy nor quick even when one party is in control of the White House and the legislative branch , \u201d says Senator Collins , who wrote in Paul Ryan \u2019 s name for president on Election Day .\nThe senator says that in her talks with other Republicans , there is some concern that Americans will expect that absent divided government , Congress will now be able to immediately pass a wide range of reforms \u201c and fix all that is wrong , quickly . \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s going to take \u201c some time \u201d do something like tax reform , even if there \u2019 s broad agreement on the goals of a fairer , simpler , pro-growth tax code , she adds . \u201c That \u2019 s an enormously complex issue. \u201d She suggests starting with something that has bipartisan support \u2013 infrastructure .\nTrue , Trump doesn \u2019 t need Congress to carry out all of his promises . For instance , he can simply not push the negotiated Pacific trade deal , strike President Obama \u2019 s executive order granting deportation relief for children of illegal immigrants , and undo regulations relating to climate change . He can , and is expected to , significantly reshape the Justice Department and other government agencies .\nAnd the new administration will have an easier time getting confirmation for judges and agency appointees , since retiring Democratic minority leader Harry Reid ( D ) of Nevada struck the blocking filibuster procedure for all executive nominees except the Supreme Court .\nWhether the filibuster will eventually disappear for Supreme Court nominees is still unclear . McConnell wouldn \u2019 t speculate on the subject when asked at his press conference on Wednesday , and said simply that the nomination will be approached the way it is \u201c typically handled. \u201d He added that he \u201c would not anticipate any particular strategy \u201d in the way Democrats may seek to block an appointment or Republicans might react .\nOn a high GOP priority such as repealing the Affordable Care Act , Republicans can use a budget maneuver called \u201c reconciliation \u201d to gut the budget-related parts of the law and pass it with only a majority vote in both houses . Indeed , they did this last year , sun-setting the act \u2019 s subsidies and Medicaid expansion in 2017 , but President Obama vetoed it .\nWith a President Trump , they could quickly repeat the process , using an extended expiration time for the provisions to work out their replacement . But that replacement would likely need Democratic cooperation to pass the Senate \u2013 unless they use the reconciliation maneuver .\nDemocrats such as Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware \u2013 who worked on several bipartisan bills that became law this year \u2013 say they will stand their ground to defend their values and Americans \u2019 civil liberties , but they are ready to work with Republicans , including on the Affordable Care Act .\n\u201c If we found a way to move forward together \u2026 with a range of options at the state level that allowed those states that have embraced the ACA to continue , and allowed those that have fought it or where it doesn \u2019 t work well for them to achieve similar goals , that \u2019 s a constructive conversation we should be willing to have , \u201d he says .\nBut if Republicans are only trying to repeal without serious replacement , they will face a severe backlash from \u201c millions of angry Americans who will lose access to health care . \u201d\nSenator Collins anticipates \u201c a major rewrite \u201d of the law that retains the good parts , throws out the unworkable parts , and comes up with new approaches \u2013 including an option for states that like the law to stick with it .\nOver in the House , Speaker Ryan and his GOP colleagues have agreed on a series of priorities including repealing and replacing the ACA , tax reform , lifting people out of poverty , and strengthening the economy and national security .
