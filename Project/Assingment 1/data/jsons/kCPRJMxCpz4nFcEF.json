A car she was in with her mother and two other men went past a barricade set up by Black Lives Matter protesters , near the site of the police killing of Rayshard Brooks . Two people in the crowd of protesters opened fire on the car .\n`` They killed my baby because she crossed a barrier and made a U-turn ? '' Turner \u2019 s anguished father said . `` Black Lives Matter ? You killing your own . You killed an 8-year-old child . She ai n't did nothing to no one of y'all . She just wanted to get home to see her cousin . That 's all she wanted to do . ''\nThe question \u201c Do black lives matter ? \u201d demands to be answered \u2013 more specifically , do black lives matter to the media when the shootings don \u2019 t involve the police ?\nTurner was just one of six children ranging in age from 6 to 14 who died in shootings over the weekend . But those tragedies went far beyond the deaths of children . In Chicago , 75 people were shot and 15 died . Of course , Chicago has been known in recent years to have a severe problem with violence . Over several recent weekends , the number of shootings in the Windy City has topped 100 .\nBut the problems of deadly violence are spreading \u2013 New York City , America \u2019 s poster child for urban renewal , put up numbers over the weekend to rival Chicago \u2019 s : 64 shootings and 10 dead . A man was shot and killed in broad daylight in the Bronx , crossing the street while holding hands with his 9-year-old daughter . ( There \u2019 s even harrowing video footage of the incident . ) In the 25 largest metro areas across the country , homicides are up an alarming 16 % this year .\nTo put those numbers in comparison , American police killed nine unarmed black people all of last year . That may be nine too many , but the threat of being killed by cops pales in comparison to black people being the victims of crime .\nThe media do a fine job covering the grisly details of these shootings \u2013 see this CNN story on the children killed over the weekend or The New York Times coverage of the city \u2019 s recent gun violence \u2013 but that \u2019 s not nearly enough . The media have a couple of clear obligations : One , demand political accountability for the increase in deaths . Two , explore and report on meaningful solutions that could prevent more violence .\nOn the first point , venerable tabloid The New York Post came out swinging with a cover taking New York Mayor Bill de Blasio to task for the alarming increase in violence on his watch . The Post , however , is largely out of step with more liberal publications . The senior editor of The Daily Beast mocked the Post for its cover because even though murders in New York are up substantially , they \u2019 re still far below the murder rates 30 years ago . That \u2019 s a pretty low bar for de Blasio , and pretty blas\u00e9 attitude about murder .\nIt \u2019 s also revealing about journalistic priorities in the half-dozen years since \u201c black lives matter \u201d became a household phrase . \u201c It \u2019 s sort of striking how little actual reforming of policing has happened during this great reckoning , \u201d Vox editor Matt Yglesias recently observed . \u201c Between Ferguson and Floyd we had a bunch of great journalism on the subjects of how difficult it is to fire officers for misconduct , how often fired officers get reinstated , and how often non-reinstated officers bounce to new departments .
