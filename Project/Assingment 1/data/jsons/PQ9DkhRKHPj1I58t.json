Kennedy Jr. , who complained about `` the right-wing control of the American media , particularly starting with Fox News . '' During a discussion on HuffPost Live , Kennedy said , `` Ninety-five percent of talk radio in our country is right-wing ... so a whole section of our country that 's what they 're hearing . ''\n`` Twenty-two percent of Americans , '' continued Kennedy , `` say their primary news source is Fox News . It 's divided our country in a way that we have n't been divided probably since the Civil War , and it 's empowered these large corporations to get certain kinds of politicians and ideologues who are in the United States Congress elected -- the tea party ideologues who control the Republican Party . ''\nAdmittedly , many conservatives complain about the liberal media , but that 's because they hold themselves out as unbiased journalists when their reporting is flagrantly slanted in favor of Democrats .\nTheir bias is obvious in their selection of news stories , in their presentation of those stories , and in the contrasting treatment they accord politicians and policies of the respective political parties .\nConservative radio talkers generally do n't hold themselves out as unbiased journalists but as commentators , and they have every right to voice their opinions .\nFox News portrays itself as `` fair and balanced , '' and while many of its hosts are conservative , a fair number are liberal , and even on their commentary shows , they almost always have liberal representatives present the left 's position on issues they 're debating . Often , this is not the case with liberal networks .\nBut Kennedy 's worst error is n't in painting conservative talk radio and Fox News as unfairly biased while ignoring their far guiltier counterparts on the left . It 's in scapegoating conservative media for the divisiveness in this nation .\nThe nation is divided because half the country subscribes to one worldview and the other half to an opposite one . Perhaps it seems more divided than it used to because the liberal media no longer have a monopoly and the emergence of a robust alternative media has given conservatives a consistent public voice . It 's understandable that after enjoying decades of free rein , liberals are frustrated at having their views challenged daily on the public airways , but it 's healthy for the republic that leftist politicians are now scrutinized , as well .\nAstonishingly , however , Kennedy probably believes what he 's saying . Like many myopic liberals , he is blind to liberal media bias and intolerant of the opposing viewpoint . As a result of their arrogance and the cloistered echo-chambered environments they inhabit , most liberals do n't believe liberal journalists slant their reporting , but present the only reasonable take on the issues .\nTo them , it is not biased to denigrate the conservative viewpoint , because to them that viewpoint is aberrational . To them , for example , there are n't two sides to manmade global warming ; there is just the fact-based community and the deniers . To them , science-based intelligent design is , oddly , anti-science , whereas macroevolution , which ca n't begin to explain the formation of matter from nothing , much less life from non-life , is an incontrovertible fact .
