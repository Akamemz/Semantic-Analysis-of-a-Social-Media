But smashing that glass ceiling will depend on offering the US Senate a convincing explanation about her dark past .\nMore than a decade ago Haspel reportedly oversaw an infamous secret CIA prison in Thailand where a terrorism suspect , Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri , was waterboarded , a process that simulates drowning . She is also said to have drafted orders to destroy video evidence of such torture , which prompted a lengthy justice department investigation that ended without charges .\nWho is Gina Haspel ? Trump 's pick for CIA chief linked to torture site Read more\n\u201c It \u2019 s wonderful this president or any president wants to nominate a woman as head of the CIA \u2013 but not Gina Haspel , \u201d said John Kiriakou , a former CIA officer who has spoken out about waterboarding in the past . \u201c There must be 50 women across government who are qualified to fill the position. \u201d He said her alleged involvement in torture was \u201c disqualifying \u201d .\nAlthough Donald Trump has railed against former president George W Bush and his war on terror , his selection of Haspel has evoked the era that squandered America \u2019 s moral authority in many eyes : the rise of the security state , the indelible images of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghraib , the use of so-called \u201c enhanced interrogation \u201d techniques such as sleep deprivation and waterboarding , which many condemn as torture .\nTrump has a reputation for favouring outsiders , and claims to be \u201c draining the swamp \u201d of Washington , but in Haspel , 61 , he has made a highly conventional choice consistent with his predecessors . She joined the CIA in 1985 , when Ronald Reagan was president and the cold war still in progress , and has served in a number of undercover overseas posts , including as chief of the CIA \u2019 s station in London . The then CIA director , John Brennan , in 2013 named her deputy director of the National Clandestine Service , but she was denied a permanent promotion in the face of congressional opposition .\nIt is the time she reportedly spent supervising the secret \u201c black site \u201d prison in Thailand code-named \u201c Cat \u2019 s Eye \u201d that will concentrate minds at her Senate confirmation hearing , however . Dianne Feinstein , the Democrat who chaired the Senate intelligence committee when it produced a vast 2014 report describing the CIA \u2019 s harsh detention and interrogation programmes , on Thursday demanded the release of classified documents on past CIA interrogations .\nIn a letter to the outgoing CIA director , Mike Pompeo \u2013 Trump \u2019 s pick for secretary of state \u2013 and Haspel , Feinstein wrote : \u201c As we move forward with the nomination process for Ms Haspel , my fellow senators and I must have the complete picture of Ms Haspel \u2019 s involvement in the program in order to fully and fairly review her record and qualifications . I also believe the American people deserve to know the actual role the person nominated to be the director of the CIA played in what I consider to be one of the darkest chapters in American history . \u201d\nA handful of Democrats have already said they would oppose Haspel , while on Wednesday Senator Rand Paul became the first Republican to announce he would try to block her nomination .\nSenator John McCain , who was severely beaten as a prisoner during the Vietnam war , has also said Haspel must explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the interrogation programme , calling the torture of US detainees during the Bush era \u201c one of the darkest chapters in American history \u201d . Trump \u2019 s fellow Republicans control only a 51-49 majority in the chamber .\nBut Haspel received a boost on Thursday night when the ProPublica news website , cited by Paul and many media reports , issued a retraction . In 2017 it had published a report that said Haspel oversaw the clandestine base where the al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah was subjected to waterboarding and other coercive interrogation methods ; it also claimed that she gleefully mocked the prisoner \u2019 s suffering . \u201c Neither of these assertions is correct and we retract them , \u201d ProPublica acknowledged . \u201c It is now clear that Haspel did not take charge of the base until after the interrogation of Zubaydah ended . \u201d\nThe truth about torture : Trump \u2019 s CIA pick ca n't lead without facing her past Read more\nHowever , ProPublica \u2019 s correction does not completely get Haspel off the hook . The New York Times has reported that she arrived to run the black site prison in late October 2002 , after the interrogation of Zubaydah , but before the arrival of another al-Qaida suspect , Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri , who was , the paper writes , waterboarded three times on her watch . ProPublica also stood by its report that Haspel later drafted a cable ordering the destruction of videotapes of Zubaydah \u2019 s waterboarding , a claim confirmed by former acting director of the CIA Michael Morrell .\nPaul \u2019 s spokesman Doug Stafford said : \u201c Senator Rand Paul was quoting a Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter . Regardless of the retraction of one anecdote , the fact remains that Gina Haspel was instrumental in running a place where people were tortured . According to multiple published , undisputed accounts , she oversaw a black site and she further destroyed evidence of torture . This should preclude her from ever running the CIA . \u201d\nAfter she was named deputy CIA director in February last year , the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights asked German prosecutors to issue a warrant for her arrest over her alleged role in the interrogations . Federal prosecutors never issued the warrant because the case had no connection to Germany . But the rights group \u2019 s allegations against Haspel remain part of a preliminary investigation that German authorities could revive if they receive evidence that any of the parties have links to Germany .\nMark Fallon , a former chief investigator at the US defence department \u2019 s criminal investigation taskforce , said : \u201c To have a director of the CIA who is at risk of being arrested when she travels abroad is irresponsible . How do we then stand for a nation that supports the rule of law ? \u201d\nHe added : \u201c The fact that she had a hand in the destruction of black site videotapes \u2013 this is not the type of person you want in a position like that .
