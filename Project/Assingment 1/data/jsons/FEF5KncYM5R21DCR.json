A stronger economy means more revenue , which is what the president seeks , \u201d the Republican speaker said .\nA day after the election , leaders on all sides said the message they took from voters was that Congress and the White House must work together to find a solution to the tax increases and automatic spending cuts that are looming in early January .\n\u201c I know how to fight . I know how to dance . I don \u2019 t dance as well as I fight , but I \u2019 d much rather dance anytime , \u201d said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat who said he approached negotiations with an open mind and wouldn \u2019 t draw any lines in the sand .\nMr. Reid said he read Tuesday \u2019 s election as a mandate for raising taxes on the wealthy \u2014 something Mr. Obama ran on as a centerpiece of his campaign .\n\u201c Look at all the polling .

His own proposal relies on cutting out tax loopholes , which would bring in more revenue , then using that money to lower income tax rates for everyone . He argues that the resulting tax code would be better for economic growth , which he said would produce more money for the federal government in the long run .\nMissing from the public conversation Wednesday was Mr. Obama , who is once again the key player in negotiations . He placed private calls to Mr. Reid and Mr. Boehner , as well as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , in which he pleaded for a \u201c balanced \u201d approach to cutting the deficit .\nBut Mr. Obama did not make any public statements , instead leaving Vice President Joseph R.

The Senate hasn \u2019 t passed a budget in three years , and House Republicans this year have run into trouble in trying to pass big legislation such as the farm bill .
