    "content": "' I Am Convinced That We Can Make A Difference , ' Pope Tells Congress\nPope Francis , in an address to a joint meeting of Congress , encouraged lawmakers to work together to solve the problems of ordinary Americans and to show compassion for people across the globe who are suffering from war and hunger .\nHis message touched on some of the biggest political controversies of our day , \u2014 immigration and the migration crisis in Europe , the death penalty , abortion , the arms trade , poverty and religious extremism .\nAt the top of the post , we have a video of the speech as it was delivered on Capitol Hill this morning .\nAppearing at the Speakers Balcony , flanked by a visibly moved House Speaker John Boehner and Vice President Joe Biden , Pope Francis greeted thousands of people who had gathered .\n`` I am so grateful for your presence here . The most important ones here , the children , have asked God to bless them . ''\n`` If there are any of you that do not believe or can not pray , I want you to send good wishes my way , '' he added .\n`` In these remarks I have sought to present some of the richness of your cultural heritage , of the spirit of the American people . It is my desire that this spirit continue to develop and grow , so that as many young people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream .\nHe calls on Congress to seek `` effective solutions rather than getting bogged down in discussions . ''\n`` A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty as Lincoln did , when it fosters a culture which enables people to 'dream ' of full rights for all their brothers and sisters , as Martin Luther King sought to do ; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed , as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work , the fruit of a faith which becomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton . ''\n`` Being at the service of dialogue and peace also means being truly determined to minimize and , in the long term , to end the many armed conflicts throughout our world . Here we have to ask ourselves : Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society ? Sadly , the answer , as we all know , is simply for money : money that is drenched in blood , often innocent blood . In the face of this shameful and culpable silence , it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade . ''\nCalls on technology , particularly that generated by American research institutions , to help solve the problem of climate change .\nOn climate change : `` We need a conversation which includes everyone , since the environmental change we are undergoing , and its human roots , concerns and affects us all . ''\n`` I am convinced that we can make a difference . I am sure . ''\nOn income inequality : `` I encourage you to keep in mind those people who are trapped among us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty . ... Hunger must be fought on all fronts . ... The fault is the creation and distribution of wealth . ''\nIn a reference to abortion : `` The Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development . '' ( to applause )\nAdds : `` This conviction has led me , from the beginning of my ministry , to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty . ''\n`` ... A just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation . ''\n`` Let us remember the Golden Rule . Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . ... Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves . Let us help others to grow , as we would like to be helped ourselves . ''\n`` [ If ] we want security , let us give security ; if we want life , let us give life ; if we want opportunities , let us provide opportunities . The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us . The Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development . ''\n`` Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War . This presents us with great challenges and many hard decisions . On this continent , too , thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones , in search of greater opportunities . ''\n`` Is this not what we want for our own children ? We must not be taken aback by their numbers , but rather view them as persons , seeing their faces and listening to their stories , trying to respond as best we can to their situation . ''\n`` We , the people of this continent , are not fearful of foreigners , because most of us were once foreigners . ''\n`` I say this to you as the son of immigrants , knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants . Tragically , the rights of those who were here long before us were not always respected . For those peoples and their nations , from the heart of American democracy , I wish to reaffirm my highest esteem and appreciation . ''\nOn MLK 's dream of equality : `` That dream continues to inspire us all . I am happy that America continues to be , for many , a land of 'dreams . ' ''\nUpdated at 10:21 a.m . ET : `` The challenges facing us today ... call for a spirit of cooperation that has shown so much good throughout the history of the United States . ''\n`` We know that no religion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism . This means that we must be especially attentive to every type of fundamentalism , whether religious or of any other kind . ''\n`` But there is another temptation which we must especially guard against : the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil ; or , if you will , the righteous and sinners . The contemporary world , with its open wounds which affect so many of our brothers and sisters , demands that we confront every form of polarization which would divide it into these two camps . ''\n`` This year marks the 150th anniversary of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln , the guardian of liberty , who labored tirelessly that 'this nation , under God , [ might ] have a new birth of freedom .
