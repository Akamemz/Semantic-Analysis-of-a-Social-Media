    "content": "The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that Fresno police officers accused of stealing more than $ 225,000 while executing a search warrant are protected by qualified immunity and thus can not be sued over the incident .\nWhile the unanimous panel acknowledged that `` the City Officers ought to have recognized that the alleged theft was morally wrong , '' it concluded that they `` did not have clear notice that it violated the Fourth Amendment . '' In other words , the cops were n't equipped with enough information to deduce that robbing people is a violation of their constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and seizures\u2014a bizarre interpretation of the law , to say the least .\nIn 2013 , the Fresno Police Department carried out a raid on Micah Jessop and Brittan Ashjian , who were suspected of operating illegal gambling machines . ( Neither man was ever charged . ) Upon completing the search , officers provided both with a ledger maintaining that they 'd seized $ 50,000 ; Jessop and Ashjian allege that , in reality , the cops made off with $ 151,380 in cash and $ 125,000 in rare coins . Both men contend that the officers pocketed the difference between the funds reported with the warrant and the total amount they took , amounting to a $ 226,380 theft .\nEven so , the panel granted qualified immunity\u2014a legal doctrine that , in the words of \u2588\u2588\u2588 's C.J . Ciaramella , `` allows public officials to violate a constitutional right '' so long as that right has not been `` clearly established '' by current case law . In theory , it protects civil servants from undue harassment ; in practice , it allows those officials to get away with behavior that would land a normal person in prison .\nWriting for the panel , Circuit Judge Milan D. Smith , Jr. cited Brewster v. Beck , a Ninth Circuit precedent , as insufficiently applicable to the Fresno case . In that decision , the court ruled that officers who impounded a vehicle in an asset forfeiture seize\u2014another repugnant practice\u2014violated a woman 's Fourth Amendment rights after she furnished a valid California driver 's license and registration . ( The police seized the car because she had a suspended license . )\nBut that does n't pass muster here , said Smith . `` Brewster , '' he wrote , `` involved the seizure of property pursuant to an exception to the warrant requirement . '' But in Jessop v. City of Fresno , the officers `` seized Appellants ' property pursuant to a warrant that authorized the seizure of the items allegedly stolen . '' Smith also argues that the former case pertains to impoundment while the latter surrounds theft . That renders the decision a useless comparison , he says\u2014notwithstanding the fact that outright stealing is arguably a more offensive transgression .\nBut the nail in the coffin is that Brewster was decided in 2017 , four years after the Fresno officers allegedly robbed Jessop and Ashjian . Even if the precedent adequately aligned with Jessop , Smith argues , the officers did n't have that case law to guide them . Smith rejected the plaintiffs ' Fourteenth Amendment claims on similar grounds , writing that the Ninth Circuit has `` not held that officers violate the substantive due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when they steal property seized pursuant to a warrant . ''\nWell , at least cops wo n't be able to use that excuse any more\u2014right ? I 'm afraid not . The judges demurred at the opportunity to issue a definitive ruling on whether the Fresno police violated Jessop and Ashjian 's rights , leaving the door open for another public servant to come along and do the very same thing .",
