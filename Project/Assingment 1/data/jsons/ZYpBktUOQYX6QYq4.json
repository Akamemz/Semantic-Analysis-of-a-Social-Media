Black leaders in the city say that if there is evidence of racism , it could call into question scores of convictions that stemmed from white police officers investigating black suspects in a city that is 25 percent black.Members of the Rev . Jesse Jackson \u2019 s Rainbow PUSH coalition met with Buttigieg in 2014 and urged him to ask for a federal investigation into allegations of police misconduct. \u201c There \u2019 s a level of frustration , \u201d said Karen White , a city councilwoman and Democrat who is black . \u201c We want this issue to be brought to closure to ensure this issue does not polarize our community further .

Serious allegations . His oath and his job every day is to follow the law , so that \u2019 s what he \u2019 s doing . Whatever the court decides , whether the tapes are to be released or destroyed , he \u2019 ll do that . \u201d\nThe matter currently sits with St. Joseph County Superior Court Judge Steve Hostetler , who could rule on a summary judgement within weeks , although further appeals are expected .\nThe issue has potential ramifications in the Democratic primary . Buttigieg , 37 , a Harvard graduate , Rhodes scholar and military veteran , officially launched his presidential campaign from a former Studebaker factory in South Bend on Sunday , saying his policies had revitalized the once-dying Midwest town .\nAfrican-American voters will be a force in the primary , where 18 Democrats and counting are battling to be heard .

Boykins allowed the taping , now on Young \u2019 s phone line , to continue but did not inform the detective that his calls were being recorded .\nAbout a year later , shortly after Buttigieg had been elected to his first term in office at the age of 29 , DePaepe discovered recordings on the line that she said revealed racist remarks and a potential criminal conspiracy between officers .\nDePaepe took the allegations to Boykins , who confronted the officers .\nThe officers , upset over the secret recordings , went to the FBI and Department of Justice to ask for an investigation . They contended the recordings were illegal , and their complaints prompted U.S. Attorney David Capp to open an investigation .\nButtigieg only learned of the investigation into the recordings in early 2012 when the FBI alerted him to the probe .\nButtigieg \u2019 s allies say he was frustrated that Boykins did not tell him about the existence of the investigation .
