The money is available for everything from solar to wind to geothermal to fuel cell projects .\nAccording to the report , though , nearly one-quarter of the $ 16 billion approved to date has been for U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms . The money went to several Spain-based companies , as well as those in Japan , Germany , France and Italy .\nNearly $ 1.8 billion , for example , went to various wind energy projects across the country under the U.S. division of Spain 's Iberdrola Renewables , according to the study .\nRepublican lawmakers say the program is effectively aiding foreign competitors , with money the U.S. government arguably does not have .\n`` With $ 16 trillion in debt , we can not afford to send one out of every four taxpayer dollars overseas for a program that has failed to create the jobs promised , '' Rep.
