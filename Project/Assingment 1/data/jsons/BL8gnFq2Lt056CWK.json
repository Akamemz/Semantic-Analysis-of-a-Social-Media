'' he said .\nMoore is worried the tariffs might cost him his job . The mill where he works , NLMK Pennsylvania , in the town of Farrell , not far from the border with Ohio , employs 750 workers and is a subsidiary of Novolipetsk Steel , or NLMK , Russia 's top steelmaker .\nBut even though NLMK is creating American jobs , the company is being hit with a 25 percent tariff on steel because it imports raw steel slabs from Russia before turning them into coils in Pennsylvania and then selling that steel to customers that manufacture cars or pipes , for example .\nBill Almashy , a 48-year-old crane operator at the mill , worries that NLMK might not be able to survive the tariffs .\nHe knows what it is like to lose a steel mill job . This is the third mill he has worked at in recent years . One of the previous mills went bankrupt ; the other moved most of its jobs to Mexico . Along the way , Almashy lost his home , his pension and his 401 ( k ) .\n`` A lot of steel in America is gone , '' he said. `` Basically our politicians failed us .
