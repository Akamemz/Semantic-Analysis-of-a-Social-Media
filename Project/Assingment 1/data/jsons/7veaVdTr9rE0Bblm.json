    "content_original": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nIt is astonishing that nearly six years into the tenure of any\n\nadministration the commander-in-chief would acknowledge publicly that\n\nhe has no strategy for addressing an evident, serious threat to\n\nAmerican interests.\n\nLast week, marauders from the so-called Islamic State overran Tabqa\n\nair base in Syria, where MANPADS, or man-portable air-defense systems,\n\nare stored. These are the weapons that can bring down commercial\n\naircraft. Considering the pledge of this group\u2019s leader to take the\n\nwar to the United States, they now have the means to do so whether\n\ntargeting the takeoff of a U.S. commercial airliner from Dubai, or in\n\na few weeks after penetrating the Mexican border, from Dallas-Fort\n\nWorth International Airport in Dallas.\n\nHistorically, every new administration spends the first year of its\n\ntenure enunciating goals \u2014 essentially, to keep the peace and\n\nestablish a climate at home and abroad in which American interests can\n\nbe advanced \u2014 and then developing strategies for achieving them in\n\nspecific regions of the world. The process begins with the president\n\nstating his view of what our regional interests are, inviting the\n\nintelligence community and the Cabinet to identify how those interests\n\nare threatened, and then tasking these principals and staff to develop\n\na range of integrated political, economic and military measures for\n\ndefending and advancing American interests throughout the world. By\n\nthe end of the first year, the president has evaluated the options\n\nsubmitted to him and has made decisions among them. He then goes about\n\nimplementing them by publishing and explaining them to three\n\nconstituencies \u2014 the American people, the U.S. Congress and our\n\nallies. While this process involves hard work and disciplined\n\nleadership, it\u2019s not rocket science. Doing it well yields enormous\n\nbenefits. It engenders confidence among the American people and\n\nnurtures cohesion and support among our allies. Finally, it puts\n\nadversaries on notice that we are a serious nation that has the will,\n\nthe capability, a strategic plan and the resources to prevail against\n\nany challenge they might consider posing.\n\nSince World War II, U.S. presidents have engaged this strategic\n\nprocess as a proven means for defining and announcing our interests\n\noverseas, assessing how they are threatened, and developing effective\n\nstrategies designed to deter, or \u2014 if deterrence fails \u2014 to prevail in\n\nany conflict well in advance of any such conflict. In the Reagan\n\nadministration, I had the privilege of managing that process, and in\n\nthe ensuing years, it proved invaluable not only in identifying \u2014 and\n\npre-empting \u2014 challenges still over the horizon, but in crisis\n\nmanagement as well. In the remaining years of the current\n\nadministration, there is still time for President Obama to lead in the\n\nresolution of the plethora of crises before us \u2014 starting with the\n\nthreats posed by the Islamic State and concurrently in Ukraine, China\n\nand Iran.\n\nModern terrorism by Islamist groups has posed a \u201cclear and present\n\ndanger\u201d to our country for more than 30 years. In Iraq, we are faced\n\nwith an especially challenging form of it. A well-financed, well-armed\n\nand well-trained barbarous force has declared its intention, inter\n\nalia, to conduct operations against the United States on its way to\n\nestablishing an Islamic caliphate of global reach and jurisdiction.\n\nGiven the plausibility of their executing such a plan, the first\n\ncomment our president must make is that this movement of uncivilized\n\nsavages puts us all at risk \u2014 from Irbil to London, Chicago, Tokyo and\n\nBeijing \u2014 and that there is no basis for trying to reason with\n\nbrainwashed, ideological, totalitarian, genocidal criminals bent on\n\npursuit of an imperial strategy. The second is that they must be\n\ndestroyed. Mr. Obama\u2019s statement from Estonia on Wednesday was a good,\n\nthough belated, beginning.\n\nDeveloping a political, economic and military strategy for containing\n\nand then destroying the Islamic State is not something that will come\n\neasily for the president, given his proclivities toward engagement and\n\ntoothless diplomacy. Yet in some respects, his task has been rendered\n\nless onerous. Politicians in every civilized state \u2014 especially\n\nEuropean states that have known this menace was coming for years \u2014\n\nunderstand that if they don\u2019t join in countering this scourge in Syria\n\nand Iraq, they will face it in their own countries before long. This\n\nweek, the president\u2019s task is to forge consensus among his political\n\ncounterparts in Western Europe to direct NATO Supreme Allied Commander\n\nEurope Gen. Philip Breedlove and the NATO military committee to work\n\nwith the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop a plan for overcoming this\n\nmenace.\n\nEconomically, it\u2019s time to lean hard on the Gulf Arabs to shut down\n\ntheir formal and informal funding of radical Islamists. The diplomacy\n\nneeded to get this done ought also to be a little easier than it would\n\nhave been even five years ago. Their tenure is at risk, and they are\n\npalpably conscious of it. Separately, our work with European allies\n\nshould involve closing their financial institutions to Islamist\n\ntransactions.\n\nThe U.S. military must work with Kurdish, Kuwaiti, Egyptian, United\n\nArab Emirates, Saudi, Jordanian and Iraqi forces to forge a strategy,\n\nfirst to contain and then to destroy the Islamic State\u2019s forces. U.S.\n\nand allied tactical aviation can help limit the enemy\u2019s mobility and\n\nprovide fire support during engagements. However, the training and\n\nsupervision of ground forces from the aforementioned countries in the\n\nstruggle to regain lost territory must fall to experienced U.S.\n\nspecial operations advisory personnel \u2014 several thousand of them.\n\nBy their brashness and brutality, the Islamists may have provided an\n\nimpetus and a window for the civilized world to come together and\n\nreverse their gains. It will take extraordinary leadership from\n\nWashington to oversee this battle and stay the course. That window may\n\nnot remain open for long.\n\nAs soon as we have stemmed this tide \u2014 a year from now \u2014 we must turn\n\nto the agenda that we have for so long avoided \u2014 bringing the moderate\n\nArabs, Kurds and Israel into a sustained conversation on regional\n\nsecurity that leads toward reconciling their differences. To do so\n\noffers a revered place in history for the American president. Yet it\n\nwill require a far better understanding of the nature of the challenge\n\nthan has thus far been apparent, together with the courage and\n\ncommitment to lead such an effort successfully.\n\nRobert McFarlane served as President Reagan\u2019s national-security\n\nadviser.
