    "content": "It started out as reasonable venting during Wednesday \u2019 s handoff between Cuomo PrimeTime and CNN Tonight about how the police treat African Americans and how white people should be more receptive . But it all went too far when the latter \u2019 s host , Don Lemon , blamed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on President Trump . On top of that , he and Chris Cuomo asserted that people on the right would be all-in for gun control if it were African Americans protesting like those demanding Michigan reopen .\nThe handoff began benign enough , with Lemon urging viewers to imagine if it were their friend who had been killed by a police officer that way , to have more empathy , and to speak out .\nBut it took a decidedly political turn when he accused the President of being an influence in the situation ( click \u201c expand \u201d ) :\nHow many more excuses do you need to make before you examine yourself and say , okay , maybe I need to wake up a little bit and take a good long look at what I 've been doing . Maybe I need to understand or realize that the environment that this President has trafficked in can help to lead to these sorts of situations , where people think that that sort of behavior , meaning the people who are doing these things , the people who are calling the cops on people falsely in Central Park . The people who are chasing people down the street in Georgia and killing them . That you may begin to think that your actions are normal . That you may begin to think that you as the preeminent voice can do things that are inhumane to other people and it will be accepted .\nHe then also appeared to link Trump to the resent situation in New York City \u2019 s Central Park in which a white woman falsely accused a black man of chasing her , and blatantly saying the cops would believe her over him .\nAlthough , he did speak out against those causing chaos in the streets . \u201c I 'm not condoning people protesting ... So , they are frustrated and they are angry and they are out there . And they 're upset . You should n't be taking televisions , but I ca n't tell people how to react to this , \u201d he said . And interestingly , in the previous hour , Cuomo actually called the violence and thieving what it was : a riot .\nBut things went back to being grossly political when they tried to argue that Republicans would give up their commitment to the Second Amendment , if African Americans were protesting with legally acquired and owned firearms .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the meme that \u2019 s going around right now with the cops with the black kid on the ground saying hello to the white guy in camo with the AK-47 and the mask who is protesting in Michigan , \u201d chided Cuomo . \u201c That when it 's white people with guns and they 're out and they 're angry and their faces with cops . \u201d\nLemon was appalled that the peaceful protesting in Michigan didn \u2019 t solicit a violent response from police , and implied that legally exercising their Second Amendment right should have been enough . \u201c Yelling at police officers armed ! Armed with heavy weaponry ! Did n't see any of that . Did you any anybody with their foot on anybody 's neck , \u201d he decried .\nCuomo responded by suggesting , without evidence : \u201c If you started to have African-Americans buying up AR-15s \u201d and they were \u201c going out and protesting legally with legal weapons , you 'd see a change in the laws , and that 's sad . \u201d\nBut back in reality , the Democratic Party \u2019 s push for gun control began as a way to take guns from newly freed slaves and oppress blacks during the Jim Crow era .\nAnd on a side note , at one point , Lemon claimed that he currently lived in the New York City neighborhood of Harlem .
