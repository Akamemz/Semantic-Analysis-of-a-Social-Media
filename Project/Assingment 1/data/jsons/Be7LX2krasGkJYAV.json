    "content": "President Trump on Saturday started his weekend with a furious tweet aimed at two Washington Post reporters who he said shouldn \u2019 t be allowed on White House grounds after the paper published a report detailing what they described as Trump \u2019 s \u201c lost summer . \u201d\nThe Post angered the White House with an article published this week called \u201c Trump \u2019 s lost summer \u201d which outlined what some aides described as a summer \u201c defined by self-inflicted controversies and squandered opportunities . \u201d\nWHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS RIP WASHINGTON POST IN SCATHING OP-ED 'AN OFFENSIVE , EGREGIOUS AFFRONT TO TRUE NEWS JOURNALISM '\nTrump took aim at White House reporters Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker , who were the authors of the article .\n\u201c The Washington Post \u2019 s @ PhilipRucker ( Mr. Off the Record ) & @ AshleyRParker , two nasty lightweight reporters , shouldn \u2019 t even be allowed on the grounds of the White House because their reporting is so DISGUSTING & FAKE , \u201d he tweeted .\nRucker 's new nickname \u201c Mr . Off the Record \u201d appeared to be a reference to claims spread by members of Trump \u2019 s circle that he was responsible for repeating off-the-record comments about Trump 's family made by former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout . Westerhout resigned last week , reportedly after those comments got back to the White House .\nThe Post recently backed Rucker over that claim when it first emerged , telling Politico in a statement that Rucker \u201c has always acted with the utmost honor and integrity and has never violated Washington Post standards or policies. \u201d On Saturday , the Post 's Executive Editor Martin Baron said the president 's tweet was part of an effort to intimidate the press .\n\u201c The Washington Post is immensely proud to have these two superb journalists on staff . Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker have consistently demonstrated their integrity in covering the White House , '' Baron said in a statement . `` We stand fully behind them and their important work . The president \u2019 s statement fits into a pattern of seeking to denigrate and intimidate the press . It \u2019 s unwarranted and dangerous , and it represents a threat to a free press in this country . \u201d\nIn the tweet , Trump linked to a Washington Examiner op-ed by White House press secretaries Stephanie Grisham and Hogan Gidley that slammed the Post piece as \u201c an offensive , egregious affront to true news journalism. \u201d Their op-ed was called \u201c The Washington Post \u2019 s lost summer \u201d and laid out what the White House sees as misteps and errors by the Post .\n\u201c From Memorial Day to Labor Day , the Post had some pretty embarrassing moments , \u201d Grisham and Gidley wrote . \u201c Whether it was incorrectly stating that presidents do not deliver remarks on the Fourth of July , ignoring speeches by Presidents Reagan , Kennedy , and Obama , or being called out for shoddy , politically motivated fact-checking , the Post \u2019 s lost summer culminated with a fateful day in August when it was forced to issue 15 corrections to a single article . \u201d\nIt also pushed back on the claim that Trump has not scored a number of achievements over the summer .\nTED CRUZ BLASTS NEW YORK TIMES : 'PROPAGANDA OUTLET BY LIBERALS , FOR LIBERALS '\n\u201c The truth is , Trump racked up many well-documented victories that directly benefited the American people at home and abroad , '' they wrote . `` When the Post asked , the White House proudly provided it with a detailed list of the administration \u2019 s 26 most important successes of the summer . Of those 26 accomplishments , the Post chose to publish just four , which it buried under 11 paragraphs of editorialized critique . ''\nThe Post , however , doesn \u2019 t agree with Grisham and Gidley \u2019 s op-ed .\n\u201c Our story prominently noted the White House \u2019 s list of accomplishments and quoted a White House spokesman at length , '' a Washington Post spokesperson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Friday . `` It also reported the views of Republicans , both on the record and on background , some of whom are part of the administration and some who watch its performance from a distance .
