    "content": "With companies set to face fines next year for not complying with the new mandate to offer health insurance , some are pursuing strategies like enrolling employees in Medicaid to avoid penalties and hold down costs .\nThe health law \u2019 s penalties , which can amount to about $ 2,000 per employee , were supposed to start this year , but the Obama administration delayed them until 2015 , when they take effect for firms that employ at least 100 people .\nNow , as employers race to find ways to cover their full-time workers while holding a lid on costs , insurance brokers and benefits administrators are pitching a variety of options , sometimes exploiting wrinkles in the law .\nThe Medicaid option is drawing particular interest from companies with low-wage workers , brokers say . If an employee qualifies for Medicaid , which is jointly funded by the federal government and the states , the employer pays no penalty for that coverage .\n\u201c You \u2019 re taking advantage of the law as written , \u201d said Adam Okun , a senior vice president at New York insurance broker Frenkel Benefits LLC .\nLocals 8 Restaurant Group LLC , with about 1,000 workers , already offers health coverage , and next year plans to dial back some employees \u2019 premium contributions . That is because an employer can owe penalties if its coverage doesn \u2019 t meet the law \u2019 s standard for affordability .\nBut the company , which is based in Hartford , Conn. , hopes to reduce its costs by offering eligible employees a chance to enroll in Medicaid , using a contractor called BeneStream Inc. to help them sign up . The government program is more affordable for employees and saves money for Locals 8 , said Chief Executive Al Gamble . \u201c The burden gets shifted to Medicaid , \u201d he said .\nSuch maneuvers could fuel controversy . Big employers with significant Medicaid enrollment in their workforces have been a political flash point in some states . The health law aimed to expand Medicaid eligibility to most people with incomes at or below 138 % of the federal poverty level , but not all states have adopted that standard .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got to be careful about not fooling ourselves into thinking everybody wins , \u201d said Matt Salo , executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors . \u201c The cost to the taxpayer does go up significantly . \u201d\nBeneStream said its business is growing rapidly . \u201c The economics of this are what \u2019 s driving change , \u201d said CEO Ben Geyerhahn . The law \u201c created this as a valid waiver \u201d for employers .\nAnother idea gaining ground with employers is offering bare-bones , or \u201c skinny , \u201d health plans that cover preventive care but exclude major benefits like hospital coverage . These low-cost plans differ from the now-illegal \u201c mini-med \u201d plans that capped benefits . Though skinny plans offer a narrow range of benefits , they don \u2019 t limit payouts .\nMaking such plans available allows employers to avoid the approximately $ 2,000-per-employee penalty for not offering coverage to at least 70 % of their full-timers . And workers who sign up won \u2019 t face the law \u2019 s penalties for individuals lacking insurance .\nSince skinny plans don \u2019 t meet the federal standard of covering 60 % of the cost of medical care , they can still leave an employer vulnerable to a different fine\u2014about $ 3,000 for each worker who opts out and instead gets a federally subsidized plan through an insurance exchange .
