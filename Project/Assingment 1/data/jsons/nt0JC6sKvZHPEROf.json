( Yuri Gripas/Reuters )\nIt \u2019 s better than the Democrats \u2019 proposal , but it goes too far on neck restraints and not far enough on no-knock warrants , and it fails to address qualified-immunity doctrine .\nGeorge Floyd \u2019 s tragic death at the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has sent shockwaves through an America understandably outraged and traumatized by the unnecessarily fatal episode . Public unrest has spurred political action . In Washington , both Democrats and Republicans have pulled together fast-track legislation aimed at police reform \u2014 the Justice in Policing Act and the JUSTICE Act ( Just and Unifying Solutions To Invigorate Communities Everywhere Act ) , respectively .\nThe lead sponsor of the Republican bill , Senator Tim Scott ( S.C. ) , is one of only two African-American men in the upper chamber ( and the only black Republican ) . He \u2019 s done an admirable job on a short timeframe . His bill is a better approach overall than the Democratic alternative , a well-intentioned effort that nevertheless overreaches in some areas , with very real public-safety costs in the balance . The Republican bill is generally more modest \u2014 seeking data and transparency when solutions aren \u2019 t clear \u2014 but is still a significant effort aimed at addressing more clearly defined problems .\nStill , the GOP bill could be improved . There are some ways in which the bill probably does not go far enough , and others in which it may go too far . And it omits an important area of focus , included in the Democrats \u2019 bill , that Republicans should address .\nWhere could the Republican bill go further ? It could do more to constrain no-knock warrants , which authorize police to enter a dwelling forcefully , and without notice , often in the late-night or early-morning hours . There is certainly a case for such tactics in at least some cases . Organized-crime hideouts , for example , are often heavily armed . The Democrats \u2019 approach \u2014 a complete ban on no-knock raids in all drug cases \u2014 would unnecessarily risk officer safety .\nNo-knock warrants are probably overused \u2014 sometimes tragically , including in the case of Breonna Taylor , whose name is affixed to the corresponding section of Senator Scott \u2019 s legislation . Consider also a 2014 raid in which police threw a flashbang grenade into the bedroom of Alecia and Bounkham Phonesavanh in Wisconsin . The grenade landed in the crib of their 18-month-old toddler , who took the brunt of the flashbang \u2019 s blast , suffering a collapsed lung as well as severe burns to his face and chest ; the child was in a medically induced coma for more than five weeks , and the family faced $ 1 million in medical bills . The target of their investigation did not live at the residence and was not there when police performed the raid .\nThe Republicans \u2019 JUSTICE Act uses Congress \u2019 s spending powers to encourage police departments to meet various reporting requirements relating to no-knock warrants . Such data would be useful , but there is room for more here . Congress should also push police departments to require a high-level commanding officer to sign off on any no-knock warrant . Judges already must approve , as required by the federal Constitution \u2019 s Fourth Amendment , but they may lack the capacity to weigh safety-risk tradeoffs and may give police undue latitude . Requiring a commanding officer to sign off \u2014 and assume public accountability in the event things go awry \u2014 would help deter overuse of no-knock warrants .\nWhile the JUSTICE Act could go further on no-knock warrants , it may go too far on the controversial use of neck restraints \u2014 or \u201c chokeholds , \u201d as they \u2019 re more commonly known . There \u2019 s certainly no case for applying full body pressure on an unresisting suspect \u2019 s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds \u2014 the indefensible use of force that killed George Floyd . But just as no-knock warrants probably have legitimate uses in at least some cases , neck restraints can be a way for a police officer to gain control of a resisting suspect , avoiding deadlier applications of force .\nWe don \u2019 t have a lot of data here . We don \u2019 t really know , for example , just how likely it is that temporary application of a neck restraint , for the purpose of securing a suspect , will result in serious injury or death . It \u2019 s vital to gather more data .\nWe do know one thing , however : Shooting a suspect with a gun is much deadlier than using a neck restraint . The JUSTICE Act doesn \u2019 t go as far as the Democrats \u2019 bill , which would ban neck restraints in all cases ; the JUSTICE Act limits such restraints to cases in which deadly force is required . But such deadly-force situations also would offer a complete defense to officers shooting a suspect . If officers \u2019 options for securing a resisting suspect are limited , either the Democrats \u2019 or the Republicans \u2019 bill could unintentionally lead to more police shootings . The dramatic reduction of such shootings over time is an unappreciated success . In New York City , for example , the number of individuals wounded and the number of individuals killed by police using a firearm each fell 90 percent between 1971 and 2016 . We don \u2019 t want to see that trend reverse itself .\nConspicuously absent from the JUSTICE Act is any mention of \u201c qualified immunity , \u201d a legal doctrine that the Democrats \u2019 bill would eliminate as applied to police . The Democrats \u2019 bill may go too far , but the Republicans should nonetheless address the issue .\nQualified immunity shields police officers ( and other government officials ) , under certain conditions , from lawsuits based on an 1871 federal law . The 1871 statute enables citizens to collect money damages from state and local government for violations of constitutional rights . In 1967 , the Supreme Court ruled that government officials couldn \u2019 t be sued for actions that were not known to be unconstitutional at the time : It wouldn \u2019 t allow a lawsuit against police officers for acting in 1961 to enforce a law that was declared unconstitutional in court four years later .\nBoth critics and defenders of qualified-immunity doctrine tend to overstate its practical importance \u2014 at least with respect to police use of force . The doctrine does nothing to shield officers from criminal prosecution or disciplinary actions . Most lawsuits against police uses of force and other alleged misconduct don \u2019 t involve the federal constitution . And even when they do , qualified immunity usually doesn \u2019 t matter : In a 2017 article in the Yale Law Journal , professor Joanna Schwartz ( a critic of the doctrine ) found that qualified immunity was the basis for dismissal or summary judgment in less than 4 percent of the cases she sampled .\nThat qualified immunity isn \u2019 t used often doesn \u2019 t mean that it doesn \u2019 t matter at all . It also doesn \u2019 t mean that the Supreme Court got it right , or that Congress should avoid the issue . As mentioned , the underlying statute was enacted in 1871 \u2014 decades before the modern Federal Rules of Civil Procedure made federal lawsuits much easier to file , imposing sizable \u201c discovery \u201d costs on defendants , win or lose . Congress should legislate a standard , rather than leave it up to unelected judges .\nIt makes little sense to hold government officials liable for actions based on changes in the law . When the Supreme Court announced , in the 1966 case of Miranda v. Arizona , that police officers had to read criminal suspects their rights , it would have made little sense to allow lawsuits against officers who hadn \u2019 t done so in 1965 . Police departments aren \u2019 t Supreme Court seers , and they won \u2019 t change their behavior based on unknown future changes in the law . Such lawsuits would act as little more than a tax on policing \u2014 one ultimately borne by the taxpayers .\nIn some cases , however , the doctrine of qualified immunity has been used to shield police from liability when the contours of the general legal concepts at issue are clear , but the specific factual circumstances are different . Judges have dismissed lawsuits based on trivial factual distinctions between an officer \u2019 s actions and earlier cases that established a clear legal principle . Congress might helpfully clarify that the qualified-immunity doctrine applies only to clear changes in legal rights \u2014 not idiosyncratic fact patterns .\nAlthough we think the JUSTICE Act could be improved , we appreciate the effort Senator Scott has made to craft a thoughtful legislative reform proposal in such a short time . In a country of 330 million people , we \u2019 ll never eliminate the possibility of police misconduct , any more than we \u2019 ll be able to eliminate violent crime .
