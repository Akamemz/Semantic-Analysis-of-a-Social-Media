    "content": "Midway through the rally for gun control that concluded the March for Our Lives , the Marjory Stoneman Douglas junior Jaclyn Corin brought out a special guest , Yolanda Renee King , the nine-year-old granddaughter of Martin Luther King , Jr. , and Coretta Scott King . \u201c I have a dream that enough is enough , \u201d Yolanda King said , \u201c and that this should be a gun-free world . \u201d\nAnd then , wearing a white coat , with an orange ribbon pinned to it in remembrance , the miniature activist stood before the crowd of thousands with a gap-toothed grin and led them in call-and-response :\nIt is , at least , a generation that has now defined itself . Regardless of its long-term effects , the March for Our Lives is the first major statement by Americans born after 1999 , who have presented a new template for protest . The March for Our Lives was a massive outcry against extreme violence delivered with a mix of pop sentiment , corporate co\u00f6peration , and an awareness of the socioeconomic privilege that allows certain voices to be heard louder than others . Youth protest today does not look like it did fifty years ago , although that \u2019 s boring to say . Many of the students came to Washington , D.C. , with their parents . Stoneman Douglas students were met by politicians on Capitol Hill . The Washington Wizards invited them to basketball practice . Student journalists held a panel at the Newseum . A concert the night before was thrown in their honor , and Shake Shack sponsored a sign-making party .\nThe student leaders were grateful , thanking their celebrity donors and corporate sponsors on social media , posing in front of the little blue bird at Twitter \u2019 s Washington offices . One student even photographed and tweeted the boxes of granola bars and snacks donated by Kind . The media could not love them enough : there were interviews on \u201c 60 Minutes , \u201d NPR \u2019 s \u201c Morning Edition , \u201d and the late-night news shows . There were major interactive packages in Teen Vogue , and a Time magazine cover . There was , in short , so much consensus about the message of the student movement that it has to be one of the least anti-establishment social movements in American history . What the student leaders seem to be saying is that they don \u2019 t want trouble , and , had a person not arrived at their school with a gun , they would have kept their heads down and scored high on their S.A.T.s . They have been as polite and as popular as protesters can hope to be , and yet the establishment has continued to prove reluctant to change .\nThe students marched on Saturday , the day after Congress had departed for its spring recess , and the spending bill that Donald Trump signed on Friday had included three meagre actions to address gun violence : fifty million dollars in grants for school-security measures ; attempts to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ; and a clarification of the terms of the Dickey Amendment that will now allow for research into the effects of gun violence ( although the amendment still bans the use of government funding to promote gun control ) . As tens of thousands of people descended on the Capitol to demand measures such as universal background checks and a ban on assault rifles that lawmakers would likely continue to ignore , most of those lawmakers left town . Two days before the march , Jaelynn Willey , a sixteen-year-old student at Great Mills High School , in southern Maryland , died , of the injuries she sustained after another student shot her at school . Adults at the march talked about \u201c standing out of the way \u201d and provided snacks .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about amplifying the voices of current students , \u201d Lysee Webb , who graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2003 and now lives in Brooklyn , said . She and her sister , Emma Webb ( Class of 2009 ) , were among the hundreds of M.S.D . alumni who gathered the morning of the march in the ballroom at the J. W. Marriott hotel in downtown Washington for a pre-march breakfast . The alumni breakfast was a culmination of fund-raising and organizing efforts that had begun in the immediate aftermath of February 14th , with impressive results : I spoke with a group of students who had just disembarked from a seventeen-hour bus ride from the University of Central Florida , and who would return to the bus again at 6 P.M .\nCurrent Stoneman Douglas students arrived to Washington in all manner of convoys , some on buses , others with their families ( the march coincided with spring break ) . One group travelled to Washington on a plane lent by the New England Patriots . At 4:10 A.M. on Saturday , three planes carrying five hundred and sixty-seven students total departed from Fort Lauderdale . The students were whisked directly from the tarmac to the site of the rally , where they were immediately given a special place in front of the stage , where the media started gathering at seven-thirty to watch them file in . Before the rally , the student speakers came out for twenty minutes of intense questioning . The Parkland students were now joined by a coalition of speakers from all over the country , an effort to emphasize that the weak gun laws that result in school shootings also cause the everyday gun violence to which Americans have shown themselves inured . \u201c We \u2019 re seeing all these people coming out under one cause ; it \u2019 s really empowering , it \u2019 s really incredible to see , \u201d Delaney Tarr said . \u201c It is a lot , but it \u2019 s a good version of a lot . \u201d\nThe rally began with a song by Andra Day , who sang about \u201c standing up for something , \u201d backed by a children \u2019 s choir from Baltimore dressed in red uniforms . It was just after noon , the sun was shining , and the mood was ebullient . The singers were joined by Common , who rhymed \u201c When they go low , we stand in the heights \u201d with \u201c I stand for peace , love , and women \u2019 s rights. \u201d After the song , a montage played in which politicians offered thoughts and prayers , followed by another showing the now-familiar narrative of the movement \u2019 s beginnings . Clips of right-wing political figures intoning that the immediate aftermath of shootings was \u201c not the time for gun control \u201d gave way to student activists in Tallahassee calling for a new kind of response .\nAfter six weeks of familiarizing itself with the faces of Cameron Kasky , Delaney Tarr , Alex Wind , Emma Gonz\u00e1lez , and the other members of the Never Again movement , the public was now introduced to a new set of activists . Edna Lisbeth Chavez , a seventeen-year-old youth leader from South Los Angeles , interspersed her speech with phrases in Spanish . She lost her brother to gun violence , and moved the crowd to chant his name , Ricardo . Zion Kelly , seventeen , of Washington , D.C. , spoke of his twin brother , Zaire , who was killed by an armed robber as he walked home from school . Zaire Kelly aspired to be a forensic scientist and wanted to attend Florida A . & M. University . Naomi Wadler , an eleven-year-old from Virginia , said that she was speaking for \u201c the African-American girls whose stories don \u2019 t make the front page of every national newspaper , whose stories don \u2019 t lead on the evening news. \u201d She quoted Toni Morrison : \u201c If there is a book that you want to read , but it hasn \u2019 t been written yet , you must be the one to write it. \u201d Christopher Underwood , of Brooklyn , lost his fourteen-year-old brother , who was shot and killed as he walked home from a graduation party . \u201c I took my pain and anger and turned it into action , \u201d he said . Alex King and D \u2019 Angelo McCade , both of Chicago , stepped onstage with tape over their mouths and their fists in the air . Matthew Soto , whose sister died in Newtown , said , \u201c America , I am pleading with you to realize this is not O.K. , we do not have to live like this . \u201d\nThere were more video montages . Demi Lovato sang a power ballad about rising from the ground like a skyscraper . Ariana Grande sang that we \u2019 re going to be all right . Miley Cyrus sang that it \u2019 s not about reaching the other side of the mountain but about the climb . The stories of students who lost their lives in Newtown and Parkland overlapped with the stories of people who lost their lives to police . The performer Vic Mensa dedicated his song \u201c Now We Could Be Free \u201d to Stephon Clark and Decynthia Clements . A video message from Malala Yousafzai offered support .\nThe final speaker was Emma Gonz\u00e1lez . Her last speech , given at a gun-control rally in Fort Lauderdale , only days after the shooting , had made her a household name , and many of the marchers wore buttons and signs that referred to its refrain : \u201c We call B.S. \u201d Gonz\u00e1lez was dressed in a green bomber jacket covered with patches and buttons . As she stepped onstage , the crowd went wild . Her speech was short . \u201c In a little over six minutes , seventeen of our friends were taken from us , fifteen were injured , and everyone , absolutely everyone in the Douglas community , was forever altered , \u201d she said . \u201c Six minutes and twenty seconds with an AR-15 , and my friend Carmen would never complain to me about piano practice ; Aaron Feis would never call Kyra \u2018 Miss Sunshine \u2019 ; Alex Schachter would never walk into school with his brother Ryan ; Scott Beigel would never joke around with Cameron at camp ; Helena Ramsay would never hang out after school with Max ; Gina Montalto would never wave to her friend Liam at lunch ; Joaquin Oliver would never play basketball with Sam or Dylan ; Alaina Petty would never ; Cara Loughran would never ; Chris Hixon would never ; Luke Hoyer would never ; Martin Duque Anguiano would never ; Peter Wang would never ; Alyssa Alhadeff would never ; Jaime Guttenberg would never ; Meadow Pollack would never . \u201d\nThen she stood in silence . Tears streamed down her cheeks . She said nothing . The crowd watched , also silent . A chant of \u201c never again \u201d started , and then faded out . Emma still stood . Finally , the beeping of an electric timer rang out . \u201c Since the time that I came out here it has been six minutes and twenty seconds , \u201d she said . \u201c The shooter has ceased shooting and will soon abandon his rifle . He would then stay with the students and walk free for an hour before arrest. \u201d She concluded : \u201c Fight for your lives before it \u2019 s someone else \u2019 s job . \u201d\nShe turned to the group of students gathered behind her onstage and hugged her friends . The lectern was removed , a gospel choir came out , and Jennifer Hudson led them all in in a rendition of \u201c The Times They Are A-Changin \u2019 . \u201d\nA previous version of this article incorrectly identified the state Naomi Wadler is from .",
