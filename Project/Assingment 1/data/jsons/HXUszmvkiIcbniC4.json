Bush , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c The question is : Will that be strong enough to offset the idea that we have to get tough on our trading partners , and that our jobs are being stolen overseas ? \u201d\nIt takes months for most consumers to feel the impact of tariffs , but as the fall approaches , everything from groceries to appliances could start to cost more at major retailers across the country . Democrats could use these price increases as a political cudgel against Republicans in swing districts as they try to take back control of Congress .\nTrump has so far suffered little political blowback for his tariffs and trade threats , saying that he is simply following through on promises he made during the campaign to crack down on trading partners , even close allies , and put America first . Since March , he has imposed blanket tariffs on nearly all imports of steel and aluminum and placed penalties on $ 34 billion in goods from China , a total likely to increase to $ 50 billion next month and into the hundreds of billions later this year .\nIn return , countries have retaliated with tit-for-tat duties on everything from U.S. agricultural goods to Kentucky bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles , aiming to sway top Republican lawmakers by hurting constituents in their districts .\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings , in your inbox .

The International Monetary Fund also warned this week that trade tensions could cut global output by some $ 400 billion by 2020 , and that the U.S. is `` especially vulnerable '' to effects of an international slowdown .\nPrice increases would vary by product , ranging anywhere from a few cents on a can of beer or soup to around $ 6,000 on a family car , if the administration moves forward with auto-specific tariffs it has threatened .\nEven if Trump does n't move forward with any additional duties , the uncertainty caused by his policies and rhetoric is leading some companies to begin pulling back investments in research and development . They 're afraid that if they develop products for foreign markets , those markets might no longer be accessible to them in six months or a year .\nThe agricultural industry has been particularly vulnerable : Countries like Mexico have begun to diversify their import markets by buying more corn and soybeans from Brazil instead of the United States , in an attempt to reduce their dependence on a country that could erect new trade barriers at any time based on the president \u2019 s whims .\nAnd while the administration has so far taken pains to avoid hitting consumers directly , leaving products like flat-screen televisions and cellphones off the list of products facing tariffs , they will be unable to continue to do so as the list of goods caught in the crossfire begins to expand .\n\u201c If this escalates into a full-blown trade war , the innocent victims are going to be American consumers , \u201d said Matthew Shay , president and CEO of the National Retail Federation . \u201c That \u2019 s what we \u2019 d like to avoid . \u201d\nAs midterm campaigns heat up , vulnerable Democrats and Democratic super PACs are already using the president \u2019 s trade war \u2014 and the Republican Party \u2019 s reluctance so far to challenge him on it \u2014 to frame their opponents as complicit in an escalating trade battle with no end in sight .\nThe Democrat-aligned group American Bridge launched an effort Thursday aimed at targeting Republican candidates for , as the group says , \u201c failing to stand up to Trump \u2019 s trade war. \u201d In one of two launch ads , the group targets Josh Hawley , who is running to unseat Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill , for saying that he supports Trump \u2019 s goals on trade and feels that the president is doing the right thing .\n\u201c Hawley welcomed this trade war , \u201d it reads at the end of a minute-long spot featuring clips of local farmers and manufacturers complaining about the harmful effects of Trump \u2019 s tariffs . \u201c Now Missouri families are paying the price . \u201d\nThe president has so far ignored increasing calls from Republicans in Congress to back down on trade , or at least to begin pursuing dialogue with Chinese President Xi Jinping . The White House insisted this week that trade talks with Beijing are ongoing , but there are no formal discussions on the books and the two sides have not met at the ministerial level since Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross traveled to China early last month .

And he has continued to frustrate Canada and Mexico by refusing to back down from what they see as unreasonable demands in the ongoing renegotiation of NAFTA .\nMoving forward with either car tariffs or a NAFTA withdrawal before November elections would be an \u201c enormous political mistake , \u201d said Bill Reinsch , a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . \u201c If he does that , you \u2019 ll see an immediate sharp consumer impact , which I think will translate into a political reaction . Everything else will be like sand leaking out of the bag . \u201d\nBut even the slow accumulation of economic effects could build up enough by November that consumers will be feeling the pain . It might be difficult for everyday Americans to recognize at this point how the tariffs will affect them , given that many of those proposed are not yet in effect , so in the meantime , the retail industry is working to educate consumers that \u201c there are greater consequences , and price increases and real impacts \u201d that could be coming in the near future , Shay said .\n\u201c That \u2019 s going to create a lot more attention around the things that right now sound a lot more hypothetical , \u201d he added .\nSo far , at least , polls show that Trump appears to still have the support of the bulk of Republican voters when it comes to tariffs . Nearly three-fourths , or 73 percent , of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who responded to a Pew Research survey out this week said they felt increased tariffs would benefit the country . Roughly the same percentage \u2014 or 77 percent \u2014 of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents felt the opposite .\nBut reaction overall is trending increasingly negative : Nearly half , or 49 percent , of all respondents to the Pew poll said they feel tariffs are a bad thing for the country , up 4 percentage points from a similar survey done in May .\nThe partisan split bodes well for Trump , who has so far shown little willingness to heed anyone \u2019 s advice over trade policy beyond his own and who will likely barge into the midterms with the same protectionist messages that helped him win over laid-off factory workers and struggling farmers in 2016 .\nDemocrats might try to point to a worsening economy to say that Trump \u2019 s policies are wreaking havoc across middle America , but the White House has already begun to fire back that the long-term payoff will be worth it .\n\u201c It \u2019 ll be those two competing narratives \u201d during midterm campaigns , said Gutierrez , who now chairs the board of the National Foreign Trade Council . \u201c It all depends on how bad the numbers get and how much pain there is that can \u2019 t be offset by simply saying , \u2018 We \u2019 re doing this for the country and we \u2019 re getting tough on our trading partners , so it \u2019 s worth the pain . \u2019 \u201d",
