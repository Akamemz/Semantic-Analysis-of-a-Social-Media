    "content": "A new grassroots organization of doctors is telling the nation it needs a second opinion about the way to handle this pandemic medically and mentally .\nDuring a media call , several of these doctors spoke of horrible medical results for people because of excessive panic over the coronavirus . They also told of harm done to ill or injured people because the medical world has been largely cut off to them while almost all resources have been redirected to deal exclusively with COVID-19 .\nDr. Simone Gold is an emergency room physician documenting these harms as she \u2019 s contacted fellow medical professionals across the country and helped form this new group A Doctor A Day .\n\u201c People are not getting their health care , \u201d Gold shared . \u201c We \u2019 re so worried about the fact that patients believe that they are going to get sick if they show up for medical tests . But they \u2019 re actually hurting themselves . \u201d\n\u201c There are all these patients out there not showing up to emergency departments , \u201d Gold stated , saying where she works , \u201c The volume in the emergency department is incredibly low . Maybe 60 percent of what it usually is . And this is across the nation . Everybody \u2019 s had the same experience , excluding the New York metropolitan area . \u201d\n\u201c Actually , it \u2019 s quite empty , \u201d she reported , saying of her own hospital , \u201c I got a letter just this last week that we are firing 50 percent of our technicians . \u201d\nLayoffs have been widespread in hospitals across the country since the pandemic hit .\nMore than 600 of these physicians involved with A Doctor A Day have sent a letter to President Trump , asking his coronavirus task force to keep in mind the full implications of a shutdown .\nIn that letter , they warn millions of Americans are endangered by much of the medical world being cut off from them or by them cutting themselves off from it .\nThe letter says , \u201c These include 150,000 Americans per month who would have had a new cancer detected through a routine screening that hasn \u2019 t happened , millions who have missed routine dental care to fix problems strongly linked to heart disease/death , and preventable cases of stroke , heart attack , and child abuse . Suicide hotline phone calls have increased 600 % . \u201d\nThe letter includes actual cases from the doctors \u2019 own practices :\n\u201c Patient A.F . has chronic but previously stable health conditions . Her elective hip replacement was delayed , which caused her to become sedentary , resulting in a pulmonary embolism in April . ''\n\u201c Patient R.T. is an elderly nursing home patient , who had a small stroke in early March but was expected to make a nearly complete recovery . Since the shutdown , he has had no physical or speech therapy , and no visitors . He has lost weight , and is deteriorating rather than making progress . \u201d\nFlattening the Curve Made Sense , but Not Much Has Since\nIn the media call , Gold spoke of the goal America was originally given when everyone was told they must \u201c flatten the curve. \u201d That goal was making sure hospitals weren \u2019 t overwhelmed by potentially millions of people dangerously ill from the coronavirus .\nShe agreed with that goal when it was first voiced , saying , \u201c I always was concerned if we \u2019 d have enough ventilators and ICU staff . That was always what I knew to be the potential problem . So I was encouraged when people said that we were going to try to slow things down for that particular reason . That makes medical sense . Everything that has followed since that does not make scientific sense and is flat-out detrimental to society . \u201d\n\u201c I can not say strongly enough that the healthcare system not only is not overwhelmed , it is underwhelmed , \u201d Gold insisted . \u201c I can tell you of scores of nurses who \u2019 ve been laid off and scores of technicians who \u2019 ve been laid off . And in my specialty , emergency physicians have cut their hours by 35 percent . I \u2019 ve never seen anything like this in my career . My point is : the curve has been flattened . \u201d\n\u201c The reality is that we are way past the time where being locked down makes any scientific or medical sense , \u201d said Dr. Jeff Barke , a primary care physician in Newport Beach , California .\nHe talked up the idea of herd immunity and addressed what he sees as the danger and illogic of keeping children and young people locked up .\n\u201c We are taking the healthiest folks \u2013 the youngest , the strongest : our children \u2013 and we are in effect protecting the healthiest herd from being exposed and allowing them to get herd immunity , \u201d Barke argued . \u201c We \u2019 re seeing over and over , especially with the statistics on children , that children are almost completely spared from the ravages of this virus . \u201d\nSanta Monica pediatrician Robert Hamilton added to the point , saying , \u201c COVID-19 has actually been a relatively benign infection for children . In one study of about 150,000 people , only 1.7 percent of them were in the age category between zero and 18 years of age . \u201d\nHe pointed out those few young people infected were for the most part asymptomatic , meaning the small number who were sickened were , as he put it , \u201c a tiny minority of a tiny minority . \u201d\nPediatrician Assures Children Won \u2019 t \u2018 Infect All of Us & Kill Us All \u2019\nBut the fact that most children will by asymptomatic has caused the fear that if schools open up again and most of the students get infected , they \u2019 ll unknowingly carry the virus to the people who could be hurt or even killed by it .\nOr , as Hamilton paraphrased those who worry about such a thing , \u201c \u2019 Oh my gosh , children are the ones who are going to infect all of us and kill us all ! \u2019 \u201d\nHamilton said of that , \u201c There was a recent study following a child who turned positive in the French Alps . He was exposed to over a hundred people . None of them turned positive. \u201d The pediatrician also cited a study done in Iceland that shows basically the same results .\nHe suggested these studies say of infected children , \u201c They are not what I call \u2018 the bubonic plague rodents \u2019 that we sometimes look at them as. \u2019 Children are not actually the cause of the problem\u2026they \u2019 re not the super-spreaders that people sometimes think . \u201d\nSo he argues for schools opening sooner rather than later .\nThis new group A Doctor A Day is also pointing out how halting most so-called \u201c non-essential \u201d surgeries and treatments during the pandemic can cause multiple medical crises .\nGold explained , \u201c There are problems pushing off what \u2019 s called \u2018 an elective surgery. \u2019 That \u2019 s a very gray area . Things go from \u2018 elective \u2019 to \u2018 urgent \u2019 rapidly . \u201d\nDr. Steven Giannotta echoed what Gold said , speaking of the crucial surgeries done by him and his associates at a hospital at the University of Southern California : surgeries for cancer , brain aneurysms , brain tumors , heart and liver transplants , and stroke care .\n\u201c When the lockdown came , we dutifully reduced our capacity to approximately 30 percent of normal , \u201d Giannotta reported . \u201c All of those patients who were in the pipeline to have their cancer treated or their brain aneurysm treated or their spinal condition treated were all put on hold . \u201d\nAnd that put many of those patients at increased risk .\nOn the flip side , the care Giannotta was not willing to see cut back involves stroke victims . But many of those people just aren \u2019 t showing up to get examined and get care . `` Which means people are sitting at home with potential symptoms of stroke and are , for whatever reason , refusing to access the healthcare system , '' Giannotta explained .\nMedia \u2019 s Made Being COVID Positive Feel More Dangerous Than It Is\nHe put much of the blame for that on news coverage , saying , \u201c We \u2019 ve allowed the media to try to stigmatize COVID positivity . \u201d\nMany people are already afraid they \u2019 ll get the virus at a medical office or in a hospital , and Giannotta charged media link getting the COVID virus to death : \u201c They \u2019 ve stigmatized now our healthcare system and people are afraid to access the healthcare system for fear of becoming COVID positive , as if that is the worst possible outcome . \u201d\nBut he pointed out the odds for most people dying from COVID-19 are actually statistically very low , \u201c Whereas all of our patients with care for their brain tumors being delayed and along with our stroke victims , who are unfortunately suffering strokes because they won \u2019 t access the healthcare system , are being very severely impacted by these lockdown tactics . \u201d\nThey \u2019 re Hurting Their Heart for Fear of the Virus Hurting Them\nSpeaking of heart conditions , Gold added , \u201c Why are we not concerned patients are not showing up at their cardiologist \u2019 s when it \u2019 s well-known if you don \u2019 t go to the cardiologist 's regularly , your heart disease will worsen ? Why are we not concerned about the stroke patients that are having strokes at home , not getting treated or dying ? \u201d\n\u201c Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States , \u201d cardiologist Gabe Vorobiof at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles pointed out .\nSpeaking of those suffering from heart conditions , he reported they \u2019 re not keeping their doctors \u2019 appointments or going to hospitals because \u201c there are a huge number of patients that are simply terrified of what the media is putting out and they \u2019 re terrified of contracting this infection . \u201d\nThe results of that are deadly . \u201c In-home cardiac arrests in the New York area are up 800 percent , \u201d Vorobiof shared . \u201c The majority of those cardiac arrest patients were not revived. \u201d In other words , they died .\n\u201c Ambulatory cardiology practices have seen about a 60 percent decline in patient volumes since late March . We \u2019 ve seen across-the-board reductions in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarctions ( heart attacks ) , \u201d Vorobiof reported , saying the same is true of those suffering strokes . \u201c We \u2019 ve also seen reduction of patient visits for valve disease and transcatheter valve replacement . Procedures are way down . \u201d\nGold introduced psychiatrist Dr. Mark McDonald , saying , \u201c He \u2019 s had patients commit suicide because of depression and picking up drug use again . \u201d\nMcDonald runs a practice in West Los Angeles for children , adolescents , and other young people . He said during the lockdown , \u201c I have had probably a 50 percent decline in patient visits due to patients being scared of coming to the office . These are children , adolescents , and young adults . They \u2019 re worried that if they get the coronavirus infection , they \u2019 ll die . And that \u2019 s what they \u2019 re hearing in the media and that \u2019 s what their parents are telling them . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c And this is not isolated . I \u2019 ve had many patients call me recently in a state of panic . They don \u2019 t know what to do . They \u2019 re drinking again . They \u2019 re thinking of jumping off a bridge . They \u2019 re really suffering and there \u2019 s very little I can do . I have nowhere to send them because there are no resources available . Often they won \u2019 t even come into the office . \u201d\n\u201c This , in my view , is a pandemic of hysteria and emotional overwhelm , \u201d McDonald stated . \u201c It \u2019 s not a medical pandemic . But the downstream consequences medically are very , very severe . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s an emotional and social toll that this is taking on children , being in lockdown for this period of time , \u201d said pediatrician Hamilton , backing up McDonald . \u201c Issues of depression , suicide threats , that sense of futility , despair , fear , paranoia really , are taking ahold in our younger people , particularly older kids , junior high and high school ages . \u201d\nPsychiatrist McDonald added , \u201c I \u2019 ve had to increase my frequency and dosage of benzodiazepines , which is the valium and Xanax family of drugs , which are highly addictive , in order to treat overwhelming increases of panic attacks , obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms , and generalized anxiety . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c I hate using these drugs ; I \u2019 m very conservative in my prescribing them . But I don \u2019 t have any choice because patients have no other resources . A lot of my patients have had substance abuse issues . They have nowhere to go . All of the AA meetings , 12-Step programs , outpatient and inpatient substance abuse programs -- they \u2019 re done . There \u2019 s nothing . \u201d\nMcDonald told of a 31-year-old woman he treated for years for severe depression who was recently in remission and taking graduate classes to become a therapist .\nBut when her college shut down due to the pandemic and her boyfriend broke up with her , she retreated to her home alone and faced weeks with no support . She \u2019 d had a history of opioid abuse she \u2019 d kicked for several years , but recently relapsed and took fentanyl .\n\u201c Fentanyl is an opiate that \u2019 s hundreds or thousands of times more potent than prescription opiates like oxycontin or oxycodone , \u201d McDonald explained . \u201c She was found unresponsive by paramedics . At 31 years old , perfectly physically well \u2013 dead . \u201d\nThe psychiatrist stated , \u201c I am certain that the cause of her death was due to a withdrawal of support in the community and the withdrawal of her ability to be in school and her inability to handle the added stress . \u201d\nMcDonald also spoke of a suicide hotline in Los Angeles reporting in early April an increase from February to March of 20 calls to 1,800 .\nGold brought up another area of concern , saying , \u201c It \u2019 s very important that children are not getting vaccinated . We keep talking about a coronavirus vaccine . Why are we not concerned that children are falling off their vaccination schedules ? \u201d\n\u201c Vaccination rates really globally are very , very down , \u201d stated pediatrician Hamilton .\nFor example , talking about what \u2019 s in a recent New York Times article , he shared , \u201c In Michigan , less than half of infants five months or younger are really up to date on their immunizations right now . \u201d\nHe went on , \u201c Because of the fear of potential infection with COVID , people are not coming to the doctor and they \u2019 re forgetting about the maintenance of their vaccines as scheduled . \u201d\nHamilton also argued that long lockdowns are hurting many children educationally .\nHe spoke of disturbing numbers brought out in a Los Angeles Times article , saying , \u201c After the L.A. Unified School District went to an online system in mid-March , they were showing that large swaths of their high school students weren \u2019 t even checking in . 15,000 of them simply disappeared . They were gone . They had not checked in one time . Another 40,000 of their students \u2013 which represents about a third of their student body \u2013 really were not in daily contact with their teachers . The quality of their education is in fact really lagging . \u201d\nDoctor Argues Keeping Schools Shut \u2018 Just Makes No Scientific Sense Whatever \u2019\nBarke weighed in on this issue of keeping schools closed , saying of those killed by the coronavirus , \u201c The number of deaths younger than 40 are very , very tiny . And if you look at the number of deaths less than ( age ) 40 compared to almost anything else \u2013 whether it be traffic accidents or other forms of death \u2013 compared to COVID-19 , it \u2019 s just ridiculously low for COVID-19 . So this idea that somehow we have to wait for a vaccination or a cure for this virus in order to open up schools just makes no scientific sense whatever . \u201d\nSome on the other side of these pandemic-related issues warn throwing the schools open and purposely exposing people to the virus to get herd immunity are dangerous .\nBarke does admit the idea of herd immunity being foolproof isn \u2019 t 100 percent guaranteed . \u201c But we have examples of past respiratory viral infections where we \u2019 ve been able to reach a level of herd immunity to protect the most vulnerable . \u201d\n\u201c For every child and for every young adult that is locked indoors and is not allowed to be exposed to the virus where they overwhelmingly do well , especially if you \u2019 re younger than the age of 40 or even 50 , that \u2019 s one person less to achieve that level of herd immunity , \u201d Barke argued .\nHe concluded , \u201c Even if we don \u2019 t get up to the recommended 60 or 70 or 80 percent of immunity within the population , even if we only reach 30 or 40 percent , that \u2019 s 30 or 40 percent of Americans that are exposed , that are immune , and are no longer able to spread the virus . And are able in some regard to protect the most vulnerable because there \u2019 s less of a medium to spread it to them . \u201d\nAt the website of this new grassroots group of doctors -- adoctoraday.com -- a different medical professional will share every day about the medical harms they \u2019 ve seen in their real-world practice caused by a continued shutdown of the nation .\nGold said of all these harms , \u201c That is also part of the COVID-19 story , and we are very concerned that decision-makers are not hearing that . \u201d\n\u201c I found that this is not something that \u2019 s widely reported in the media at all , \u201d Gold said , concluding , \u201c I feel there \u2019 s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what \u2019 s actually going on . \u201d\nGold shared one case of inadvertent harm caused by the way Americans have been denied so many services they \u2019 ve been accustomed to . She spoke of a middle-aged woman who tired of not being able to get her hair dyed like she usually did .\n\u201c She was dying her hair at home because her hairdresser was not available , \u201d Gold explained . \u201c And that \u2019 s an awkward thing to do , and she turned and she fell and she broke her hip and she broke her shoulder . And that \u2019 s how I met her : in the emergency department with both of these fractures , and she needed surgery . And I have thousands and thousands of these stories . \u201d\nSTAY UP TO DATE WITH THE FREE \u2588\u2588\u2588 NEWS APP !\nClick Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Live Events",

But they\u2019re actually hurting themselves.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re avoiding hospitals even during emergencies.\n\n\u201cThere are all these patients out there not showing up to emergency departments,\u201d Gold stated, saying where she works, \u201cThe volume in the emergency department is incredibly low. Maybe 60 percent of what it usually is. And this is across the nation.

Procedures are way down.\u201d\n\nLockdowns & Pandemic-Panic Making Many Mental Problems Worse\n\nGold introduced psychiatrist Dr. Mark McDonald, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s had patients commit suicide because of depression and picking up drug use again.\u201d\n\nMcDonald runs a practice in West Los Angeles for children, adolescents, and other young people. He said during the lockdown, \u201cI have had probably a 50 percent decline in patient visits due to patients being scared of coming to the office. These are children, adolescents, and young adults. They\u2019re worried that if they get the coronavirus infection, they\u2019ll die. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re hearing in the media and that\u2019s what their parents are telling them.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd this is not isolated. I\u2019ve had many patients call me recently in a state of panic. They don\u2019t know what to do. They\u2019re drinking again. They\u2019re thinking of jumping off a bridge. They\u2019re really suffering and there\u2019s very little I can do. I have nowhere to send them because there are no resources available. Often they won\u2019t even come into the office.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Pandemic of Hysteria\u2019\n\n\u201cThis, in my view, is a pandemic of hysteria and emotional overwhelm,\u201d McDonald stated. \u201cIt\u2019s not a medical pandemic. But the downstream consequences medically are very, very severe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an emotional and social toll that this is taking on children, being in lockdown for this period of time,\u201d said pediatrician Hamilton, backing up McDonald. \u201cIssues of depression, suicide threats, that sense of futility, despair, fear, paranoia really, are taking ahold in our younger people, particularly older kids, junior high and high school ages.\u201d\n\nPsychiatrist McDonald added, \u201cI\u2019ve had to increase my frequency and dosage of benzodiazepines, which is the valium and Xanax family of drugs, which are highly addictive, in order to treat overwhelming increases of panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, and generalized anxiety.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI hate using these drugs; I\u2019m very conservative in my prescribing them. But I don\u2019t have any choice because patients have no other resources. A lot of my patients have had substance abuse issues. They have nowhere to go. All of the AA meetings, 12-Step programs, outpatient and inpatient substance abuse programs -- they\u2019re done. There\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\n\u2018Perfectly Physically Well,\u2019 but Young Woman Now Dead\n\nMcDonald told of a 31-year-old woman he treated for years for severe depression who was recently in remission and taking graduate classes to become a therapist.\n\nBut when her college shut down due to the pandemic and her boyfriend broke up with her, she retreated to her home alone and faced weeks with no support. She\u2019d had a history of opioid abuse she\u2019d kicked for several years, but recently relapsed and took fentanyl.\n\n\u201cFentanyl is an opiate that\u2019s hundreds or thousands of times more potent than prescription opiates like oxycontin or oxycodone,\u201d McDonald explained. \u201cShe was found unresponsive by paramedics. At 31 years old, perfectly physically well \u2013 dead.\u201d\n\nThe psychiatrist stated, \u201cI am certain that the cause of her death was due to a withdrawal of support in the community and the withdrawal of her ability to be in school and her inability to handle the added stress.\u201d\n\nMcDonald also spoke of a suicide hotline in Los Angeles reporting in early April an increase from February to March of 20 calls to 1,800.\n\nWhile World Cries for a Vaccine, Vaccinations Are Falling\n\nGold brought up another area of concern, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s very important that children are not getting vaccinated. We keep talking about a coronavirus vaccine. Why are we not concerned that children are falling off their vaccination schedules?\u201d\n\n\u201cVaccination rates really globally are very, very down,\u201d stated pediatrician Hamilton.\n\nFor example, talking about what\u2019s in a recent New York Times article, he shared, \u201cIn Michigan, less than half of infants five months or younger are really up to date on their immunizations right now.\u201d\n\nHe went on, \u201cBecause of the fear of potential infection with COVID, people are not coming to the doctor and they\u2019re forgetting about the maintenance of their vaccines as scheduled.\u201d\n\n15,000 Students \u2018Simply Disappeared\u2019\n\nHamilton also argued that long lockdowns are hurting many children educationally.\n\nHe spoke of disturbing numbers brought out in a Los Angeles Times article, saying, \u201cAfter the L.A. Unified School District went to an online system in mid-March, they were showing that large swaths of their high school students weren\u2019t even checking in. 15,000 of them simply disappeared. They were gone. They had not checked in one time. Another 40,000 of their students \u2013 which represents about a third of their student body \u2013 really were not in daily contact with their teachers. The quality of their education is in fact really lagging.\u201d\n\nDoctor Argues Keeping Schools Shut \u2018Just Makes No Scientific Sense Whatever\u2019\n\nBarke weighed in on this issue of keeping schools closed, saying of those killed by the coronavirus, \u201cThe number of deaths younger than 40 are very, very tiny. And if you look at the number of deaths less than (age) 40 compared to almost anything else \u2013 whether it be traffic accidents or other forms of death \u2013 compared to COVID-19, it\u2019s just ridiculously low for COVID-19. So this idea that somehow we have to wait for a vaccination or a cure for this virus in order to open up schools just makes no scientific sense whatever.\u201d\n\nSome on the other side of these pandemic-related issues warn throwing the schools open and purposely exposing people to the virus to get herd immunity are dangerous.\n\nBarke does admit the idea of herd immunity being foolproof isn\u2019t 100 percent guaranteed. \u201cBut we have examples of past respiratory viral infections where we\u2019ve been able to reach a level of herd immunity to protect the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor every child and for every young adult that is locked indoors and is not allowed to be exposed to the virus where they overwhelmingly do well, especially if you\u2019re younger than the age of 40 or even 50, that\u2019s one person less to achieve that level of herd immunity,\u201d Barke argued.\n\nHe concluded, \u201cEven if we don\u2019t get up to the recommended 60 or 70 or 80 percent of immunity within the population, even if we only reach 30 or 40 percent, that\u2019s 30 or 40 percent of Americans that are exposed, that are immune, and are no longer able to spread the virus. And are able in some regard to protect the most vulnerable because there\u2019s less of a medium to spread it to them.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Very Big Disconnect\u2019\n\nAt the website of this new grassroots group of doctors -- adoctoraday.com -- a different medical professional will share every day about the medical harms they\u2019ve seen in their real-world practice caused by a continued shutdown of the nation.\n\nGold said of all these harms, \u201cThat is also part of the COVID-19 story, and we are very concerned that decision-makers are not hearing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found that this is not something that\u2019s widely reported in the media at all,\u201d Gold said, concluding, \u201cI feel there\u2019s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d\n\nGold shared one case of inadvertent harm caused by the way Americans have been denied so many services they\u2019ve been accustomed to. She spoke of a middle-aged woman who tired of not being able to get her hair dyed like she usually did.\n\n\u201cShe was dying her hair at home because her hairdresser was not available,\u201d Gold explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an awkward thing to do, and she turned and she fell and she broke her hip and she broke her shoulder. And that\u2019s how I met her: in the emergency department with both of these fractures, and she needed surgery. And I have thousands and thousands of these stories.\u201d\n\nSTAY UP TO DATE WITH THE FREE CBN NEWS APP!\n\nClick Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Live Events",
