Surrendering to the sheer magnitude of the situation . For many , this is a new post-COVID routine . For people with addictions in recovery , it \u2019 s a daily checklist that existed long before this global health crisis did .\nIsolation can trigger enough introspection to cut through the carefully placed layers of internal bullshit that allow chaos and addiction to fester , but it can also trigger a relapse , especially when financial and mental health hang in the balance . This tension is inherent in sobriety at the best of times and becomes brutally obvious when self-isolation is a matter of life and death .\nThe tricky thing about isolation is that the usual checks and balances like AA meetings , work , or socializing are no longer in place . Without these outlets so readily available , a person in recovery has the freedom to get fucked up by themselves and watch the world burn with relatively little accountability .\nAs COVID poses a growing mental health threat worldwide , cranking up the volume on everything from anxiety to the risk of suicide , for many , it will be a make-or-break period in their sobriety .\nWe spoke to three people in recovery about what \u2019 s keeping them alive , healthy , and sober in a time of unprecedented isolation .\nMatiya , whose last name we are not using to protect her identity as someone in recovery , has been in recovery since 2017 and is confronting the new reality of quarantine with mixed feelings . \u201c It \u2019 s not the worst thing because we \u2019 re so prepared for it in recovery and so used to spending time alone , but at the same time it \u2019 s the worst possible thing for addicts , \u201d she says after two weeks of isolating . \u201c It \u2019 s really easy to slip when no one \u2019 s around , especially for newcomers . \u201d\nWhat usually keeps sober people in check is a combination of internal and external accountability , the latter having been seriously disrupted in recent weeks . \u201c If you \u2019 re alone and you have nowhere to be , then why stay sober ? \u201d Matiya says . \u201c No one \u2019 s watching . No one will know . In my experience , isolation is the biggest downfall for us because we \u2019 re not held accountable , we get lonely , and we lose a sense of community . It \u2019 s easy to slip when no one \u2019 s around . It \u2019 s really scary right now for a lot of people in recovery . \u201d\nScary because , for Matiya , whose drugs of choice included heroin , cocaine , and alcohol , a relapse could be even more lethal than a virus with a two-to-three-percent kill rate . These baseline stressors are compounded by the fact that she has just been laid off from not one , but two jobs recently . Thanks to sobriety though , Matiya says she \u2019 s not feeling too overwhelmed .\n\u201c Honestly , it \u2019 s OK , \u201d Matiya says . \u201c The voice in my head is saying , \u2018 One day at a time \u2019 and , as slogan-y as it sounds , it \u2019 s the way that I lived my life before quarantine and it \u2019 s the way that I live it now . I \u2019 ve been living with a disease that \u2019 s trying to kill me for a long time and I have a program ( AA ) that requires me to look at my daily life as unmanageable . At least I have tools to deal with this unmanageability . \u201d\nThose tools include daily meditation , prayer , and checking in with other people in recovery while benefiting from the explosion of Zoom meetings that have brought Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) and Narcotics Anonymous ( NA ) out of the church basement and into the home in recent weeks . But in a community founded on fellowship and in-person meetings , the ripple effects of quarantine are still being felt hard .\nRyan Aronson is an addiction counselor and founder of Lighthouse Counselling Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Montreal . According to Aronson , an addict \u2019 s tendency to ruminate and obsess , especially when they are alone and under financial stress , puts them at a significant risk of relapse .\n\u201c The risk factors of mental obsession get exaggerated because there \u2019 s nobody to use as a mirror or to break you out of the hamster wheel of negative self-talk , \u201d he says . \u201c If you combine that with financial insecurity , it \u2019 s a recipe for disaster . \u201d\nAnd while the general population can still resort to the \u201c essential services \u201d of state-run liquor and cannabis stores to ease anxiety , many people in recovery are forced to confront discomfort head-on , though this is something they hopefully have trained themselves to do .\n\u201c Sobriety conditions you to be comfortable with the uncomfortable and to delay gratification , \u201d Aronson says . \u201c We \u2019 ve learned how to be on our own and find ways to survive and live without self-destructing or medicators or the need to constantly be eating , shopping , fucking , or whatever it is . The general attitude I \u2019 m hearing from our community at this time is , \u2018 Fuck , man , I \u2019 ve been through way worse ; this is not my bottom . This is life on life \u2019 s terms , this is a roadblock , but I can handle this . \u2019 \u201d\nMarshall was laid off from his restaurant job two weeks ago . He \u2019 s also just reached six months of sobriety and at the moment is grateful for being more fixated on his phone than his old drugs of choice .\n\u201c I just got the gram\u2014of cocaine . Just kidding ! \u201d he laughs . \u201c Instagram\u2014I \u2019 m just trying to figure out how to use Instagram for the first time . I haven \u2019 t really had any issues in terms of cravings or urges so far , thankfully . \u201d\nBad social media puns aside , Marshall isn \u2019 t taking anything lightly . While he relied on in-person AA meetings in the pre-coronavirus era , he says regular check-ins with his sponsor and sober friends have alleviated the isolation he \u2019 s felt since , \u201c You might be physically alone , but you \u2019 re not alone in terms of emotional connection . \u201d\nWhile Marshall may be a relative newcomer , any emotional discomfort he is feeling while in quarantine is far outweighed by the sense of gratitude he has for getting sober when he did . \u201c If I wasn \u2019 t sober , I wouldn \u2019 t be handling anything right now , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 m very grateful that I made the life changes when I did . I have a bit of a financial cushion right , because if I was still using I would still be completely dependent on my parents . Life would be very dark right now . \u201d\nWith a daily routine centered around his mental health , Marshall says obstacles like isolation and unemployment are a lot more manageable than when his entire life revolved around cocaine and alcohol .\n\u201c I try to meditate first thing every morning and it helps tremendously to quiet the brain .
