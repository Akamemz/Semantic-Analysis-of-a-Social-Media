( Al Drago/Reuters )\nAt a coronavirus-task-force briefing at the beginning of April , White House adviser Jared Kushner explained the approach that would \u2014 as events proved \u2014 get the country through its ventilator crisis .\nHe was relentlessly pilloried , mocked , and distorted in the press for it .\nAfter nearly four years of unrelieved Trump hysteria in the media , it \u2019 s hard to rank the worst journalistic outrages , but how Kushner \u2019 s remarks were misreported and misinterpreted belongs high on the list .\nMuch of the press coverage and subsequent commentary focused on one sentence at that April 2 briefing : \u201c The notion of the federal stockpile was it \u2019 s supposed to be our stockpile . It \u2019 s not supposed to be states \u2019 stockpiles that they then use . \u201d\nCue the outrage . As CNBC put it , correctly , in a headline , \u201c Jared Kushner slammed for saying the federal medical supply stockpile isn \u2019 t meant for states . \u201d\nThe blue-checkmarks on Twitter descended in force . Representative Ted Lieu tweeted , \u201c Dear Jared Kushner of the @ realDonaldTrump : We are the UNITED STATES of America . The federal stockpile is reserved for all Americans living in our states not just federal employees . Get it ? \u201d\nFormer director of the United States Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub thundered , \u201c Who the hell does the nepotist think \u2018 our \u2019 refers to ? It is for the American people . \u201d\nPartisan outlets piled on . \u201c Jared Kushner , President Donald Trump \u2019 s son-in-law and White House adviser , \u201d Salon wrote , \u201c claimed that the federal stockpile of medical supplies is not for individual states to \u2018 use , \u2019 even though that is exactly the reason why the stockpile exists . \u201d\nAnd so did mainstream outlets . ABC News rapped Kushner for his \u201c inaccurate description \u201d of the stockpile , which \u201c actually is intended for states \u2019 use . \u201d\nIn a piece for The New Yorker , Susan Glasser went even further . She wrote that the press briefing \u201c will surely go down as one of the Administration \u2019 s most callous performances. \u201d It was symptomatic , she argued , of a federal response that was a \u201c failure by design \u2014 not a problem to be fixed but a policy choice by President Trump that either would not or could not be undone . \u201d\nAll of this was completely ridiculous and wrong . With even a little context , it was obvious what Kushner was saying : States shouldn \u2019 t be drawing on the federal stockpile just to hold ventilators in their own reserves while hard-pressed cities were running low .\nThis was obvious from the very next sentence from Kushner : \u201c So we \u2019 re encouraging the states to make sure that they \u2019 re assessing the needs , they \u2019 re getting the data from their local \u2014 local situations and then trying to fill it with the supplies that we \u2019 ve given them . \u201d\nThe proximate reason for Kushner \u2019 s comment about the state stockpiles was a dispute between the Trump administration and New York governor Andrew Cuomo . New York City was running out of ventilators . The administration had sent 4,400 but learned that 2,000 of them were being held by the state and hadn \u2019 t made their way to the city .\nThe controversial sentence was part of a long answer setting out the administration \u2019 s strategy on ventilators that has , despite all the hue and cry , clearly worked . The emphasis \u2014 with Jared Kushner and his team in the middle of it , and capable leadership from Rear Admiral John Polowczyk at FEMA and Admiral Brett Giroir at HHS \u2014 was on data and shrewd allocation , so that ventilators did not go to states simply on request .\nThere \u2019 s no doubt that the lockdowns , in bending the curve of cases downward , have played a role in averting any shortage \u2014 one of the points of the lockdowns in the first place , of course . But there was no guarantee that we would get to this place where we are today , with ventilators no longer a significant worry .\nAt the outset , the country was looking at a daunting , perhaps impossible challenge . A chilling briefing at FEMA early on posited that the U.S. could be short 130,000 ventilators by April 1 . The federal government had about 16,000 ventilators on hand in its stockpile and several thousand more from the Veteran \u2019 s Administration and the Department of Defense .\nIt was possible the government could perform at the highest level \u2014 and still fall short . A couple of insights drove the administration \u2019 s effort to get its arms around the problem .\nOfficials realized , as one White House adviser puts it , that there was \u201c too much guesstimating \u201d going on . New York , for instance , said it needed 40,000 ventilators . Then , the administration interrogated the request . What was that based on ? It \u2019 s coming from public-health officials . Okay , how are they getting that number ? Models . Plus , we don \u2019 t want to be short .\nIt became clear that many governors didn \u2019 t know how many ventilators their states had , and they were driven by early models that were \u201c doomsday scenarios , \u201d as one senior administration official puts it .
