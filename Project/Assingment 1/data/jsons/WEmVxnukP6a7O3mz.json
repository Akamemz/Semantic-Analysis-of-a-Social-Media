    "content": "Will The Kavanaugh Saga Leave Bruises That Heal Or Permanent Scars ?\nPresident Trump 's choice of Brett Kavanaugh is already the most contentious nomination to the Supreme Court since Clarence Thomas won a 52-48 confirmation vote in 1991 .\nThomas ' was the closest vote confirming a justice since the 1800s , and it followed a stormy hearing and an adverse vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee . The process nearly foundered on accusations of sexual harassment and racial prejudice .\nBut the Senate in that day settled down , and Thomas has served on the court for 27 years \u2013 a nearly always silent anchor on the court 's right .\nThe Kavanaugh controversy did not have a racial element , but at times has seemed equally bruising . It has divided the Senate just as evenly .\nAnd it may prove to be more permanently divisive , not only for the Senate 's confirmation process but for the Senate itself and for the Court as well .\nIt must be said that the atmosphere of collegiality has been deteriorating in both institutions for some time . But the Kavanaugh confrontation has featured more raw partisanship on all sides than even the Thomas affair .\n`` Boy , you all want power , '' said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , his voice rising to a shout at the Democrats across from him in a public hearing . `` God , I hope you never get it ! ''\nThat came from a Republican who had twice voted to confirm Democratic nominees for the Supreme Court and who was once considered something of a bridge between the parties .\nIt is one more manifestation of the emotional cauldron that boiled throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and has simmered ever since . And it may poison relationships in the Capitol and the Courthouse for some time to come .\nBy tradition , both the Senate and the Supreme Court have been thought of as elevated plateaus in American political life . In these hallowed spaces , the air was rarefied . Party ties existed but mattered less .\nIdeology was present and contentious , but it was not always salient .

Nations , like people , are inclined to idealize and sanitize their pasts . Some , too , may be attributable to the lower profile of both Senate and Court in the generations before C-SPAN , cable TV news and social media .\nBut there surely has existed a keen sense that being the Senate \u2014 and acting accordingly \u2014 mattered for its own sake . Some of this can be seen in the courtly way senators address each other in the chamber even now .\nThey do not use names but refer to each other as `` the distinguished '' gentleman or `` gentle lady '' or as the senator from such and such state . What is said in the cloakroom , or behind closed doors , does not get repeated on the Senate floor .\nThe ambience of this more bipartisan Senate was on display last month in the tributes to the late Senator John McCain of Arizona , a Republican to be sure but one with many friends across the aisle .\nThis notion of Senate decorum was visible at times in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing a week ago , primarily in exchanges between the two most senior members of each party \u2013 a quartet that has served a combined century-and-a-half in the Senate .
