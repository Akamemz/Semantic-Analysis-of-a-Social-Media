It \u2019 s not \u2014 I already have really good health care . \u201d\nHe chided Republican lawmakers for \u201c refighting these old battles , \u201d holding dozens of votes to repeal parts or all of the 2010 Affordable Care Act .\n\u201c Sometimes I just try to figure out why , \u201d Mr. Obama said to laughter from his invited guests . \u201c Maybe they think it \u2019 s good politics . \u201d\nThe president was joined by families who have benefited from the health care law provision that provides consumers with a refund if their insurance company doesn \u2019 t spend a set percentage of premium dollars on medical care and improving health care quality , rather than administrative costs or overhead .\nMr. Obama was introduced by Morgan Theriot , a self-employed woman from Silver Spring , Md. , who received a $ 267 refund check from her insurance company last summer after it didn \u2019 t meet the requirement to spend at least 80 percent of her premium dollars on her health care .\nSEE ALSO : House votes for delays on Obamacare ; some Democrats give support to GOP move\n\u201c I \u2019 m curious \u2014 what do opponents of this law think that folks here today should do with the money they were reimbursed ? \u201d Mr. Obama asked . \u201c Should they send it back to the insurance companies ? Do they think that was a bad idea , to make sure that insurance companies are being held accountable ? \u201d\nBut Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , said the president isn \u2019 t telling Americans the full story .\n\u201c What he won \u2019 t say is that next year , Obamacare will impose a new sales tax on the purchase of health insurance that will cost Americans about $ 8 billion , \u201d Mr. McConnell said Thursday . \u201c If the administration is concerned with saving people money on their health care , I have some advice for them . Work with us to repeal Obamacare and start over . \u201d\nSpeaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said the GOP will continue its efforts to repeal the law .\n\u201c The picture that the president paints of his health care law looks nothing like the reality facing struggling American families , \u201d Mr. Boehner said . \u201c The law is costing American jobs ; it \u2019 s forcing people to give up health plans they like ; and it \u2019 s driving up the cost of care for families across America . In my home state , many Ohioans will pay nearly $ 200 more a month , on average , for individual plans . This law has to go . \u201d\nFor the law to work as its supporters envision , more young and healthy people need to sign up for insurance under the various health exchanges being set up in states . The audience at the White House included community groups who will be working at the grassroots level across the country to help enroll Americans in the new health insurance marketplaces this fall .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s pitch came a day after the House voted to delay mandates in the federal health care law requiring individuals and large employers to have coverage , with dozens of Democrats joining Republicans in poking a symbolic hole in the president \u2019 s signature achievement .\nThirty-five Democrats joined with House Republicans to give large businesses a one-year reprieve on the requirement to provide health insurance for full-time employees , helping pass that provision on a 264-161 vote .\nThe House also voted 251-174 to give individuals the same one-year break , with 22 Democratic lawmakers joining Republicans .
