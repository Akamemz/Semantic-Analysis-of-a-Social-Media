    "content": "\u201c He was in Congress for years . He had one senator support him . Nobody likes him , nobody wants to work with him . He got nothing done , \u201d Clinton said in the four-part series \u201c Hillary , \u201d which is set to debut in March and chronicle her life and most recent White House bid .\n\u201c He was a career politician . It \u2019 s all just baloney , and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it , \u201d Clinton added of Sanders , in comments first reported by The Hollywood Reporter .\nAddressing those criticisms in a Hollywood Reporter interview about the documentary \u2014 conducted earlier this month and published Tuesday \u2014 Clinton said her characterization of Sanders still holds true and demurred on whether she would throw her support behind the independent Vermont senator should he emerge as Democrats \u2019 choice to challenge President Donald Trump in November .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to go there yet . We \u2019 re still in a very vigorous primary season , \u201d Clinton said . \u201c I will say , however , that it \u2019 s not only him , it \u2019 s the culture around him . It \u2019 s his leadership team . It \u2019 s his prominent supporters . It \u2019 s his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors , particularly the women . \u201d\nClinton argued that \u201c it should be worrisome \u201d that Sanders has \u201c not only permitted \u201d such a corrosive campaign culture but also \u201c seems to really be very much supporting it . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think we want to go down that road again where you campaign by insult and attack and maybe you try to get some distance from it , but you either don \u2019 t know what your campaign and supporters are doing or you \u2019 re just giving them a wink and you want them to go after Kamala [ Harris ] or after Elizabeth [ Warren ] , \u201d Clinton said . \u201c I think that that \u2019 s a pattern that people should take into account when they make their decisions . \u201d\nSanders , who has been battling accusations of misogyny after Warren accused of him of saying that a woman could not win in 2020 , sought to downplay the tensions with Clinton . \u201c My focus today is on a monumental moment in American history : the impeachment trial of Donald Trump . Together , we are going to go forward and defeat the most dangerous president in American history , \u201d he said in a statement .\nPressed further on the controversy by reporters in the Capitol , Sanders said Clinton is \u201c entitled to her point of view \u201d and cited polling showing him to be the \u201c most popular U.S. senator in the country , \u201d concluding : \u201c So somebody out there must like me . \u201d\nOn social media , Clinton \u2019 s interview immediately ignited an intra-party crossfire . Tommy Vietor , the former National Security Council spokesman under President Barack Obama , described her refusal to commit to endorsing Sanders if he captures the Democratic nomination as \u201c inexcusable . \u201d\n\u201c If Bernie wins the nomination , we all need to work our asses off to help him win . If someone else is the nominee , we all do the same for them , \u201d he tweeted . \u201c Don \u2019 t kick up this bulls -- - right before Iowa , especially after complaining about Bernie \u2019 s lack of support in 2016 . \u201d\nResponding to Vietor , Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill tweeted : \u201c She said \u2018 yet. \u2019 She has repeatedly made clear that she isn \u2019 t committing to any candidate as the primary plays out , and more than anyone in the world she has shown time and again that she puts Democrats & our democracy above all else . \u201d\nMerrill went on to note how Clinton \u201c worked her heart out for Obama \u201d on the campaign trail in 2008 and later served as his secretary of State \u201c after a long primary as adversaries . \u201d\n\u201c Let \u2019 s all take a deep breath , give her the benefit of the doubt for once , & look at history , \u201d Merrill wrote . \u201c But you 're exactly right , we all need to work our heart out for the nominee , whoever that is , and @ HillaryClinton , as usual , won \u2019 t be any exception . \u201d\nJennifer Palmieri , the communications director of Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign , also backed up her old boss .\n\u201c Friends , if there \u2019 s anything @ HillaryClinton has proven to us time & again is you can count on her to do the right thing for the party & the country . The Dem nominee will face a lot of hurdles , Hillary Clinton will not be one of them , \u201d she tweeted .\n\u201c Also , give the woman a break and benefit of the doubt . My God , after all she \u2019 s been through and done for Democrats and the country , she \u2019 s earned our faith in her , \u201d Palmieri added .\n\u201c Why do we need the benefit of the doubt ? '' replied Jon Lovett , a former Obama speechwriter . \u201c Is there a rule against being clear ? \u2018 I \u2019 m not getting involved in the primary . But whoever wins , even if it \u2019 s my second favorite Vermont senator , I \u2019 ll work my heart out for him or her. \u2019 Not that hard ! I even added a little joke . \u201d\nThe progressive group Justice Democrats further ramped up pressure on Clinton , launching an online petition calling on her \u201c to do the right thing and immediately say that she \u2019 ll do everything she can to support whoever becomes the Democratic nominee . \u201d\nClinton caught up with the controversy on Tuesday evening , implying that she would support Sanders if he prevailed in the primaries .\n\u201c I thought everyone wanted my authentic , unvarnished views ! \u201c she posted on Twitter . \u201c But to be serious , the number one priority for our country and world is retiring Trump , and , as I always have , I will do whatever I can to support our nominee. \u201c\nMeanwhile , Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale attempted to amplify the infighting . He tweeted a New York Times report on Clinton \u2019 s statements and wrote : \u201c The knives are out for Bernie . It \u2019 s happening again. \u201c\nThe stinging repudiation by Clinton comes as Sanders has reestablished himself as a leading contender in the current primary contest \u2014 polling near the top of the pack in early nominating states and posing perhaps the most credible long-term threat to frontrunner Joe Biden .\nBut Sanders \u2019 momentum leading up to the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses has produced high-profile clashes with his chief opponents for the nomination . He apologized Monday for an op-ed penned by a surrogate alleging Biden had \u201c a big corruption problem , \u201d and he is still weathering the political fallout from his recent dispute with Warren .\nWarren has maintained that Sanders told her during a private meeting in December 2018 , prior to their respective presidential campaign announcements , that he did not believe a female candidate could defeat Trump in 2020 . Although he has denied ever making such a statement , Clinton charged that the debate represents \u201c part of a pattern \u201d for Sanders .\n\u201c If it were a one-off , you might say , \u2018 OK , fine. \u2019 But he said I was unqualified . I had a lot more experience than he did and got a lot more done than he had , but that was his attack on me , \u201d Clinton , who served in the Senate with Sanders from 2007-2009 , told The Hollywood Reporter .\n\u201c I just think people need to pay attention , \u201d she continued , \u201c because we want , hopefully , to elect a president who \u2019 s going to try to bring us together , and not either turn a blind eye , or actually reward the kind of insulting , attacking , demeaning , degrading behavior that we \u2019 ve seen from this current administration . \u201d\nClinton weighed in at length on the challenges still facing female White House contenders , including Warren and Amy Klobuchar , and praised Warren \u2019 s forceful defense of a woman \u2019 s electability at last week \u2019 s Democratic primary debate .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve tried to tell all the candidates the same thing , but with the women , I say , \u2018 You \u2019 re probably not going to be treated fairly . Don \u2019 t let it knock you off stride , \u2019 \u201d Clinton said .\nAs the 2020 campaign has worn on , journalists tracking the race have also reverted \u201c back to stereotypes , \u201d she asserted , \u201c and many of those are highly genderized . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s really hard ever to score 100 when you \u2019 re trying to navigate gender expectations and barriers . Sometimes you really do want to let loose , and then you think , \u2018 Oh , great , they \u2019 ll say I can \u2019 t take it , so I \u2019 m getting angry. \u2019 Or they \u2019 ll say that I \u2019 m mad , and that that \u2019 s not a very attractive look , \u201d Clinton said . \u201c So , it \u2019 s a constant evaluation about , \u2018 How can I best convey who I am , what I believe , what I stand for and what I \u2019 m willing to fight for ? \u2019 \u201d",
