And the court \u2019 s docket is already loaded with potentially landmark cases on LGBTQ rights , abortion , religious freedom and school choice , and protections for young unauthorized immigrants .\nAnd public confidence in the court \u2013 now arguably more reliably conservative than at any point since at least the 1970s \u2013 could be in danger as a result , experts say .\nTo be sure , there have been a few big decisions \u2013 perhaps most notably the 5-4 decision in June that the federal courts can \u2019 t place limits on partisan gerrymandering . Rancorous partisan battles to confirm two new justices have also dominated the headlines , but when it comes to the court \u2019 s main job \u2013 interpreting the toughest statutory and constitutional questions \u2013 significant developments have been few and far between since Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016 .\nIt may not feel that way , but the United States Supreme Court has stayed fairly quiet over the past four years .\nIt may not feel that way , but the United States Supreme Court has stayed fairly quiet over the past four years .\nTo be sure , there have been a few big decisions \u2013 perhaps most notably the 5-4 decision in June that federal courts can \u2019 t place limits on partisan gerrymandering .

Justice Scalia and the moderately conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy , who retired last year , have been replaced by the more reliably conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh , and the court \u2019 s docket is already loaded with potentially landmark cases on LGBTQ rights , abortion , religious freedom and school choice , and protections for young unauthorized immigrants .\n\u201c We \u2019 re in an [ unusual ] position now with so many justices who \u201d share similarly conservative judicial philosophies , says Kimberly West-Faulcon , a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles . \u201c I have no reason to believe that all five of them have any interest in laying low for a term . \u201d\nThe new conservative majority has not been seen much to date . Last term only seven of the Supreme Court \u2019 s 72 opinions split 5-4 along partisan lines . One of those was the landmark decision to not place limits on partisan gerrymandering , but so far it has been more common to see different coalitions .\nJustice Gorsuch joined his liberal colleagues in four 5-4 cases last term , for example , and Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 widely considered the ideological center of the court \u2013 did the same in the 5-4 decision striking a citizenship question from the 2020 census .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t go about our work in a political manner , \u201d Chief Justice Roberts told an audience at the Temple Emanu-El \u2019 s Streicker Center in New York . \u201c When you live in a politically polarized environment , people tend to see everything in those terms , \u201d he added . \u201c That \u2019 s not how we at the court function , and the results in our cases do not suggest otherwise . \u201d\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the court \u2019 s senior justice and one of its most progressive , concurred . The justices agreed \u201c considerably more often \u201d than not last term , she said in a July interview . Yet Justice Ginsburg added that this term \u201c I can safely predict that we will have our fair share of closely-watched cases . \u201d\nOn the second day of the term , the justices will hear three cases regarding whether federal civil rights law protects gay and transgender people from employment discrimination . Next month , the court will hear a case questioning whether the Trump administration \u2019 s decision to rescind the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2013 which gave a measure of protection from deportation for unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children \u2013 was lawful .\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP Cathy Haggstrom from Odessa , Fla. , right , joins anti-abortion activists in front of the Supreme Court , Oct. 7 , 2019 , in Washington .\nIn December , the court is scheduled to hear a case challenging a New York City gun control law . ( The law has since been amended , however , meaning the justices could dismiss the case . ) The court has also agreed to hear a case over the constitutionality of using state tax-credit scholarship programs at religious schools , as well as a case concerning congressional appropriations for the Obama-era Affordable Care Act .\nAs with last term , court watchers say , the five conservative justices are unlikely to be in constant agreement .\n\u201c It \u2019 s pretty clear the conservative bloc on the Supreme Court is more coherent and united than when Justice Kennedy was on it , \u201d says Ilya Somin , a professor at George Mason University \u2019 s Antonin Scalia Law School .\n\u201c But by no means is it a monolith , \u201d he adds . \u201c On some of these cases there will be one conservative justice who does something we don \u2019 t expect . \u201d\nWhere that could happen is unclear , however .

While the court voted 5-4 last term to block the law while it was being appealed \u2013 with Chief Justice Roberts joining his liberal colleagues \u2013 the law closely resembles one enacted by Texas that the court struck down 5-4 in 2016 . The deciding vote then ? Justice Kennedy .\nPerhaps the only issue more politically divisive than abortion at the moment is the president of the United States , and the justices could encounter several Trump-related legal battles .\nThe administration is already fighting lawsuits challenging a new rule barring asylum applications from migrants who traveled through another country to reach the U.S. \u2013 a policy the justices allowed to go into effect last month pending appeals . Meanwhile , California and 22 other states sued the administration last month over its decision to revoke the Golden State \u2019 s ability to set its own tailpipe emissions standards .\nMost explosive of all ( and anxiety-inducing for someone , like Chief Justice Roberts , concerned about the institutional integrity of the high court ) is the prospect of the justices ruling on a case related to an investigation of President Trump or his administration \u2013 in particular the ongoing congressional impeachment inquiry .\nBut a case related to impeachment would be especially fraught for the court now , not just in the context of the hyperpartisan Garland and Kavanaugh nominations , but also President Trump \u2019 s attacks on \u201c so-called \u201d judges and \u201c Obama judges \u201d and the surprising regularity with which his administration is making \u201c emergency \u201d appeals to the Supreme Court .\nAn upcoming study found that in President Trump \u2019 s first three years in office , the government has filed 21 \u201c emergency \u201d motions with the court , compared with six in eight years during both the George W.
