Democracy is over ! Muh values ! ( No matter the issue , liberals love to preen about \u201c values \u201d when it comes to Trump because it masks the sad facts about their own degenerate lives . I mean , when your \u201c value \u201d is \u201c social justice , \u201d what other value do you need , amiright ? ) It \u2019 s all manufactured hysteria , of course , and most normal Americans see right through the hand-wringing and pearl clutching . In fact , far from causing the destruction of America , President Trump is actually SAVING not just our country , but the entire world through his actions as president .\nThe world , you ask ? Isn \u2019 t that being a bit melodramatic ?\nPut it this way . If liberals can take every new \u201c crisis \u201d and somehow manufacture it into a way to accuse Trump of literally * ending * the world , I should be able to write a column on how he \u2019 s saving it , right ? And it \u2019 s not like I \u2019 m lacking for material either \u2026\nSo let \u2019 s consider five of the ways together . They are all worth noting , even if President Trump will never get a liberal to thank him for actually accomplishing something they at least pretend to care about - SAVING THE FREAKING PLANET .\nRemember when liberals used to be about peace ? Back in my parents \u2019 day , when sandaled , tie-dye clad hippies marched and shouted \u201c war , what is it good for ! \u201d , at least you got the impression they genuinely wanted peace . Hell , in those days liberals dug Russia too because Communism was cool and capitalists drooled . Now , they \u2019 ve turned into cold-warriors seemingly overnight because , among other reasons , Russia backed the wrong horse in 2016 . And they \u2019 ve got ta pay !\n\u201c The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia , even a confrontation that could lead to war , \u201d Trump said last Thursday in what was likely an understatement . Liberals will hem and haw when asked if they want to fire up the nukes on Moscow , but the fact that Trump promised to make relations with Russia better is like kryptonite not just to libs , but also to bloodthirsty # NeverTrump neocons itching for another war .\nExcept , President Trump isn \u2019 t having any of it . Whether it \u2019 s negotiating with North Korea \u2019 s Kim Jong Un or Russia \u2019 s Vladimir Putin , Trump - like Winston Churchhill - believes that \u201c To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war . \u201d\nWhether or not his actions eventually earn him a Nobel Peace Prize , if he stays the course President Trump will end up potentially saving millions of lives , and possibly the world in the process .\nAh , human freedom . It \u2019 s a concept that in many ways has its origins in Western civilization , but it was truly perfected right here , in the good old U S of A .\nIn the movie Braveheart , Mel Gibson \u2019 s William Wallace asked an army of reluctant soldiers , \u201c What will you do without freedom ? Will you fight ? \u201d because then , as now , the concept of fighting , and dying , for human freedom is one that resonates particularly strong in a West that saw the concept take root and grow to become the engine that , through the mighty vehicle of capitalism , lifted and continues to lift millions upon millions out of poverty and despair worldwide .\nAnd no country has spilled more blood for freedom than the United States of America , the nation Ronald Reagan once described as a \u201c city on a hill . \u201d\nBy appointing judges and endorsing and implementing policies that expand freedom , as the leader of the free world has done and continues to do , President Trump is constantly improving the lives of those whose lives would be significantly worse without it . No , it \u2019 s not a perfect system and we \u2019 re not a perfect country , not by a long shot , but remove the freedom from our nation , as liberals are increasingly wont to do , and the freedom of billions will likely die along with it .\nRemember ISIS ? Back in the day , before Trump , the Islamic extremist group had managed to carve out a caliphate that included wide swaths of small country-sized territories in Iraq and Syria . From Kirkuk to Aleppo and as far south as near Damascus , dissidents were getting their heads chopped off , women were being raped , mutilated , and murdered , and gays were getting tossed off buildings . Now I \u2019 m as anti-war as they come , but this is the kind of evil that only understands blood , guns , and steel , and a lot of it .\nIn 2017 , President Trump promised to `` extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth . '' It was a bold , Trumpian promise , but could it be done ? Politifact , while rating President Trump \u2019 s later claim that ISIS had lost \u201c very close to 100 percent \u201d of their territory as \u201c mostly true , \u201d notes that ISIS \u201c went from 90,800 square kilometers in January 2015 to 6,759 square kilometers in January 2018 \u201d with the overwhelming majority of those losses coming under President Trump .\nWhere would the world be with an ISIS caliphate controlling vast swaths of the Middle East ? Thanks to President Trump , we don \u2019 t have to find out .\nThe United States may have a third of the population of China , but we still have the largest economy in the world , and at $ 20 trillion compared to second-place China \u2019 s $ 14 trillion and third place Japan \u2019 s $ 5.1 trillion , it \u2019 s really not even close . To put things in perspective , Canada comes in at number 10 with only a tenth of what the United States puts out ( $ 1.8 trillion ) .\nIn general , as the U.S. economy goes , so goes the world . If we are roaring along , the world roars along with us . If we tank , they tank too , and the lives of lots of poor folks get exponentially worse . So when President Trump releases U.S. manufacturers from burdensome regulations , cuts corporate tax rates , and implements business-friendly policies that has in no small part led to some of the greatest economic gains in any two year span in American history , the world benefits as well . ( If America getting richer to benefit the world sounds wrong to you , you need to go back to class and study Reaganomics 101 . )\nAnd yes , that includes implementing fair trade policies that may stifle some trade in the short run but will lead to better wages and manufacturing infrastructure long-term . Which , in turn , will lead to a more financially sound middle-class , a good thing for America and the world .\nAs anyone with a lick of common sense knows , a country isn \u2019 t a country without borders . President Trump is not only attempting to enforce ours , he is modeling a virtue that other countries would be wise to follow . If they do , as countries like Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2019 s Hungary and others have , they will avoid the inevitable tyranny and ruin that comes from globalization .\nIndeed , keeping the world decentralized by preserving and maintaining nation states may be preventing the one world order dreamed of by Soros and other globalists , but make no mistake - it will in the long run save the world .\nThere are doubtless plenty more ways than what I \u2019 ve listed above , so feel free to list them in the comments .\nNot that he \u2019 ll ever get a thank you from liberals , but on behalf of President Trump and the millions of people who put him into office , I \u2019 ll go ahead and say a hearty - You \u2019 re Welcome !",

They are all worth noting, even if President Trump will never get a liberal to thank him for actually accomplishing something they at least pretend to care about - SAVING THE FREAKING PLANET.\n\n1. Avoiding a World War\n\nRemember when liberals used to be about peace? Back in my parents\u2019 day, when sandaled, tie-dye clad hippies marched and shouted \u201cwar, what is it good for!\u201d, at least you got the impression they genuinely wanted peace. Hell, in those days liberals dug Russia too because Communism was cool and capitalists drooled. Now, they\u2019ve turned into cold-warriors seemingly overnight because, among other reasons, Russia backed the wrong horse in 2016. And they\u2019ve gotta pay!\n\n\u201cThe Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war,\u201d Trump said last Thursday in what was likely an understatement. Liberals will hem and haw when asked if they want to fire up the nukes on Moscow, but the fact that Trump promised to make relations with Russia better is like kryptonite not just to libs, but also to bloodthirsty #NeverTrump neocons itching for another war.\n\nExcept, President Trump isn\u2019t having any of it. Whether it\u2019s negotiating with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un or Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, Trump - like Winston Churchhill - believes that \u201cTo jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war.\u201d\n\nWhether or not his actions eventually earn him a Nobel Peace Prize, if he stays the course President Trump will end up potentially saving millions of lives, and possibly the world in the process.\n\n2. Advancing Human Freedom\n\nAh, human freedom. It\u2019s a concept that in many ways has its origins in Western civilization, but it was truly perfected right here, in the good old U S of A.\n\nIn the movie Braveheart, Mel Gibson\u2019s William Wallace asked an army of reluctant soldiers, \u201cWhat will you do without freedom? Will you fight?\u201d because then, as now, the concept of fighting, and dying, for human freedom is one that resonates particularly strong in a West that saw the concept take root and grow to become the engine that, through the mighty vehicle of capitalism, lifted and continues to lift millions upon millions out of poverty and despair worldwide.\n\nAnd no country has spilled more blood for freedom than the United States of America, the nation Ronald Reagan once described as a \u201ccity on a hill.\u201d\n\nBy appointing judges and endorsing and implementing policies that expand freedom, as the leader of the free world has done and continues to do, President Trump is constantly improving the lives of those whose lives would be significantly worse without it. No, it\u2019s not a perfect system and we\u2019re not a perfect country, not by a long shot, but remove the freedom from our nation, as liberals are increasingly wont to do, and the freedom of billions will likely die along with it.\n\n3. Defeating Islamic Extremism\n\nRemember ISIS? Back in the day, before Trump, the Islamic extremist group had managed to carve out a caliphate that included wide swaths of small country-sized territories in Iraq and Syria. From Kirkuk to Aleppo and as far south as near Damascus, dissidents were getting their heads chopped off, women were being raped, mutilated, and murdered, and gays were getting tossed off buildings. Now I\u2019m as anti-war as they come, but this is the kind of evil that only understands blood, guns, and steel, and a lot of it.\n\nIn 2017, President Trump promised to \"extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth.\" It was a bold, Trumpian promise, but could it be done? Politifact, while rating President Trump\u2019s later claim that ISIS had lost \u201cvery close to 100 percent\u201d of their territory as \u201cmostly true,\u201d notes that ISIS \u201cwent from 90,800 square kilometers in January 2015 to 6,759 square kilometers in January 2018\u201d with the overwhelming majority of those losses coming under President Trump.\n\nWhere would the world be with an ISIS caliphate controlling vast swaths of the Middle East? Thanks to President Trump, we don\u2019t have to find out.\n\n4. Laying The Foundation For a Roaring Economy\n\nThe United States may have a third of the population of China, but we still have the largest economy in the world, and at $20 trillion compared to second-place China\u2019s $14 trillion and third place Japan\u2019s $5.1 trillion, it\u2019s really not even close. To put things in perspective, Canada comes in at number 10 with only a tenth of what the United States puts out ($1.8 trillion).\n\nIn general, as the U.S. economy goes, so goes the world. If we are roaring along, the world roars along with us. If we tank, they tank too, and the lives of lots of poor folks get exponentially worse. So when President Trump releases U.S. manufacturers from burdensome regulations, cuts corporate tax rates, and implements business-friendly policies that has in no small part led to some of the greatest economic gains in any two year span in American history, the world benefits as well. (If America getting richer to benefit the world sounds wrong to you, you need to go back to class and study Reaganomics 101.)\n\nAnd yes, that includes implementing fair trade policies that may stifle some trade in the short run but will lead to better wages and manufacturing infrastructure long-term. Which, in turn, will lead to a more financially sound middle-class, a good thing for America and the world.\n\n5. Enforcing National Borders\n\nAs anyone with a lick of common sense knows, a country isn\u2019t a country without borders. President Trump is not only attempting to enforce ours, he is modeling a virtue that other countries would be wise to follow. If they do, as countries like Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary and others have, they will avoid the inevitable tyranny and ruin that comes from globalization.\n\nIndeed, keeping the world decentralized by preserving and maintaining nation states may be preventing the one world order dreamed of by Soros and other globalists, but make no mistake - it will in the long run save the world.\n\nThere are doubtless plenty more ways than what I\u2019ve listed above, so feel free to list them in the comments.\n\nNot that he\u2019ll ever get a thank you from liberals, but on behalf of President Trump and the millions of people who put him into office, I\u2019ll go ahead and say a hearty - You\u2019re Welcome!",
