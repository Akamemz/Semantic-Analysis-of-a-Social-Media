It just underscores the superfluous and abusive character of his probe . He is not compiling an air-tight legal case for impeachment ; he is simply using abusive prosecutorial tactics to foment an anti-Trump political firestorm .\nRod Rosenstein is the Dr. Frankenstein in this political horror show . He birthed a monster in Mueller , who is now rampaging through the streets of Manhattan in search of pre-presidential dirt . Let \u2019 s , for the sake of argument , say that all of his claims about Trump-Cohen corruption are true . Is that impeachable material ? No , it is not . The American people voted for Trump knowing full well that his pre-presidential record was checkered .

Through his relentless tweeting , Trump has thoroughly educated the American people on the raw politics of Mueller \u2019 s probe \u2014 that he inherited a hopelessly tainted investigation from Trump haters ensconced in the Obama administration , that Mueller assembled a team of Hillary supporters to continue the probe , and that he has abandoned his DOJ mandate for a partisan fishing expedition of staggering proportions .
