His implausible denials and obstinate attitude only do damage to him and the Republican Party. It is his sad legacy, but richly deserved.\n\nLeigh Corfman Speaks Out\n\nMoore was a 32- year-old assistant district attorney when Corfman says she met him on a bench outside a courtroom. He allegedly lured her to his remote cabin, removed most of her clothing and molested her.\n\nPoised and articulate, Corfman conveys a persuasive account of how she was intimidated and frightened, saying she \u201cdidn\u2019t deserve\u201d to have an adult man \u201cprey upon\u201d her.\n\nWhen challenged as to why she waited nearly 40 years to divulge what she says happened, she explained that fear drove her silence to all but her family and a few friends.\n\nOver the years, Corfman said, she struggled with the notion of coming forward to confront Moore. On several occasions, she almost did. But always she worried about what a powerful man would do to her young children and her ability to support them financially.\n\nWhen Washington Post reporters recently sought her out, Corfman was reluctant to speak.

Their stories are all very specific as to time, place and manner of acts committed. The mothers of some of the women corroborate their accounts of creepy meetings with Moore when their daughters were teenagers \u2013 how he fawned over them.\n\nThese allegations are compelling. They have the ring of truth. Moore\u2019s denials do not.\n\nRoy Moore Contradicts Himself\n\nMoore\u2019s only interview in response to the accusations came Nov. 10 on Sean Hannity\u2019s nationally syndicated radio show. The former judge did not acquit himself well. Since then, he has refused to be questioned, which can be revealing of a person who has much to hide.\n\nHannity posed tough questions in the style of a courtroom cross-examination. He first asked Moore if, as a 32-year-old man, he ever dated 17- or 18-year-old girls.\n\n\n\nMoore replied: \u201cIf I did, I\u2019m not going to dispute anything.\u201d This response sounds like a \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nBut Hannity persisted, asking the same question a second time, to which Moore replied differently: \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.\u201d That\u2019s a conditional \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nSince Moore\u2019s answers appeared inconsistent, Hannity asked the question for a third time. In response, Moore adamantly denied ever dating teenagers when he was a 32-year old prosecutor. That\u2019s a clear \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThere is a reason lawyers seize upon the conflicting or contradictory statements that people make. They suggest the person is not telling the truth.\n\nIndeed, there is a standard jury instruction in which jurors are told that if they find that a witness is deceptive in part of his testimony, they may conclude that the witness is deceptive in all of his statements.\n\nWhich account given by Moore was the truth and which accounts were lies? Was his first answer truthful, but the other two responses lies? Or was it some other combination? All three accounts cannot represent the truth, since they were all different.\n\nPeople who are incapable of getting their story straight tend to be lying. This is why cross-examination is often referred to as the \u201cengine of truth.\u201d When done effectively, it exposes all manner of prevarication and lies.\n\nMoore\u2019s History of Lawlessness\n\nBefore the Alabama primary, I argued on air that it would be a serious mistake for Republicans to nominate Roy Moore. He has a long history of lawlessness.\n\nIf elected to be a U.S. senator, Moore would bring to the chamber his tempestuous personality and seditious approach to government. For his party and the Senate at large, he would prove to be destructive, not constructive.\n\nMoore was twice removed from his position on the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal court orders on important constitutional issues, including his refusal to abide by a United States Supreme Court decision.\n\nIt is not within the legal province of state court judges to render the final word on the U.S. Constitution. Under the Supremacy Clause, such matters are decided by the federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWe do not allow state judges to subvert federal law. In the seminal case of Ableman v. Booth (62 U.S. 506), the Supreme Court held that state court judges can never issue rulings that contradict the decisions of federal courts.\n\nYet either though ignorance of the law or insufferable arrogance, Moore has repeatedly attempted to usurp power and substitute his own judgment for that of the federal judiciary. He pretends to embrace the law. But in truth, he has shown nothing but contempt for the rule of law whenever it fails to conform to his own religiously driven interpretation.\n\nOn this basis alone, Roy Moore is not fit to serve in the United States Senate. The appalling accusations of sexual assault and harassment only reinforce that conclusion.",
