    "content": "SIOUX CITY , Iowa \u2014 Hours after terrorists attacked a hotel in Mali and a week after Islamic State fighters struck Paris , Ted Cruz took the floor here to deliver a harsh critique of President Barack Obama \u2019 s Middle East posture and pledge a hard-line approach to Syrian Muslim refugees .\nIt was exactly what this crowd of mostly conservative Christians wanted \u2014 and an ominous sign for Iowa \u2019 s weakened front-runner , Ben Carson .\nAcross the state and at a major gathering of politically active evangelicals on Friday night , foreign policy was top-of-mind for the voters and state lawmakers once considered natural constituents for Carson . But after a week of confused comments from the retired neurosurgeon and a dismissive critique by his own advisers , Iowans are now consistently voicing doubt about Carson \u2019 s credentials to be commander in chief .\nIndeed , they said the terrorist attacks have reordered the candidates in their mind , lifting Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio and , for many , making Carson an afterthought .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a great guy , he \u2019 s fun to listen to , but I didn \u2019 t hear anything substantive , \u201d said Alan Hilgerson , a Des Moines-based physician who said national security is an `` extremely high \u201d priority for him as he considers the 2016 contenders vying for Iowa . Of Carson , he continued , \u201c I don \u2019 t know that I \u2019 d want him as my president . \u201d\nWorse yet for Carson , at the Family Leader Forum organized by social-conservative icon Bob Vander Plaats , voters said the more they thought about Carson \u2019 s foreign policy credentials , the less comfortable they were with him .\nMarilu Erdahl \u2014 who drove 2\u00bd hours in the snow to see the candidates speak , making her exactly the kind of Republican the candidates count on during the wintry caucuses \u2014 said she entered the event torn between Cruz and Carson . But as she talked through the importance of national defense , she decided on Cruz . \u201c He has experience , he \u2019 s shown what he can do , \u201d she said of Cruz . \u201c With the state of affairs we \u2019 re in right now , I think it is very important . It \u2019 s vital . \u2026 We need someone who knows the ropes , who \u2019 s not the establishment but who doesn \u2019 t need on-the-job training . \u201d\nShe went on : \u201c I guess I \u2019 ve maybe made up my mind . \u201d\nCarson and Cruz have been racing toward this collision in Iowa for weeks . Both have been courting the same Christian conservative community that makes up a crucial bloc of the state \u2019 s caucus electorate . But the turning point came when security and foreign policy were forced to the top of the GOP agenda by the terrorist attacks .\nCarson landed here fresh off a string of fumbles that included struggling to name countries he \u2019 d ask to join a coalition to fight the group known as ISIS or ISIL and smarting from a New York Times story that featured one of his own foreign policy advisers saying the candidate was struggling to grasp key issues .\nThe momentum , according to activists , state lawmakers and other voters here , now appears to be with Cruz . And he seems to know it .\n\u201c On the Republican side , I think the Paris attacks infuse a greater seriousness to the search for who is prepared to be commander in chief , who has the experience , who has the judgment , who has the understanding of the very real and growing threats facing America , \u201d Cruz told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an interview in Iowa .\n\u201c The overlay of the Paris attacks , even today , the horrific attack in Mali , makes clear that we need a president who \u2019 s prepared on Day One to understand the nature of the threats facing America and to lead this country in standing up to these threats and defending our citizens from the growing menace of radical Islamic terrorism , \u201d he said on the sidelines of the Family Leader event .\nInfluential Iowa vote-broker Steve King , who endorsed Cruz last week , pointed to a new online NBC poll that showed Carson dropping and said he attributed that slip to renewed interest in national security and Carson \u2019 s struggles with the issue . Polls conducted by more traditional methods will provide a fuller picture in coming weeks .\n\u201c They \u2019 ll often say , all politics are local , politics are domestic , domestic politics will elect the next president . I \u2019 m not sure that \u2019 s right . Not when you see the pictures of the bodies in places like Paris and around the world , Beirut , now Mali today , \u201d King said . \u201c When we see that , and we \u2019 re almost guaranteed that \u2019 s going to continue until we defeat [ terrorists ] , that makes a candidate that \u2019 s strong on foreign policy , strong on national defense \u2026 that makes that candidate stronger .\n\u201c Being [ from ] outside the Beltway doesn \u2019 t help with that .
