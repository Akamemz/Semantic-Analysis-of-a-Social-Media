    "content": "( 1 ) On policy substance -- ideology aside -- Hillary Clinton was more informed and prepared than Donald Trump by a wide margin , as expected . She also remained mostly cool and collected , even as the debate threatened to veer off the rails on several occasions . She was smug , rehearsed and pedantic at times , and exhibited some breathtaking hypocrisy ( yes , let 's hear some more about the importance of data security , Madame Email Scandal ) , but my instinct is that she won this exchange overall . She did so over the last hour-plus of the debate , pulling away after Trump held his own early . He may have been a little heavy on the interruption over that opening stretch for someone with a temperament problem , but he hit his central themes hard and pretty effectively . When Clinton went on offense over tax returns , the federal race discrimination lawsuit against Trump 's company and birtherism , his responses were woefully insufficient ( despite some flashes of decent parrying , like highlighting her deleted emails , and noting her 2008 campaign 's scurrilous anti-Obama tactics ) . She won because she baited him , and he took the bait every time , missing far too many chances to land obvious thematic and specific counter-punches -- on emails , on the Clinton Foundation , on Benghazi . Rarely did he put her on the defensive , which is n't especially hard to do . His lack of focused preparation was , once again , quite clear .\n( 2 ) Poor debate performances , temper flare-ups , and manifest ignorance occasionally dented Trump during the primary , but he always prevailed in the end . My instinct is that this night hurt him and helped her . But my instinct also told me more than a year ago that he was an unserious candidate with no chance , which was wrong ( and quickly abandoned as a working theory last summer ) . We will not have any solid grasp on how the public felt about this debate until a full round of solid , scientific polling is conducting , which will take several days . In the meantime , here is what CBS News ' focus group concluded :\nIn my focus group , 6 people said Trump and 16 said Clinton . # DebateNight\nYou can say here : https : //t.co/rFZYklEsdr \u2014 Frank Luntz ( @ FrankLuntz ) September 27 , 2016\nClinton : Firm . Same old . Knowledgeable \u2014 Rebecca Berg ( @ rebeccagberg ) September 27 , 2016\nAfter impressing in the early stages , some of his worst moments with this panel of undecided Pennsylvania voters involved Birtherism , tax returns and temperament . Did he come across as a plausible president for 90 minutes ? We 'll see what the voters say . I have my doubts . Then again , I 'm not convinced his performance was as disastrous as many talking heads are already saying . As Trump pointed out several times over the course of the night , Mrs. Clinton has prosecuted many of these lines of attack against him in a massive bombardment of paid advertising , spread over many weeks . Her standing has fallen . Did swing voters learn anything negative tonight that they did n't already know ? If Trump takes a polling hit , and he might , it 'll be because he failed the plausibility test among people who 've been giving him a chance so far .\n( 3 ) The debate over the moderator began before the evening concluded . Lester Holt did a fine job for most of the evening , not intervening too often , and using a light touch to allow the candidates engage each other . Some Trump supporters and surrogates believe his tougher questions and challenges were directed at their man , and not Hillary Clinton . They 're right . On Birtherism ( a legitimate question on which Trump did himself no favors ) , on his withholding of tax returns , on his Iraq war record , on 'say it to her face , ' and even on the 'will you respect the election 's outcome ? ' question , the sharper push-back and skeptical premises all went in one direction . Off the top of my head , I ca n't recall a single question slanted against her statements or record . I wo n't be surprised if voters at the town hall-style debate prod her with harder questions than Holt did . So while he was n't horribly biased , it seems clear that Holt took note of the Left 's over-the-top outcry against his NBC colleague Matt Lauer , and overcompensated . Working the refs works . For Democrats .\n( 4 ) I saw a fair amount of this type of analysis immediately after the debate , and I think it 's wrong :\nTrump going to the spin room is a sign he knows he lost the debate by a large margin \u2014 Dan Pfeiffer ( @ danpfeiffer ) September 27 , 2016\nThat would be true of a conventional candidate in a conventional year . But this is Donald Trump and we 're living through 2016 . Trump personally rolling into the spin room after a debate is n't an indication of much of anything , other than the fact that he floods the media zone whenever possible . He did this in the primary , he 's doing it again in the general . And he 's pummeling away at his message every chance he gets . It 's that simple , I think .\n( 5 ) An incomplete hodgepodge of memorable moments : For Trump , his refrain about Hillary embodying the same old , disappointing , under-performing system broke through early . He turned her `` experience '' argument against her twice . First , when she stated that she 'd thought about a lot of issues , he shot back `` yeah , for 30 years . '' And toward the end of the debate , after her strong 'stamina ' line , he recovered with , `` Hillary has experience , but it 's bad experience . '' Meanwhile , Clinton 's ad-makers will be busy . When she attacked Trump for rooting for the housing crash in order to make money , he did n't deny it . `` It 's called business , '' he boasted . When she speculated that he has n't turned over his tax returns ( which he later conceded he could do , against his lawyers ' advice ) because he 's avoided paying any income taxes , he appeared to confirm her suspicion . That 's `` smart , '' he said . But again , I ask : Will more seemingly devastating ads matter at all ? And when he was making a case against President Obama 's record at one point , he gestured at Hillary and referred to Obama as `` your president . '' I 'm fairly confident he meant your party/your administration , but Democrats pounced all over it as a racial code word . It will almost certainly be used to motivate black voters .
