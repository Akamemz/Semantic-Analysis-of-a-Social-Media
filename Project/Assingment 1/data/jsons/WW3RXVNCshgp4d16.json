    "content": "Understandably , given its potential for large scale loss of life and severe economic disruption , coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic has so far focused on its short-term health and economic impact . Eventually , however , we will have to start thinking about the longer-term repercussions of the virus\u2014particularly its political fall-out . According to the social science literature , there appears to be a positive correlation between the prevalence of disease and an increase in authoritarian-nationalist political views.1 This could have important ramifications in continental Europe , where several of the countries at the epicentre of the outbreak were already dealing with the rise of authoritarian-nationalist opposition parties and have upcoming elections . The possibility of the EU \u2019 s three largest economies ( Germany , France , and Italy ) shifting toward authoritarian-nationalist politics , and upending the liberal settlement of the world \u2019 s biggest economic block , means the political fall-out from COVID-19 could influence events around the world for decades to come .\nThis conjecture is built on two foundations . The first is the evidence that greater prevalence of disease increases authoritarian-nationalist politics in individuals and countries . The second is the explanation of how this occurs , which is that higher disease prevalence leads to greater \u201c disgust sensitivity , \u201d the psychological term for a stronger tendency to experience disgust , which acts as a negative moderating influence on personality traits that predict liberal political views . If this analysis is accurate , it looks likely that the COVID-19 pandemic will cause a rise in authoritarian-nationalism .\nThe evidence linking \u201c pathogen risk \u201d ( the psychological term for an increased likelihood of dangerous disease ) and authoritarian-nationalist views concerns both short- and long-term differences in ideology , across countries and cultures . A 2013 study that aimed to review the existing literature found the data \u201c provide empirical substantiation for the hypothesis that societal differences in authoritarian governance may result , in part , from ecological variation in the prevalence of disease-causing parasites. \u201d This correlation holds among individuals in some 30 countries , and in modern as well as isolated hunter-gatherer societies . Importantly , priming people with pathogen threat increased their authoritarian-nationalist tendencies immediately ( see here and here ) .\nLike most observations of human behaviour , the link between greater disease risk and authoritarian-nationalism makes more sense when put into an evolutionary context . Across the millennia in which the evolutionary influences on human nature took effect , there was what scientists have called an \u201c opportunity/parasite trade-off \u201d to changing social norms and interaction with outside groups . New practices , or interaction with outsiders , might mean innovation and trade . But they could also mean ending traditional practices that maintained cleanliness and being exposed to new diseases . It is therefore logical that we would have developed a response to higher disease risk that included becoming more politically conservative .\nIt appears that in societies and individuals , the increased risk of disease can have an impact on the personality traits ( mapped to the five-factor model of human personality ) that influence our political views . At times of high disease risk , our heightened disgust dials down \u201c openness to experience , \u201d which is positively correlated with political liberalism and negatively with authoritarian-nationalism ( this relationship appears to be true for overall ideology , attitudes to individual political issues , and party preferences ) . Historic pathogen risk predicts countries \u2019 political authoritarianism and social conformity . Even in the short-term , a sudden increase in disease risk is likely to turn the political tide away from liberalism towards authoritarian-nationalism .\nThis disease risk/liberalism trade-off is helpful when it comes to explaining the consistent victories of liberal politics , particularly in Europe . A healthier , wealthier Europe has embraced a more open politics ( the EU single market , the Schengen open border zone , pluralist democracy , and liberal individualism ) . And the rest of the world , at least the richer parts with traditionally lower pathogen risk , has followed a similar pattern . This combination of an ever-decreasing threat and ever-increasing liberalism , buttressed by other complimentary trends ( for example , higher urbanisation and education levels ) , has led the conservative author Ed West in Small Men on the Wrong Side of History to bemoan the fact that \u201c the future appears progressive and [ conservatives \u2019 ] defeat is inevitable , part of an \u2018 arc of history \u2019 that leads irrevocably to a progressive utopia in which they \u2019 re left in the dustbin . \u201d\nIndeed , some people on Twitter have argued that COVID-19 might even contribute to this \u2018 arc of history \u2019 by disproportionately killing off older voters . Such people also argue that conservative political leaders ( such as Scott Morrison in Australia , Donald Trump in America , and Boris Johnson in the UK ) might suffer politically from an \u201c incumbency effect \u201d \u2014they will be punished for being in office when the virus struck , regardless of how well or badly they handle the crisis ( although the people making this prediction all think they \u2019 ve handled it badly ) .\nBut social science suggests the opposite , at least in the medium-to-long term : The most likely political fall-out from the pandemic will be an increase in authoritarian-nationalism . That was broadly what happened after the Spanish flu broke out in 1918 \u2014 20 .\nThat pandemic was one of the worst in history , killing an estimated 50 million people . Coming as it did at the end of the First World War , and coinciding with tumultuous events ranging from the Russian Revolution to hyperinflation in Weimar Germany , its political impact is hard to isolate . But in the years that followed , America ( having suffered 675,000 flu deaths ) adopted a policy of international isolationism and higher tariffs , the far Right began to rise in Europe , and fascism emerged in a Japan ravaged by the disease . Though Britain elected its first Labour government in 1924 , the Liberal party and its associated ideology vanished so quickly that by 1935 George Dangerfield was able to write a book called The Strange Death of Liberal England . The Spanish flu pandemic coincided with a rapid turn away from a liberal global order towards authoritarian-nationalism .\nItaly is probably the best place to start in considering how the COVID-19 pandemic might change European and global politics . Italy has already felt the full force of political turmoil in recent years , with its 2018 general election seeing the populist Right win the most seats and the populist Left win the most votes . The Italians \u2019 sense of getting a bad deal from the EU , after decades of economic stagnation and bearing the brunt of the migration crisis , has been aggravated by the emerging perception that its EU allies have \u201c abandoned \u201d it during its COVID-19 hour of need . The leader of its populist Right , Matteo Salvini , has seized the opportunity to push authoritarian-nationalist rhetoric . He has already used the virus outbreak to call for tighter borders , and tweeted : \u201c When Europe has been in need , Italy has always given\u2026 Now that we are asking for help , all the [ other ] countries are starting to close their frontiers. \u201d The reaction from ordinary Italians is hard to judge , but it is the Italian Il Tricolore , not the EU flag , that gets flown in the skies by its air force , and its own national anthem that is the subject of nationally coordinated balcony singing , not Europe \u2019 s \u2018 Ode to Joy. \u2019 This undercurrent could provide fertile ground for Salvini \u2019 s campaigning in a future election that could occur at any time .\nTurning from the eurozone \u2019 s third-largest economy to its second , France was already facing a populist surge ahead of its 2022 presidential election . Marine Le Pen , leader of the right-wing Rassemblement National , has begun to lead in first-round opinion polls as Macron \u2019 s popularity has crumbled following the gilets jaunes protests . She was already pitching her campaign as an end to violence and chaos , and around \u201c patriotism , \u201d even before the pandemic arrived . Since the COVID-19 outbreak she has , like Salvini , used it as an opportunity to call for an end to the EU \u2019 s system of open borders between countries .\nEven in Europe \u2019 s dominant economy and the EU \u2019 s lynchpin member , Germany , there appears to be a high risk of post-COVID-19 political disruption . The right-wing Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ( AfD ) has been growing in popularity in recent elections , especially in the poorer east . With an election due in October 2021 , the ruling Christian Democratic Union party has already been thrown into disarray at state level by the AfD \u2019 s rise , causing the resignation of the party \u2019 s leader and presumptive nominee for chancellor . With the AfD polling around 15 percent , the party \u2019 s leader in the German parliament has argued that the COVID-19 pandemic was caused by \u201c the dogma of open borders. \u201d Goldman Sachs has echoed Chancellor Merkle in estimating that 70 percent of Germans may catch the virus . The impact of a national and global lockdown is likely to be especially severe on an export-driven economy with a strong dependence on global supply lines and pan-European trade .\nThe primary and secondary economic effects of the virus could also provide fertile ground for Europe \u2019 s authoritarian-nationalists . Populists have historically capitalised on economic downturns , particularly the type of depressions that will likely occur in the countries and continents hit hardest by the virus . In Sweden , the right-wing Sweden Democrats already lead in the polls ahead of the 2022 general election , and in Greece ( where an election is due in 2023 ) populists have enjoyed electoral success on the back of anti-EU sentiment for nearly a decade . Even in countries where the virus has not yet taken hold as severely as in Italy , the higher pathogen risk and likely economic impact of the pandemic mean that nationalist parties will find a favourable electoral climate in the coming years .\nIn countries like the UK , the US , and Australia , there is little sign that electorates will punish conservative incumbents . Donald Trump , despite widespread criticism of his handling of the crisis , has steady approval ratings ( and is already using the virus to argue for lower immigration ) ; Boris Johnson \u2019 s personal approval ratings are holding up and his party \u2019 s poll ratings have never been higher ; and Scott Morrison has regained his lead on who Australians see as the best prime minister among party leaders .\nThese anglosphere countries , and Asian liberal democracies such as Japan and South Korea , may drift in a more authoritarian-nationalist direction , but lack the tinderbox context of continental Europe . It is there that we find the volatile combination of increased disease risk ( augmented by its negative economic effects ) with rising authoritarian-nationalist opposition parties . What might the ramifications be for Europe , and the world ?\nIn the EU , the least dramatic scenario is that liberal , integrationist leaders like Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel will be forced to tread lightly and even go into reverse on further European integration . Come election time , the increasing popularity of nationalist parties will force more mainstream parties into awkward and potentially unworkable coalitions , creating an even bigger opportunity for the nationalists in the next round of elections in the mid-to-late 2020s .\nThe next step could be the end of the EU \u2019 s open border Schengen zone , and reduced economic coordination and adherence to budget rules in the eurozone . Following on so soon from Brexit , that could be a huge challenge to the future of the EU .\nAn even greater challenge would be Italy or France leaving or demanding wholesale reform of the eurozone or single market . While the EU could probably survive a Greek exit , and Germany is unlikely to countenance leaving , the EU would face an existential threat if its second- or third-largest economy was to leave or opt out of various integrationist arrangements . While Marine Le Pen has rowed back on her earlier position of demanding \u201c Frexit , \u201d she still calls for \u201c control of immigration , economic patriotism , [ and ] rational and reasonable protectionism. \u201d Salvini \u2019 s League is even more eurosceptic\u2013it renewed its campaign for Italy to abandon the euro in December 2019 , reversing its more moderate position while in government .\nFor now , politicians and voters are focusing on minimising the terrible human toll of COVID-19 . But understanding the social science literature\u2014which tells us that increased pathogen risk is likely to shift voters toward authoritarian-nationalism\u2014and taking into account the fragile state of some of Europe \u2019 s biggest economies , suggests that the political fall-out from the pandemic could be the not-so-strange death of liberal Europe . This would be an impact felt for decades to come .\nJamie Martin is a former Special Adviser to the UK Government . He tweets @ jamieamartin1\n1 In this essay I will for ease use \u201c authoritarian-nationalist \u201d to mean hostility to immigration , social conservatism , and sympathy for protectionist economic policies , and \u201c liberal \u201d to mean in favour of open markets , high immigration , and social permissiveness .",
