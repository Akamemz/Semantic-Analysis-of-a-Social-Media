He died there Tuesday night , along with another diplomat and two State Department security officers , when a mob stormed the U.S. Consulate and set it ablaze .\nThe Benghazi consulate was one of several American diplomatic missions that faced protests after the online release of a film that ridiculed Muslims and depicted the Prophet Mohammed as a child molester , womanizer and ruthless killer .\nBut U.S. sources said Wednesday the four-hour assault in Benghazi had been planned , with the attackers using the protest as a diversion .\n`` We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act , '' President Barack Obama said . `` And make no mistake , justice will be done .

The drones are expected to gather intelligence that will be turned over to Libyan officials for strikes , the official said .\nBut two American destroyers also are being moved toward the Libyan coast , two U.S. officials told CNN . Both the USS Laboon and USS McFaul are equipped with satellite-guided Tomahawk cruise missiles that can be programmed to hit specific targets .\nThe move `` will give the administration flexibility '' in case the administration orders action against targets inside Libya , one senior official said . The McFaul was making a port call on Mediterranean island of Crete , while the Laboon was outside Gibraltar , a few days away from Libya .\nLibya 's leaders apologized for the attack , with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib calling it a `` cowardly , criminal act . '' And Obama said that despite the inflammatory movie , the violence was unwarranted .\n`` Since our founding , the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths . We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others , '' he said . `` But there is absolutely no justification for this type of senseless violence -- none . ''\nU.S. and NATO warplanes helped the Benghazi-based rebellion drive on Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi last August .

A senior defense official told CNN the drones would be part of `` a stepped-up , more focused search '' for a particular insurgent cell that may have been behind the killings .\nIn June , a senior Libyan official told CNN that U.S. controllers were already flying the unmanned craft over suspected jihadist training camps in eastern Libya because of concerns about rising activity by al Qaeda and like-minded groups in the region .\nTuesday 's attack took place on the 11th anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington .
