    "content": "At the United Nations on Tuesday , Mr. Obama drove home the conclusion that he came to after his own party deserted him over a military response to the chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,000 Syrians : The bigger risk for the world in coming years is not that the United States will try to build empires abroad , he argued , but that there will be a price to be paid in chaos and disorder if Americans elect to stay home .\nTo Mr. Obama \u2019 s mind , his aides say , his worldview has changed little since he came to office in 2009 , after a campaign promising to end a \u201c dumb war \u201d and to renew outreach to America \u2019 s adversaries .\nBut his image around the world is radically different from what it once was . From South Asia to the Middle East , his presidency became known more for roughly 400 drone strikes against affiliates of Al Qaeda and cyberattacks on Iran \u2019 s nuclear program , both of which he saw as direct threats . Despite his early overtures , diplomacy in the region stagnated .\nNow , after a remarkable month that began with his planning and then aborting a Tomahawk missile strike against the military facilities of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria , Mr. Obama has recommitted himself , he told world leaders on Tuesday , to devoting the rest of his presidency to two high-risk diplomatic initiatives : finding a negotiated end to the Iran confrontation , and creating a separate state for the Palestinians that Israel can live with , without fear .\nSuccess in a region that has stymied two Bushes and two Clintons would become the legacy issue of his presidency \u2014 but three years and four months is not a long time to resolve disputes that date back decades . It was a measure of how complicated those efforts are that Iran \u2019 s president , Hassan Rouhani , shied away Tuesday not only from a handshake but also from any substantive discussion of resolving its disputes with a country it has long denounced as the Great Satan .",
