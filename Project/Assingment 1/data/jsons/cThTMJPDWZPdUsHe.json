He has to give his fellow Democrats something to go with when, eventually, the questions are asked. He also has to give his defenders in the media something to go with.\n\nHere's how it will play out.\n\nBiden will grant an exclusive, one-on-one interview with a friendly, female journalist (I mean, there are many to choose from.)

They'll all have the same rehearsed answer. \"Joe's already spoken to these allegations. It's old news. Nobody cares. Move on.\"\n\nAnd the media will, in fact, move on.\n\nThis is how they do it. It's how they've done it in the past. It's how they'll do it this time.\n\nAs Chris Plante likes to say, \"It's good to be a Democrat.\"\n\nEditor's Note: Want to support Townhall so we can keep telling the truth about Joe Biden and the liberal media coverup of the sexual assault allegation against him?
