In 2008 , as a candidate for president , Senator Obama railed against President George W. Bush \u2019 s penchant for circumventing Congress .\nNow , seven years into his own presidency , Obama is a master at executive action , pushing the envelope time and again when Congress won \u2019 t act \u2013 even after saying he \u2019 s done everything he can . Gun control is his latest mission , with new actions to be announced Tuesday , a televised town hall on the subject Thursday night , and gun violence expected to be a focus again in next week 's State of the Union address .\nOne new measure would tighten the so-called \u201c gun-show loophole '' by requiring occasional gun dealers \u2013 such as those who sell at gun shows and over the Internet \u2013 to obtain licenses and conduct background checks on buyers . In remarks to reporters Monday evening , administration officials also laid out plans to boost enforcement of federal gun laws , including the hiring of additional FBI personnel to process background checks .\nSome of Obama \u2019 s new gun measures , including an additional $ 500 million in federal funds to increase access to mental health care , require congressional approval .\nBut those enacted by executive order have the force of law \u2013 though they can be undone by the next president . And therein lies the rub for Obama : If he is replaced by a Republican , he is sure to see a raft of measures eliminated with a quick signature , on matters ranging from gun control to immigration to women \u2019 s reproductive health .\nThe large Republican presidential field has uniformly decried Obama \u2019 s aggressive use of executive power . On Saturday , front-runner Donald Trump vowed to \u201c unsign \u201d any gun control measures Obama enacts unilaterally .\n\u201c So he 's going to sign another executive order having to do with the Second Amendment , having to do with guns , \u201d Mr. Trump told a rally in Biloxi , Miss . \u201c I will veto .
