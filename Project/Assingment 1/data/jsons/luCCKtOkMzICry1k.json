Biden in a midsummer call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but said he did nothing wrong , as Democrats warned these latest charges may have \u201c crossed the Rubicon \u201d and into impeachment territory .\nLeaving the White House on Sunday , Mr. Trump insisted the conversation that has consumed Washington for several days was \u201c largely congratulatory . \u201d\nBut , he added , \u201c it was largely corruption \u2014 all of the corruption taking place . It was largely the fact that we don \u2019 t want our people , like Vice President Biden and his son , creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine . \u201d\nMr. Trump didn \u2019 t say whether he pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden , the front-runner to become his Democratic rival in the 2020 election , or other members of the Biden family during the July 25 call .\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Mr. Trump urged Mr. Zelensky \u201c about eight times \u201d to cooperate with his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani on investigating Mr. Biden \u2019 s son Hunter Biden over a possible nexus between the son \u2019 s business interests and the vice president \u2019 s push in 2016 to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor .\nThe conversation is believed to be at the heart of a whistleblower complaint that the Trump administration is keeping out of the hands of Congress , sparking yet another investigation into whether Mr. Trump used foreign actors for political gain .\nSEE ALSO : Adam Schiff : Trump withholding Ukraine aid for Biden dirt likely impeachable\nRep. Adam B. Schiff , California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said Sunday that Congress needs to know whether Mr. Trump held up $ 250 million in aid to Ukraine as part of an attempt to extract dirt on Mr. Biden . The aid was released Sept. 12 , but an unusual delay coincided with Mr. Trump \u2019 s interest in Mr. Biden \u2019 s activities .\nIf Mr. Trump demanded such a quid pro quo , then impeachment \u201c may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents , \u201d said Mr. Schiff , who long has pushed impeachment investigations against Mr. Trump .\n\u201c This would be , I think , the most profound violation of the presidential oath , \u201d Mr. Schiff told CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union. \u201d \u201c We may very well have crossed the Rubicon here . \u201d\nThe inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community , who received a complaint about Mr. Trump \u2019 s interactions with the Ukrainian leader , deemed it an \u201c urgent concern , \u201d yet acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire won \u2019 t turn over the complaint to lawmakers .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , urged Republicans on Sunday to join Democrats in calling for Mr. Maguire to \u201c obey the law \u201d and turn over the whistleblower \u2019 s complaint when he testifies before Congress at midweek .\nThe law requires Mr. Maguire to turn over the complaint , she said , so failure to do so would endanger national security and have a chilling effect on future whistleblowers .\n\u201c We must be sure that the president and his administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people , not the president \u2019 s personal or political interest , \u201d Mrs. Pelosi said in a \u201c dear colleague \u201d letter that she sent to both Democrats and Republicans .\nMany Republicans have rallied to defend Mr. Trump , either by questioning the whistleblower \u2019 s motives or calling on the media to investigate Mr. Biden .\nYet Sen. Mitt Romney , Utah Republican , said he needs to learn more about Mr. Trump \u2019 s conduct .\n\u201c If the president asked or pressured Ukraine \u2019 s president to investigate his political rival , either directly or through his personal attorney , it would be troubling in the extreme , \u201d he tweeted . \u201c Critical for the facts to come out . \u201d\nAnother Senate Republican , Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania , didn \u2019 t criticize Mr. Trump directly but did suggest it would be wrong for a president to seek a political leg up from a foreign nation .\n\u201c Look , it is not appropriate for any candidate for federal office , certainly , including a sitting president , to ask for assistance from a foreign country , \u201d Mr. Toomey told NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c That \u2019 s not appropriate . But I don \u2019 t know that that \u2019 s what happened here . \u201d\nThe president , traveling in Texas , said he will consider ways to release details about his call with Mr. Zelensky .\nHe also said he would have \u201c no problem \u201d with Mr. Giuliani testifying to Congress about his recent meetings with Ukrainians . He called his attorney a \u201c straight shooter . \u201d\nBut Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said forcing the president to hand over a full transcript of the Zelensky call would set a poor precedent regarding presidential power and diplomatic confidentiality .\nMr. Trump questioned the whistleblower \u2019 s motives , saying presidents should speak freely with foreign leaders and \u201c you can \u2019 t have people doing this . \u201d\nHe tried to flip pressure back onto Mr. Biden , pointing to the former vice president \u2019 s claim that he never spoke about business with his son despite evidence to the contrary .\n\u201c This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did , and then he said he never spoke to his son . Does anybody believe that one ? \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nMr. Trump also highlighted a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister , who said his country did not feel pressured by the U.S. during the midsummer call .\n\u201c It was a beautiful , warm , nice conversation . It was put out last night also by Ukraine , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nDemocrats say they can not rely on that statement because Ukraine is in an awkward diplomatic position and is beholden to the Trump administration for aid money for at least one year and possibly five .\nSen. Christopher Murphy , Connecticut Democrat , said Mr. Trump put Ukraine through a nervous ordeal by holding back expected aid this summer .\nMr. Zelensky was \u201c really worried about these overtures he was getting , from particularly from Rudy Giuliani , and he didn \u2019 t understand whether this was an official government position , these requests to investigate the former vice president , \u201d Mr. Murphy told NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press , \u201d recounting a visit to Kyiv .\nMr. Trump released the aid to Ukraine on Sept. 12 and even extended $ 140 million more .\nThe president downplayed the delay by saying he was worried that the U.S. was shouldering too much of the financial burden .\n\u201c I backed Ukraine from the beginning , but I \u2019 m very upset that other countries aren \u2019 t doing the same , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c Germany should be spending much more , France , all of the European Union should be spending money . Why are we spending money and they \u2019 re not ? Or at least they \u2019 re spending very little by comparison , so I \u2019 m not happy about that . \u201d\nThe White House confirmed that Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet with Mr. Zelensky on Wednesday on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly in New York , a meeting that is sure to fan the flames of the saga .\nA senior administration official said Mr. Trump will focus on \u201c congratulating President Zelensky on his election victories and the incredible energy and success President Zelensky has put forward in implementing the reform and anti-corruption efforts . \u201d",
