It \u2019 s clear now that relying on Russia for rocket engines was a policy based on hope , not good judgment , \u201d said Michael V. Hayden , a four-star Air Force general who headed the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency before his retirement in 2009 .\nThe Air Force started launching national security satellites with Russian-made rocket engines in 2000 during a time of warming relations under President Clinton . Washington and Moscow cooperated in the post-Soviet era on peaceful projects such as the International Space Station .\nRelations began to sour near the end of George W. Bush \u2019 s presidency , especially after Russia invaded neighboring Georgia in 2008 , raising speculation of a new Cold War era .\nSEE ALSO : Missing Libyan jetliners raise fears of terror attacks on 9/11\nBut the Air Force has been slow to abandon the Russian engine , critics say .\nSen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , and Sen. Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat , sent letters this spring to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and President Obama expressing concerns about the importation of the engines , hoping to prod the Air Force to action .\nLast month , Gen. William Shelton , the departing head of the Air Force Space Command , told reporters that the U.S. needs to develop its own version of the RD-180 to regain \u201c required world leadership . \u201d\nThreats by Moscow already have revealed the danger to American interests .\nAfter Mr. Obama issued sanctions against high-powered Russian officials in March , Russian Deputy Minister Dmitry Rogozin threatened to cut off U.S. supplies of the rocket engine . The threat was not carried out , but concerns were raised .\n\u201c Relying on Russian rocket engines to launch American spy satellites may have not been a problem when the U.S. and Russia were working together to build the International Space Station , but it \u2019 s definitely a problem now , \u201d said Michael Waller , a political warfare professor at the Washington-based Institute of World Politics and a vocal critic of Russian space dominance .\n\u201c The fact that we are dependent on the Russians for rocket engines gives Vladimir Putin a chokehold over the United States . \u201d\nThe Aerospace Corp. , a nonprofit , federally funded research and development center that works for the Air Force , said a U.S. version of the RD-180 may not be ready until 2022 .\nUntil then , the Air Force will have to turn to private American space companies that use rocket engines wholly made in the U.S. or continue relying on the Russian engines .\nThe Air Force has continued to use the Russian RD-180 over U.S. competitors but says it is exploring alternatives .\n\u201c We are evaluating options to end the use of Russian engines , and we are working with the executive office of the president and our interagency partners to determine future actions to take , \u201d Air Force Maj. Eric D.

Badger said the Air Force believes it has enough RD-180 engines to meet launch needs through spring 2016 .

When one of its contractors , Aerojet , heard rumors that the Russians may have leftover engines from the extinct Soviet moon program , U.S. officials traveled to Russia to investigate .\nAfter inspecting the engines , the Americans were in awe .
