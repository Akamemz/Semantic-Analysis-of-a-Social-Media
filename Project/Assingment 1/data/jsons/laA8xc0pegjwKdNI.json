Joe Manchin , D-W.Va. , and Doug Jones , D-Ala. , joined Republicans in writing to President Trump urging the implementation of Operation Safe Return -- a Department of Homeland Security pilot program that that would focus on quickly identifying , processing and returning family units who do not have valid asylum claims in the U.S .\nDHS CHIEF DECRIES 'CHILD RECYCLING ' AT BORDER , RECALLS MIGRANT WHO 'BOUGHT ' INFANT FOR $ 80 TO EXPLOIT LOOPHOLES\n\u201c Through this program , we expect that we can meet our commitments to humanitarian protections while ensuring proper efficiency , timeliness , order , and fairness in the credible fear screening process , \u201d the letter said . \u201c We also expect that Operation Safe Return will help us examine current process deficiencies , identify required increases in capacity , and understand the drivers of migration . \u201d\nThe program would allow DHS to remove family units within 15 days who are determined not to meet the criteria of \u201c credible fear \u201d of returning home necessary for an asylum claim .
