    "content": "Last night , I joined CNBC 's The Kudlow Report to discuss the recent news that 18 Senate Democrats have signed a letter urging the postponement or repeal of Obamacare 's destructive medical device tax . Conservatives have warned for years that the tax would kill jobs and undermine innovation in the field , a conclusion that some Democrats have finally embraced as implementation looms . The Left has recognized this problem all along , of course , but they needed to squeeze as much on-paper revenue as possible into the Obamacare CBO score back in 2010 in order to attract those final few votes from `` fiscally conservative '' Democrats . Now that Obamacare 's on the books , they can systematically abandon their pay-fors -- a process that 's well underway . My sparring partner in this discussion was Igor Volsky , a staffer at George Soros ' Think Progress . Larry asked him why Democrats will admit that higher taxes kill jobs in some cases , but not others . See if you can locate a concrete answer anywhere in here :\nVolsky fascinatingly set up ideological shop several steps to the left of Elizabeth Warren and Al Franken . That alone is a noteworthy feat . But the point I tried to underscore in the segment was the bizarre certitude he projected that this medical device tax will not stifle innovation or threaten jobs . The industry will emerge unscathed by the tax increase , he argued , because it 's `` narrowly tailored '' and `` fair . '' Without explicitly saying so , he 's basically accusing America 's medical innovators of lying about how the new policy will affect their companies . And implicitly , by extension , he 's suggesting that these Democrats are either gullible or corrupt for believing the lies . Apparently we 're supposed to believe that the crew over at Think Progress has more expertise on the intricacies of healthcare business models than the industry 's actual businesses do . Incidentally , MKH pieced together a useful rundown of just a handful of the tangible consequences of this Obamacare tax over the summer . Some highlights :\n( 1 ) An Indiana-based company is severely scaling back expansion plans , likely costing the US economy hundreds of jobs at five Midwestern plants that wo n't exist because of the tax . Cook Medical anticipates the device tax will cost them $ 20 million annually . ( 2 ) It took Massachusetts ' Abiomed three decades to become profitable . The new tax would have wiped out all of its 2012 profits , plunging the company $ 1.4 million into the red .
