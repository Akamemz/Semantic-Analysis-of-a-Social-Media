    "content": "The New York Times has just taken what it calls the `` rare step of publishing an anonymous Op-Ed essay '' by a `` a senior official in the Trump administration whose identity is known to us . '' Why the secrecy and urgency ? `` We believe publishing this essay anonymously is the only way to deliver an important perspective to our readers . '' The author , we 're told , would lose his ( her ? ) job if he/she went public .\nPlease . An identifiable , high-level person quitting on principle might actually command respect and change some minds . But venting that the president is an idiot and throwing a link to a Times piece on Bob Woodward 's new anti-Trump book , Fear , is hardly a profile in courage . The anonymity of the author will only work to harden Trump loyalists and members of the so-called resistance . So much for transcending partisanship among the shrinking numbers of Americans who call themselves Democrats or Republicans ( Gallup 's latest numbers put self-identified independents at 43 percent of the electorate , compared to 28 percent for the GOP and 27 percent for the Democrats ) .\nIn a nutshell , the op-ed complains that Donald Trump is `` amoral '' and `` not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making . '' Many in the White House , we 're told , are actively working to subvert the president 's agenda on certain issues , although the op-ed is weirdly filled with qualified praise , such as the claim that `` many of [ the administration 's ] policies have already made America safer and more prosperous . '' Still , the author argues , Trump is an idiot who is prevented from enacting all of his own policies by the unsung `` adults in the room '' who have created a `` two-track presidency . ''\nIn public and in private , President Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators , such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia and North Korea 's leader , Kim Jong-un , and displays little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us to allied , like-minded nations . Astute observers have noted , though , that the rest of the administration is operating on another track , one where countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly , and where allies around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals .\n`` There is a quiet resistance within the administration of people choosing to put country first , '' writes the author , wrapping in treacly clich\u00e9s of patriotism the bald fact that a duly elected president is being undermined by his own staff .\nExactly the same sort of thing , albeit in softer form , could be said about any White House . There are always factions and cross-currents . How many members of George W. Bush 's administration , for instance , really gave a shit about their boss ' desire after re-election to enact immigration and Social Security reform ? Zero . The Obama White House was riven by differences over health-care plans and foreign-policy disputes as well . Read any history of the Reagan years , and you 'll find that it was amazing that anything ever got done given all the in-fighting . Bill Clinton actually had officials resign over policy differences . It 's patently absurd to elevate frictions within the Trump White House to an existential threat to the Republic . In fact , it 's the sort of overstatement that is worthy of , well , Donald Trump , who just does n't do nuance .\nWhich is n't to say that the author 's reading of the Trump White House sounds wrong , especially in light of the revelations reportedly contained in Woodward 's book . Among other things , Woodward , whose credibility is hardly above reproach , says that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis dismissed Trump 's command to assassinate Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and instead prepared a `` more measured '' response involving bombing Syria . Woodward asserts that Mattis told colleagues that `` the president acted like\u2014and had the understanding of\u2014a 'fifth or sixth grader . ' '' Mattis has denied using such language or whatevering the president , saying , `` This is a uniquely Washington brand of literature , and [ Woodward 's ] anonymous sources do not lend credibility . ''\nNeither does the Times ' decision to publish an anonymous White House official .\nThere is no question that Trump was a uniquely unqualified candidate to run for president , and he seems to have virtually no expertise in anything other than Twitter trolling . He clearly understands nothing about trade deficits , for instance , and his policies clearly do n't add up to anything particularly coherent ( then again , they did n't on the campaign trail , either ) . He is not a traditional Republican , but since when is that an impeachable offense ? The author genuflects to John McCain , a well-respected public figure but also one whose incoherent and grandiose economic , social , and foreign policy positions were hardly worth emulating , and concludes :\nSenator John McCain put it best in his farewell letter .

The anonymous op-ed can only be read in that light and thus discounted .\nDespite the hand waving about breaking `` free of the tribalism trap , '' this op-ed is clearly in the service of the anti-Trump resistance . The real liberation is to break free of both Trump loyalism and Trump Derangement Syndrome , which both put the president at the white-hot center of every goddamn minute of every goddamn day .
