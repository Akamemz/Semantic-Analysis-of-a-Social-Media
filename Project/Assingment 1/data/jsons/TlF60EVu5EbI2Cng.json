Here \u2019 s the Project Veritas headline and story :\nInsider Blows Whistle & Exec Reveals Google Plan to Prevent \u201c Trump situation \u201d in 2020 on Hidden Cam\n( New York City ) \u2014 Project Veritas has released a new report on Google which includes undercover video of a Senior Google Executive , leaked documents , and testimony from a Google insider . The report appears to show Google \u2019 s plans to affect the outcome of the 2020 elections and \u201c prevent \u201d the next \u201c Trump situation . \u201d\nThe report includes undercover footage of longtime Google employee and Head of Responsible Innovation , Jen Gennai , saying :\n\u201c Elizabeth Warren is saying we should break up Google . And like , I love her but she \u2019 s very misguided , like that will not make it better it will make it worse , because all these smaller companies who don \u2019 t have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next Trump situation , it \u2019 s like a small company can not do that . \u201d\n\u201c This is the third tech insider who has bravely stepped forward to expose the secrets of Silicon Valley . These new documents , supported by undercover video , raise questions of Google \u2019 s neutrality and the role they see themselves fulfilling in the 2020 elections . \u201d\nJen Gennai is the head of \u201c Responsible Innovation \u201d for Google , a sector that monitors and evaluates the responsible implementation of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) technologies . In the video , Gennai says Google has been working diligently to \u201c prevent \u201d the results of the 2016 election from repeating in 2020 :\n\u201c We all got screwed over in 2016 , again it wasn \u2019 t just us , it was , the people got screwed over , the news media got screwed over , like , everybody got screwed over so we \u2019 re rapidly been like , what happened there and how do we prevent it from happening again . \u201c We \u2019 re also training our algorithms , like , if 2016 happened again , would we have , would the outcome be different ? \u201d\nSo with all those investigations into interference by Russians in the 2016 election \u2014 will there be a congressional investigation into Google ? In fact , Google executive Gennai already has an answer on what happens when Congress requests Google execs to show up for a hearing :\n\u201c We got called in front of Congress multiple times , so we \u2019 ve not shown up because we know that they \u2019 re just going to attack us .
