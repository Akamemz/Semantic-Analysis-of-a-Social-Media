( Brian Snyder/Reuters )\nThe \u2018 salacious and unverified \u2019 documents invaded the body politic like a cancer .\nThe Mueller investigation has concluded , and Mueller \u2019 s declaration has now entered the public record : \u201c The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. \u201d But it \u2019 s worth reflecting on how the contrary view \u2014 the firm conviction that Trump did coordinate with Russia \u2014 became so deeply embedded in the hearts and minds of millions of Americans . And it \u2019 s worth reflecting on why another set of Americans could look at actual , troubling evidence of Russian contacts and simply not care at all .\nThe answer is complex , but at its heart is a set of documents compiled into a collection known as the \u201c Steele dossier. \u201d The dossier , characterized by James Comey under oath as \u201c salacious and unverified , \u201d consisted of opposition research compiled by a former British intelligence officer and commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign . Taken as whole , it undermined the credibility of American intelligence agencies , corrupted elements of the media , and distorted the public debate . It may well be one of the most malignant documents in modern American history .\nI \u2019 m not going to link to the dossier , but it \u2019 s worth remembering its core claim . As explained in this December analysis in Lawfare , the document not only contained claims that Russia possessed lurid , compromising information on Donald Trump , it also made the sensational allegation that there existed a \u201c well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between [ Trump and his associates ] and the Russian leadership , \u201d including an \u201c intelligence exchange [ that ] had been running between them for at least 8 years. \u201d The very existence of this allegation detonated like a bomb in the American body politic .\nIt had an obvious distorting effect on the intelligence community and parts of the American government . To be clear , I believe that the Trump-Russia investigation would have existed even without the dossier \u2014 I \u2019 m with Trey Gowdy on that point . As Devin Nunes wrote in his famous February 2018 memorandum alleging FISA abuse , information about George Papadopoulos triggered the opening of the FBI \u2019 s counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 . Moreover , the multiplicity of problematic Trump-team contacts with Russians or Russian operatives justified an investigation regardless of the dossier \u2019 s contents or the dossier \u2019 s use by the FBI .\nThe dossier was used to form a crucial part of the Carter Page FISA-warrant applications , however : The Nunes memo notes that \u201c Deputy Director McCabe testified . . . that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the dossier information. \u201d In addition , elements of the dossier made it to lawmakers including Harry Reid and John McCain , and the FBI ultimately even briefed then-president-elect Trump about its contents . While the summary it provided Trump is still largely redacted , it is easy to imagine how the existence of such a document could enrage the president .\nI urge you to read Chuck Ross \u2019 s well-reported account of the comprehensive efforts to \u201c seed the dossier with reporters and government officials. \u201d The efforts were in fact so comprehensive \u2014 and the existence of its allegations such an open secret with the press \u2014 that I even heard about it in Tennessee during the later stages of the campaign . I was flat-out told that there was evidence Trump had been \u201c compromised \u201d by Russian intelligence .\nSalacious rumor-mongering is par for the course in politics . I \u2019 ve heard the wildest stories about even the most staid politicians . And when politicians aren \u2019 t staid , well , there are no boundaries . To this day , there are folks lurking around the dark quarters of the Internet absolutely convinced that the Clintons are responsible for a string of murders in Arkansas .\nBut even in the face of widespread rumors , responsible journalists \u2014 or journalists who aspire to responsibility \u2014 do not print the rumor , at least not without verifying or debunking it . They should not print the rumor even if they know that law enforcement is looking into it .\nLet \u2019 s try a hypothetical . Imagine if you \u2019 re a reporter and you know that local police are investigating a wild claim against a prominent local figure . You \u2019 ve started to look into the claim yourself , but so far everything you \u2019 ve learned contradicts the allegations . Do you dump it into the public domain anyway , heedless of the impact on the public or the person ?\nWell , if you \u2019 re BuzzFeed , that \u2019 s exactly what you do . While it may well be newsworthy that the FBI is looking into claims that Trump is \u201c compromised , \u201d there \u2019 s a vast difference between that factual report and just tossing a raw opposition-research file into the public square and telling people to \u201c make up their own minds . \u201d\nThat makes no sense . None . Between taking kids to soccer practice and dance lessons , parents aren \u2019 t able to determine whether Michael Cohen went to Prague .

Not punt to the public .\nBuzzFeed \u2019 s decision had two immediate effects . First , it demonstrated the extent to which an influential media outlet would depart from best practices when it possessed negative allegations against Trump .
