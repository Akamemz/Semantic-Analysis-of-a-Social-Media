That works out to nearly $ 90 a day for each person in those contract facilities .\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said there shouldn \u2019 t be any illegal immigrants in prisons , because they shouldn \u2019 t have been in the country in the first place .\n\u201c Every crime committed by an illegal alien is , by definition , a crime that should have been prevented , \u201d he said in releasing the report . \u201c It is outrageous that tens of thousands of Americans are dying every year because of the drugs and violence brought over our borders illegally and that taxpayers have been forced , year after year , to pay millions of dollars to incarcerate tens of thousands of illegal aliens . \u201d\nPresident Trump last year ordered the Justice and Homeland Security departments to produce a regular count of immigrants in prisons to give taxpayers a sense for one of the costs the government bears .\nThe total federal prison population is about 185,000 , so immigrants would account for about 31 percent . The vast majority are people who have been ordered to be deported , making them illegal immigrants once their sentences are completed . About 8 percent are illegal immigrants the government has asked a judge to order to be deported , and another 5 percent are legal immigrants whom the government is also trying to deport in light of their crimes .\nA very small number \u2014 169 \u2014 have been granted a specific protection and can not be deported .\nThe numbers are from last year , or before the new zero tolerance policy the administration has adopted at the border . Under that policy , nearly every person who crosses the border illegally is being charged with a crime for illegal entry , a misdemeanor . If they \u2019 ve been deported before and try to sneak back , they \u2019 re charged with illegal re-entry , a felony .\nOutside the prisons , the U.S . Marshals Service also held 19,688 confirmed immigrants as of Dec. 31 , and another 3,022 whose status was still being investigated .\nThose numbers could shoot up in future reports thanks to the zero tolerance policy , which is adding hundreds of immigrants a week to the court dockets in California , Arizona and Texas .\nThe report said 29 percent of the immigrants in federal prisons are serving immigration-related charges such as sneaking back in after being deported , or smuggling other illegal immigrants .\nNearly half of the migrants in federal custody were there for drug smuggling or dealing .\nSex offenders accounted for 2 percent .
