According to John Heilemann of Bloomberg , he met with a top Obama donor , gave a speech to back a minimum wage hike with Gov . Andrew Cuomo with some of the Big Apple \u2019 s most powerful unions in attendance , stood by Attorney General Loretta Lynch who announced an $ 80 million effort to get rape kits tested in a more timely manner , and of course , that emotional interview with Stephen Colbert .

Out of that loss comes a liberation from the fear of failure that dogs most politicians , and causes them to dodge , prevaricate and spin .
