''\nWhat we know : Federal law enforcement sources say authorities have recovered three weapons from the scene of the mass shooting , including one -- a shotgun -- that investigators believe he brought in to the compound . The other two weapons -- handguns -- the sources say , may have been taken from guards .\nWhat we do n't know : The sources , who have detailed knowledge of the investigation , cautioned that initial investigation information that an AR-15 rifle was used may have been incorrect . It is believed that Alexis had rented an AR-15 , but returned it before Monday morning 's shootings .\nOn Sunday , Alexis purchased a Remington 870 shotgun and a small amount of ammunition at Sharpshooters Small Arms Range in northern Virginia , the store 's attorney , J.

The ordeal ended when Washington police Officer Scott Williams fatally shot Alexis, 34, Mayor Vincent Gray told CNN.\n\nWhat we don't know: Exactly how Alexis died, beyond the fact it happened after 30 minutes of gunfire, according to Gray.\n\nHIS HISTORY\n\nWhat we know: He left New York after apparently helping rescue efforts at the site of the World Trade Center after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, according according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation. His father told Seattle police after a 2004 arrest that Alexis was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder related to that experience.\n\nHe had served in the Navy, but officials moved to discharge him in 2010 over a pattern of misconduct that included insubordination, unauthorized absences and other infractions, according to a U.S. defense official. It wasn't enough for a general discharge, so Navy officials decided to grant him an honorable discharge, the official said.\n\nAs a contractor, he worked in information technology, had medium security clearance, high enough to work at multiple Navy offices over the summer. He had an ID badge to enter the Navy Yard. His employer says the shooter jumped through all the right hoops. \"Alexis had a security clearance that was updated in July, approved by military security service personnel,\" said Thomas Hoshko, CEO at The Experts. \"There is nothing that came up in all the searches.\"\n\nHe appeared to become increasingly troubled in recent years, according to the source with direct knowledge of the investigation.

These individuals, Alexis police, had followed him to three hotels in the area -- including talking to him through walls and the floor and using \"some sort of machine\" to send vibrations through the ceiling that prevented him from falling asleep.\n\nPolice subsequently notified officials at a Navy base in Newport, the police report stated. Officials at Naval Station Newport referred CNN to the FBI on Tuesday when asked about the incident, and the FBI subsequently had no comment on the August police report.\n\nWhat we don't know: How he was able to get a security clearance with such a spotty background.\n\nFormer Navy SEAL Cade Courtley says a poor or incomplete background check is to blame. \"Most people, when they get into that, they are given an interim clearance, and that means that the background check hasn't been done but it's in the process of being done,\" Courtley said. \"He may have started out with an interim clearance and a background check should have been done.\"\n\nThe former SEAL says just running Alexis' fingerprints would have turned up his arrest record. In Seattle, he fired several shots into the tires of a car during an altercation over construction near where he lived in 2004. There was also a weapons incident in Texas in 2010.\n\nSECURITY AT THE YARD\n\nWhat we know: Alexis drove onto the grounds of Navy Yard on Monday morning with a shotgun, according to federal law enforcement sources with detailed knowledge of the investigation. He proceeded into Building 197 and opened fire. He had access to the Navy Yard because of his contracting work, and he used a valid pass to gain entry.\n\nCity police were the first law enforcement personnel on site within eight minutes of when the first shots rang out, according to Gray, and they were joined soon by SWAT team members.\n\nWashington Police Chief Cathy Lanier said there's \"no doubt in mind\" that law enforcement officers response to the shooting \"saved numerous lives.\"\n\nWhat we don't know: Even to drive or walk onto the base, a person would be required to present credentials, said Navy Capt.
