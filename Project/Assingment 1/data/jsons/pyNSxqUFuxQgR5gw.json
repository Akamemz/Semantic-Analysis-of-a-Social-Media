    "content": "Mamie Cosey and others living near downstate Sauget , a tiny , industrial town on the banks of the Mississippi River near East St. Louis , wondered for years what poisons they all could smell spewing from the three smokestacks of a waste-incinerator plant .\nTwo days before President Barack Obama left office , the federal Environmental Protection Agency ordered that the stacks be continuously monitored for arsenic , lead , mercury and other harmful metals that the 78-year-old Cosey blames for the health problems of her three great-grandchildren .\nIt was a victory environmental groups took more than a decade to secure .\nBut the French owner of the Veolia North America plant , which fought daily monitoring as too restrictive and unreliable , knew that Obama \u2019 s EPA wouldn \u2019 t have the last word . President Donald Trump \u2019 s EPA would .\nTwo months into the Trump presidency , the plant manager and the company \u2019 s lobbyist \u2014 a former Illinois congressman \u2014 traveled to Washington to meet with the new president \u2019 s embattled choice to head the agency , Scott Pruitt .\nDays later , a company lawyer emailed federal EPA staff in Chicago that Pruitt himself was stepping into the process . \u201c Administrator Pruitt is currently reviewing the next steps in Veolia \u2019 s permitting process , \u201d Veolia lawyer Joseph Kellmeyer wrote on March 31 , 2017 . \u201c I am certain that all parties involved do not wish to proceed in a manner inconsistent with Administrator Pruitt \u2019 s desires . \u201d\nThis past June , the EPA issued a \u201c final revised \u201d permit , eliminating the mandated monitoring guidelines for the plant , leaving Cosey and her neighbors in the mostly poor , largely African American community angry and frustrated .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t hardly breathe , \u201d says Cosey , who takes care of three great-grandchildren she says suffer from asthma , sinus infections and headaches . \u201c For the government to not require them to have a monitor up is ludicrous . \u201d\nIt was one in a string of decisions by the Trump administration to cut staff and relax or reverse environmental regulations and policies throughout the Midwest , a Better Government Association investigation has found .\nSince Trump took office , about 150 fewer scientists , technicians and other employees are working in the EPA \u2019 s Chicago Region 5 , covering Illinois , Wisconsin , Indiana , Michigan , Minnesota and Ohio , according to EPA figures provided by the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704 in Chicago , the EPA employees \u2019 union . The 945 employees in Region 5 this year compares to the 995 positions authorized by Congress , according to figures provided by the union and the EPA .\nThe number of inspections out of the Chicago office has plummeted by more than 60 % , while inspections throughout the rest of the nation declined by 30 % . The same pattern is true of enforcement actions aimed at getting polluters to change their actions through fines , cleanups and mitigation agreements .\nThe impact isn \u2019 t only being felt in towns such as East St. Louis and Cahokia , which are affected by the air quality in Sauget ( pronounced saw-ZHAY ) . In the Chicago area , Illinois \u2019 two U.S. senators have called for an investigation into whether politics played a part in curtailing EPA tests for cancer-causing gases at three suburban medical-equipment sterilization plants . In Minnesota , a copper and nickel mine is being allowed to discharge wastewater even though some EPA staffers have warned that threatens waterways that flow into the St. Louis River and Lake Superior .\nCathy Stepp , appointed under Trump to head the EPA Region 5 office , said in a public appearance in September that nearly 50 environmental regulations had been rescinded on Trump \u2019 s watch , saving taxpayers $ 3.7 billion . Stepp declined interview requests .\n\u201c Enforcement is an important tool to achieve compliance , but it is not the only tool , \u2019 \u2019 says Rachel Bassler , a spokeswoman for the Chicago EPA office , who says the agency now relies more on \u201c state assists \u201d and self-audits .\nEnvironmental groups fought for more than a decade for stiffer controls at the Veolia plant and began protests after Trump \u2019 s EPA started changing course .\nThe Obama EPA had issued a final permit Jan. 18 , 2017 \u2014 two days before Trump \u2019 s inauguration \u2014 requiring the installation of monitors at all three stacks to continuously record emissions of mercury , lead , arsenic and other materials for one year . Previously , the plant would measure emissions every five years .\nVeolia appealed the terms of the new permit . On March 27 , 2017 , the plant manager and company lobbyist \u2014 former downstate Democratic U.S. Rep. Jerry Costello \u2014 met with Pruitt , a longtime foe of the EPA and Trump \u2019 s pick to run the agency . Veolia argued that EPA restrictions required the purchase of $ 250,000 monitors that are largely untested and manufactured by only one company .\nVeolia \u2019 s plant manager Doug Harris says such stringent monitoring wasn \u2019 t required at any other hazardous waste incinerators throughout the country .\nRecords show the agency noted Veolia \u2019 s history of pollution violations dating to at least 2006 . Obama \u2019 s EPA cited the urgency of improved monitoring in the East St. Louis area , calling it an \u201c overburdened \u201d community that bears \u201c environmental harms and risk as a result of cumulative impacts or greater vulnerability to environmental hazards . \u201d\nHarris downplays the role his meeting with Pruitt had in rescinding the Obama-era requirements . \u201c For all I know , the Obama administration would \u2019 ve met with us , \u201d he says .\nCostello , who records show was paid $ 450,000 by Veolia to work on the company \u2019 s permit issues between 2015 and 2018 , declined to comment .\nLast year , Cosey and other East St. Louis residents were enlisted by a coalition of churches to oppose the company \u2019 s appeal .\n\u201c You are hurting my children and my community , \u201d she says , sitting in the living room of her East St. Louis home . \u201c It really was just an insult . \u201d\nShe and her neighbors have never trusted the infrequent reports coming from the plant , which burns industrial sludge and other hazardous materials .\n\u201c It sets in your throat and in the hairs in your nose , \u201d says the Rev . Norma Patterson , president of United Congregations of Metro East , a coalition of 27 churches .\nWhen Sauget was incorporated in 1926 , it was called Monsanto , having been developed as a company town for the chemical maker . From 1929 to 1977 , Monsanto produced more than 500,000 tons of the now-banned polychlorinated biphenyls , PCBs , at a plant in Sauget . PCB contamination contributed to two nearby toxic-waste sites designated for cleanup by the EPA \u2019 s Superfund program . The town , population 159 , is still home to several chemical plants and a massive regional sewage treatment plant .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a total disregard for the folks living around there , \u201d says Dale Wojtkowski , whose environmental group American Bottom Conservancy has been battling the incinerator since 2004 .\n\u201c It made me angry , \u201d he says . \u201c Especially since a lot of people put a lot of effort into it , and it affects a lot of people in an environmental justice community , lower-income people , and it seems to me they \u2019 re treated very unfairly . \u201d\nVeolia won its appeal this past June , when the EPA issued a revised permit that dropped the stricter monitoring requirements . The company instead agreed to install additional internal controls aimed at limiting only mercury emissions .\nSauget residents and their supporters say it \u2019 s impossible to know how effective those controls will be without monitors .\n\u201c For them to turn around something so different months after they issued a final permit is pretty dramatic , \u201d says Elizabeth Hubertz , a lawyer with the environmental law clinic at Washington University in St. Louis , which is appealing the new permit on behalf of the American Bottom Conservancy .\nIn Minnesota last year , state environmental officials approved a permit for a copper mine \u2014 owned by PolyMet Mining \u2014 near the St. Louis River , a tributary of Lake Superior . The permit hit a snag six months later after a leaked EPA email suggested the permit was issued under circumstances that favored the mine . It said water-contamination concerns raised by the Chicago EPA staff overseeing the permit process were kept secret from the public at the request of Minnesota state officials .\nThe controversy prompted lawsuits from environmental groups over the permit and a federal investigation into the EPA \u2019 s oversight .\nIn August , the Minnesota Court of Appeals ordered the case be returned to district court for a \u201c hearing and determination of alleged procedural irregularities related to the grant of the permit . \u201d\nA PolyMet spokesman says the permit addresses the EPA \u2019 s concerns and that the company hopes it ultimately will be allowed to start mining .\nIn Wisconsin last year , the Taiwanese company Foxconn was given a break from environmental regulators in its efforts to build a massive flat-screen electronics plant near Racine . That came after parts of Wisconsin , Illinois and Indiana were given passing grades by the EPA on air quality against the advice of the agency \u2019 s scientific staff , emails show .\n\u201c There is no credible evidence to support this , \u201d one EPA scientist , Jennifer Liljegren , wrote in April 2018 of a plan to declare southeast Wisconsin \u2019 s air quality to be in compliance with the federal Clean Air Act .\nLiljegren \u2019 s email and others were obtained by environmental groups suing to reverse the decisions . The review of Wisconsin \u2019 s air was vital to the then-proposed plant . By declaring the air clean , the EPA gave Foxconn a pass on being required to buy air filters that are required in polluted areas .\nEnvironmental groups have sued in an effort to reverse the decision .\nIn a speech last year at the Foxconn site , Trump said the plant symbolizes a manufacturing comeback under his presidency .\nIn January , Sen. Dick Durbin and Sen. Tammy Duckworth called for a federal probe of allegations of political interference in EPA decisions they say allowed cancer-causing chemicals into the air at three plants in Chicago \u2019 s suburbs . In a letter to the EPA \u2019 s inspector general , they asked for an investigation into whether Stepp halted air inspections related to the cancer-causing chemical ethylene oxide .\nIn their letter \u2014 prompted by complaints from an unnamed Chicago EPA staffer \u2014 the senators cited \u201c politically motivated interference overriding recommendations of career staff . \u2019 \u2019\nDuckworth and Durbin have criticized the EPA \u2019 s oversight at Sterigenics International plant in Willowbrook , Medline Industries \u2019 plant in Waukegan and the Vantage Specialty Chemical facility in Gurnee .\nSterigenics has since closed its facility after an order from the state and said it won \u2019 t reopen . The two plants in Lake County are still operating .\n\u201c That \u2019 s where we are right now , \u201d Duckworth says . \u201c To continue to put pressure on them but also to get an outside independent third party to take a look at what \u2019 s happening . \u201d\nDurbin says he fears staff cuts and regulatory favors for big business are threatening public health .\n\u201c If you remove the personnel that have a professional responsibility when it comes to inspections and enforcements , fewer are going to be done , \u201d he says . \u201c Some people who are vulnerable are going to find their health and safety compromised . \u201d\nAttorney General Kwame Raoul says he is challenging more than 40 of the Trump administration \u2019 s environmental and energy policies . \u201c The need to act now is urgent , and in the absence of real leadership at the federal level , \u201d Raoul says .\nJohn Kim , director of the Illinois EPA , says federal policies \u201c are weakening protections that have been effective and in place for years . \u201d\nAll of the talk is little consolation to Mamie Cosey , whose three great-grandchildren are still breathing air she doesn \u2019 t trust is safe . Twice in the past two years , she says her 15-year-old great-granddaughter was rushed to a hospital with what Cosey feared were seizures .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not safe here , \u201d she says . \u201c They can \u2019 t go out and play . We wake up at night , and it smells like someone is cooking . My children say , \u2018 Granny , please shut the door. \u2019 Kids should not have to live like that .\n\u201c We just learned to live with it . We shouldn \u2019 t have to do that in America , \u201d Cosey says . \u201c The EPA is supposed to protect the community and the people . \u201d",
