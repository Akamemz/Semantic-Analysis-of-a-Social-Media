With House Speaker John Boehner expected to announce the Republican members of the newly established Benghazi Select Committee today , House Democrats are fretting over a politically crucial call on whether to boycott the panel \u2019 s investigation or participate on some level . The turmoil among Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team who meet with rank and file members today roiled-on after the House voted 232 \u2013 186 Thursday to establish the committee charged with launching a comprehensive investigation aimed at answering lingering questions about what happened before , during and after the terror attack that killed four Americans in 2012 .\n[ Immediately after the vote , Pelosi accused Republicans of \u201c unending eagerness to exploit \u201d the Benghazi attack , adding , \u201c our nation deserves better than yet another deeply partisan and political review. \u201d Rep. Trey Gowdy , R-S.C. , who will head the panel , said , \u201c This resolution equips the select committee with the scope and tools necessary for the seriousness of this investigation . We are charged with a clear mission : uncover all the facts and provide answers to the American public . \u201d ]\nIf they stay away , who \u2019 ll protect Hillary ? - WaPo : \u201c Democrats are split over whether to boycott the select committee , which will have a 7-5 Republican edge in membership . They are concerned that their participation would grant legitimacy to what they believe will be a partisan forum . But they also worry that if they avoid it they won \u2019 t have the chance to counter GOP claims and defend potential witnesses. \u201d Read that : who \u2019 s got then-Secretary of State and current 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton \u2019 s back ? Another option , being floated by top Pelosi ally Rep. Rosa DeLauro , D-Conn. , is to empanel a single Democrat . Whatever choice Pelosi and company make will be a strategic gamble as the politically charged hearings pick up this summer , into the midterms , and beyond .\nRisky for GOP too - Charles Krauthammer points out the risks for Republicans in the hearings . \u201c \u2026 [ T ] hese hearings are a big political risk for Republicans . Going into the 2014 election , they stand to benefit from the major issues \u2014 Obamacare , the economy , chronic unemployment \u2014 from which Benghazi hearings can only distract . Worse , if botched like previous hearings on the matter , these hearings could backfire against the GOP , as did the 1998 Clinton impeachment proceedings . On purely partisan considerations , the hearings are not worth the political risk . But the country deserves the truth . They \u2019 ll get it if the GOP can keep the proceedings clean , factual and dispassionate . No speeches . No grandstanding . Gowdy has got to be a tough disciplinarian \u2014 especially toward his own side of the aisle . \u201d\nFox News Sunday - HostChris Wallace will discuss the current situation in Nigeria with John Campbell , former U.S .

The supposed list contained around 1,500 veterans being forced to wait for appointments at the hospital that resulted in more than 40 deaths . Fox News : \u201c The vote [ to subpoena Shinseki ] on the House Veterans Affairs Committee comes as Shinseki begins to face calls -- from Congress and beyond -- for his resignation . In an interview with CBS News , Shinseki brushed aside those calls , while acknowledging that the Phoenix controversy \u2018 makes me angry. \u2019 Shinseki has placed top Phoenix officials on leave as the department tries to get to the bottom of what happened. \u201d The committee chairman Rep. Jeff Miller , R-Fla. , told the WaPo , \u201c It is unfortunate that we have to come to this decision , but we did not do so without substantial justification\u2026The last few weeks have been a model of VA stonewalling , which precipitated the need for a subpoena . \u201d\nToo little too late \u2013 Arizona Republic : \u201c On Wednesday , [ Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick , D-Ariz. , ] requested nationwide audits of VA scheduling to establish whether the system is infected with \u2018 inaccurate reporting practices. \u2019 Shinseki responded in less than 24 hours , ordering reviews at all clinics \u2018 to ensure a full understanding of VA \u2019 s policy and continued integrity in managing patient access to care . \u2019 \u201d\nNew in Fox Opinion : Rep. Mike Coffman , R-Colo. , a 21-year veteran of the Army and Marine Corps , who now leads the House oversight panel with jurisdiction over the Department of Veterans Affairs , calls for Shinseki \u2019 s resignation : \u201c If the VA was a military organization run by the same standards that General Shinseki demanded of his subordinates leaders during his service in the U.S. Army , he would have been relieved of his command a long time ago for his failure to effectively provide leadership . \u201d\nSecretary of State John Kerry is hosting billionaire Democratic donor George Soros for the State Department \u2019 s upcoming Open Forum .

Ham Concert Hall , Adelson held forth on his business philosophy and rise to power as a casino titan . When the topic briefly turned to partisan politics , staunch Republican Adelson raised eyebrows when he expressed affection and respect for Reid . \u201d\nThe Hill : \u201c A leading healthcare analysis group said Thursday that insurance premiums in some states might see double digit increases this year under ObamaCare , but not because of age discrepancies . \u2018 Despite initial concerns about the age mix of exchange enrollees , the current age distribution appears to be close enough to plan projections to avoid driving major premium increases , \u2019 said Avalere Health in a new analysis . However , the group said increasing cost of medical care , use of services and new technology will mean exchange plans will need to increase their premiums , and the hikes will vary state by state\u2026 . Last month , the younger demographic was crucial in tipping enrollment numbers over 8 million . However , Avalere said young enrollment numbers are not uniform throughout the country , and success of the new healthcare law will depend on making sure they continue to enroll . \u201d\nAre you sick and tired of that red bar on your phone warning you that your battery is about to give out ?

The event was billed as a Democratic Governors Association event and Crist has the national party \u2019 s implicit support in his bid to unseat Gov . Rick Scott , R-Fla. , but Smith reports that \u201c the event had turned into a shindig principally for Arkansas gubernatorial candidate Mike Ross. \u201d Crist reportedly wasn \u2019 t present , which Smith attributes to the fact that Crist \u2019 s rival for the Democratic nomination , former state Sen. Nan Rich , called in a favor from longtime friend Hillary Clinton . Crist seemed to indicate that he would attend . Crist has so far refused to debate Rich , a South Florida liberal who is calling attention to Crist \u2019 s myriad changes of position .

Michelle Obama was picked by 24% and Laura Bush \u2013 Barbara Bush\u2019s daughter-in-law \u2013 carried 17%.\u201d\n\nPOWER PLAY: TAR HEEL TEA LEAVES\n\nDemocratic Internet impresario Joe Trippi and Republican strategist Ron Bonjean join host Chris Stirewalt to discuss the North Carolina Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan and Republican challenger Thom Tillis. What\u2019s the outlook for this race and what does it say about other primary contests? Watch the newest edition of Political Pros here.\n\n[The National Republican Senatorial Committee launched a two and a half minute bio video explaining Tillis\u2019 family values and how that transcends into this public work.]\n\nLANDRIEU LOWER THAN EVEN\n\nThe Hill: \u201cSen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) posts her lowest level of support yet in a new poll of her tough reelection fight. The survey, from Louisiana-based bipartisan pollster Southern Media & Opinion Research, gives Landrieu just 36 percent support among likely voters to 35 percent support for Rep. Bill Cassidy (R). Retired Air Force [Col.] Rob Maness (R) takes 7 percent and state Rep. Paul Hollis (R) has 4 percent support. Seventeen percent are undecided. \u2026The SMOR poll also shows her deeply underwater, nearing President Obama-levels of disapproval. Fifty-eight percent disapprove of her job performance, while 64 percent disapprove of the president\u2019s. Only 39 percent of respondents view the incumbent positively.\u201d\n\n[In a new SMOR poll, 63 percent of Louisiana voters said they were against ObamaCare, including 79 percent of undecided voters.]\n\nSwamp thing - Republican Senate hopeful Rob Maness is standing up to big Washington in a not so conventional way: wrestling an alligator. In the first TV ad of his campaign, Maness tussles with the reptile saying, \u201cHere in Louisiana you learn to be tough. One moment of weakness and the alligators eat you alive.\u201d He continues, \u201cLouisiana needs a senator who will stand up to career politicians\u2014and the alligators.\u201d If no candidate reaches 50 percent of the vote in the all-party November 4 primary, the top two finishers will face off in a December runoff.\n\n[New Orleans Times-Picayune: \u201cUnderdog Louisiana Senate candidate Rob Maness picked up the endorsement Thursday of Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and the 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate.\u201d]\n\nNEBRASKA RACE TURNS TO IMMIGRATION\n\nIt\u2019s the last weekend before Nebraska's Tuesday primary, and the nasty contest to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., will turn to immigration. The top two Senate hopefuls are GOP Establishment backed former state Treasurer Shane Osborn and Tea Party supported Midland University President Ben Sasse. Osborn accepted the backing of the key author of Arizona\u2019s immigration law, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, Thursday. Osborn appears to be taking a similar approach to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who used immigration as a weapon against conservative foes in 2012. However, banker Sid Dinsdale, who is in third place in the polls, stayed on the sidelines of the back and forth battle between Sasse and Osborn. Thursday, the Sasse-backing Club for Growth launched an ad attacking Dinsdale as \u201ctoo liberal.\"\n\nLAND BASHES PETERS ON KEYSTONE MEETING WITH STEYER\n\nThe Detroit News: \u201cRepublican Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land is unveiling two new Internet ads that criticize her rival [Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich] for opposing the Keystone XL pipeline and tying him to a billionaire. \u2026Her ads cite media reports that Peters attended a Feb. 19 event with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and former Vice President Al Gore at the San Francisco home of Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge fund manager who has vowed to spend tens of millions in favor of candidates who oppose the pipeline. \u2018Gary Peters \u2014 working for billionaires not Michigan,\u2019 say the two ads from Land. \u2018Steyer could make millions by killing the pipeline by investments in Keystone\u2019s competitor.\u2019\u201d\n\nPICK SIX\n\nThe status quo in Washington and President Obama\u2019s second-term agenda depend largely on Democrats preventing Republicans from gaining six seats, and thereby a majority, in the Senate.

The event was billed as a Democratic Governors Association event and Crist has the national party\u2019s implicit support in his bid to unseat Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., but Smith reports that \u201cthe event had turned into a shindig principally for Arkansas gubernatorial candidate Mike Ross.\u201d Crist reportedly wasn\u2019t present, which Smith attributes to the fact that Crist\u2019s rival for the Democratic nomination, former state Sen. Nan Rich, called in a favor from longtime friend Hillary Clinton. Crist seemed to indicate that he would attend. Crist has so far refused to debate Rich, a South Florida liberal who is calling attention to Crist\u2019s myriad changes of position. From Smith\u2019s column: \u201cWhen I asked Thursday if the Clintons were supporting her, Nan was guarded. \u2018I doubt President Clinton would endorse anybody in the primary, but I really believe he and Hillary know where I stand, what I can do and are on my side.\u2019\u201d The primary is set for Aug. 26.\n\n[Reuters: \u201cFlorida Democrat Charlie Crist is exploring a possible trip to Cuba this summer as part of his campaign to win the state\u2019s governorship, in a move his supporters call bold but detractors say would be a betrayal of Miami's large Cuban exile population.]\n\nFLORIDA WOMAN GOES ALL IN ON SPRING CLEANING\n\nFlorida Times-Union: \u201cWhen a 62-year-old St. Johns County woman decided she didn\u2019t like the sort of people who had been living next door, a bulldozer solved the problem. \u2026 The woman told a heavy equipment operator she owned the trailer on Dusty Road and wanted it and its septic tank destroyed\u2026 The arrest report said Moreta Folch had the trailer bulldozed because people who had lived there were unsavory and she suspected they had broken into her car. She said she considered it a favor to her neighborhood. Damage was estimated at $25,000.\u201d\n\nAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cEvery time you want to cut, Democrats are saying orphans are going to end up out in the snow, the border will be open, we\u2019re not going to be able to put \u2013 it\u2019s ridiculous. Everybody understands billions are wasted absolutely stupidly every year. And if you could start with that, you could have enormous reductions in spending but the way to do it is to mandate the reductions in advance and then you say you do it\u2026 And they will do it if they have to, if that is the law.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
