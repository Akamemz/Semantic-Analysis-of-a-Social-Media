''\none way the system survives congressional action is that power flows to non-congressional branches\nDouthat may , depending on the details of the policy , be right that Obama intends to push presidential authority beyond where it should properly go . But he skips too lightly over the role congressional dysfunction plays in empowering the executive branch . `` Incompetence and gridlock are significant problems , indeed severe ones , but they 're happening within the context of a constitutional system that allows for \u2014 and can survive \u2014 congressional inaction , '' he says .\nThat 's true , so far as it goes .
