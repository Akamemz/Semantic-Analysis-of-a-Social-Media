It \u2019 s sad to see what was once allegedly a man be utterly emasculated in public and then proceed to dance to please his new masters . He ought to be , and henceforth shall be , known as Jeff ! since he \u2019 s essentially Jeb ! without the pedigree or \u2013 here \u2019 s the scary part \u2013 the spine . Yeah Jeff ! , you \u2019 ll get your one-shot 60 Minutes tongue bath , and there \u2019 s probably a 3:00 a.m. Sunday MSNBC program in it for you , wedged between reruns of Lockup . A hosting gig for a crappy show on a doofus network is today \u2019 s equivalent of 30 pieces of silver .\nFlake does not care about you Normals , especially you Normals from the Grand Canyon state who are now regretting your decision to send McCain Superlite to the Senate . At least John McCain , for all his faults , flew fighters and took no guff ; Jeff ! takes a little guff from some shrieking leftist in an elevator and he \u2019 s suddenly primed for his Democrat buddies to talk him into helping carry some of the wood for the Brett Kavanaugh witch burning .\nThe \u201c Democrat buddies \u201d part is key . See , they are his real constituency . Like all Fredocons , he chose trying to please his elite pals over keeping his promise to serve Normals like you . But , of course , he \u2019 s been doing that for a while , ever since he was so greatly disappointed in you for choosing Donald Trump and not Moby McMuffin or even Felonia Milhous von Pantsuit . So , it was no surprise that the Dems ID \u2019 d him as the weak link , swarmed , and rolled him . In a town like DC that is known for changing the soft and feckless , Jeff ! was especially mushy and feck-free .\nHis real concern was not enacting the conservatism he endlessly talks about but conforming to the bizarre norms and taboos of the elite he aspires to , because if you do \u2013 if you prove yourself by slavish acceptance of their twisted , reality-defying fetishes \u2013 you will be richly rewarded . You have to demonstrate your acceptance of the ridiculous concept that no woman can ever lie about sexual assault , despite the Duke lacrosse team and UVA scams . You have to demonstrate your acceptance of the ridiculous concept that the weather in a couple centuries is going to kill us off because you \u2019 re too selfish not to ride a bike to work and want to drink out of a straw , even though the high priests of the weird climate cult are so concerned that they fly everywhere in private jets .\nMostly , you have to demonstrate your acceptance of the ridiculous concept that Normal Americans are morally and intellectually unfit to participate in their own governance , despite the fact that we built this country , fed it , fuel it , and defend it . And you have to demonstrate your acceptance of the ridiculous concept that the elite is elite because of some track record of achievement , despite hiccups that we Normals pay for like Iraq , the 2008 meltdown , Obamacare , and sidewalks covered with bum droppings .\nMy new book Militant Normals : How Regular Americans Are Rebelling Against the Elite to Reclaim Our Democracy explains why Jeff ! and his sorry ilk side against the people who send them to Washington , and it does it in a lot more detail and with a lot more snark than possible in one column . You must order it now because it comes out tomorrow . Order it to own the libs and the conservasissies .\nJeff ! \u2019 s flake illustrates the disconnect between status-obsessed elites and the Normals . Jeff ! wanted his pals to think he was sensitive and caring and concerned with process and blah blah blah . He wanted the elite \u2019 s acceptance , and if Kavanaugh \u2019 s family had to go through more hell , okay . He knows this is all a scam . He knows this is a grift . He knows it \u2019 s a delay designed to let Stripper Matlock or some other bottom feeder come up with a new pack of lies about how Brett Kavanaugh ran an international sex ring during his Bud Lite blackouts back in \u2019 83 .\nBut Jeff ! mostly had to do what the elite in this country do instead of actually achieving anything \u2013 he signaled . He signaled to his elite pals , \u201c Hey , I \u2019 m one of you , not one of them , not one of those icky Normals . \u201d\nAnd , while they will pretend to welcome him and give him a seat at the cable kiddie table , they are laughing at him .\nFortunately , he \u2019 s gone . He quit knowing the people of Arizona would vote for a rotting cactus rather than him in the GOP primary . Of course , to Jeff ! , what happened is that the people of Arizona grew unworthy of him . They no longer meet his exacting standards . Jeff ! is too good for them , to pure , too elite , so he sadly must to deprive them of his virtue .\nIt \u2019 s happening a lot . The sissies , punks , and RINOs are going away . The hacks of Conservative , Inc. , are right about one thing \u2013 it \u2019 s a new GOP . It \u2019 s a GOP that fights . Oh , not all of them . You still have weak sisters like Collins and Murkowski . Collins is safe because she \u2019 s about as conservative as Maine is going to get , and Murkowski is getting primaried if she backstabs us . But Normals have put righteous fear into the rest of them .\nThe conservagimps want to claim that the Republicans are now the Party of Trump , but that \u2019 s a self-serving narrative designed to obscure the fact that they brought their downfall upon themselves through their legacy of failure in the fight against progressivism . Donald Trump is the avatar of the Militant Normals . None of the establishment was fighting for their rights and their interests , so they found someone who would and would not apologize for doing so .\nOur new crop of candidates gets it . Except for that insufferable loser Mitt Romney , the McMullin of 2012 who can \u2019 t help but suck up to the establishment and media who humiliated him by thanking them and asking them if he may have another , the candidates looking to win in red states are solid . With the Kavanaugh atrocity activating conservative-leaning Normals , we stand to do very well \u2013 assuming we don \u2019 t get petulant because a few has-beens have collaborated with the enemy .\nKavanaugh is a boomerang that can come back and knock the Democrats out . They counted on stripping off the suburban women \u2019 s vote that had been going GOP . But those suburban women have sons , brothers , and husbands whose lives can be ruined in an instant over some uncorroborated baloney from three decades ago if the Democrat \u2019 s new rules go into effect . A vote for a Democrat is a vote against due process , a vote against justice , and a vote against men .\nThat \u2019 s a pretty crummy platform if you are seeking to appeal to Normals , but inside the elite bubble it makes perfect sense .\nSo , focus on the fight . Don \u2019 t play the Democrat \u2019 s game and walk away from the GOP because Jeff ! walked away from you . He \u2019 s a nobody who will be gone in a couple months . He \u2019 s nothing .
