    "content": "Poll : Americans Overwhelmingly Say Impeachment Hearings Wo n't Change Their Minds\nThe country is witnessing one of only a handful of times in its history that Congress has gone through with public hearings on whether to impeach a president . And yet , the overwhelming majority of Americans across parties say nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment , according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll .\nHalf of Americans said they approve of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 about the same as the poll found last month . Respondents are also split on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office .\nBut 65 % of Americans say they ca n't imagine any information or circumstances during the impeachment inquiry where they might change their minds about their position on impeachment . And 30 % say yes , it 's possible .\nIt 's a tangible example of just how locked in most Americans are in their partisan positions , even as nearly a dozen people have either testified or are set to testify in the impeachment inquiry . The poll was conducted Nov. 11-15 \u2014 before , during and after the testimonies of the first three witnesses to be called in the inquiry .\nEight more people are slated to testify this week . The inquiry centers on the accusation that President Trump , through his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others , pressured Ukraine to conduct investigations of conspiracy theories related to the 2016 presidential campaign and Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid and a White House meeting for Ukraine 's president .\n`` We 're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive , '' Barbara Carvalho , director of the Marist Poll , said of the impeachment inquiry . `` What we 're seeing is people just locking in . ''\nDemocratic leaders held off on aggressively pursuing impeachment for months fearing a backlash from the public . So far , that has n't happened .\nBy 47 % -41 % , Americans say they are more likely to support impeachment based on what they 've heard or read from the testimonies and evidence presented . And the testimonies could actually be serving to harden their views \u2014 86 % of Democrats said they are now more likely to support impeachment after hearing testimony and evidence , while 83 % of Republicans said they are less likely to now support impeachment .\nSome 70 % of registered voters say they 've been paying `` very '' or `` fairly '' close attention to the House impeachment inquiry . And 53 % of those paying at least fairly close attention say they 're more likely to support impeachment .\nDemocrats are the ones following most closely with 78 % saying they 're doing so , compared with 68 % of Republicans and 66 % of independents .\nHalf of people say they approve of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 50 % \u2014 compared to 43 % who do n't . That 's about the same as in the poll a month ago ( 52 % to 43 % ) . But Americans are pretty much split down the middle \u2014 45 % to 44 % \u2014 on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office .\nThere is little question , however , what Americans think of Trump 's conduct on that now-infamous July 25 call , in which Trump asked the president of Ukraine for a `` favor '' to conduct the investigations .\nSeventy percent say it is not acceptable for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent . That includes 53 % of Republicans who say it 's either unacceptable ( 37 % ) or they 're unsure ( 16 % ) .\n`` They think it 's wrong , '' Carvalho said . `` They disagree on whether it 's impeachable or not . ''\nMost Americans also think the whistleblower 's identity should be protected \u2014 56 % say so ; 39 % say the person should be revealed . There 's a big partisan split , however , with 83 % of Democrats saying the person should be protected , and 78 % of Republicans saying the person should be revealed .\nOn the 2020 presidential contest , 69 % of Democrats say they 're happy with the field . Less than a quarter say they 're not .\nThree-quarters of Democrats also say they still have n't made up their minds on who to vote for , down only 7 points since July , the last time the question was asked in the survey .\nThe survey also asked a battery of candidate qualities that would make a voter most `` enthusiastic '' to vote for that person .\nBeing a woman is the most desirable quality in a candidate among all registered voters . But there were big differences by party . Democrats would be most `` enthusiastic '' about voting for a woman , someone who is gay or lesbian , or someone under 40 .\nThe top three qualities for Republicans , on the other hand : a business executive , a white man or a woman .\nPresident Trump 's approval rating has remained remarkably steady since taking office , and this survey is no different .
