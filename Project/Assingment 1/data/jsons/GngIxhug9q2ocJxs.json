    "content": "Rudy Giuliani ignited a media firestorm with media appearances in which he disclosed and explained President Donald Trump \u2019 s reimbursement of a $ 130,000 pre-election payment to a porn star who appeared to be ready to go public with a story about a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier .\nSome pundits are going so far as to call the former New York City mayor \u2019 s actions the equivalent of a \u201c murder-suicide \u201d that devastated Trump \u2019 s legal defense , but how much damage did Giuliani actually do to Trump \u2019 s legal case ?\n\u201c Trump is in considerably more potential legal trouble than he was before Giuliani opened his mouth , \u201d said Rick Hasen , a University of California at Irvine law professor and a prominent expert on campaign finance .\nOther legal experts said Giuliani \u2019 s remarks about the arrangement between the president and Michael Cohen , his longtime personal attorney , might not have been helpful to Trump but didn \u2019 t really put him in greater jeopardy .\n\u201c His comments have no impact on the legal fact that the payments by Mr. Cohen to Stormy Daniels were consistent with a long pattern of payment by businessman Trump and the Trump Organization to protect their reputation , \u201d said Charlie Spies , an election attorney with the Washington law firm Clark Hill . \u201c They don \u2019 t have to stop defending him just because there \u2019 s a campaign going on . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 . You can unsubscribe at any time .\nHere \u2019 s a look at some of the potential impacts of Giuliani \u2019 s dramatic disclosure and his ensuing remarks :\nDoes the president \u2019 s admission strengthen or weaken the case that the Stormy Daniels payment broke campaign finance law ?\nGiuliani stressed repeatedly in interviews that the money used to reimburse Cohen came from Trump \u2019 s personal funds and not from any campaign account , but the critical legal question is whether the original payment to Daniels or the reimbursement were intended to advance Trump \u2019 s electoral chances .\n\u201c It certainly increases Trump \u2019 s exposure , but we need to know more , \u201d Hasen said . \u201c If he knew about it at the time of the campaign , it looks like Trump could have committed a campaign finance violation and potentially a willful one . \u201d\nSome legal experts disagree , arguing that a payment over an alleged affair would never or almost never be a campaign contribution that must be reported , especially where a prominent individual is involved .\n\u201c This is financing related to an intensely intimate personal matter , and the [ campaign finance ] laws don \u2019 t apply , \u201d said Jan Baran of the D.C. law firm Wiley Rein . \u201c There has to be some objective way to measure whether something is campaign-related . \u2026 There was a time people would keep their personal relations like this quiet because it would be death to them politically , but that isn \u2019 t the case anymore , obviously . \u201d\nOne open question is what emails , recordings or other evidence seized from Cohen \u2019 s online accounts and his home , office and hotel room give prosecutors insights into Cohen \u2019 s motivation in arranging the payment in October 2016 . Indications that it was urgently necessary because of the looming election could make a charge of a legal violation more likely .\nGiuliani may have unintentionally fueled that perception on Thursday morning when he noted the way that publicity about Daniels \u2019 claims could have hurt Trump \u2019 s campaign .\n\u201c Imagine if that came out on Oct. 15 , 2016 , in the middle of the , you know , last debate with Hillary Clinton , \u201d Giuliani said . \u201c Cohen didn \u2019 t even ask . Cohen made it go away . He did his job . \u201d\n\u201c He suggested the motive for the payment was to help Trump in the campaign , which was the last thing you \u2019 d want a lawyer saying on this , \u201d the law professor said .\nWas Trump \u2019 s embrace of the Daniels payment a signal to Cohen not to \u201c flip \u201d and turn on the president ?\nTrump \u2019 s defense team has been concerned in recent weeks that Cohen might agree to cooperate with federal prosecutors and seek leniency by offering them information \u2014 accurate or inaccurate \u2014 about Trump . Some analysts saw the president \u2019 s acknowledgment of the payment as a bid to discourage Cohen from making such a move .\n\u201c The strategy might be , let \u2019 s try to keep Cohen on the president \u2019 s side , \u201d said Laurie Levenson , a former federal prosecutor who \u2019 s now a professor at Loyola Law School . \u201c There \u2019 s going to be enormous pressure on Cohen . Cohen might end up pointing the finger back at the president . And while he \u2019 s said he \u2019 ll be loyal , at that point , loyalty only goes so far . \u201d\nGiuliani \u2019 s statement that Trump reimbursed Cohen and a later comment that Trump has known about the Daniels situation in general terms for a long time suggest that Cohen may be off the hook on a potential charge of making an illegally large in-kind donation to Trump \u2019 s campaign . However , if it was for campaign purposes , even a loan of the money should have been reported . It may have not been Cohen \u2019 s duty to report it , but he could still face a charge related to concealing it or causing it to be omitted from campaign finance reports .\n\u201c Cohen and Trump may not have had a credible story before , but at least it was consistent , \u201d said Peter Zeidenberg , a former federal prosecutor now with the D.C. law firm Arent Fox . \u201c Now , they \u2019 ve junked it all . I think it \u2019 s a mess , and it doesn \u2019 t get him out of the soup . I don \u2019 t understand the value at all . \u201d\nCould Trump face other charges like bank fraud or structuring ?\nOne drawback to the strategy reflected in Giuliani \u2019 s statements is that they tie Trump more closely with Cohen , who \u2019 s known to be under investigation for possible bank and wire fraud , in addition to campaign finance violations . It seems unlikely that Trump would be involved in some aspects of Cohen \u2019 s financial affairs known to be under scrutiny , like financing for taxi medallions .\nThere has been some speculation about Trump \u2019 s facing legal jeopardy because , according to Giuliani , Cohen was reimbursed in $ 35,000 increments . However , criminal charges for structuring generally apply only to cash withdrawals or deposits , and there \u2019 s been no indication Trump paid in cash .\nWill Trump \u2019 s apparent lie have any legal consequences for him ?\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One on April 5 , Trump said he didn \u2019 t know about Cohen \u2019 s $ 130,000 payment to Daniels . Now , Giuliani says Trump did know something about it .\n\u201c He did know about the general arrangements , \u201d Giuliani , a former prosecutor , told Sean Hannity on Wednesday night .\nMany people are calling Trump \u2019 s statement a flat-out lie , although Giuliani and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders insisted that Trump became aware of details about the payments only about two weeks ago .\n\u201c This was information that the president didn \u2019 t know at the time but eventually learned , \u201d Sanders told reporters on Thursday .\nThere are strong reasons to doubt that Trump was entirely unaware until mid-April that Cohen had paid off Daniels . On Feb. 27 , Cohen sought a restraining order against Daniels , saying she violated the \u201c hush money \u201d deal . On March 6 , Daniels sued Trump and Cohen in a bid to void the alleged agreement . It seems likely that those events would have triggered the president or his lawyers to inquire about when Daniels was paid , why and how much .\nWhile it \u2019 s not a crime to lie to reporters or the public , legal experts say that if Trump knew the Cohen payments were the focus of a criminal investigation or Federal Election Commission review , deliberately trying to confuse investigators could form the basis for an obstruction-of-justice charge . Normally , however , prosecutors cite a public statement along with other facts showing what amounts to a deceptive scheme .\n\u201c It is one factor , if you could build a series of misstatements , \u201d said Levenson , the Loyola law professor . \u201c You don \u2019 t want to put too much stock into any individual statements . You want to build a pattern of conduct . \u201d\nMany lawyers said on Thursday that while Giuliani \u2019 s presentation might have been ham-fisted and at times counterproductive , he and Trump might have had little choice but to get out the fact that Trump was involved in reimbursing Cohen \u2019 s payment to Daniels .\nIn recent days , Cohen \u2019 s attorneys began receiving copies of the records seized from his office , home and hotel room early last month . If those records contained enough information to make clear that Trump did have a role in the payment , that fact was certain to emerge eventually . So there \u2019 s some rationale for Giuliani \u2019 s going on a friendly show like \u201c Hannity \u201d and offering up the unexpected news .\nEven if the payment were purely personal , might Trump have broken another law ?\nTaking Giuliani at his word that the money sent to Daniels had nothing to do with the campaign , Trump might still be guilty of another crime : filing a false personal financial disclosure report . Cohen \u2019 s decision to pay Daniels and then collect the money from Trump over time seems like a loan to Trump , but it was never reported on his financial statement filed with the Office of Government Ethics last year .\nThe watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint on the issue with the Justice Department back in March and updated it on Thursday with Giuliani \u2019 s statements .\n\u201c Trying to talk his way out of a campaign finance violation , Trump has admitted to filing a false financial disclosure in 2017 , \u201d Walter Shaub , a former OGE director , wrote on Twitter .\nCould linking Trump to the $ 130,000 payment bolster Daniels \u2019 two pending civil suits against him ?\nYes . At a minimum , Trump \u2019 s acknowledgment of involvement makes it far more likely that he \u2019 ll have to submit to a deposition on the topic , legal experts said .\n\u201c I think at this point , he \u2019 s setting himself up to be subject to a deposition , \u201d Levenson said . \u201c I think it 's extremely beneficial to the civil cases . \u201d\nOne of Daniels \u2019 suits seeks to void the \u201c hush money \u201d deal and accuses Cohen of defamation . A case filed earlier this week accuses Trump of defamation . Responding to Giuliani \u2019 s initial comments , Trump took to Twitter on Thursday morning to call Daniels \u2019 claims \u201c false and extortionist accusations. \u201d That will likely result in a broader libel suit from Daniels against Trump , also adding Giuliani as a defendant , lawyers said , although it could be some time before either case progresses to a stage where Trump \u2019 s testimony is ordered .\n\u201c Whatever happens @ foxandfriends , please do not stop helping our case week in and week out by having Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani appear and make damaging stmts , \u201d Daniels \u2019 attorney , Michael Avenatti , tweeted Thursday morning . \u201c You are truly THE BEST ; where can we send the gift basket ? \u201d",
