    "content": "Over the past three decades , the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) has seen its taxpayer-funded budget doubled . Then doubled again . Then doubled again . And then nearly doubled once more .\nBut spending nearly 14 times as much as we did in 1987 on the agency whose mission statement says it `` saves lives and protects people from health threats '' did not , apparently , help the CDC combat the emergence of the biggest disease threat America has faced in a century . In fact , a new report argues , inflating the CDC 's budget may have weakened the agency 's ability to handle its core responsibility by giving rise to mission creep and bureaucratic malaise .\n`` The CDC devolved into an agency incapable of adequately addressing the serious threat posed by infectious disease , particularly novel diseases for which there is little information about risk , spread , and treatment , '' says Michelle Minton , a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a free market think tank .\nMinton is the author of a newly released study showing just how far the CDC has strayed from its core mission . In addition to combating dangerous infectious diseases like HIV and malaria , the CDC now also studies alcohol and tobacco use , athletic injuries , traffic accidents , and gun violence . While those things can indeed be important factors to public health , Minton notes , they do n't seem to fall within the agency 's original mission .\nThey do , however , explain why the CDC 's budget has ballooned from $ 590 million in 1987 to more than $ 8 billion last year . If the agency had grown with inflation since 1987 , it would have a budget of about $ 1.3 billion today . Total federal spending , meanwhile , has grown from a hair over $ 1 trillion in 1987 to $ 4.4 trillion last year\u2014which means that the CDC 's budget has grown faster the government 's overall spending .\nHas all that extra funding made America safer ? In 2019 , the CDC spent $ 1.1 billion on its National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion , which focuses on ailments like heart disease , cancer , and diabetes . The CEI report notes that there are at least 10 other federally funded agencies\u2014mostly within the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) \u2014engaged in similar health and wellness research .\nInstead of spending billions of dollars in recent years to duplicate work being done by other federal agencies , hindsight now suggests that the CDC should have spent more time and money researching emergent influenza-like infectious diseases , a project that received just $ 185 million in funding last year . This is a failure of priority-setting by both the CDC and Congress , which ultimately controls the purse strings .\nInstead , the CDC was doing things like spending $ 1.75 million on the creation of a `` Hollywood liaison '' whose job was to help movies and TV shows write more accurate storylines about infectious diseases . A 2007 report published by the office of late Sen. Tom Coburn ( R\u2013Okla . ) found that the CDC funded the position with money originally earmarked for combating bioterrorism and appointed a semi-retired employee to run the office . The same report calls out the CDC for lavish spending on a new headquarters and visitor center that opened in 2006 . The agency blew through more than $ 10 million in new office furniture and built a $ 200,000 fitness center and $ 30,000 sauna on site .\nIt would be one thing if the CDC was merely wasting money on saunas and duplicative research , but the agency has also been pushing agendas that were counterproductive to public health . In the months before the coronavirus pandemic hit , the CDC was on the front lines of a `` war on vaping '' that came in response to a brief panic over deaths caused by black market THC vape pens .\n`` Even though it was clear early on that vaping-related lung injuries overwhelmingly involved black-market cannabis products , the CDC repeatedly intimated that legal , nicotine-delivering e-cigarettes might kill you , '' \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Jacob Sullum reported in March . `` That message endangered public health by implying that people\u2014teenagers as well as adults\u2014would be better off smoking , which is demonstrably not true .
