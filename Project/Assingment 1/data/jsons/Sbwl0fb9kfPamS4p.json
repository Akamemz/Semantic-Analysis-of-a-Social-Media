It is whether he can beat Joe Biden, an epidemic, a recession, and a few swing voters who just may have had enough of Captain Chaos.\n\nTeam Trump should be worried.\n\nRepublicans will nod their heads and pump their fists when Trump unloads both 12-gauge barrels on Biden, charging that he is senile, fragile, doddering, weak, confused, unsteady, unreliable, and at the center of a family network of rapacious political profiteering. But don\u2019t expect that to be a knockout punch, even if you think it should be \u2014 Republicans are not Trump\u2019s problem: Democrats and independents are.\n\nAll Biden really has to do is mend fences with the Sanders gang. Trump has a steeper hill to climb. In 2016, he won critical victories in Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 but in none of those states did he break 50 percent. Trump\u2019s margin of error is tiny.\n\nThe line that Trump is sure to deploy against Biden already has been tried in the primary \u2014 and Trump should take note: It did not work, in spite of the best efforts of Sanders\u2019 surrogates who are every bit as vicious as Trump can be. Charging that Biden is senescent did not work on Democrats in Michigan or Minnesota, and it is not working in Pennsylvania, where Biden leads Sanders by 25 points in the polls \u2014 and where he leads Trump by 4.\n\nComplaining about Biden\u2019s gaffes is like complaining about Trump\u2019s spelling or his adultery \u2014 it\u2019s nobody\u2019s news flash.\n\nBiden\u2019s remarkable comeback saw him ruthlessly push out every significant opponent save Sanders and then face off with the socialist from Vermont from Brooklyn and beat him like a rented mule.\n\nAnd even if Biden is personally weak, the machine for which he serves as a mascot is as powerful as ever \u2014 and it will be even more powerful once the Sanders faction has remembered that it hates Trump more than it resents the DNC.

That was before the stock market tanked 20 percent in response to the Wuhan plague and the Trump administration\u2019s incompetent response to it, including the president\u2019s error-laden Wednesday evening speech that sent markets plunging again on Thursday morning.
