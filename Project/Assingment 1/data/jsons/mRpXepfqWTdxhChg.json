During that appearance , which came on Tucker Carlson 's show , Rowe perfectly diagnosed the problems he sees in America today .\nBut his being on Fox News was just too much for one fan .\nAccording to a fan named `` John Ray , '' Rowe 's appearance on Fox News and his `` cozying up to the right wing '' is doing nothing but `` pissing off people who would otherwise love you . ''\n`` I totally get that you think they are 'furthering your cause ' , but they 're not , '' John Ray wrote . `` All you are doing is pissing off people who would otherwise love you . I 've been with you from the beginning , but this 'cozying up to the right wing ' stuff is getting increasingly hard to take . And that includes the Koch boys . ''\n`` Please , go back to being 'just Mike ' , so * everyone * can support you , '' the fan added .\nRowe began by pushing back at John Ray 's criticism that he is not being impartial by appearing on Fox . Rowe said he never claimed to be impartial , only `` partial to people who are willing to work hard and master a skill that 's in demand . ''\nLook , I get that you don \u2019 t like Fox , or Tucker , or Hannity , or Charles Koch .

Where were your words of encouragement when I appeared on MSNBC , Meet the Press , NPR , GMA , The Today Show , or Real Time with Bill Maher ? Where were your positive comments when I had a weekly show on CNN for the better part of two years ? When I appear on liberal platforms , as I often do , why do you never thank me for \u201c cozying up to the Left ? \u201d I welcome your criticism John , sincerely , as well as your advice , but please , spare me the whole , \u201c I \u2019 ve been with you from the beginning \u201d routine .

Like yours , their threats are those of a kidnapper , trying to ransom an item of no value .\nIn the end , Rowe explained John Ray 's `` assumptions are rooted in a fundamental misperception .
