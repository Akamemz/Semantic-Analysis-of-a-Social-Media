Federal appeals courts across the country have rejected efforts to phase out the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA , but the administration has looked to the high court for support .\n`` The administration has basically chalked up the fact that they are going to lose a lot of these cases in the lower courts , '' said Thomas Dupree , a former top Bush Justice Department official and now an appellate attorney .\n`` But they 're playing the long game .

''\nAn estimated 700,000 young adults currently in the DACA program could be affected , with a ruling for the administration potentially putting them at risk for deportation once again .\nThe Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program in 2017 , only for the federal courts to rule that it could not apply retroactively and that DACA should be restarted in full . The White House fought back on those decisions , saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy .\nDACA proponents have argued that Trump \u2019 s planned termination violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed , as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees .\nThe Supreme Court took the unusual step of taking up the cases before they had been fully heard at the lower court level . Those federal courts have issued nationwide injunctions , blocking the administration 's plans , at least for now .\nThe Trump administration argues that the DACA program is not working and is unlawful , and that the president should have the `` absolute discretion '' to adopt a revised overall immigration strategy .\n`` Given the unacceptably high numbers of illegal border crossings , '' the Justice Department wrote in its appeal to the Supreme Court , `` it was critically important for DHS [ Department of Homeland Security ] to project a message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear , consistent , and transparent enforcement of the immigration laws against all classes and categories of aliens .
