The pattern of Rice \u2019 s requests was discovered in a National Security Council review of the government \u2019 s policy on \u201c unmasking \u201d the identities of individuals in the U.S. who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping , but whose communications are collected incidentally . Normally those names are redacted from summaries of monitored conversations and appear in reports as something like \u2018 U.S . Person One. \u2019 The National Security Council \u2019 s senior director for intelligence , Ezra Cohen-Watnick , was conducting the review , according to two U.S. officials who spoke with Bloomberg View on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly . In February Cohen-Watnick discovered Rice \u2019 s multiple requests to unmask U.S. persons in intelligence reports that related to Trump transition activities . He brought this to the attention of the White House General Counsel \u2019 s office , who reviewed more of Rice \u2019 s requests and instructed him to end his own research into the unmasking policy . The intelligence reports were summaries of monitored conversations \u2014 primarily between foreign officials discussing the Trump transition , but also in some cases direct contact between members of the Trump team and monitored foreign officials . One U.S. official familiar with the reports said they contained valuable political information on the Trump transition such as whom the Trump team was meeting , the views of Trump associates on foreign policy matters and plans for the incoming administration .\nAlso on this trail was Fox \u2019 s Adam Housley . The Housley headline :\nSusan Rice requested to unmask names of Trump transition officials , sources say\nMultiple sources tell Fox News that Susan Rice , former national security adviser under then-President Barack Obama , requested to unmask the names of Trump transition officials caught up in surveillance .

The names were part of incidental electronic surveillance of candidate and President-elect Trump and people close to him , including family members , for up to a year before he took office .\nWhatever else is learned in these two bombshell stories , it is that word is beginning to get out about who in the Obama administration not only had access to this classified information , but actually requested or \u201c consumed it. \u201d The fact is that people who do not have access to certain information are in no position to leak information they don \u2019 t have .
