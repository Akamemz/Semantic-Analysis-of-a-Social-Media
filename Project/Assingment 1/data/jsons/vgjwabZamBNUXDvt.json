Hillary Clinton , and the media , were bashed to no end .\nThose were the headlines from this week \u2019 s Conservative Political Action Conference , a celebration for the GOP \u2019 s activist set and one of the first major Republican cattle calls of the 2016 presidential race . Beneath the surface , though , the confab revealed much about the contours of the emerging primary fight .\nBush showed he has a template for defending himself from attacks that he \u2019 s too moderate . Chris Christie \u2019 s slide continued . And Carly Fiorina positioned herself as Clinton \u2019 s main antagonist .\nScott Walker , meanwhile , is challenging Paul for conservative supremacy . Then there are two candidates who are about to make life difficult for their GOP rivals .\nFor Bush , the event had all the makings of a disaster . In recent weeks , prominent conservatives had criticized him . His support for comprehensive immigration reform and Common Core education standards \u2014 positions that are anathema to those gathered at the confab \u2014 had been rehashed . And his political pedigree had been railed against by tea partiers .\nIn the end , he beat expectations . In a 20-minute question-and-answer session with Fox News host Sean Hannity , Bush gave a forceful defense of his tenure as Florida governor . He spent much of his time offering detailed explanations for his support for in-state tuition and driver \u2019 s licenses for undocumented immigrants . He also defended his education positions , though he stressed that the federal government should play a limited role in school policies .\nIn each case , Bush , who \u2019 s quickly emerged as the establishment favorite , placed his more moderate positions in the context of what he said was a broader , more conservative , record . At the same time , he didn \u2019 t stake out positions too far to the right \u2014 something that could make his path to a general election win tougher .\nWhen Hannity asked Bush about his ideological philosophy , he coolly answered that he \u2019 s a \u201c practicing , reform-minded conservative . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s not to say it was a totally smooth appearance for Bush .
