    "content": "Invoking the Clintonian precedent as a moral justification for Team Trump \u2019 s actions is ludicrous .\nOn Tuesday morning , I posted this mini-screed about how nobody knows anything about the Russia-collusion story , so the best course of action is to just wait for the facts to come in .\n( I wanted to turn this into a Latin slogan , but when I typed \u201c Trust Nothing , Defend Nothing \u201d into Google \u2019 s Latin translation thingamabob I got \u201c Nihil confido , nihil pupillo defendite viduam. \u201d This looked fishy to me so I translated that back into English and got : \u201c I trust there is nothing , there is nothing , for the fatherless , plead for the widow. \u201d This seems either like World War II code for \u201c We \u2019 re invading Belgium on Wednesday \u201d or the sign-language subtitles from Charlie Rose \u2019 s interview of Paco , the chain-smoking existentialist gorilla ) .\nThis was bipartisan advice . On the one hand , the media get lots of stuff wrong and get way ahead of the facts . So , we should give Donald Trump some benefit of the doubt . On the other hand , the Trump White House lies like a randy sailor with eight hours of shore leave and not enough money for a professional \u201c date . \u201d\nBut the lying really isn \u2019 t the problem . Sometimes the Trump team tells the truth . Sometimes it buries the kernels of truth in the larger nougat of B.S . The problem is that Trump and his people can \u2019 t stay on message , whether it \u2019 s true or false . President Trump just doesn \u2019 t care if he makes his surrogates , including members of his cabinet and family , look like chumps . Allow myself to repeat myself :\nIf there is one thing we \u2019 ve learned from this president , it \u2019 s that going too far out on a limb brings out the saw . Poor Steve Mnuchin . He went out on Sunday and heaped praise on this joint US-Russia Cyber Fox Force Five idea that the president blurted out on Twitter . Within a few hours , Trump left Mnuchin out to dry . It happens again and again .\nShortly after I said , \u201c wait and see because we don \u2019 t know anything yet , \u201d we suddenly got some new information . Donald Trump Jr. released his e-mail chain about a meeting with a Russian lawyer . In this exchange , Rob Goldstone , who looks like he could land a great role in a Guy Ritchie remake of Boogie Nights , says :\nThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father . This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government \u2019 s support for Mr. Trump \u2014 helped along by Aras and Emin .\nI know everyone knows this stuff already . But I really want to make a few interrelated points .\nFirst , according to Team Trump , this was a bold and laudable act of \u201c transparency . \u201d\nUm . No . This transparency \u201c argument \u201d is like a dye-marker to see who is intellectually serious and who is part of the great Trump Aqueduct , carrying water for the president wherever and whenever he needs it . Junior released his e-mail chain minutes before the New York Times could publish it . This is like \u201c bravely \u201d admitting to your wife that you cheated on her seconds before she opens the blackmailer \u2019 s envelope containing the 8\u00d710 glossies of you at the Motel 6 with a troupe of dwarf \u201c acrobats \u201d using you like a pommel horse .\nHeading off the Times was smarter than the alternative , just as telling your wife about your time with the cast of Le Petite Cirque du Soleil before the blackmailers get to her is better than the alternative . But after spending the better part of a year denying any contact whatsoever with the Russians and lying so baldly about this meeting , it takes a Costco pallet full of chutzpah to claim the mantle of transparency .\nThis , of course , is all the more true now that it \u2019 s being reported that Junior wasn \u2019 t being transparent while he was bragging about his transparency . This morning , news came out that some sketchy former Soviet counter-intelligence officer was also in the room . ( What are the odds he recorded the conversation , by the way ? I \u2019 d say they \u2019 re pretty high . )\nSecond , this underscores a point I \u2019 ve been shouting at the TV all week : Why the Hell are people taking the word of anyone in that meeting as proof of anything ? Before this morning \u2019 s revelation , even members of the Trump-hostile press repeated that \u201c nothing came of the meeting \u201d or that \u201c no information was given. \u201d On the Trump Aqueduct , this was translated into the whole story being a \u201c nothingburger . \u201d\nWhere did the proof of this come from ? From the people in the room ! Jiminy Cricket , that \u2019 s stupid .\nWho in that room do you think is above lying about what transpired there ?\nIt may be true that nothing came of the meeting . Heck , I think it probably is true ( more on that in a moment ) . Junior seems plausible when he says as much . But every single person who was in that room has a very strong incentive to say nothing nefarious happened in the room . Well , when the Soprano crew is jointing a corpse in the backroom of Satriale \u2019 s , everyone there has a vested interest in sticking to the story that they were just playing cards .\nWho in that room do you think is above lying about what transpired there ? Paul Manafort ? Forget his deep Russian connections . The guy was a lobbyist for Mobutu Seske Seko . When he worked for the Pakistani intelligence service , he pretended to be a CNN reporter for a propaganda documentary he was making for them . The only way you could say \u201c that man \u2019 s word is oak \u201d is if Jell-O came out with a new oak-flavored pudding . ( \u201c Now with real bark ! \u201d )\nJared ? The guy who initially \u201c forgot \u201d that meeting happened at all ?\nDon Jr. ? We already know he \u2019 s capable of lying about the meeting because he \u2019 s already lied about the meeting .\nOh , maybe you \u2019 re taking the word of the sketchy Russian lawyer . That \u2019 s a great idea . It \u2019 s also kind of hilarious . Many of the people pushing back on this story are doing so by questioning Natalia Veselnitskaya \u2019 s credibility . But we should take her word that nothing happened ? Cults of personality are a helluva drug .\n[ While I was editing the galley of this \u201c news \u201d letter , the Associated Press reported that the sketchy former Soviet counter-intelligence guy , Rinat Akhmetshin , who was in the room claims that Veselnitskaya did indeed hand over a file of incriminating info . I guess this is just a smudge on the window of Junior \u2019 s transparency . ]\nWhich brings me to point No . 3 . It doesn \u2019 t frick \u2019 n matter if \u2014 note the \u201c if \u201d \u2014 nothing came of the meeting . Junior can \u2019 t claim he , Manafort , and Kushner never sought to collude with the Russian government when he admits that he , Manafort , and Kushner eagerly took a meeting for the express purpose of colluding with Russia . This is like one of those episodes of Dateline \u2019 s \u201c To Catch a Predator \u201d where some sleazebag is catfished into having a \u201c date \u201d with a 13-year-old girl only to show up and find Chris Hansen waiting in the kitchen with a transcript of their conversations . At least those scumbags had the \u201c integrity \u201d to lie and say it was all a misunderstanding and that they were just there because they really like hanging out and watching MTV and eating ice cream . \u201c We had a lot in common ! I thought we could be friends ! \u201d\nI don \u2019 t recall any of them saying , \u201c Hey , I didn \u2019 t do anything wrong because I didn \u2019 t actually get a chance to rape her . \u201d\nIf you break into a bank , you can \u2019 t claim you did nothing wrong if the safe turns out to be empty any more than a terrorist can plead innocence if his bomb didn \u2019 t go off .\nWhich brings me back to my first point of the week . Why on God \u2019 s good Earth would you defend any of this ? Since I \u2019 ve been having this ridiculous argument all week , let me skip ahead . Yes , \u201c Crooked Hillary , \u201d Ted Kennedy , and a host of other liberals did bad things . Whether those bad things were analogous to this is highly debatable . But let \u2019 s just concede the point for argument \u2019 s sake . Let \u2019 s also accept the president \u2019 s grotesquely cynical and false claim that pretty much anyone in politics would have done the same thing and taken the meeting . ( I for one am perfectly happy to concede that Sidney Blumenthal would happily have done equally sleazy things for his Queen-master . But I have every confidence that if some shady Russian cutouts approached , say , James Baker with a similar scheme to \u201c incriminate \u201d Michael Dukakis , he would become a helicopter of fists . )\nWhy on God \u2019 s good Earth would you defend any of this ?\nBut here \u2019 s the thing : Who gives a dirty rat \u2019 s ass ? If you spent years \u2014 like I did , by the way \u2014 insisting that the Clintons were a corrupt affront to political decency , invoking their venal actions as a moral justification for Team Trump \u2019 s actions is the rhetorical equivalent of a remake of Waterworld set entirely in the main vat of a sewage-treatment plant , i.e. , the intellectual Mother of Sh * t Shows . This is a point Ben Shapiro made well earlier this week ( and which I \u2019 ve been writing about for two years now ) . If you want to make the case that Democrats or the media are hypocrites , whataboutism is perfectly valid ( and quite fun ) . But if you want to say that it \u2019 s fine for Trump to do things you considered legally and morally outrageous when Hillary Clinton did them , you should either concede that you believe two wrongs make a right or you should apologize for being angry about what Clinton did . And you should be prepared to have no right to complain when the next Democrat gets into power and does the same thing .\nAll of this said , I don \u2019 t think we are anywhere near impeachment . The cries of \u201c treason \u201d are ridiculous . But I for one no longer believe that the collusion thing is mostly hype . We already know that Trump openly implored the Russians to dig up Clinton \u2019 s e-mails . We now know that Junior , Kushner , and then\u2013campaign manager Manafort had no problem meeting with a person they believed to be an emissary of the Russian government . Moreover , not only am I unconvinced nothing damning happened in that room , I think there \u2019 s merit to Chris Hayes \u2019 s analysis that there was an important phone call before the meeting .\n\u2026 does don jr \u2019 s email thread reveal he might have had a phone conversation before the meeting ? @ chrislhayes walks us through it . # inners pic.twitter.com/ppluP5Vtp3 \u2014 fake nick ramsey ( @ nick_ramsey ) July 13 , 2017\nI also think there are many shoes to drop with regard to Cambridge Analytica and the Mercers .\nErick Erickson may be right that this meeting was a setup .
