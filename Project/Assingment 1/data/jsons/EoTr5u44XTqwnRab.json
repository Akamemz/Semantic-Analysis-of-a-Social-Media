It 's just tough , '' Santorum said about another White House run .\nThe former Pennsylvania senator tells The Associated Press in an interview that he is n't ruling out a 2016 candidacy .\nBut , he says , there are plenty of reasons why he would n't do it .\nHe is enjoying a second career as a movie studio executive . His daughter 's health remains a concern .\nAnd , Santorum writes in a new book , he can help shape his party 's future from offstage .\nIn the interview , Santorum said the GOP will struggle to win races unless candidates came up with policies that help working Americans .\nVictories will be tough , he said , unless elected officials stop being obstructionists .\nSantorum said the libertarian streak running through his party distorts the definition of freedom , and that politicians wrongly look to President Ronald Reagan 's policies to address today 's challenges .\nThen there 's Santorum 's slap at Republicans who demonize social welfare programs .\n`` Do Republicans really care less about the person at the bottom of the ladder than Democrats do ? To be painfully honest , I would have to say in some ways 'yes , ' '' Santorum writes in his book , `` Blue Collar Conservatives : Recommitting to an America That Works . ''\nThe tough talk raises questions about Santorum 's viability in what could be a crowded 2016 primary field .\nAlso , he 's not rushing to camp out in early nominating Iowa or New Hampshire again .\n`` A while . A year at least , probably , '' he said of his timeline to decide on a 2016 bid .\nSantorum ran an upstart campaign in 2012 , surviving long enough to be Mitt Romney 's last remaining rival . He struggled to raise money or support among establishment-minded Republicans , but his socially conservative profile drew enough backing for Santorum to pick up victories in 11 states .\nEven in victory , his disorganized campaign cost him , including failing to qualify for the ballot in Virginia .\n`` We can not run the campaign we ran last time if we run this time , '' Santorum said .\nHow Republicans win is the focus of Santorum 's latest book , to be released Monday .\nSantorum offers ideas on energy , education , the economy and health care . It comes across as part think tank policy paper , part campaign playbook and part communications advice on how to connect with working-class voters .\nFor instance , Republicans should not focus exclusively on business leaders and `` job creators '' and should speak to employees , Santorum said .\nAnxiety among those voters remains high , and Republicans have for too long talked to the top earners and not the workers .\n`` A rising tide lifts all boats \u2014 unless your boat has a hole in it . A lot of Americans , we 've got holes in our boats , '' Santorum said . `` Millions and millions of Americans ( are ) out there who want good lives but have holes in their boats . ... They just see the water level going up and their boat sinking . ''\nThat 's why , he argues , candidates need to put forward policies to help those voters .\n`` I 'm looking at 2014 and I 'm thinking the Republican Party is heading toward No-ville , which is 'we 're against this , we 're against that , we 're against this . ' We 're not painting a positive vision for America , '' Santorum said in the interview .\nAfter the 2012 campaign , he signed on as CEO of EchoLight Studies , which produces movies rooted in faith and family .\n`` I saw an opportunity to do something in the space where we need to have movies that have a faith message in them that are better than the movies that have been done , '' Santorum said .\nAt home , 5-year-old daughter Bella keeps Santorum busy . She has a genetic disorder , Trisomy 18 , which causes brain , heart and internal organ developmental abnormalities . Almost all children die within the first year of life .\nBella turns 6 in May and the senator is at work on a book about his daughter . Her difficult nights have sometimes kept Santorum at her bedside .\nSantorum said family issues would drive his decision to run or not , and Bella would be a key factor .\nHis other six other children , Santorum said , are `` all very open to dad doing this again . ''\nBut Santorum is n't rushing into anything . A primary might feature the libertarian wing of the party , led in part by two prominent tea partyers , Sens .
