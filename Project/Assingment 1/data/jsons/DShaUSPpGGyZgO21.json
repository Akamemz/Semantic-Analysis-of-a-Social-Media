There are few filters between President Donald Trump 's mind and mouth . That is his appeal and his weakness . It is very common that a person 's strengths are also weaknesses . I wish Trump 's tweets and comments were as forthright -- as un-P.C . -- as they are now but stated in a sophisticated way . I also wish that cheesecake were not fattening . But just as cheesecake comes with sugar , Donald Trump comes with unsophisticated rhetoric . People are packages , not a la carte menus .\n2 . As a rule , a president of the United States should not label countries , let alone continents , `` s -- -holes . '' I do n't know what word the president actually used , but had he used the word `` dysfunctional '' instead of `` s -- -hole , '' that actually might have been a service to the people of many of these countries . I have been to 20 African countries . Corruption is Africa 's greatest single problem . That 's why those who truly care about Africans , many of whom are terrific people , need to honestly describe the moral state of many or most African countries . What benefit is it to honest , hardworking Africans or Latin Americans or others to deny the endemic corruption of these societies ?\nAs Guatemalan columnist Claudia Nunez wrote on Trump in the Guatemalan newspaper Siglio 21 : `` The epithets he uses to describe certain groups are unfortunate and exemplify the decadence of the current political scene . But he has also said things that are true , for example , that it is we citizens of migration countries who have accommodated ourselves to the need to export people , as we have calmly allowed excessive levels of corruption to grow for decades . ''\n3 . Though many wonderful immigrants come from the world 's worst places , there is some connection between the moral state of an immigrant 's country and the immigrant 's contribution to America . According to data from the Center for Immigration Studies , 73 percent of households headed by Central American and Mexican immigrants use one or more welfare programs , as do 51 percent of Caribbean immigrants and 48 percent of African immigrants . Contrast that with 32 percent of East Asians and 26 percent of Europeans .\n4 . The press 's constant description of Trump as a racist , a white supremacist , a fascist and an anti-Semite has been a Big Lie . It is meant to hurt the president , but it mostly damages the country and the media . To cite the most often provided `` evidence '' for the president 's racism , the president never said or implied that the neo-Nazis at the infamous Charlottesville , Virginia , demonstrations were `` fine people . '' The `` fine people '' he referred to were the pro- and anti-statue removal demonstrators .\n5 . Why are the left 's repeated descriptions of America as `` systemically racist '' not the moral equivalent of the word `` s -- -hole '' ? The left 's descriptions of America and its white majority are at least as offensive , less true , and not made in private or semi-private conversations but in the open ( in most college classes , for example ) .\n6 . The poor choice of language notwithstanding , can any countries be legitimately described as `` s -- -holes '' ? As Ben Shapiro , a never-Trumper , wrote , `` The argument that Trump is wrong to call some countries s -- -holes comes down to nicety , not truth -- which is why Rich Lowry of National Review took Joan Walsh of CNN to the woodshed over whether she 'd rather live in Haiti or Norway . '' Walsh refused to respond , giving the specious response that she has n't been to either country .\n7 . That the president allows himself to speak openly to Democrats -- whose overriding ambition is to undo his election -- is testament to his self-confidence , if not his hubris . And his naivet\u00e9 .\n8 . What people say in private is neither my business nor my concern . That 's why I wrote a column in The Wall Street Journal in the 1990s defending Hillary Clinton against charges of anti-Semitism for allegedly directing expletive-filled anti-Jewish comments in private against a Jewish campaign official she felt was responsible for Bill Clinton 's lost congressional race . Former President Harry Truman 's private use of the word `` kike '' was also mentioned . In the Age of Non-Wisdom in which we live , many well-educated people ( and , therefore , often the least wise among us ) think private speech reveals all you need to know about someone . But in truth , private speech may reveal nothing about people . If everything you or I said in private were revealed to the world , we could all be made to look awful .\n9 . The Washington Post reports that the president also said he would be open to more immigrants from Asian countries . That would seem to invalidate the racism charge . Had he just met with the prime minister of Singapore , as he had with the prime minister of Norway , he may well have said we need more immigrants from Singapore . As the never-Trump editors of National Review editorialized , `` What he was almost certainly trying to get at , in his typically confused way , is that we 'd be better off with immigrants with higher skills . ''\n10 . The left has lost all credibility in using the term `` racist . '' The University of California lists as an example of a `` microaggression '' the statement `` There is only one race , the human race . '' The left labels anyone who opposes race-based quotas , or all-black college dorms , or the Black Lives Matter movement `` racist . '' And it labeled President Trump 's Warsaw-speech call to preserve Western civilization a call to preserve white supremacy .
