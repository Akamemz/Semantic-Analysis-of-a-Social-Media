Now it looks like President Trump is going to put their beliefs to the test .\nTrump \u2019 s new tax plan would hit blue states hardest , by eliminating the federal deductibility of state income and property taxes . That \u2019 s going to make it harder for blue states to maintain the high tax rates they \u2019 ve traditionally levied .\nRight now , if you pay state property or income taxes , you can deduct them against your federal income taxes . In effect , it means that if you \u2019 re in a high federal bracket , your state taxes may be offset by that federal deduction to the tune of 40 % or more .\nEnd the federal deduction , though , and high state taxes come straight out of taxpayers \u2019 pockets with no offset . As economist Nicole Kaeding told The Hill , by allowing deductions for state taxes , \u201c the federal government is essentially subsidizing high tax rates in states like California and New York . \u201d\nThe National Journal \u2019 s Ronald Brownstein calls this `` an offensive against blue states , '' but as Brad Todd replied on Twitter , \u201c I think what you mean is it ends imbalanced federal subsidy for big government at the local level . \u201d\nI think that \u2019 s right . States should be able to set their own levels of taxing and spending , but I see no reason why a Walmart cashier in Tennessee ( which has no state income tax and low property taxes ) should be subsidizing a hedge fund mogul in New York or a studio executive in Hollywood . It \u2019 s fine if blue states want to have higher state and local tax rates , as they do , but they shouldn \u2019 t be encouraged to do so by federal tax giveaways . And it \u2019 s the urban , coastal areas that have done best over the past 25 years , so it seems time for them to pay their fair share now .\nIn that spirit , I have a few other proposals . First , we should eliminate the mortgage interest deduction . Experts have been calling for that for years , and they \u2019 re right to .
