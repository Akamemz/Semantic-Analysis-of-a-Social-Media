But it wasn \u2019 t clear whether Republicans could hold an impeachment trial that both ended relatively quickly and didn \u2019 t do much damage to Trump electorally . Witnesses would both lengthen the trial and increase the possibility of compelling details being unearthed that might make the president and his aides look bad .\nIt therefore looked from the start of the trial like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republicans would work to avoid including witness testimony . But then The New York Times reported on Sunday night that former national security adviser John Bolton described in his upcoming book that Trump personally told him of the strategy to delay military aid to Ukraine unless the Ukrainians investigated the Bidens .
