    "content": "American democracy\u2014or , at least , the California simulation of it\u2014requires that even disinterested and actively hostile non-voters mark a ballot so government officials can gin up participation numbers , says Assemblyman Marc Levine ( D-San Rafael ) . Levine has introduced a bill that would make voting compulsory , with civil penalties for the non-compliant . It 's a proposal that seems guaranteed to make disaffected non-voters become even less impressed with a sketchy political process .\nIf passed , the measure would `` require a person who qualifies and is registered to vote to cast a ballot , marked or unmarked in whole or in part , at every election held within the territory within which the person resides and the election is held . The bill would require the Secretary of State to enforce this requirement , '' according to the summary .\nIn defending the bill , Levine points to the 20-plus supposedly healthier democracies around the world that have some sort of compulsory ballot-marking on their law books . The number is a bit vague , since several countries have experimented with mandatory voting , then dropped it , while others implement it only regionally , and still others have it on the books but do n't bother with enforcement .\n`` Can a country be considered to practice compulsory voting if the mandatory voting laws are ignored and irrelevant to the voting habits of the electorate ? '' asks the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance . `` Is a country practicing compulsory voting if there are no penalties for not voting ? What if there are penalties for failing to vote but they are never or are scarcely enforced ? Or if the penalty is negligible ?
