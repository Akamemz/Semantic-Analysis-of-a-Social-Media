He wrote on CNN that `` we should direct the focus of NASA efforts on establishing a permanent human presence on Mars by the 2030 to 2040 decade . ''\nFurther afield , one of the biggest space milestones of the year was the crossing of Voyager 1 out of the solar system . There 's no border crossing agent out there , so scientists had to figure out on their own whether the probe had truly entered uncharted territory .\nThe probe , which launched with its twin , Voyager 2 , in 1977 , made history as the first human-made object to leave the heliosphere , the magnetic boundary separating the solar system 's sun , planets and solar wind from the rest of the galaxy . We did n't get confirmation from scientists until well after the actual event took place , though . A study in the journal Science suggests the probe entered the interstellar medium around August 25 , 2012 .\nJUST WATCHED NASA : Voyager has left the solar system Replay More Videos ...

Thanks to the new data from the European Space Agency 's Planck space telescope , which studies light left over from the Big Bang , scientists now believe that the universe is about 100 million years older than they thought .\nA space telescope with a different mission , called Kepler , gave us hope for finding distant planets with life , but also suffered serious setbacks .\nThe Kepler space telescope has led scientists to believe that most stars in our galaxy have planets circling them . But the spacecraft ran into some trouble this year : The failure of a control mechanism used to keep the device focused on distant stars with pinpoint accuracy . But NASA says it still hopes to find another role for the craft , which has confirmed the existence of more than 135 planets since its launch in 2009 .\nAsteroid `` 2012 DA14 , '' measuring 150 feet wide , passed by Earth on February 15 .\nAs we tracked the progress of machines that humanity sent out of this world , we also watched out for approaching space rocks -- and not all of them flew by gently .\nA whopper of an asteroid gave Earth its closest shave in recorded history . At 150 feet wide , `` 2012 DA14 '' slipped in below the moon 's orbit on February 15 and squeaked by our planet just 17,200 miles from its surface .\nIn a twist worthy of Tolstoy , as astronomers watched that well-tracked rock approach , a different asteroid plunged into Earth 's atmosphere and exploded high over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk .\nScientists determined the meteor was about 60 feet ( 17 meters ) across and packed the punch of about 30 Hiroshima-type atomic bombs when it blew up . Researchers have been collecting and studying the fragments ever since , and in October , a suspected chunk weighing 570 kilograms ( 1,257 pounds ) was hauled out of a nearby lake for study\nNASA 's Near Earth Object Program keeps a close eye on the asteroids that pass the planet almost daily , but they do n't catch everything . Ukrainian astronomers discovered asteroid 2013 TV135 on October 8 , while NASA was closed during the government shutdown . The asteroid had already passed by Earth on September 16 .\nBack on Earth , the animal kingdom got several important additions this year . Some had been extinct for millions of years ; some are alive now , and were just hard to find .\nThen along came a different creature that looks even more cuddly , and it 's alive today . Called the olinguito , the Smithsonian described the mammal 's appearance as a `` a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear , '' even though we know the latter is n't a real animal . Such discoveries do n't happen often ; the olinguito is the first mammalian carnivore species to be newly identified in the Americas in 35 years , says Kristofer Helgen , curator of mammals at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History .\nThe Cape Melville Leaf-Tailed Gecko is also among the species discovered in 2013 . This primitive-looking lizard , along with two other vertebrates and a `` host of other interesting species '' that may also be new to science , have been isolated in a remote mountain range in Australia for millions of years .\nWe 're also learning more about the world of our ancient relatives , although there 's not enough information to use the word `` ancestor . ''\nA remarkable find in Dmanisi , Georgia , gave us the most complete skull ever of an individual from the early Homo genus . It is the fifth example of an ancient hominid , a bipedal primate mammal that walked upright , at this site .\nScientists involved in the discovery proposed that these individuals are members of a single evolving Homo erectus species , examples of which have been found in Africa and Asia . They also said that what have traditionally been called distinct species from this period -- Homo ergaster , Homo rudolfensis and Homo habilis -- could actually be variations on a single species , Homo erectus .\nThat 's a radical departure from how ancient human relatives are currently classified . Other experts said the skull is an important find , but disagreed with the controversial theories regarding Homo erectus membership .\nAnother potential game-changer was the reconstruction of the nearly complete mitochondrial genome of an ancient human relative . It is the oldest DNA to be recovered from an early humanlike species , and is about 400,000 years old .\nThe sequencing technique used in this study , said senior author Svante Paabo , `` opens a possibility to now do this at many other sites , and really begin to understand earlier human evolution . ''\nScientists are also hoping to help our own species understand the perils associated with climate change . The phenomenon raises the likelihood of severe weather events and is predicted to damage agriculture , forestry , ecosystems and human health .\nA key symbolic moment was when the average concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide hit 400 parts per million in Mauna Loa , Hawaii , in May . Such levels have n't been seen in about 3 million years , said J. Marshall Shepherd at the University of Georgia .\nRising atmospheric CO2 leads to overall warming . By 2100 , the Earth will be warmer than ever , authors of a Science study said in March .\nJUST WATCHED Global warming ? More like global weirding Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Global warming ?

MUST WATCH Scientists 95 % sure on climate change 02:39\nThe Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , released in September , found increasing evidence that ice sheets are losing mass , glaciers are shrinking , Arctic sea ice and global snow cover is decreasing , and permafrost is thawing in the Northern Hemisphere . And the researchers said they were more certain than ever that humans are responsible for at least half the increases in global average temperatures seen since the 1950s .\nWhile the concept of man-made climate change remains controversial politically , the debate among scientists and governments has shifted toward what can be done to limit the carbon emissions blamed for trapping heat in the atmosphere , how to deal with the expected effects , and who should pick up the cost for the poor countries analysts say are likely to be hit the hardest .\nWith legislative action likely to fail in the U.S. Congress , the Obama administration took steps on its own to try to rein in emissions and beef up the defenses of vulnerable communities .\nIt takes funding to do scientific research , and it 's a big problem when the stream stops . The one-two punch of $ 85 billion in forced spending cuts and a federal government shutdown bit deeply into American science in 2013 .\nThe National Science Foundation , which supports research and education in non-medical science and engineering , said it would be awarding 1,000 fewer grants in 2013\nNearly half the recipients who get federal science funding say they 've recently laid off or will lay off scientists and researchers , according to a survey by 16 scientific societies .
