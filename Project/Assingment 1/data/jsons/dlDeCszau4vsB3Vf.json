In the clip , he rejected former first lady Michelle Obama 's famous call for civility in politics \u2013 adopting a confrontational tone that \u2019 s become increasingly fashionable amid the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation fight and other debates .\n`` It is time for us , as Democrats , to be as tough as they are , to be as dedicated as they are , to be as committed as they are , '' Holder told the crowd . `` Michelle always says -- I love her ; she and my wife are like , really tight , which always scares me and Barack -- but Michelle always says , 'When they go low , we go high .
