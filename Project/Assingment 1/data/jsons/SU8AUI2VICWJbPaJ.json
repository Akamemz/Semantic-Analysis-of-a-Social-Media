    "content": "Several Supreme Court justices indicated they might lean toward issuing a narrow ruling on gay marriage during a landmark hearing Tuesday on California 's same-sex marriage ban , even as lawyers for the plaintiffs argued for legalizing the unions nationally .\nThe case heard Tuesday , the first of two gay-marriage cases the high court is weighing this week , centered on California 's Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage but could have national implications . If the justices choose to rule broadly , they could overturn Prop 8 and in doing so invalidate every other restriction on gay marriage in the country .\nBut the justices suggested Tuesday they could decide the case without issuing a ruling that ripples through all 50 states .\nSeveral justices , including some liberals who seemed open to gay marriage , raised doubts Tuesday that the case was properly before them . Justice Anthony Kennedy , the potentially decisive vote on a closely divided court , suggested that the court could dismiss the case with no ruling at all .\nSuch an outcome would almost certainly allow gay marriages to resume in California but would have no impact elsewhere .\nClick to listen to the Supreme Court arguments in the Prop 8 case .\nKennedy said he feared the court would go into `` uncharted waters '' if it embraced arguments advanced by gay marriage supporters . But lawyer Theodore Olson , representing two same-sex couples , said that the court similarly ventured into the unknown in 1967 when it struck down bans on interracial marriage in 16 states .\nKennedy challenged the accuracy of that comment by noting that other countries had had interracial marriages for hundreds of years .\nThere was no majority apparent for any particular outcome and many doubts expressed about the arguments advanced by lawyers for the opponents of gay marriage in California , by the supporters and by the Obama administration , which is in favor of same-sex marriage rights .\nChief Justice John Roberts told Olson that it seemed supporters of gay marriage were trying to change the meaning of the word `` marriage '' by including same-sex couples .\nLawyers representing supporters of the California ban known as Proposition 8 argued that the court should not override the democratic process and impose a judicial solution that would redefine marriage in the some 40 states that do not allow same-sex couples to wed .\nThe case attracted high interest . Spectators were waiting in line since Thursday for the chance at being in the room while the two sides try to sway the court .\nBy ruling broadly , the court could overturn every state constitutional provision and law banning same-sex marriages . Or , they could set back the gay marriage movement by upholding California 's ban and continuing to leave the issue up to the states . By choosing the middle route , though , the justices could dismiss the case -- a move likely to let gay marriages resume in California , with no impact anywhere else .\nThe case before the high court came together four years ago when the two couples agreed to be the named plaintiffs and become the public faces of a well-funded , high-profile effort to challenge Proposition 8 in the courts .\nThe fight began in 2004 when San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered city officials to issue marriage licenses . Six months later , the state Supreme Court invalidated the same-sex unions . Less than four years later , however , the same state court overturned California 's prohibition on same-sex unions .\nThen , in the same election that put President Obama in the White House in 2008 , California voters approved Proposition 8 , undoing the court ruling and defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman .\nThe ballot measure halted same-sex unions in California . Roughly 18,000 couples were wed in the nearly five months that same-sex marriage was legal and those marriages remain valid in California .\nThe high-profile case has brought together two one-time Supreme Court opponents .
