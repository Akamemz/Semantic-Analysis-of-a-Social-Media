Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.\n\nSTATUS QUO PREVAILED\n\nThe third Democratic debate seemed to end in a 10-way tie.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden was sure-footed (until the end), at least for him and compared with the previous two debates. There were more attacks on President Donald Trump than on each other. No one dominated.\n\nBiden took on the most fire, but parried it and, as front-runner, benefits the most from a no-decision. Sen. Bernie Sanders faced sharp criticism about his universal health care plan from several candidates, but his base has demonstrated its loyalty. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was more in the background than in prior debates but didn\u2019t damage herself, and she closed with a compelling personal story. Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker were both crisp but got lost on the crowded stage at times.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and Sen. Amy Klobuchar helped form a sensibility caucus, offering pragmatism and civic-mindedness. Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur, spoke eloquently about immigration and assured himself a mention with his proposal to give 10 families $1,000 a month, from his campaign. The normally mild-mannered Juli\u00e1n Castro, a former Housing secretary, decided that attacking Biden, often in personal terms, was one way to get noticed.\n\nThe likely result: little change in a primary that has been remarkably static for months.\n\n___\n\nFIGHT THAT DIDN\u2019T BREAK OUT\n\nThe first matchup between Biden and Warren had so much anticipation \u2014 and so little fireworks.\n\nThere were a few criticisms of Warren on health care, though she not directly answer whether her plan would raise taxes on the middle class.\n\nDuring a discussion on trade, Biden even said he agreed with Warren\u2019s call to bring labor to the table.\n\nCertainly, the head-to-head confrontation will come if Biden continues as the front-runner and Warren maintains her momentum as perhaps the most likely progressive alternative. But perhaps the two campaigns were right after all when they said privately before the debate that September \u2014 five months before the Iowa caucuses \u2014 isn\u2019t necessarily the time for a titanic fight at the top of the field.\n\n___\n\nBERNIE BATTERED ON HEALTH CARE\n\nSanders took heavy fire on his single-payer health insurance proposal, with Biden and others hammering the Vermont senator for the cost and the political palatability of effectively eliminating the existing private insurance market.\n\nThe former vice president went hardest at Sanders when the senator argued that his estimated $30 trillion cost over a decade is cheaper than the \u201cstatus quo,\u201d which he put at $50 trillion \u2014 with most of the money being what Americans spend privately on premiums, co-pays and out-of-pocket costs.

Biden punctuated the point with one of the quotes of the night: \u201cFor a socialist, you\u2019ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.\u201d\n\nButtigieg piled on Sanders, too. Buttigieg said he \u201ctrusts the American people to make the right decision\u201d between private insurance and a public option. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked Sanders.\n\n___\n\nOF AGE AND EXPERIENCE\n\nAt the center of the debate stage were three candidates in their 70s who have had a collective headlock on the upper tier for months. Of the seven younger contenders, Castro, 44, was most explicit in arguing it was time for a new generation \u2014 and he specifically targeted the front-runner, 76-year-old Biden.\n\n\u201cOur problems didn\u2019t start with Donald Trump,\u201d Castro said in his opening statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t solve them by embracing old ideas.\u201d\n\nCastro also seemed to allude to speculation about Biden\u2019s mental acuity during an exchange about health care. When Biden denied that his health plan required people to buy into Medicare, Castro exclaimed, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said 2 minutes ago?\u201d He continued to suggest Biden didn\u2019t remember what he\u2019d just said about his own plan.\n\nLater, during a discussion about deportations under the Obama administration, Castro mocked Biden for clinging to former President Barack Obama, but then saying he was only vice president when Obama\u2019s conduct was questioned. \u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not answer any questions,\u201d Castro said.\n\n___\n\nMONEY FOR NOTHING\n\nYang is an unorthodox candidate, and he came to the debate with an offer to match his persona: a proposal to use his campaign funds to pay 10 randomly-selected families $1,000 a month.\n\nYang announced the maneuver in his opening statement. It\u2019s intended to illustrate the center of his quixotic campaign, to provide monthly $1,000 payments to all Americans 18 and over. After lamenting how the country is in thrall to \u201cthe almighty dollar,\u201d Yang, 44, urged viewers to go to his campaign website and register for the contest to win the money.\n\nHis offer drew cheers from the audience and chortles from some of the other candidates onstage. \u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Buttigieg said.",
