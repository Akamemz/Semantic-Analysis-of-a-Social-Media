With no running water , her father hauls it in almost daily . They live about 8 miles from the closest and only grocery store in their high desert community , where shoppers have felt the strain of limited supplies through the rationing of foods like meat .\nPrior to the coronavirus pandemic `` people were dependent on the grocery store , '' Wilson said . `` Now , they 're in shock or worried about how they 're going to keep their pantries filled when they ca n't go to the stores like they used to . It 's a wake-up call that we need to go back to growing our own foods and tending to our own livestock . ''\nCynthia Wilson , the traditional foods program director of Utah Dine Bikeyah , is mailing indigenous seeds as part of the `` Seeds and Sheep '' program . Cynthia Wilson\nWilson , the traditional foods program director of Utah Din\u00e9 Bik\u00e9yah , an Indigenous-led nonprofit that has worked to protect the Bears Ears national monument in southern Utah and the ancestral lands of several Indigenous peoples , found her motivation amid all of the uncertainty . This month , she helped launch a `` Seeds and Sheep '' program in response to the pandemic and mailed out 1,500 seed packets to homes in the Four Corners region that want to plant and grow their own food .\nThe initial goal was to reach 100 families . She heard from more than 300 .\nAcross the country , as households turn to planting and gardening as a relaxing hobby or to become more self-sufficient during turbulent times , the act of cultivating one 's own food has taken on a greater significance among Native American communities where the pandemic has laid bare an enduring food crisis and a desire to return to customs and traditions some fear are slowly being lost .\nThe idea of Native food sovereignty \u2014 that tribes can farm , access and secure healthy and culturally essential foods that empower their citizens , respect the lands and are not bound to outside policies \u2014 was already a growing movement among Indigenous peoples , said Elizabeth Hoover , an author and assistant professor of American studies at Brown University who writes about food and environmental health and justice in Native communities .\nBut for more people to move toward food sovereignty , `` a lot of elders would say what it 's going to take is a crisis that will keep people from going to the grocery store and picking up food like they used to , '' she said .\nHoover , who is of Mi'kmaq and Mohawk ancestry , grew up on a farm in upstate New York . Elders of the Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne , whom she had interviewed for her first book , told her that `` nobody knew the Depression was happening around here because everyone had their own gardens . ''\nDespite untrue assumptions that Native American tribes have a multitude of acres at their disposal and primed for harvesting , outdated policies and discriminatory lending practices by the federal government have kept many Native farmers at a financial disadvantage , Hoover said .\nIn 2010 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture reached a $ 680 million settlement on a class-action lawsuit that alleged the agency engaged in discriminatory lending against Native American farmers for nearly two decades . Those farmers said they received significantly fewer loans and more onerous terms than were provided to white farmers . In response , the USDA said it is `` committed to resolving all cases involving allegations of past discrimination by individuals . ''\nLet our news meet your inbox .

This site is protected by recaptcha\nBut the troubling legacy of discrimination intersects with other urgent issues surrounding food sovereignty , including disparities in Indian Country of poor health care and disease , now exacerbated by the coronavirus ; environmental battles over oil pipelines and access to clean water ; federal policies that have eroded tribal territory and ancestral lands ; and climate change that has led to increased drought and flooding throughout the country .\nWith so much at stake , Hoover said , the younger Native American generation is seeing the appeal of a type of farming that 's more community-oriented rather than mass farming , like growing soybean and corn for commodities markets , or on the opposite end of the spectrum , a quaint pastime .\n`` It 's not just doing as grandma did : Plant your garden because it 's an old-timey thing to do , '' she said . `` It 's resistance to corporations , to people working cheek by jowl in meat plants , to an unreliable supply chain where products are shipped from thousands of miles away contributing to the carbon footprint . So for these young folks , they 're asking : How do you resist that system and all it stands for ? ''\nAttempts to challenge that system to the benefit of Native populations are being made by Cherokee communities swapping seed kits for each season , Oglala Lakota chefs preserving Native food traditions and Native-run community colleges teaching methods that might otherwise be forgotten .\nNueta Hidatsa Sahnish College , a public tribal community college in New Town , North Dakota , will begin its `` food security '' program this week , said Lori Nelson , the school 's land grant director . Eighteen applicants have signed up to learn how to grow their own gardens or plant using containers , while the college itself expects to make produce available to people through an acre-size `` pick-your-own '' garden .\n`` Much of North Dakota is in a food desert , '' Nelson , who recently applied for a USDA grant , said . `` People are very used to flour and sugar and processed foods . It 's really difficult to change mindsets . ''\nFort Berthold in New Town , the headquarters for the Three Affiliated Tribes , also known as the MHA Nation , has obesity rates of 86 percent among the adult population and 55 percent among school-age children , triggering higher rates of diabetes and heart disease .\nNelson said the hope is to lead citizens down a path with healthier options .\n`` If you grow your own food , '' she added , `` you 're more likely to eat it . ''\nNative seed organizations say the pandemic has increased interest in what they 've been doing for decades .\nThe requests for seeds from the Traditional Native American Farmers Association has doubled this year , said Clayton Brascoupe , one of the founders who has farmed in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico for more than four decades .\nClayton Brascoupe is a co-founder of the Traditional Native American Farmers Association , which donates seeds to home farmers .
