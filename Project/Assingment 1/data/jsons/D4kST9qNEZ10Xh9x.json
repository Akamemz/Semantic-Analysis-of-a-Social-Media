''\nCarissa Cutrell , a spokesperson for ICE , said the agency now needed to make sure it was enforcing existing federal regulation requirements .\nThe Department of Homeland Security 's Student and Exchange Visitor Program previously instituted a temporary exception for online classes in the spring and summer semesters in response to schools going online because of COVID-19 .\nUnder the proposed policy some students taking a combination of online and in-person classes will be allowed to take more than the maximum currently allowed by federal regulation , as long as schools certify the program is not entirely online . F-1 students in English-language training programs and those on M-1 visas , used for those in vocational programs , are not allowed to enroll in any online classes .\nUnder existing federal regulations , students on F-1 visas may take a maximum of one class or three credit hours online .\nSome schools , such as Harvard and Princeton , have announced some students will only be able to take online courses in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic .\nThe agency said affected students on F-1 and M-1 visas in the US could transfer to a school offering in-person classes to maintain their legal status . Otherwise , they risk being put in deportation proceedings .\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials said Monday that international students who are taking classes entirely online this fall will not be allowed to enter the United States or must leave if they 're already in the country .\nLarry Bacow , president of Harvard University , said in a statement the school was concerned that ICE 's guidance imposes a blunt , one-size-fits-all approach to a complex problem , giving international students in online classes few options beyond leaving the US or transferring . It also undermines the effort taken by schools to continue academic programs while balancing the health and safety challenges of the coronavirus pandemic , Bacow said .\n`` We will work closely with other colleges and universities around the country to chart a path forward '' Bacow said . `` We must do all that we can to ensure that our students can continue their studies without fear of being forced to leave the country mid-way through the year , disrupting their academic progress and undermining the commitments\u2014and sacrifices\u2014that many of them have made to advance their education . ''\nThe decision to limit the ability of certain international students to remain in the US comes just weeks after the Trump administration blocked some employment-based visas for foreign workers . It has been met with serious criticism from immigrant advocates who believe it is yet another attempt to restrict immigration to the country .

The tuition fees for international students help subsidize their US counterparts , he said .\n`` A lot of universities are totally dependent on international students to survive . That 's particularly true in science and engineering departments where Americans are not enrolling in sufficient numbers to keep departments going , '' Siskind told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` This is going to result in a dramatic drop in enrollment in US schools in my view .
