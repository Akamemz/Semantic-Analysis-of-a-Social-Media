Comcast announced today it has agreed to acquire Time-Warner , its largest and only significant competitor in the cable and broadband business .\nSome financial analysts are claiming Verizon will still provide stiff competition to the new mega-company . \u201c Verizon is offering video service in the most the markets Comcast is participating in , \u201d a Yahoo Finance reporter declared . But Verizon \u2019 s FiOS service is available to only 15 percent of Comcast \u2019 s existing customers , and in the fall 2011 , Comcast and Verizon reached an agreement that solidified Comcast \u2019 s control over the non-wireless industry . In exchange for parts of the wireless spectrum that Comcast owned , Verizon agreed not to expand its FiOS network , which offers far superior service to that of Comcast or Time-Warner .\nThe combined company would now serve about thirty percent of the cable television market . That doesn \u2019 t seem large until you realize that it would have a virtual monopoly in 19 of the 20 largest media markets . ( Here \u2019 s a useful map . ) It would also serve over half of the customers who buy \u201c triple-play \u201d cable-telephone-broadband services . ( I haven \u2019 t seen figures on the companies \u2019 high-speed internet penetration , but according to the National Broadband Plan , only about 15 percent of consumers have a choice of more than one plan . ) The companies claim that the merger wouldn \u2019 t threaten consumers because they operate in different markets . But that \u2019 s ludicrous . The merger would replace two monopolists ( that is , very large companies with monopoly power over a market ) by an even more powerful single monopoly , even better equipped to discourage competition .\nLarge companies , even monopolies , are not necessarily contrary to the public interest if they are strictly and intelligently regulated . But in the wake of the 1996 telecommunications act ( which idiotically assumed that deregulation would lead to competition ) and a pliant Federal Communications Commission , the big telecom companies have progressively avoided regulation . As a result , they are already committing many of the abuses that come with monopoly power , and if the new merger passes muster , will do so with a vengeance .",
