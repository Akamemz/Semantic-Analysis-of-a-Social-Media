I mean , I do n't know what group you 're talking about . You would n't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about . I 'd have to look . If you would send me a list of the groups , I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong . You may have groups in there that are totally fine -- it would be very unfair . So give me a list of the groups and I 'll let you know . Tapper : Ok .
