''\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) Chairwoman Cheri Bustos downplayed Ocasio-Cortez \u2019 s decision to shun dues and pointed to the record-breaking fundraising numbers the committee has notched without her .\n\u201c That 's always up to individual members so I guess I do n't think about it one way or another , \u201d Bustos said when asked about Ocasio-Cortez 's stance . \u201c We \u2019 re raising record amounts of money from our members . \u201d\nThe DCCC declined to comment further on the matter of Ocasio-Cortez and her dues .\nAnother Democrat was less diplomatic : \u201c Deadbeat Cortez should pay her bills , \u201d complained the Democratic source . \u201c She \u2019 s always whining about people paying their fair share and here she is leaving her friends with the bill . \u201d\nTheir gripe is that Ocasio-Cortez hasn \u2019 t given any money to the DCCC , the party arm with the sole job of electing Democrats to the House .

' \u2014 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\nInstead , Ocasio-Cortez is ramping up her donor base with the help of Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , whom she endorsed for president in October , to funnel money directly to progressive candidates .\nThrough social media posts and email solicitations , she 's activated her donor network to support her hand-picked candidates . In 2019 alone , she funneled more than $ 300,000 to candidates she \u2019 s endorsed by hosting online fundraising campaigns for them , according to records obtained by Fox News .\n\u201c I want to help frontline members by putting that money straight into their pocket , \u201d Ocasio-Cortez said .\nBucking the Democratic Party line , Ocasio-Cortez led online fundraisers for at least two progressives who are trying to defeat sitting Democratic members of Congress .\nShe solicited nearly $ 18,000 in donations for Marie Newman , who is taking on current Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski , a conservative Democrat who opposes abortion . She also gave Newman an additional $ 5,000 directly from her campaign account . Ocasio-Cortez also raised nearly $ 35,000 in online donations for progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros , who is trying to defeat Rep. Henry Cuellar , D-Texas .\n\u201c Certainly , these are new times , \u201d Cuellar said of his colleague 's effort to oust him , \u201c which is something that we certainly do n't agree with . \u201d\nCuellar said Democrats should be focused on the larger goal of beating Republicans and retaining the House majority . \u201c To have people try to purify the caucus because they do n't agree with them \u2013 100 percent , I certainly do n't agree with that . \u201d\n\u201c Hopefully , we will start to get away from this circular firing squad , '' said Cuellar , who paid all his dues to the DCCC , records show .\nOcasio-Cortez views herself as a vehicle to help candidates who wouldn \u2019 t ordinarily have access to DCCC resources and \u201c to really bring in people from outside the traditional political process , \u201d she said .\nBut she does support some colleagues : \u201c I \u2019 m happy to support some incumbents , but it \u2019 s not just a blanket rule . ''\nIn one online appeal , Ocasio-Cortez urged her supporters to back \u201c bold swing district Democrats \u201d by donating to Rep. Mike Levin from California , Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut , and Rep. Katie Hill ( before she resigned from Congress amid a throuple sex scandal with a staffer ) .\nAOC 's supporters pitched in $ 38,000 for Levin and $ 35,500 Hayes -- both frontline DCCC members in competitive districts .\nOther beneficiaries of her online campaigns include Sanders ( nearly $ 36,000 ) and fellow liberal squad members Reps. Rashida Tlaib ( about $ 10,000 ) , Ilhan Omar ( $ 29,000 ) and Ayanna Pressley ( $ 3,800 ) .\nOcasio-Cortez gained nationwide fame when the former bartender from the Bronx upset powerful 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley , D-N.Y. , in the 2018 primary . Now at just 30 years old , the Democratic socialist has turned into a fundraising juggernaut .\nREP. JOE CROWLEY DEFEATED IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY UPSET BY NEWCOMER ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ\nIn the third quarter of 2019 , she raised $ 1.42 million -- more than any other House Democrat . She beat out top Democrats like Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff by rejecting corporate PAC dollars and traditional high-dollar fundraisers and instead relying on grassroots small-dollar fans who are rooting for the young pol and her unapologetic fight for progressive ideals , like the Green New Deal .\nHer fourth-quarter fundraising is even bigger . Her campaign nearly hit its goal of raising $ 2 million in the final three months of 2019 from online donors from every state . That amount puts her 2019 fundraising at more than $ 5 million , a groundbreaking amount for the youngest female ever elected to Congress .\nShe \u2019 s benefited from joint online fundraising campaigns with Sanders that \u2019 s expanded her fundraising base and her commitments for reoccurring monthly contributions . His online appeals have raised more than $ 140,000 for Ocasio-Cortez , while she \u2019 s raised about $ 36,000 for Sanders by appealing to her supporters , according to her campaign .\nBut with all that money comes certain expectations . Her decision not to spread the wealth around has some colleagues griping that she benefits from being in the House majority without giving back to the whole team .\nRep. Meeks suggested that not paying DCCC dues and actively trying to oust certain Democratic colleagues shows a lack of respect for the party and fellow reps who have to answer to constituents more conservative than her Bronx and Queens base .\n`` DCCC dues are about supporting others because you want to be part of the team , '' he said . `` The goal is to be in the majority . And the goal is , when you are on a team I would think , to respect individuals whose districts are different than yours . ''\nMeeks said he ca n't recall another time when sitting Democrats were actively trying to defeat other Democrats in Congress . Ocasio-Cortez is funding Cisneros in Texas and Newman in Illinois , who also has gotten financial backing from Rep. Ro Khanna of California .\n\u201c I would hope in the spirit of teamwork that we do n't see any further incursions with other members , '' Meeks said . `` I would hope at least it stops there . ''\nMeeks also raised concerns about the Ocasio-Cortez alliance with Sanders : `` His revolution is to not just to stop the Republicans , it \u2019 s to blow up the Democratic Party . ''\nMeeks said there 's room in the party for AOC and her cohorts but appealed to them to invest in the movement . `` Even if you want to change it , you \u2019 ve got to invest in it . That concerns me , '' he said .\nOcasio-Cortez isn \u2019 t the only member who has yet to pay dues , but she \u2019 s unique in that she \u2019 s openly thumbing her nose at the DCCC out of principle . Last March , Ocasio-Cortez urged supporters to stop donating directly to the DCCC over its rule to `` blacklist '' vendors , calling it \u201c extremely divisive and harmful to the party . \u201d\nJustice Democrats and other allied progressive groups have created an alternative vendor network to help out their liberal firebrand challengers \u2013 through the website dcccblacklist.com .\nThe DCCC assigned the 237 House Democrats ( including four delegates ) a certain amount of dues they must pay to help the party win elections in November . It 's a routine practice for both Democrats and Republican House members . Amounts vary based on the level of leadership and committee assignments .\nMore high-profile members have to pony up more money to the DCCC , with Pelosi having the highest dues at $ 1 million . Newer members or less prolific fundraisers have the smallest goals of $ 150,000 for the two-year cycle .\nThe October final dues report shows that Pelosi already contributed $ 900,000 of her $ 1 million goal . Majority Leader Steny Hoyer paid $ 600,000 of his $ 900,000 dues and Rep. James Clyburn paid $ 350,000 of his $ 800,000 . DCCC Chair Bustos already paid all of her $ 575,000 in dues .\nOf the 237 members with dues , 97 of them -- or more than 40 percent -- hadn \u2019 t paid anything as of October , records obtained by Fox News show . Party insiders say more members likely ponied up in the months since and they caution there \u2019 s still plenty of time for other members to pay their 2020 dues . They expect nearly all the membership to contribute in the coming months , especially after some had to stockpile money for competitive primaries .\nFormer DCCC chairwoman Rep. Nita Lowey said , in her experience , most members pay their dues \u2013 \u201c some more than others . \u201d\nShe said the DCCC is most effective when members work as a team .\n`` If you are a Democrat and you \u2019 re here , you should be part of the effort , \u201d Lowey said from the Capitol . \u201c But [ Ocasio-Cortez ] may not feel that way . Each to their own . \u201d\nAsked if Ocasio-Cortez \u2019 s refusal to pay up is a threat to the party , Lowey said , \u201c if more people say they don \u2019 t want to pay , of course . \u201d\nBut the DCCC touted raising an off-year record of $ 110 million through November of 2019 , more than all of 2017 .\nAnd House Democrats outraised their GOP counterpart , the NRCC , every month through November by $ 33 million , according to the DCCC .\nThe purpose of the dues is to retain the House majority by helping support candidates in competitive races Democrats will need to win in November . The dues helped the DCCC back a diverse crop of 92 swing district candidates in 2018 .\n\u201c The DCCC \u2019 s primary purpose is to protect and expand this Democratic caucus which has made history for its diversity across racial , demographic , and socio-economic lines , \u201d said DCCC spokesperson Robyn Patterson .\nWhile backing primary challengers while in Congress was once considered taboo , Ocasio-Cortez says the competition is good for the party .\n\u201c We have to earn our keep every time , '' Ocasio-Cortez said . `` I think we have to make our case every single time . \u201d",
