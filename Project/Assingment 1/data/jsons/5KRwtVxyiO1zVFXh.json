    "content": "Since he became President Obama \u2019 s secretary of defense earlier this year , Chuck Hagel , the ruthlessly candid and occasionally contrarian former Republican senator from Nebraska , has mostly kept his inner maverick in check . He \u2019 s been so much of an enigma in nine muted months at the Pentagon that one frequent critic , Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( R-N.H. ) , was heard to ask aloud , \u201c What \u2019 s with this guy ? \u201d as she emerged from a low-energy meeting with the heavy-lidded defense secretary , according to one fellow senator . So White House officials were stunned when Hagel abruptly spit the bit over the summer .\nBy August , the first round of across-the-board cuts mandated by the congressionally imposed process known as budget sequestration had forced the Pentagon to slash its massive personnel costs . Obama \u2019 s White House team was controlling the talking points , and these defense cuts were an especially powerful part of their political message : Republicans , they claimed , were willing to endanger national security to appease their anti-government Tea Party wing . So it came as unwelcome news when Hagel declared\u2014without getting West Wing approval\u2014that he was exercising his authority to reinstate five of 11 furlough days for the department \u2019 s civilian employees , according to several current and former administration officials . White House aides called Hagel \u2019 s team to complain . The secretary didn \u2019 t care . He was growing increasingly concerned that the administration was ignoring the Pentagon \u2019 s budget and readiness crises , and he directed his staff to give a mid-level agency bureaucrat a one-hour head \u2019 s up before he went public . \u201c Hagel didn \u2019 t want to slow the process down , \u201d a former defense official told me . \u201c So he just decided to do it , and he did it\u2026 Message sent . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s too early to tell if Hagel \u2019 s sotto voce declaration of independence was a genuine pivot point . But it \u2019 s clear the 67-year-old Vietnam War hero is entering the make-or-break phase of his Pentagon stewardship , according to about a dozen current and former West Wing and Pentagon officials I spoke with . Up until recently , they say , Hagel appeared shaky , a career legislator struggling with his first big command\u2014and under constant fire . \u201c How would I describe him right now ? He \u2019 s a paper tiger , \u201d says a longtime Obama campaign and White House adviser . \u201c He \u2019 s a great guy and a war hero . The regular troops love him . \u2026 It \u2019 s not quite buyer \u2019 s remorse , but he needs to show us more . \u201d\nObama \u2019 s people may yet get their wish , if perhaps in ways they hadn \u2019 t quite anticipated . In recent days , Secretary of State John Kerry has hogged the spotlight with his headlong-into-the-breach diplomacy with Iran . But it is Hagel who might face the potentially greater career-defining moment : Over the next six weeks , he \u2019 ll have to battle Congress , and perhaps some on Obama \u2019 s West Wing team , to forestall unprecedented new defense cuts that , when added to the first round of sequester cuts , could slash as much as $ 100 billion a year ( according to Obama administration estimates ) from a Pentagon accustomed to Bush-era annual budgets of $ 700 billion . It \u2019 s the sort of bloodletting that could force commanders to choose between modern weapons systems , funding benefits programs or paying to retain enough troops to meet new threats . In effect , what has followed the low-key secretary ( self-effacing to a fault\u2014he has described defense as \u201c the fourth \u201d most powerful gig in Obama \u2019 s Cabinet ) to his memento-crammed office on the third floor of the Pentagon is a fight that could now determine the ambition of the military in the post-Afghanistan and Iraq era .\n\u201c How would I describe him right now ? He \u2019 s a paper tiger , \u201d says a longtime White House advisor . \u201c He \u2019 s a great guy and a war hero . The regular troops love him \u2026 but he needs to show us more . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s no doubt that Hagel shares Obama \u2019 s philosophy of a leaner and more efficient military , and he voiced only perfunctory objections to the $ 50 billion-a-year hit the Pentagon took in the 2012 budget deal\u2014and toes the administration line that all sequester cuts , to military and domestic programs , need to be restores in full . He also embraced a long-term Obama budget proposal that would backload billions of dollars more in cuts over the next decade . But the additional $ 20 billion to $ 50 billion in yearly cuts due to take effect next month if congressional negotiators can \u2019 t avert a second sequester are too much for Hagel . Obama opposes the cuts too , but Hagel is pressing to de-link the Pentagon \u2019 s budget from the non-defense budget , a stance that puts him in conflict with the White House bargaining position at a crucial moment : If Republicans want to avoid the defense cuts , Obama is trying to make the case that they will also have to spare the ax for an array of social welfare and infrastructure programs . \u201c If you just to start to carve out certain popular items from the sequester you don \u2019 t solve the problem , \u201d a person close to Obama told me when asked about Hagel \u2019 s position . \u201c Chuck is just doing his job . \u2026 He wants to exempt the military from the sequester , and that \u2019 s understandable . But we \u2019 re looking to get rid of the sequester across the board . \u201d\nHagel has directed most of his public comments at GOP budget-cutters but he \u2019 s also made it clear he \u2019 s dissatisfied with some in the administration , especially Obama \u2019 s Office of Management and Budget Director Sylvia Mathews Burwell who , in the words of one Hagel confidant , \u201c just doesn \u2019 t get the urgency \u201d of the threat . \u201c This is an irresponsible way to govern , and it forces the department into a very bad set of choices , '' Hagel said earlier this month of the sequester , speaking to an audience at the Reagan Library .\nJohn Kerry has hogged the spotlight with his headlong-into-the-breach diplomacy on Iran . But it is Hagel , with his upcoming battle with Congress and maybe even the White House to forestall proposed defense cuts , who may face the greater career-defining moment . | Reuters\nBut here \u2019 s where the months of lackluster leadership at the Pentagon might pose a key problem for Hagel , a former infantry squad leader in Vietnam now entering a big bureaucratic fight well below full battle strength . His top deputy , the highly regarded Ashton Carter\u2014himself a candidate for defense secretary and a man who has been running the place day to day for two years\u2014is leaving this month . Several top-level former defense officials , including the department \u2019 s one-time No . 3 , Mich\u00e8le Flournoy , another also-ran for the secretaryship when Hagel got the job , have rebuffed entreaties to join the team , say people close to the situation .\nHagel \u2019 s grasp of granular budget and manpower issues have improved greatly over the last few months , and people close to him say he has even booted out staffers from briefings if they don \u2019 t have the information he needs at the ready . But he \u2019 s still a relative neophyte , and having a first-class deputy remains a necessity . \u201c I sure hope it 's a strong pick , \u201d says Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) . \u201c And I sure hope it 's somebody with experience in the Pentagon . \u201d\nThat Hagel is the secretary of defense at all is a minor political miracle . He nearly flamed out during late January confirmation hearings\u2014he mortified his handlers by suggesting he could live with a nuclear-armed Iran until he was handed a note telling him : nope , no way , take it back\u2014where he looked confused , sluggish and generally unprepared , leading to the tightest confirmation vote of any Obama cabinet official . The performance made Hagel easy pickings for critics like Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) , who blasted Hagel as an ally of Tehran and enemy of Israel . His near-mute testimony this fall defending the administration \u2019 s muddled Syria policy , especially alongside Kerry 's much more animated performance , was nearly as unimpressive . \u201c Next time we have a hearing and he sits next to John Kerry at a hearing , you know , I 'd like to hear from him too , \u201d quips McCain , a fellow Vietnam veteran who considers himself to be Hagel \u2019 s friend , despite Hagel \u2019 s decision not to endorse him during the 2008 general election . \u201c He 's been kind of low-visibility . But I do n't think necessarily he 's been a weak secretary of defense . \u201d\nIndeed , a low-key manager is what Obama \u2019 s national security team wanted to succeed first-term Pentagon chiefs Bob Gates , a steely commander who steadied the place after the disastrous invasion of Iraq under Donald Rumsfeld , and Leon Panetta , a canny former member of Congress and White House chief of staff who ran the building , in the words of one former subordinate , \u201c like a big Italian dinner. \u201d By the time of Panetta \u2019 s exit , almost all key strategic decisions on Iraq and Afghanistan had been made and Obama settled on Hagel in part because he was convinced that a Republican , even one mostly estranged from his party , would be best positioned to oversee a new era of contraction and recalibration . Hagel embraced the position , and rather than compete with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough , Kerry and national security adviser Susan Rice for a marquee foreign policy role , he has focused on allocating resources wisely and on adapting the military \u2019 s postwar strategy toward the challenges of the future in a rising Asia rather than the lingering complications of the last century \u2019 s conflicts still so evident in the Middle East . \u201c That stuff is really unsexy but someone \u2019 s got to do it , \u201d says Andrew Exum , a former Army Ranger and Pentagon consultant .\nHagel has been bracingly candid about his role . \u201c I 've never seen my job or the time I \u2019 ll spend here as defining a Hagel era , \u201d he told the Atlantic \u2019 s Steve Clemons in an October interview . \u201c I \u2019 ve never seen it that way . \u2026 I do n't see it as a Hagel imprint . The way I do see my role is what can I do to improve our security ? What can I do to improve this institution while I 'm here ? How can I enhance it by my leadership and by my presence ? And then the rest of it takes care of itself . \u201d\nIf Hagel \u2019 s furrowed face looks like frozen masonry on C-Span , he is steady and forthright in the flesh , which has endeared him to staffers and helped him overcome suspicions inside the Pentagon that he \u2019 s an Obama yes-man . He works the building like he used to work the Nebraska State Fair , a bit awkwardly but with plenty of gusto . On the Monday before Thanksgiving , I was allowed to peek into his office as a three-star general squired in an elderly civilian employee and his wife for a photo op . After presenting the man with a plaque celebrating 50 years of service , Hagel asked the man 's wife what she planned to cook for the holiday . \u201c Turkey , um , with cranberries , \u201d she answered nervously , and then asked him what he planned to eat . \u201c Oh , I \u2019 m from Indian country , \u201d Hagel declared . \u201c We eat steak ! \u201d\nHagel 's near-mute testimony this fall defending the administration \u2019 s muddled Syria policy , especially alongside an animated John Kerry , was unimpressive . | AP Photo\nHe may be at ease with his employees , but Hagel has clearly been thrown off his politician \u2019 s game by his terrible debut . He was \u201c deeply shaken \u201d by his self-inflicted confirmation trauma , a source who counts him as a friend told me , \u201c and was really shocked by how hostile the political environment had become. \u201d At times , he \u2019 s seemed more like a secretary on defense\u2014an outsider squeezed between Obama \u2019 s political imperatives and the Pentagon brass he \u2019 s now surrounded by . In late August , Hagel argued privately to the White House against a military strike in Syria and was overruled by Obama . He sat mostly in silence when he and Kerry appeared together ostensibly to sell the intervention policy to the Hill , and he flubbed key facts when he did speak , including a faulty assertion that Russia had been the main supplier of Syria \u2019 s homegrown chemical weapons program . Even then , he was overshadowed by Martin Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who made no secret of his frustration with the White House , which then quickly blamed Dempsey for leaks questioning the effectiveness of a limited missile attack on Syria and the logistics of mustering forces to pull it off .\nHagel is steady and forthright in the flesh , which has endeared him to staffers and helped him overcome suspicions inside the Pentagon that he \u2019 s an Obama yes-man . | Reuters\nBehind the scenes as this Syria drama played out , Hagel was preoccupied with a different struggle : the budget crisis that is likely to consume his Pentagon tenure . By the fall , he was beginning to grasp just how degraded Army and Marine units had become after years of war . The Pentagon \u2019 s Strategic Choices and Management Review\u2014a deep-dive report issued in late summer\u2014painted a bleak picture : To cover the cost for modern weapons systems , the Pentagon would need to shrink the Army and Marines to about 520,000 troops , the smallest force since the end of World War II , and far below the 700,000 the department deemed sufficient to deal with emerging threats . The \u201c Skimmer , \u201d as the report is known in the building , nudged Hagel closer to the service chiefs , especially Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno , a hard-charging battlefield commander who had clashed with Hagel over the Iraq surge years before .\nThe paradox is that Hagel , a brash non-commissioned officer who once counseled an inexperienced Senator Obama to stand up the generals seven years ago , now finds himself increasingly motivated by their priorities . \u201c There \u2019 s a cognitive disconnect between the Pentagon and the White House , and he \u2019 s aware of that , \u201d a Panetta-era Pentagon official told me .\nThe balancing act\u2014between the attraction to power and the compulsion to buck authority\u2014is the leitmotif of Hagel \u2019 s four-decade career . In 1968 , Hagel , a 21-year-old army sergeant , found himself leading a unit that , contrary to military regulations , included his younger brother Tom . In the span of a month , the two took turns saving each other \u2019 s lives . When Chuck was struck by shrapnel in the chest , Tom patched it , stanching a fountain of blood with a bandage . Weeks after that , Chuck pulled his unconscious brother from a burning personnel carrier , later telling a reporter , \u201c I vowed then to do what I could to stop wars . \u201d\nA disaffected Tom Hagel , like John Kerry , turned against the war when he returned home and embraced liberal , anti-war politics . Chuck Hagel took John McCain \u2019 s change-the-system-from-the-inside path . He became active in Republican politics , and the two brothers sometimes came to blows over their political differences .\nChuck would go on to make a fortune in the cell phone business , before later carving out a unique political niche in the Senate . To no one \u2019 s surprise , he was among the first Republicans to call President George W. Bush to account for the series of mistakes that led to the Iraq debacle , and he joined Obama in speaking out against the Iraq troop surge in 2007\u2014which he called the \u201c most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam. \u201d He spurned his friend McCain a year later during the general election , tacitly supporting Obama \u2019 s anti-war candidacy .\nSince being appointed to run the Pentagon , Hagel has been cast in a supporting actor role , says Tom Ricks , the Pulitzer Prize winner who wrote the definitive account of the Bush administration \u2019 s management failures in Iraq . He regards Hagel as \u201c a soporific version of William Cohen , \u201d Bill Clinton \u2019 s low-key second-term defense secretary , \u201c another Senate Armed Services [ Committee member ] picked by a Dem late in the administration to keep the deck chairs from sloshing over the side . Not a bad guy to have at the end of a presidency . \u201d\nThat perception isn \u2019 t entirely fair . Hagel played a critical role in keeping open ties with the Egyptian military following its overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood and he \u2019 s also been the administration \u2019 s standard-bearer on its fits-and-starts focus on Asia , making three trips to the region in the first few months he was in office while Kerry focused on the Middle East . In recent days , he \u2019 s burned up the phone lines with Japanese leaders in order to avoid any provocation over Beijing \u2019 s announcement demanding airspace control over a vast swath of the East China Sea\u2014but he was also supportive of the decision to send a flight of unarmed B-52s to the disputed zone as a show of force . In another small act of self-assertion , he ordered the aircraft carrier U.S.S . George Washington to the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan with only a cursory head \u2019 s up to Obama \u2019 s national security team , which was debating whether or not to \u201c militarize \u201d the response , according to a defense official .\nHagel has taken on thankless tasks , too , serving as Obama \u2019 s human shield on the sensitive issue of the Pentagon \u2019 s sexual assault adjudication policy ; Hagel has embraced some internal reforms but resisted Senate efforts to remove investigations from the military \u2019 s chain of command , a proposal that is anathema to his top commanders but a position that has earned him the ire of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-N.Y. ) . \u201c He has not shown leadership . \u2026 I think he has not lived up to his promises , the promises of having the passion and the drive for rooting out the scourge of sexual violence , \u201d she told me . \u201c I don \u2019 t think that he has lived up to my expectations . \u201d\nDealing with these external pressures might actually be easier than the internal challenges . All second-term secretaries are forced to confront a brain drain , but Hagel is finding that replacing outgoing staffers is an especially tall order for a Pentagon bracing for a future of tightening budgets and diminishing influence . The departure of Carter , Hagel \u2019 s highly regarded deputy secretary , does n't come as a surprise given that Carter had been passed over for the top job . But clearly there was friction ; he had agitated , with little success , for Hagel to take a more active role in foreign policy , according to people close to both men . When Hagel \u2019 s team quietly reached out to Flournoy about her interest\u2014the former Pentagon policy planning chief who left the administration after also being short-listed for the secretary job\u2014she politely declined the offer , according to three people familiar with the situation . Lesser-known Robert Work , a 60-year-old former undersecretary of the Navy , is now considered the top candidate but Hagel was still interviewing other officials as recently as last week , according to administration officials .\nIn October , Ash Carter ( right ) , Hagel \u2019 s highly regarded deputy secretary who had been passed over for the top job , announced he was stepping down after two years of supervising the operations of the department . | Reuters\nHagel has had similar problems filling the department \u2019 s vacated top policy post . Over the past month , Hagel \u2019 s team has reportedly gauged the interest of several candidates , including Kurt Campbell , a former top State Department official who co-founded ( with Flournoy ) the Center for a New American Security . Another prominent think-tanker , Kathleen Hicks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies , also took a pass . \u201c To some extent you are seeing the Clinton effect , \u201d says a former defense official who served under President Bill Clinton and recently turned down a Pentagon job offer . \u201c Why take the risks of working in a second Obama administration , when you can make $ 300,000 in the private sector and then go work for Hillary ? \u201d\nOf course Hagel \u2019 s greatest challenge may be figuring out the insider game in an administration known for aggregating national security power in the West Wing . Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) , a hawk who admires Hagel \u2019 s independence , says he would be wise to emulate his predecessor , Panetta , a sharp-elbowed bureaucratic infighter with an avuncular public image . \u201c Chuck needs to pick up where Panetta left off \u2026 fight \u2019 em from the inside . \u2026 If he \u2019 s not following Leon \u2019 s lead , he \u2019 s making a big mistake . \u201d\nHagel seems to be moving in that direction . He has butted heads with Burwell , the OMB director , over how she is pitching the impact of the cuts to Congress , pressing her to illustrate more vividly\u2014district-by-district\u2014the effects that defense cuts would have on members of Congress . And he has quietly made the case to McDonough and others that they need to take a more active role in bipartisan budget negotiations being run by Rep. Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) and Sen. Patty Murray ( D-Wash. ) , at a time when most of Obama \u2019 s attention has been occupied by meltdown of Obamacare . Hagel has also taken a few less conventional steps , meeting last month with Tina Tchen , Michelle Obama \u2019 s chief of staff , in an effort to convince the first lady that Pentagon cuts will hit military families hardest . Meanwhile , Hagel has upped his public profile , sitting for a series of mostly gaffe-free interviews with foreign policy reporters and delivering speeches suggesting , ever so subtly , that he won \u2019 t remain silent if Obama allows the sequester cuts to go through .\nBut critics wonder if Hagel will directly challenge Obama , whom he befriended in the Senate at a time when the Illinois freshman knew next to nothing about foreign or military affairs . Even Hagel \u2019 s allies aren \u2019 t sure entirely how committed he is to holding the line on budget cuts , or even what that line is . He raised eyebrows among Senate Democrats in November by telling Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) , \u201c I don \u2019 t have money , but I can handle that , \u201d during a phone conversation\u2014which they read as a \u201c sign of weakness , \u201d in the words of one Democratic senator who told me about it .\nRepublicans , clearly relishing the travails of a turncoat , are less charitable . \u201c The first thing he \u2019 s got to do is confront the political team in the White House which is \u2026 asserting too much influence over policy decisions , \u201d says Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) , an Armed Services Committee member and one of 27 Senate Republicans to oppose Hagel \u2019 s confirmation . \u201c I just think it \u2019 s his duty to speak the truth to the president and stand up , and you can \u2019 t just always continue in office if you are asked to execute a policy that you truly believe is harmful . You have to make up your mind if you should stay or leave . \u201d\nIf his own history is any guide , Hagel isn \u2019 t about to rip off his stripes in protest . \u201c He \u2019 s not going anywhere , \u201d said a senior administration official close to the secretary . Yet it \u2019 s hard not to hear a 1980s-vintage Republican strain in Hagel \u2019 s recent public utterances on the need to maintain a robust defense , and he has become increasingly fond of invoking another president , the first one for whom he ever worked .\n\u201c President Reagan understood the importance of the readiness of our defense enterprise , \u201d Hagel\u2014who helped run the Gipper \u2019 s Nebraska operation in 1980\u2014told his audience at the Reagan Library last month . \u201c President Reagan inherited a military that was still grappling with the legacy of the Vietnam War . \u2026 [ He ] began the rebuilding of America 's military readiness and capabilities . But it took leadership , it took time and it took resources . \u201d\nGlenn Thrush is senior staff writer for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine .",

But we\u2019re looking to get rid of the sequester across the board.\u201d\n\nHagel has directed most of his public comments at GOP budget-cutters but he\u2019s also made it clear he\u2019s dissatisfied with some in the administration, especially Obama\u2019s Office of Management and Budget Director Sylvia Mathews Burwell who, in the words of one Hagel confidant, \u201cjust doesn\u2019t get the urgency\u201d of the threat. \u201cThis is an irresponsible way to govern, and it forces the department into a very bad set of choices,\" Hagel said earlier this month of the sequester, speaking to an audience at the Reagan Library.\n\nJohn Kerry has hogged the spotlight with his headlong-into-the-breach diplomacy on Iran. But it is Hagel, with his upcoming battle with Congress and maybe even the White House to forestall proposed defense cuts, who may face the greater career-defining moment. | Reuters\n\nBut here\u2019s where the months of lackluster leadership at the Pentagon might pose a key problem for Hagel, a former infantry squad leader in Vietnam now entering a big bureaucratic fight well below full battle strength. His top deputy, the highly regarded Ashton Carter\u2014himself a candidate for defense secretary and a man who has been running the place day to day for two years\u2014is leaving this month. Several top-level former defense officials, including the department\u2019s one-time No. 3, Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, another also-ran for the secretaryship when Hagel got the job, have rebuffed entreaties to join the team, say people close to the situation.\n\nHagel\u2019s grasp of granular budget and manpower issues have improved greatly over the last few months, and people close to him say he has even booted out staffers from briefings if they don\u2019t have the information he needs at the ready. But he\u2019s still a relative neophyte, and having a first-class deputy remains a necessity. \u201cI sure hope it's a strong pick,\u201d says Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). \u201cAnd I sure hope it's somebody with experience in the Pentagon.\u201d\n\nThat Hagel is the secretary of defense at all is a minor political miracle. He nearly flamed out during late January confirmation hearings\u2014he mortified his handlers by suggesting he could live with a nuclear-armed Iran until he was handed a note telling him: nope, no way, take it back\u2014where he looked confused, sluggish and generally unprepared, leading to the tightest confirmation vote of any Obama cabinet official. The performance made Hagel easy pickings for critics like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who blasted Hagel as an ally of Tehran and enemy of Israel. His near-mute testimony this fall defending the administration\u2019s muddled Syria policy, especially alongside Kerry's much more animated performance, was nearly as unimpressive. \u201cNext time we have a hearing and he sits next to John Kerry at a hearing, you know, I'd like to hear from him too,\u201d quips McCain, a fellow Vietnam veteran who considers himself to be Hagel\u2019s friend, despite Hagel\u2019s decision not to endorse him during the 2008 general election. \u201cHe's been kind of low-visibility. But I don't think necessarily he's been a weak secretary of defense.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a low-key manager is what Obama\u2019s national security team wanted to succeed first-term Pentagon chiefs Bob Gates, a steely commander who steadied the place after the disastrous invasion of Iraq under Donald Rumsfeld, and Leon Panetta, a canny former member of Congress and White House chief of staff who ran the building, in the words of one former subordinate, \u201clike a big Italian dinner.\u201d By the time of Panetta\u2019s exit, almost all key strategic decisions on Iraq and Afghanistan had been made and Obama settled on Hagel in part because he was convinced that a Republican, even one mostly estranged from his party, would be best positioned to oversee a new era of contraction and recalibration. Hagel embraced the position, and rather than compete with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, Kerry and national security adviser Susan Rice for a marquee foreign policy role, he has focused on allocating resources wisely and on adapting the military\u2019s postwar strategy toward the challenges of the future in a rising Asia rather than the lingering complications of the last century\u2019s conflicts still so evident in the Middle East. \u201cThat stuff is really unsexy but someone\u2019s got to do it,\u201d says Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger and Pentagon consultant.\n\nHagel has been bracingly candid about his role. \u201cI've never seen my job or the time I\u2019ll spend here as defining a Hagel era,\u201d he told the Atlantic\u2019s Steve Clemons in an October interview. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it that way. \u2026 I don't see it as a Hagel imprint. The way I do see my role is what can I do to improve our security? What can I do to improve this institution while I'm here? How can I enhance it by my leadership and by my presence? And then the rest of it takes care of itself.\u201d\n\nIf Hagel\u2019s furrowed face looks like frozen masonry on C-Span, he is steady and forthright in the flesh, which has endeared him to staffers and helped him overcome suspicions inside the Pentagon that he\u2019s an Obama yes-man. He works the building like he used to work the Nebraska State Fair, a bit awkwardly but with plenty of gusto. On the Monday before Thanksgiving, I was allowed to peek into his office as a three-star general squired in an elderly civilian employee and his wife for a photo op. After presenting the man with a plaque celebrating 50 years of service, Hagel asked the man's wife what she planned to cook for the holiday. \u201cTurkey, um, with cranberries,\u201d she answered nervously, and then asked him what he planned to eat. \u201cOh, I\u2019m from Indian country,\u201d Hagel declared. \u201cWe eat steak!\u201d\n\nHagel's near-mute testimony this fall defending the administration\u2019s muddled Syria policy, especially alongside an animated John Kerry, was unimpressive. | AP Photo\n\nHe may be at ease with his employees, but Hagel has clearly been thrown off his politician\u2019s game by his terrible debut. He was \u201cdeeply shaken\u201d by his self-inflicted confirmation trauma, a source who counts him as a friend told me, \u201cand was really shocked by how hostile the political environment had become.\u201d At times, he\u2019s seemed more like a secretary on defense\u2014an outsider squeezed between Obama\u2019s political imperatives and the Pentagon brass he\u2019s now surrounded by. In late August, Hagel argued privately to the White House against a military strike in Syria and was overruled by Obama. He sat mostly in silence when he and Kerry appeared together ostensibly to sell the intervention policy to the Hill, and he flubbed key facts when he did speak, including a faulty assertion that Russia had been the main supplier of Syria\u2019s homegrown chemical weapons program. Even then, he was overshadowed by Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who made no secret of his frustration with the White House, which then quickly blamed Dempsey for leaks questioning the effectiveness of a limited missile attack on Syria and the logistics of mustering forces to pull it off.\n\nHagel is steady and forthright in the flesh, which has endeared him to staffers and helped him overcome suspicions inside the Pentagon that he\u2019s an Obama yes-man. | Reuters\n\nBehind the scenes as this Syria drama played out, Hagel was preoccupied with a different struggle: the budget crisis that is likely to consume his Pentagon tenure. By the fall, he was beginning to grasp just how degraded Army and Marine units had become after years of war. The Pentagon\u2019s Strategic Choices and Management Review\u2014a deep-dive report issued in late summer\u2014painted a bleak picture: To cover the cost for modern weapons systems, the Pentagon would need to shrink the Army and Marines to about 520,000 troops, the smallest force since the end of World War II, and far below the 700,000 the department deemed sufficient to deal with emerging threats. The \u201cSkimmer,\u201d as the report is known in the building, nudged Hagel closer to the service chiefs, especially Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno, a hard-charging battlefield commander who had clashed with Hagel over the Iraq surge years before.\n\nThe paradox is that Hagel, a brash non-commissioned officer who once counseled an inexperienced Senator Obama to stand up the generals seven years ago, now finds himself increasingly motivated by their priorities. \u201cThere\u2019s a cognitive disconnect between the Pentagon and the White House, and he\u2019s aware of that,\u201d a Panetta-era Pentagon official told me.\n\nThe balancing act\u2014between the attraction to power and the compulsion to buck authority\u2014is the leitmotif of Hagel\u2019s four-decade career. In 1968, Hagel, a 21-year-old army sergeant, found himself leading a unit that, contrary to military regulations, included his younger brother Tom. In the span of a month, the two took turns saving each other\u2019s lives. When Chuck was struck by shrapnel in the chest, Tom patched it, stanching a fountain of blood with a bandage. Weeks after that, Chuck pulled his unconscious brother from a burning personnel carrier, later telling a reporter, \u201cI vowed then to do what I could to stop wars.\u201d\n\nA disaffected Tom Hagel, like John Kerry, turned against the war when he returned home and embraced liberal, anti-war politics. Chuck Hagel took John McCain\u2019s change-the-system-from-the-inside path. He became active in Republican politics, and the two brothers sometimes came to blows over their political differences.\n\nChuck would go on to make a fortune in the cell phone business, before later carving out a unique political niche in the Senate. To no one\u2019s surprise, he was among the first Republicans to call President George W. Bush to account for the series of mistakes that led to the Iraq debacle, and he joined Obama in speaking out against the Iraq troop surge in 2007\u2014which he called the \u201cmost dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam.\u201d He spurned his friend McCain a year later during the general election, tacitly supporting Obama\u2019s anti-war candidacy.\n\nSince being appointed to run the Pentagon, Hagel has been cast in a supporting actor role, says Tom Ricks, the Pulitzer Prize winner who wrote the definitive account of the Bush administration\u2019s management failures in Iraq. He regards Hagel as \u201ca soporific version of William Cohen,\u201d Bill Clinton\u2019s low-key second-term defense secretary, \u201canother Senate Armed Services [Committee member] picked by a Dem late in the administration to keep the deck chairs from sloshing over the side. Not a bad guy to have at the end of a presidency.\u201d\n\nThat perception isn\u2019t entirely fair. Hagel played a critical role in keeping open ties with the Egyptian military following its overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood and he\u2019s also been the administration\u2019s standard-bearer on its fits-and-starts focus on Asia, making three trips to the region in the first few months he was in office while Kerry focused on the Middle East. In recent days, he\u2019s burned up the phone lines with Japanese leaders in order to avoid any provocation over Beijing\u2019s announcement demanding airspace control over a vast swath of the East China Sea\u2014but he was also supportive of the decision to send a flight of unarmed B-52s to the disputed zone as a show of force. In another small act of self-assertion, he ordered the aircraft carrier U.S.S. George Washington to the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan with only a cursory head\u2019s up to Obama\u2019s national security team, which was debating whether or not to \u201cmilitarize\u201d the response, according to a defense official.\n\nHagel has taken on thankless tasks, too, serving as Obama\u2019s human shield on the sensitive issue of the Pentagon\u2019s sexual assault adjudication policy; Hagel has embraced some internal reforms but resisted Senate efforts to remove investigations from the military\u2019s chain of command, a proposal that is anathema to his top commanders but a position that has earned him the ire of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). \u201cHe has not shown leadership. \u2026 I think he has not lived up to his promises, the promises of having the passion and the drive for rooting out the scourge of sexual violence,\u201d she told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think that he has lived up to my expectations.\u201d\n\nDealing with these external pressures might actually be easier than the internal challenges. All second-term secretaries are forced to confront a brain drain, but Hagel is finding that replacing outgoing staffers is an especially tall order for a Pentagon bracing for a future of tightening budgets and diminishing influence. The departure of Carter, Hagel\u2019s highly regarded deputy secretary, doesn't come as a surprise given that Carter had been passed over for the top job. But clearly there was friction; he had agitated, with little success, for Hagel to take a more active role in foreign policy, according to people close to both men. When Hagel\u2019s team quietly reached out to Flournoy about her interest\u2014the former Pentagon policy planning chief who left the administration after also being short-listed for the secretary job\u2014she politely declined the offer, according to three people familiar with the situation. Lesser-known Robert Work, a 60-year-old former undersecretary of the Navy, is now considered the top candidate but Hagel was still interviewing other officials as recently as last week, according to administration officials.\n\nIn October, Ash Carter (right), Hagel\u2019s highly regarded deputy secretary who had been passed over for the top job, announced he was stepping down after two years of supervising the operations of the department. | Reuters\n\nHagel has had similar problems filling the department\u2019s vacated top policy post. Over the past month, Hagel\u2019s team has reportedly gauged the interest of several candidates, including Kurt Campbell, a former top State Department official who co-founded (with Flournoy) the Center for a New American Security. Another prominent think-tanker, Kathleen Hicks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, also took a pass. \u201cTo some extent you are seeing the Clinton effect,\u201d says a former defense official who served under President Bill Clinton and recently turned down a Pentagon job offer. \u201cWhy take the risks of working in a second Obama administration, when you can make $300,000 in the private sector and then go work for Hillary?\u201d\n\nOf course Hagel\u2019s greatest challenge may be figuring out the insider game in an administration known for aggregating national security power in the West Wing. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a hawk who admires Hagel\u2019s independence, says he would be wise to emulate his predecessor, Panetta, a sharp-elbowed bureaucratic infighter with an avuncular public image. \u201cChuck needs to pick up where Panetta left off \u2026 fight \u2019em from the inside. \u2026 If he\u2019s not following Leon\u2019s lead, he\u2019s making a big mistake.\u201d\n\nHagel seems to be moving in that direction. He has butted heads with Burwell, the OMB director, over how she is pitching the impact of the cuts to Congress, pressing her to illustrate more vividly\u2014district-by-district\u2014the effects that defense cuts would have on members of Congress. And he has quietly made the case to McDonough and others that they need to take a more active role in bipartisan budget negotiations being run by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), at a time when most of Obama\u2019s attention has been occupied by meltdown of Obamacare. Hagel has also taken a few less conventional steps, meeting last month with Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama\u2019s chief of staff, in an effort to convince the first lady that Pentagon cuts will hit military families hardest. Meanwhile, Hagel has upped his public profile, sitting for a series of mostly gaffe-free interviews with foreign policy reporters and delivering speeches suggesting, ever so subtly, that he won\u2019t remain silent if Obama allows the sequester cuts to go through.\n\nBut critics wonder if Hagel will directly challenge Obama, whom he befriended in the Senate at a time when the Illinois freshman knew next to nothing about foreign or military affairs. Even Hagel\u2019s allies aren\u2019t sure entirely how committed he is to holding the line on budget cuts, or even what that line is. He raised eyebrows among Senate Democrats in November by telling Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), \u201cI don\u2019t have money, but I can handle that,\u201d during a phone conversation\u2014which they read as a \u201csign of weakness,\u201d in the words of one Democratic senator who told me about it.\n\nRepublicans, clearly relishing the travails of a turncoat, are less charitable. \u201cThe first thing he\u2019s got to do is confront the political team in the White House which is \u2026 asserting too much influence over policy decisions,\u201d says Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), an Armed Services Committee member and one of 27 Senate Republicans to oppose Hagel\u2019s confirmation. \u201cI just think it\u2019s his duty to speak the truth to the president and stand up, and you can\u2019t just always continue in office if you are asked to execute a policy that you truly believe is harmful. You have to make up your mind if you should stay or leave.\u201d\n\nIf his own history is any guide, Hagel isn\u2019t about to rip off his stripes in protest. \u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d said a senior administration official close to the secretary. Yet it\u2019s hard not to hear a 1980s-vintage Republican strain in Hagel\u2019s recent public utterances on the need to maintain a robust defense, and he has become increasingly fond of invoking another president, the first one for whom he ever worked.\n\n\u201cPresident Reagan understood the importance of the readiness of our defense enterprise,\u201d Hagel\u2014who helped run the Gipper\u2019s Nebraska operation in 1980\u2014told his audience at the Reagan Library last month. \u201cPresident Reagan inherited a military that was still grappling with the legacy of the Vietnam War. \u2026 [He] began the rebuilding of America's military readiness and capabilities. But it took leadership, it took time and it took resources.\u201d\n\nGlenn Thrush is senior staff writer for Politico Magazine .",
