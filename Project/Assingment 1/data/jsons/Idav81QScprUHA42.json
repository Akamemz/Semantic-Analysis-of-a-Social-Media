And while the overall difference was negligible , between completing the survey with complete anonymity and talking to a live interviewer over the phone , there were important variations with key demographic groups that underscore the cultural divides that have defined this historic election .\n\u201c In the primaries , we conducted a study that sought to get at why Donald Trump was performing better in online surveys than on telephone polls , \u201d said Morning Consult co-founder and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp . \u201c The study showed that a polling mode effect called \u2018 social desirability bias \u2019 \u2014 respondents didn \u2019 t want to tell a live interviewer they were voting for Trump \u2014 was at play . Our new study to assess the general election shows that not to be the case overall , although there are likely still small pockets of shy Trump voters . \u201d\nOverall , the \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult study released Thursday showed Clinton with a 5-point lead among voters interviewed over the phone , 52 percent to 47 percent .\nThe race was modestly closer in online interviews : Clinton \u2019 s share of the vote ticked down a single point , to 51 percent . Trump \u2019 s support inched up a point , to 48 percent .\nThe \u201c shy Trump \u201d theory centers around a basic premise : Given Trump \u2019 s controversial candidacy \u2014 which has featured attacks on electoral norms he derides as \u201c political correctness , \u201d provocative policy proposals like a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and vulgar comments about women \u2014 some voters may perceive it is socially undesirable to admit support for the Republican nominee .\nIt is similar to a phenomenon seen in Great Britain , where Conservative Party candidates have sometimes outperformed their poll numbers because voters did not want to admit they would back the Tory in their districts . Many cited a similar occurrence earlier this year , when British voters decided , in a nationwide referendum , to leave the European Union .\nIn American politics , the 1982 gubernatorial election in California is often cited as an example of social-desirability bias skewing the polls . The race is so legendary \u2014 then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley , an African-American , led in the polls but lost to Republican George Deukmejian on Election Day \u2014 that this phenomenon is known in the U.S. as the \u201c Bradley effect . \u201d\nIf social-desirability bias were to boost Trump next week , it would be the reverse of what some contend befell Bradley : Rather than voters saying they will vote for Bradley and then supporting Deukmejian , Trump \u2019 s campaign is betting that voters are saying they will vote against him now , but will cast a vote for him in the privacy of the voting booth .\nTrump has called himself \u201c Mr . Brexit \u201d on numerous occasions , and he has cited the Bradley effect as evidence that he will outperform his poll numbers significantly on Nov. 8 .\n\u201c He was supposed to win by 10 points , and he lost by 5 or something . So it \u2019 s a certain effect , \u201d Trump said back in June , alluding to Bradley without mentioning him by name . \u201c Now , I have \u2014 unfortunately , maybe fortunately \u2014 the opposite effect . When I poll , I do fine . But when I run , I do much better . \u201d\n\u201c In other words , people say , \u2018 I \u2019 m not going to say who I \u2019 m voting for , \u2019 \u201d Trump added . \u201c And then they get it , and I do much better . It \u2019 s like an amazing effect . \u201d\nKellyanne Conway , Trump \u2019 s campaign manager and a longtime Republican campaign pollster , subscribed to this same theory in an interview with a British television outlet this summer .\n\u201c Donald Trump performs consistently better in online polling where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the elections , \u201d Conway said . \u201c It \u2019 s become socially desirable , especially if you \u2019 re a college-educated person in the U.S. , to say that you \u2019 re against Donald Trump . \u201d\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult study suggests Conway \u2014 who didn \u2019 t reply to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 request for an interview on Wednesday \u2014 is at least half right . While the overall results found completing the survey online didn \u2019 t boost Trump significantly , he did run stronger among more-educated voters .\nIn phone interviews , likely voters with a college degree said they support Clinton by a 21-point margin , 60 percent to 39 percent . But online , that margin shrunk to just 7 points , 53 percent to 46 percent .\nSimilarly , among likely voters in households earning more than $ 50,000 annually , Clinton leads by 10 points over the phone , 54 percent to 44 percent . The candidates run neck-and-neck among these voters online , however : 50 percent for Trump , and 49 percent for Clinton .\nA previous Morning Consult study late last year found Trump ran about 6 points better among Republicans and GOP-leaning independent voters in online interviews than he did over the phone .\nBut that same effect is not carrying over to the same extent in the general election .\nThe November presidential electorate differs from the smaller universe of primary voters and caucus-goers . And while Trump mobilized working-class white voters in the primaries , those voters are \u2014 on the whole \u2014 still better-educated and higher-income than the general electorate .\n`` Seeing a measurable difference in those with higher education and higher income is consistent with our study during the primaries , \u201d Dropp said . \u201c These more \u2018 elite \u2019 groups seem to be the most apprehensive when it comes to telling others they would vote for Trump . That being said , they do not seem to be affecting overall levels of support . \u201d\nWhile many have looked at the disparity between online and phone polls , there are key differences between those surveys that could drive the variance in results .
