This is \u201c The Daily. \u201d Today : As they lobbied the Trump administration for a $ 1.5 trillion tax cut , corporations promised that they would invest the savings right back into the U.S. economy . Jim Tankersley investigates whether that actually happened . It \u2019 s Tuesday , November 19 .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) To all Americans , I say it \u2019 s time for change and time for leadership . Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration . We \u2019 re going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan , even \u2014\nThroughout the 2016 presidential campaign , Donald Trump had promised he was going to cut taxes .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) We are proposing major tax relief for the middle class and lowering the business tax from 35 percent all the way down to 15 percent .\nBig tax cuts for individuals , and especially for businesses , which he said was going to revitalize the American economy as a big part of his economic program .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) And you will see companies expand , companies come back into our country , companies not leave our country anymore because taxes and regulations are so onerous .\nIt \u2019 s one of his top priorities . He gets into office . His team starts working on it . But it \u2019 s not what they do first in Congress .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) Finally , we want a very big tax cut , but can not do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare .\narchived recording This morning , Republicans are fighting to pass a new health care plan . Right now , House Republicans just don \u2019 t have enough votes to pass the replacement to Obamacare .\nAnd in the spring of 2017 , that effort is not going well , and neither is Trump \u2019 s tax plan .\nWell , the version of the tax bill that Republicans are working on has some big opponents in the business community . And there \u2019 s a real question over whether they can actually craft a bill that passes muster with enough folks in Congress , and with the business community , and makes it all the way to President Trump \u2019 s desk , and he \u2019 ll sign it .\nRight . I remember this feeling like a perilous moment for this young presidency . It \u2019 s struggling to repeal the Affordable Care Act , and it is struggling to convince people to support its tax cuts .\narchived recording 1 There is a lot of discord within the Republican Party as to what works when it comes to tax reform and when it comes to health care . archived recording 2 Six months into his term , he has exactly zero big legislative accomplishments to boast about .\nIf there \u2019 s one thing you would have expected a Republican president with Republican majorities to be able to do , it \u2019 s pass a big tax cut .\nAnd yeah , we \u2019 re at this moment in the spring when that looks like that might not happen . And into the breach of that steps Fred Smith .\nFred Smith is a former Marine who went to Yale and wrote a famous paper in a class that imagines a new type of company that is so wild in its imagination that he gets a C on the paper .\nBut he turns around and takes the basis of what he has sketched out on the paper into a company , and builds it into FedEx \u2014\narchived recording America , you \u2019 ve got a new airline . There \u2019 s no first class , no meals , no movies \u2014 in fact , no passengers , just packages .\narchived recording Federal Express , a whole new airline of packages only .\nAnd how exactly does the founder of FedEx , Fred Smith , get involved in this ?\nWell , he has been an advocate for lower corporate tax rates for a really long time . And now he sees this opportunity with President Trump , a real ally of corporate tax cuts in the White House , to push this plan he \u2019 s been working on for years . And he does something more than just push the idea of tax cuts into the public discourse . He and his team at FedEx actually write their own plan \u2014\nThe FedEx plan is really centered around a big cut in the corporate tax rate , from 35 percent to 20 percent , and some extra carrots for businesses to be able to write new investments off their taxes right away , so two things that Fred Smith and a lot of other executives say are going to spur a renaissance of business investment in America .\narchived recording ( frederick smith ) The fundamental problem with the U.S. tax code is that it punishes investment .\nThe argument is that the United States was being held back in its economy by a lack of business investment \u2014\narchived recording ( frederick smith ) And at the end of the day , investment is what produces high-paying jobs .\n\u2014 that companies just weren \u2019 t spending money that they were sitting on , basically , and they weren \u2019 t spending it on capital spending that economists see as very important to economic growth .\narchived recording ( frederick smith ) If you make the United States a better place to invest , there is no question in my mind that we would see a renaissance of capital investment , a growth in G.D.P . and an increase in an income for our blue-collar workforce in the United States .\nWhat kind of investments is Fred Smith talking about ? When we talk about capital investments , what do we mean ?\nWe \u2019 re talking about plants . We \u2019 re talking about equipment . In FedEx \u2019 s case , we \u2019 re talking about airplanes or a transportation hub or new technologies that can help to deliver or sort packages faster . So something that can help you make your business run more efficiently \u2014 that \u2019 s the kind of thing that economists think of as big , productive capital investments .\nGot it . And the reason that would help the rest of the economy is someone has to build that plant , someone has to build that plane . It just ripples across .\nIt ripples across for a couple of reasons . One , it creates demand for those products that are being invested in , which , yes , need to be built , and need to be installed or flown or whatever . But the other real argument is that having these new technologies put in place helps workers do more .\narchived recording ( frederick smith ) Investment is the only way to make blue-collar workers , people that don \u2019 t have college degrees , more productive and have more income . So you can hire six people to move a pile of dirt , or you can hire one person with a bulldozer . The difference is the bulldozer . The bulldozer driver makes a lot more money than the people with the shovels .\nAnd the argument was that companies weren \u2019 t doing that because their profits were taxed too heavily . And it was more profitable for them to invest in other countries than in the United States because America \u2019 s tax rates weren \u2019 t competitive .\narchived recording ( frederick smith ) It \u2019 s just like us playing basketball . And on our end of the court we \u2019 re playing with a 12-foot basket , and everybody else that we compete with around the world is shooting on a 10-foot basket .\nFred Smith makes this very clear promise , saying , if we cut corporate tax rates , businesses are going to start investing again in America , and the economy is going to grow faster . And that \u2019 s going to help workers and everyone .\nJim , how skeptical are people of the Fred Smith school of thinking here , that big corporate tax cuts will lead to big investments in the economy and to a lot of growth in the U.S. ?\nWell , a huge part of Washington is not skeptical at all . They are pushing this . The Trump administration , Republicans in Congress , many sort of economists who support tax reform are arguing to one degree or another that there will be more investment , lots more , if you just cut the corporate tax rate . There is , though , this dissenting group , including a lot of Democrats and liberal economists , who make the argument that , hey , companies have a lot of money . They don \u2019 t need lower taxes to have just a little bit more money to invest it . If they want to invest it , they can . It \u2019 s sitting right there on their balance sheets . And cutting their taxes is not going to dramatically increase investment because that \u2019 s not what \u2019 s holding them back .\nAnd I \u2019 m curious , Jim , how much was FedEx paying in corporate taxes at the time that Fred Smith was making this argument ?\nSo throughout the time that he \u2019 s making this argument , FedEx is paying what it calls in its financial filings an effective tax rate of about 33 percent or 34 percent , which is a lot . In just the fiscal year 2017 alone , it paid more than $ 1.5 billion in taxes .\nIt \u2019 s a meaningful tax bill . And it \u2019 s close to the top corporate tax rate in America , which is 35 percent before the Trump tax cuts passed .\nThe tax plan arrives in Washington and gets a warm reception , and it injects energy in what had been a little bit of a stalled process .\narchived recording Brightening prospects of a major tax cut , especially for corporations .\nAnd it helps open the door again for all of the champions of tax reform to work together for a new bill .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) And as a Christmas gift to all of our hardworking families , we hope Congress will pass massive tax cuts for the American people .\nSo Republicans get back on track on the tax bill , particularly spurred on by the fact that they fail completely to repeal the Affordable Care Act . So now this is it . The business community is back on board , they \u2019 re lobbying hard . The Trump administration is working key details out with congressional negotiators .\narchived recording President Trump is heading to Capitol Hill today to boost momentum for the tax reform bill that could become his first legislative victory .\nWe enter the fall . The House passes a version of the bill .\narchived recording Debate is still happening on the Senate floor . But this bill does appear to be gaining momentum .\nThe Senate narrowly passes a version of the bill , with no Democrats supporting it . And then they put them together , and the final proposal includes the really big corporate rate cut . Basically , just like what Fred Smith and FedEx have proposed .\nAnd it includes a bunch of other incentives for investment , also like FedEx had proposed .\nThe bill passes . I do vaguely recall in my fever dreams from that time period of working 20-hour days that the bill did pass .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) The corporate tax rate , as you know , will be lowered from 35 percent to 21 percent . That means that more products will be made in the U.S.A. A lot of things are going to be happening in the U.S.A. We \u2019 re going to bring back our companies . They \u2019 ve already started coming back . I think they had a certain confidence in me . They figured we were going to get this done .\nThis law includes individual tax cuts . It includes some other provisions . But the centerpiece , the thing it was sold on , was the idea that it would reinvigorate economic growth in America . And it would do that by supercharging business investment . It \u2019 s almost hard to understate just how often and vocally Republicans and the president made that case to voters , that this is what American business and the American economy needed for more domestic investment .\nSo once this bill passes , what is FedEx \u2019 s tax bill ? How much does it save ?\nSo the bill passes . And FedEx files financial statements for the fiscal year 2018 at the end of the year . And it shows that rather than paying $ 1.5 billion , like it paid the last year , it actually was owed money by the government . It has a negative effective tax rate .\nWow . And how much of that savings , $ 1.5 plus billion , is attributable to this tax bill ?\nAll of it . Over the first two years after the tax law , we can count $ 1.6 billion .\nHmm . So that \u2019 s a pretty staggering figure . But then again , we know that FedEx plans to use that money to reinvest in the American economy .\nSo that \u2019 s the story that FedEx told before the law passed .\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . So Jim , what happened with all this money that FedEx saved from this tax cut that it played such a huge role in shaping ?\nFedEx had said , up to the eve of the bill being signed , that they were going to use the money to increase investment . But they didn \u2019 t . Investment actually went down compared to what they had projected . And then the next year , it went down again .\nHmm . So what did FedEx do with these savings if they were not investing it in the kind of things that we all thought they would ?\nWell , it largely rewarded its shareholders . It increased dividends , which is the money it regularly pays people who own its stock . And it bought back shares of that stock , which has the effect of pushing up prices of the stock for the people who own it . Now , to be clear , it did some good things for its workers , too . It accelerated some raises . It increased the size of its workforce . It made a large contribution to its pension plan . But the big winner were shareholders . And that \u2019 s a group that is largely , if you look at who owns stock in America , skewed toward the very wealthy .\nSo the promise that FedEx made , that they would invest much of the savings from this tax cut into the kind of projects that would benefit everyday workers across the economy \u2014 instead , the benefit of the way they used this money really went to people who are largely already pretty well-off .\nI had a lot of questions for FedEx about how they spent their tax money . I tried to ask some of the executives over a period of a couple months . I was never granted an interview with an executive . I sent very detailed questions , including one very similar to the one you just asked . Most of them went unanswered . I would love to hear FedEx \u2019 s explanation of how it has made the decisions it \u2019 s made with its tax cut windfall .\nHmm . Jim , how typical was this for companies that received these big savings from the tax cuts , that they did not use it to invest , and instead they used it to buy back shares or pay dividends ?\nIt was very typical . My colleagues and I did a few different analyses to sort of demonstrate just how widespread this type of behavior was . And here \u2019 s a few ways of looking at it . One is that companies increased share buybacks and dividends by about triple as much as they increased investment following the tax cuts .\nAnother is that investment has now grown more slowly since the tax cuts under President Trump than it grew before the tax cuts under President Trump .\nWhich is another way of saying that the central claim of the tax cuts , and how they would be used , and how it would benefit the economy , that has just not come to pass .\nJim , if these companies were to call you back , and you were able to ask what their thinking was , would there be an argument from a company like FedEx about why the way it chose to use this money is wise and will benefit the American economy ?\nAbsolutely . The argument goes like this . First off , rewarding shareholders is just another way to increase investment . Because those shareholders will use that money to invest in different companies , who will use that money productively . The other argument is that it \u2019 s just too soon to tell the effects of tax cuts on investment , that basically what changes for companies when you cut their tax rate is not , oh , they get a bunch of money today . It \u2019 s that investments tomorrow pay off even more . Because the profits you get back , you pay less taxes on . And so we would expect over time to see more investment , not right away .\nIs there any truth to that ? Are these arguments from the companies about how they use this money accurate , that it eventually will really help the economy ?\nI think there are mechanical truths that you can see to those arguments . But it \u2019 s also true that this is all really complicated , and that this was sold as a very simple relationship . Cut the taxes , investment will increase . And just the fact that we \u2019 re not seeing that happen right away flies in the face of the arguments that were used to sell the bill . I think that \u2019 s really important here , is that , yes , it may be true that investment over time is slightly more competitive in America because of a reduction in marginal business tax rates . But that was not what President Trump stood up at rallies and talked about . He talked about growing the American economy by 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 percent a year because of all this flood of investment coming back to the United States . And we just don \u2019 t see it .\nJim , why is this important , at the end of the day ? I mean , these companies successfully lobbied for a tax cut . They got it . It \u2019 s their money . Theoretically , can \u2019 t they just do what they want to do with it , whatever that is ?\nI think it \u2019 s important to hold politicians and their supporters accountable for the promises they make , particularly when those promises have real-world implications . The economy is not performing as well as we were promised it would when the tax cuts were passed . It \u2019 s not growing as fast . It doesn \u2019 t have as much investment . And if you believe the arguments that were made to sell this , that \u2019 s hurting workers . Because slower growth is keeping their incomes from rising as fast as they should be . So real people are suffering from not having that additional growth that they were promised they would have and now don \u2019 t . A then there \u2019 s this one last thing , which is this all comes at a cost . It \u2019 s not free to just give money back to corporations by cutting their tax bills . Despite what the proponents said , which was that the law would pay for itself \u2014 the additional growth \u2014 what we \u2019 re actually seeing is a massive , hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars-a-year effect to grow the federal budget deficit . And last year , that deficit came very close to topping $ 1 trillion .\nAnd how big a role is the tax cut playing in that ballooning deficit ?\nIt is the primary driver of additional deficits beyond what we had already before the law was passed .\nIn a statement , FedEx criticized the Times reporting about its tax savings and investments , but offered no specific factual objections . In the statement , the company \u2019 s founder and C.E.O. , Fred Smith , challenged the publisher of The Times to a public debate about federal tax policy in Washington . In response , a spokeswoman for The Times dismissed the request as a stunt and a , quote , \u201c effort to distract from the findings of our story . \u201d\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . Here \u2019 s what else you need to know today .\narchived recording ( mike pompeo ) The establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not , per se , inconsistent with international law .\nOn Monday , the Trump administration declared that the U.S. does not consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be in violation of international law , reversing four decades of American policy .\narchived recording ( mike pompeo ) We \u2019 re not addressing or prejudging the ultimate status of the West Bank . This is for the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate .\nThe Times reports that the new policy would likely doom any peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians by legitimizing Israeli settlements on West Bank territory that Palestinians have demanded for a future state . And \u2014\n\u2014 in a closely watched showdown , police in Hong Kong have surrounded nearly 500 student protesters on a college campus , threatening them with gunfire and tear gas unless they surrender . The standoff has turned the college campus into Hong Kong \u2019 s latest battleground over democracy and the influence of China . The students there have used homemade firebombs , slingshots and bows and arrows to defend themselves against the police , but now appear to be cornered .",

I do vaguely recall in my fever dreams from that time period of working 20-hour days that the bill did pass.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\njim tankersley\n\nAnd the president did sign it into law.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) The corporate tax rate, as you know, will be lowered from 35 percent to 21 percent. That means that more products will be made in the U.S.A. A lot of things are going to be happening in the U.S.A. We\u2019re going to bring back our companies. They\u2019ve already started coming back. I think they had a certain confidence in me. They figured we were going to get this done.\n\njim tankersley\n\nThis law includes individual tax cuts. It includes some other provisions. But the centerpiece, the thing it was sold on, was the idea that it would reinvigorate economic growth in America. And it would do that by supercharging business investment. It\u2019s almost hard to understate just how often and vocally Republicans and the president made that case to voters, that this is what American business and the American economy needed for more domestic investment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo once this bill passes, what is FedEx\u2019s tax bill? How much does it save?\n\njim tankersley\n\nSo the bill passes. And FedEx files financial statements for the fiscal year 2018 at the end of the year. And it shows that rather than paying $1.5 billion, like it paid the last year, it actually was owed money by the government. It has a negative effective tax rate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat?\n\njim tankersley\n\nYeah, negative 5 percent.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo less than zero.\n\njim tankersley\n\nLess than zero.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. And how much of that savings, $1.5 plus billion, is attributable to this tax bill?\n\njim tankersley\n\nAll of it. Over the first two years after the tax law, we can count $1.6 billion.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. So that\u2019s a pretty staggering figure. But then again, we know that FedEx plans to use that money to reinvest in the American economy.\n\njim tankersley\n\nSo that\u2019s the story that FedEx told before the law passed.\n\n[music]\n\nBut the story that played out is different.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Jim, what happened with all this money that FedEx saved from this tax cut that it played such a huge role in shaping?\n\njim tankersley\n\nFedEx had said, up to the eve of the bill being signed, that they were going to use the money to increase investment. But they didn\u2019t. Investment actually went down compared to what they had projected. And then the next year, it went down again.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. So what did FedEx do with these savings if they were not investing it in the kind of things that we all thought they would?\n\njim tankersley\n\nWell, it largely rewarded its shareholders. It increased dividends, which is the money it regularly pays people who own its stock. And it bought back shares of that stock, which has the effect of pushing up prices of the stock for the people who own it. Now, to be clear, it did some good things for its workers, too. It accelerated some raises. It increased the size of its workforce. It made a large contribution to its pension plan. But the big winner were shareholders. And that\u2019s a group that is largely, if you look at who owns stock in America, skewed toward the very wealthy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the promise that FedEx made, that they would invest much of the savings from this tax cut into the kind of projects that would benefit everyday workers across the economy \u2014 instead, the benefit of the way they used this money really went to people who are largely already pretty well-off.\n\njim tankersley\n\nIn the short term, that seems very clear.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy do you think that FedEx did that?\n\njim tankersley\n\nI had a lot of questions for FedEx about how they spent their tax money. I tried to ask some of the executives over a period of a couple months. I was never granted an interview with an executive. I sent very detailed questions, including one very similar to the one you just asked. Most of them went unanswered. I would love to hear FedEx\u2019s explanation of how it has made the decisions it\u2019s made with its tax cut windfall.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. Jim, how typical was this for companies that received these big savings from the tax cuts, that they did not use it to invest, and instead they used it to buy back shares or pay dividends?\n\njim tankersley\n\nIt was very typical. My colleagues and I did a few different analyses to sort of demonstrate just how widespread this type of behavior was. And here\u2019s a few ways of looking at it. One is that companies increased share buybacks and dividends by about triple as much as they increased investment following the tax cuts.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\njim tankersley\n\nAnother is that investment has now grown more slowly since the tax cuts under President Trump than it grew before the tax cuts under President Trump.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhich is another way of saying that the central claim of the tax cuts, and how they would be used, and how it would benefit the economy, that has just not come to pass.\n\njim tankersley\n\nIt is not.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJim, if these companies were to call you back, and you were able to ask what their thinking was, would there be an argument from a company like FedEx about why the way it chose to use this money is wise and will benefit the American economy?\n\njim tankersley\n\nAbsolutely. The argument goes like this. First off, rewarding shareholders is just another way to increase investment. Because those shareholders will use that money to invest in different companies, who will use that money productively. The other argument is that it\u2019s just too soon to tell the effects of tax cuts on investment, that basically what changes for companies when you cut their tax rate is not, oh, they get a bunch of money today. It\u2019s that investments tomorrow pay off even more. Because the profits you get back, you pay less taxes on. And so we would expect over time to see more investment, not right away.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs there any truth to that? Are these arguments from the companies about how they use this money accurate, that it eventually will really help the economy?\n\njim tankersley\n\nI think there are mechanical truths that you can see to those arguments. But it\u2019s also true that this is all really complicated, and that this was sold as a very simple relationship. Cut the taxes, investment will increase. And just the fact that we\u2019re not seeing that happen right away flies in the face of the arguments that were used to sell the bill. I think that\u2019s really important here, is that, yes, it may be true that investment over time is slightly more competitive in America because of a reduction in marginal business tax rates. But that was not what President Trump stood up at rallies and talked about. He talked about growing the American economy by 3, 4, 5, 6 percent a year because of all this flood of investment coming back to the United States. And we just don\u2019t see it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJim, why is this important, at the end of the day? I mean, these companies successfully lobbied for a tax cut. They got it. It\u2019s their money. Theoretically, can\u2019t they just do what they want to do with it, whatever that is?\n\njim tankersley\n\nI think it\u2019s important to hold politicians and their supporters accountable for the promises they make, particularly when those promises have real-world implications. The economy is not performing as well as we were promised it would when the tax cuts were passed. It\u2019s not growing as fast. It doesn\u2019t have as much investment. And if you believe the arguments that were made to sell this, that\u2019s hurting workers. Because slower growth is keeping their incomes from rising as fast as they should be. So real people are suffering from not having that additional growth that they were promised they would have and now don\u2019t. A then there\u2019s this one last thing, which is this all comes at a cost. It\u2019s not free to just give money back to corporations by cutting their tax bills. Despite what the proponents said, which was that the law would pay for itself \u2014 the additional growth \u2014 what we\u2019re actually seeing is a massive, hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars-a-year effect to grow the federal budget deficit. And last year, that deficit came very close to topping $1 trillion.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how big a role is the tax cut playing in that ballooning deficit?\n\njim tankersley\n\nIt is the primary driver of additional deficits beyond what we had already before the law was passed.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJim, thank you very much.\n\njim tankersley\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn a statement, FedEx criticized the Times reporting about its tax savings and investments, but offered no specific factual objections. In the statement, the company\u2019s founder and C.E.O., Fred Smith, challenged the publisher of The Times to a public debate about federal tax policy in Washington. In response, a spokeswoman for The Times dismissed the request as a stunt and a, quote, \u201ceffort to distract from the findings of our story.\u201d\n\n[music]\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.

This is for the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe Times reports that the new policy would likely doom any peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians by legitimizing Israeli settlements on West Bank territory that Palestinians have demanded for a future state.
