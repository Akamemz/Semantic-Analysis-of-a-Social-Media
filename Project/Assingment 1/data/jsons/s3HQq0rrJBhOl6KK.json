    "content": "On Monday morning , President Donald Trump decided that there was an urgent matter he needed to clear up for the public . \u201c I call my own shots , largely based on an accumulation of data , and everyone knows it , \u201d he tweeted . \u201c Some FAKE NEWS media , in order to marginalize , lies ! \u201d\nIt may seem odd that the president of the United States would feel compelled to remind the country that he is actually in charge . But over the past week and a half of Trump \u2019 s young presidency , a narrative has been gaining steam in the media and among political observers that it is not Trump but in fact White House chief strategist Steve Bannon who is actually running the show .\nIn the wake of the chaos following Trump \u2019 s order banning entry into the US from nationals of seven majority-Muslim countries \u2014 and in the wake of reports that Bannon was the chief architect of the policy \u2014 the hashtag # PresidentBannon began to spread on Twitter , and images of Bannon as a puppet master pulling Trump \u2019 s strings became commonplace . A Saturday Night Live skit concluded an Oval Office session with its version of Bannon asking Trump for the president \u2019 s desk back , and Alec Baldwin as Trump responding , \u201c Yes , of course , Mr. President . \u201d\nPerhaps most prominently , Time magazine put Bannon on a striking cover and dubbed him \u201c The Great Manipulator. \u201d Just whom he might be manipulating was left unstated .\nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough cited the Time cover in a Morning Joe segment Monday as an example of how \u201c this Steve Bannon thing just keeps coming up , people are saying \u2018 President Steve Bannon. \u2019 \u201d Scarborough added that it was very unusual for a White House staffer to develop such a high profile so quickly , and though he professed to believe that \u201c Donald Trump is the final decider , \u201d he said that other people keep wanting to hear about Bannon \u2019 s influence . ( Trump \u2019 s \u201c I call my own shots \u201d tweet , which came less than an hour later , may have been a direct response to this exchange , and it also calls to mind President George W. Bush \u2019 s \u201c I \u2019 m the decider \u201d remark . )\nFor some , the \u201c President Bannon \u201d meme is useful as a deliberate attempt to annoy a president they view as thin-skinned and egotistical . But while it \u2019 s surely going too far to say that Bannon is \u201c the real president \u201d \u2014 he does work for Trump and serve at his pleasure , after all \u2014 the chief strategist has indeed been remarkably influential in shaping the new administration so far . Not only are his fingerprints all over the most controversial parts of Trump \u2019 s immigration actions , but that same weekend Trump announced another order that gave Bannon a full seat on the National Security Council Principals Committee , which is unprecedented for a White House political adviser .\nFurthermore , while the \u201c powerful political aide skilled in the dark , manipulative arts \u201d is a common trope , Bannon isn \u2019 t just any aide . His prominence is particularly noteworthy because there are indications that he is more hard-line than Trump in certain ways . Where Trump has said he loves legal immigration , Bannon has called it a \u201c problem. \u201d Where Trump has often been cozy with moneyed elites on Wall Street and in Hollywood , Bannon professes to despise them . Bannon has even predicted that the US will go to war in the South China Sea within five to 10 years .\nMany liberals , and even many conservatives , therefore find Bannon \u2019 s apparent influence on Trump immensely disturbing . And that \u2019 s just the way Bannon likes it .\nStephen K. Bannon grew up in Virginia , served in the Navy , went to Harvard Business School , became a banker at Goldman Sachs , and eventually got very , very rich from a deal in which he got a share of royalties from the TV show Seinfeld . His wealth freed him up to pursue his own interests , first as a documentary filmmaker and then as a close associate of Andrew Breitbart , the conservative political activist who founded the website Breitbart News . After Breitbart himself died suddenly in 2012 , Bannon took over the site as executive chair .\nUnder Bannon , Breitbart News filled a unique role in the conservative media ecosystem . The site was relentlessly critical of Obama and top Democrats , but also of top Republicans it portrayed as sellouts to powerful interests , like House Speaker Paul Ryan and his predecessor John Boehner . The site \u2019 s tone and editorial choices on racial matters are also the subject of major controversy \u2014 the site spotlights tales of lurid crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants , Muslims , and African Americans , and Bannon himself has called the site \u201c the platform for the alt-right , \u201d according to Mother Jones .\nSo when Trump launched his presidential campaign , the anti-immigrant , anti-Muslim , anti-elite rhetoric he used all sounded familiar to Breitbart readers . Under Bannon , Breitbart News \u2019 s coverage became staunchly pro-Trump . Few then were surprised when , in an August 2016 shake-up , Trump brought on Bannon as his campaign CEO \u2014 this was merely the formalization of an alliance that had already existed for many months . When Trump unexpectedly won the election , he decided to reward Bannon with a top White House job . ( Josh Green wrote the definitive pre\u2013White House profile of Bannon , and Zack Beauchamp has a fuller explainer on the history of Bannon and Breitbart . )\n2 ) Why would anyone get the idea that Bannon has a different agenda than Trump ?\nThe idea that Steve Bannon might be manipulating Donald Trump to advance his own agenda doesn \u2019 t come out of nowhere \u2014 in fact , it comes from Bannon \u2019 s own lips . As late as summer 2016 , when Bannon was still at Breitbart and just months before he moved to the Trump campaign , he told a journalist that Trump was a \u201c blunt instrument for us \u201d and said , \u201c I don \u2019 t know whether he really gets it or not . \u201d\nWho is the \u201c us \u201d there ? Overall , Bannon sees himself , Breitbart , and now Trump as allies in what he calls a \u201c global populist movement , \u201d which is taking back the interests of \u201c the people \u201d against various malefactors like rapacious capitalists , open borders \u201c globalists , \u201d unauthorized immigrants , and radical Islamists . He \u2019 s the type of person who pontificates a lot about how \u201c the Judeo-Christian West \u201d is under siege , and who thinks the US and many European governments are failing to appropriately defend the interests of people born there .\nThe word Bannon has embraced to describe this movement is \u201c nationalism. \u201d Indeed , he sees himself and Trump as embarking on a conscious project to demolish the old American political camps and \u201c build an entirely new political movement , '' he told Michael Wolff in November . `` I 'm not a white nationalist , I 'm a nationalist . I 'm an economic nationalist , '' he continued . \u201c It will be as exciting as the 1930s , greater than the Reagan revolution \u2014 conservatives , plus populists , in an economic nationalist movement . ''\nAccording to the Daily Beast \u2019 s Ronald Radosh , Bannon gave an even more grandiose statement of his motivations a few years back . He called himself a \u201c Leninist \u201d because \u201c Lenin wanted to destroy the state , and that \u2019 s my goal too . I want to bring everything crashing down , and destroy all of today \u2019 s establishment. \u201d ( Bannon now claims he doesn \u2019 t remember saying this . )\nBut despite Bannon \u2019 s denials , there are unmistakable racial and ethnic aspects to the movement he \u2019 s building , and critics argue \u201c white nationalism \u201d is in fact the key to his project . Bannon has often sought to drum up political support ( in the form of either pageviews or votes ) by mobilizing white Americans against various frightening \u201c others \u201d \u2014 whether they \u2019 re Black Lives Matter protesters , immigrants , or refugees .\nMuch of this fits quite well with Trump \u2019 s worldview . But Trump has also appointed many more traditional Republicans to his administration , and could conceivably be swayed toward more mainstream policies as a result . Bannon also seems to genuinely differ from Trump on a couple fronts . First , there \u2019 s sometimes a religious tinge to his rhetoric \u2014 he \u2019 s argued that \u201c secularism has sapped the strength of the Judeo-Christian West to defend its ideals , \u201d and has even taken an interest in internal Vatican disputes .\nSecond , while Trump says legal immigration is wonderful , Bannon views it as a \u201c problem and thinks it needs to be cut back. \u201d This was dramatically demonstrated in an exchange the two had on Bannon \u2019 s radio show in November 2015 , in which Bannon made the false claim that most Silicon Valley CEOs were from Asia and expressed his unhappiness with that . \u201c A country \u2019 s more than an economy . We \u2019 re a civic society , \u201d he said .\nNot just illegal immigrants but immigrants in general , Bannon seemed to believe , were sapping America \u2019 s Americanness . In this , he goes further than Trump , but he \u2019 s in alignment with several other important figures in the new administration . Most prominent among these are attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions and several former Sessions aides , including senior White House adviser Stephen Miller . Past public statements make clear that Bannon , Sessions , and Miller are all harsh critics of even legal immigration . In some tellings , they are frequently pitted against more traditional Republicans in administration disputes .\nIt \u2019 s hardly unprecedented for a president to give a political adviser a top job , as George W. Bush did for Karl Rove and Barack Obama did for David Axelrod . But recent incoming presidents have tended to designate one chief of staff who is indisputably in charge .\nNot Trump . In a November press release , the Trump transition announced that Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus would be chief of staff \u2014 but that Bannon would fill the newly created position of \u201c chief strategist. \u201d Priebus and Bannon , the press release said , would work as \u201c equal partners. \u201d And yet Kremlinologists could n't help noticing that Bannon \u2019 s name was listed first .\nBannon , it should be noted , fits the stereotype of the sinister political adviser to a T \u2014and even seems to revel in it . \u201c Darkness is good , \u201d he told Wolff . \u201c Dick Cheney . Darth Vader . Satan . That 's power. \u201d Note that Bannon said this after the election and his appointment to a top White House job . ( These comments are why Saturday Night Live portrayed him as the Grim Reaper in its recent skit . )\nBut as chief strategist , Bannon is more than just a political adviser . He \u2019 s taken on a major role in policy and is , by most accounts , the leading force in crafting the Trump administration \u2019 s agenda \u2014 especially the series of White House\u2013issued executive orders with which Trump began his presidency . \u201c Mr . Bannon has rushed into the vacuum , telling allies that he and Mr. Miller have a brief window in which to push through their vision of Mr. Trump \u2019 s economic nationalism , \u201d the New York Times \u2019 s Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman report .\nAs the transition proceeded , many top White House positions and Cabinet jobs went to traditional Republicans rather than Bannon-esque outsiders , suggesting to some observers that the steady hand of Priebus was at the helm and that the Trump administration might actually end up being surprisingly normal .\nThat narrative exploded on January 27 , Trump \u2019 s seventh full day in office . On that day , Trump issued the executive order meant to block all refugees , and nationals of seven majority-Muslim countries , from entering the US for several months .\nChaos ensued . Hundreds of people who had been previously cleared to enter the US were detained at airports around the country or prevented from boarding their flights to the US at all . Shockingly , the administration initially applied the entry ban to green card holders too , even though many of them had lived and worked in the US for years . Thousands turned out to protest , even many Republicans started to criticize the order , and a series of lawsuits soon brought the policy to a screeching halt .\nThe blame game that ensued during and after all this made clear the order was a Steve Bannon production . A set of reports described the order as crafted by Bannon and Miller with minimal input from the relevant agencies . One of its most objectionable features \u2014 the ban on entry for green card holders \u2014 was personally dictated by Bannon and Miller over the Department of Homeland Security \u2019 s objections , according to CNN \u2019 s Evan Perez and Pamela Brown .\nFurthermore , it turned out that Bannon had a starring role in the other executive action Trump signed alongside the immigration order that Friday . This order gave Bannon a permanent seat on the Principals Committee of the National Security Council , placing him among the president \u2019 s top foreign policy advisers \u2014 an unprecedented role for a political hand .\nThrush and Haberman report that Trump was angry afterward because he \u201c was not fully briefed \u201d on that order \u2019 s details , and that it was an even \u201c greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban. \u201d ( However , Time \u2019 s Zeke Miller has his own source saying that Trump was in fact briefed on Bannon \u2019 s new role . ) In any case , the reports on Bannon \u2019 s role in the immigration order converged with this NSC order , and the \u201c President Bannon \u201d meme was born , making him a sort of combination Dick Cheney/Karl Rove figure in the minds of liberals .\nThe fallout from the travel ban controversy has apparently led to Bannon being reined in somewhat . Both the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post report Trump has clarified to his staff that Priebus is his top aide and that policy changes have to go through him and through a more rigorous vetting process .\nBy all accounts , though , Bannon remains very influential , and there \u2019 s no real talk of him being on the outs with Trump \u2014 not yet , at least . Indeed , Bannon and Trump have come a long way together . They share similar pugilistic instincts and a willingness to flout the political class \u2019 s conventional wisdom . Plus , it \u2019 s understandable if Trump places a great deal of stock in Bannon \u2019 s political instincts , since Bannon did oversee a campaign that put him in the White House despite the predictions of practically every expert .\nBut Bannon will only continue to keep that influence if Trump is satisfied with how his presidency is going . And while the strategy of constantly throwing red meat to the base worked well to boost Breitbart News \u2019 s traffic numbers and to win Trump the election , it has not worked so well when it comes to governance . All it has done so far is earned Trump record-low job approval for a new president .\nSo at some point , Trump may have to decide whether holding on to the loyalty of Bannon \u2019 s movement is really enough . Perhaps he might decide he \u2019 d prefer trying to convert some new voters to his side . And if he does opt for that route , Steve Bannon may no longer be so useful to him .",

All it has done so far is earned Trump record-low job approval for a new president.\n\nSo at some point, Trump may have to decide whether holding on to the loyalty of Bannon\u2019s movement is really enough. Perhaps he might decide he\u2019d prefer trying to convert some new voters to his side. And if he does opt for that route, Steve Bannon may no longer be so useful to him.",
