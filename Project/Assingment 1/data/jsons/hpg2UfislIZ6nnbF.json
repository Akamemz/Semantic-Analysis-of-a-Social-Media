    "content": "In less than three months , COVID-19 has changed from a peripheral concern , barely registering in presidential debates , to the greatest global crisis since World War II . We are living in extraordinary times , and there is scarcely an industry or country that has escaped the impact of the new virus . In the United States , the Federal Reserve estimates that the unemployment rate could briefly skyrocket to 32 percent\u2014higher than anything the country experienced during the Great Depression . People have lost their livelihoods . Many others are scared about what is to come when they develop a fever or cough .\nIllness , financial hardship , and loneliness are , nevertheless , well-trodden paths . One man who can guide us along the way is Seneca the Younger , a Roman philosopher and statesman and contemporary of Jesus . Seneca suffered from asthma , and his condition sometimes left him bedridden and gasping for air . As he grew older , he even contemplated suicide because his affliction was so severe . Seneca \u2019 s lifelong illness , as well as his background in Stoic philosophy , gave him the insight he needed to find dignity and joy in periods of extended hardship . \u201c There are times , \u201d he once wrote , \u201c when even to live is an act of bravery . \u201d\nYou don \u2019 t have to test positive for COVID-19 to appreciate the consolation offered by Seneca \u2019 s wisdom . Pandemics are multitiered crises\u2014the virus itself is only one among many serious disruptions in our lives . Maybe you lost your job after the economy in your country fell into a coma . Or perhaps you \u2019 ve recently been diagnosed with diabetes and you \u2019 re worried about how the virus might aggravate it . You may also be unsure how to endure physical isolation in the months ahead , even though you already know that several months of suppression and social distancing is vital if the spread of this highly infectious disease is to be contained . Seneca , who was once exiled to Corsica by Emperor Claudius , would have a word or two to say about separation from friends and family .\nThe starting point is to have compassion for ourselves . We are not , after all , in complete control of our initial reactions to a diagnosis or an unexpected layoff . As Seneca writes in his 11th letter to Lucilius :\nWhen they face a crowd of people some men , even ones with the stoutest of hearts , break into a sort of sweat one usually sees on persons in an overheated or exhausted state ; some men experience a trembling at the knees when they are about to speak ; some a chattering of the teeth , a stuttering tongue or stammering lips . These are things which neither training nor experience ever eliminates . Nature just wields her power and uses the particular weakness to make even the strongest conscious of her .\nHere , Seneca is meditating upon the terror induced by public speaking . Nevertheless , his lesson about humility before nature is broadly applicable . The true test of resilience lies in how we cope with our subordination .\nIt helps to clarify our thinking and identify threats . In his 78th letter to Lucilius , who at the time was fighting his own battle with asthma , Seneca lists the three most common fears that attack us during illness : \u201c dying , the physical suffering , and the interruption of our pleasures. \u201d With characteristic bluntness , he argues that to dread an illness because it might kill you is irrational . \u201c You will not die because you are sick , but because you are alive , \u201d he points out . \u201c That end still awaits you when you have been cured . In getting well again you may be escaping some ill health but not death. \u201d Seneca \u2019 s point is not that life is unimportant , nor that we should be indifferent to medical advice . Rather , he is warning that fear of the inevitable only compounds our suffering , because \u201c in illness , the suffering is always bearable so long as you refuse to be affected by the ultimate threat . \u201d\nProlonged anxiety is a petri dish for all sorts of poor health outcomes , including , ironically , an elevated susceptibility to infectious diseases . Seneca placed supreme importance on managing anxiety by occasionally running through the worst-case scenarios in our minds , instructing Lucilius to \u201c always take full note of fortune \u2019 s habit of behaving just as she pleases , treating her as if she were actually going to do everything it is in her power to do so. \u201d Confronting what scares us in a safe environment is , of course , an established technique in cognitive behavioral therapy . Seneca \u2019 s peers called this practice premeditio malorum , and there are simple guides to begin applying it immediately to our own situations . After doing this , \u201c whatever you have been expecting for some time comes as less of a shock , \u201d Seneca promises his friend .\nFear of mortality isn \u2019 t only bad for the individual concerned . It also creates problems for others . Just a few days ago , a doctor from Farmington sounded the alarm about a large influx of New Yorkers fleeing their state to wait out the pandemic in Maine . In other words , people almost certainly already exposed to COVID-19 were so scared of the virus that they risked infecting the population of another state to find sanctuary . It is hard to imagine a more destructive and short-sighted response , although the frightened individuals who hoard cleaning supplies at supermarkets are doing their best .\nThe second disruption Seneca identifies is physical suffering . He concedes that pain is a part of illness , but he promises Lucilius a more bearable experience if he separates the sensation itself from exaggerated perceptions of it :\nProvided that one \u2019 s thinking has not been adding anything to it , pain is a trivial sort of thing . If by contrast you start giving yourself encouragement , saying to yourself , \u201c it \u2019 s nothing\u2014or nothing much , anyway\u2014let \u2019 s stick it out , it \u2019 ll be over presently , \u201d then in thinking it is a trivial matter you will be ensuring that it actually is . Everything hangs on one \u2019 s thinking . The love of power or money or luxurious living are not the only things guided by popular thinking . We take our cue from people \u2019 s thinking even in the way we feel pain .\nSeneca encourages Lucilius to fortify himself by thinking of famous individuals who have dealt with worse . \u201c This is a time for recollecting all those individuals of exceptional courage who have triumphed over pain , \u201d he writes . Identifying role models is an important practice in Stoicism , because they inspire us and are benchmarks for measuring our own behavior . In this case , they also can provide us with perspective , which in turn shapes how we experience our own suffering .\nLiteral pain , of course , isn \u2019 t the only way that diseases can debilitate our bodies . We can also lose the ability to sleep , to walk , or in the most extreme cases of COVID-19 , to even breathe without assistance . These set objective limits to what we can accomplish while we are ill. Seneca \u2019 s answer is to shift our priorities . Or , as the modern Stoic author Massimo Pigliucci puts it , \u201c we need to focus on abilities , not disabilities. \u201d In one deeply moving passage , Seneca writes :\n[ I ] f you meet sickness in a sensible matter , do you really think you have accomplished nothing ? You will be demonstrating that even if one can not always beat it one can always bear an illness . There is room for heroism , I assure you , in bed as anywhere else . War and the battlefront are not the only spheres in which proof is to be had of a spirited and fearless character : a person \u2019 s bravery is no less evident under the bedclothes .\nThe final disruption that Seneca acknowledges is \u201c the interruption of our pleasures. \u201d We \u2019 re all familiar with this , especially if we live in a state or a country that has imposed a stay-at-home order . Acting on the best advice of epidemiologists and physicians , multiple governments have shut down cinemas , weddings , bonfires , beaches , and all other non-essential businesses . These shutdowns are literally saving lives .\nStill , all these interruptions working in tandem are potentially very stressful . Seneca argues that eventually , we \u2019 ll stop craving what we used to desire . \u201c And there is nothing harsh about having to do without things for which you have ceased to have any craving , \u201d he concludes . ( What Seneca is describing is called hedonic adaptation , a well-attested phenomenon in human psychology . ) Even with modern technology , however , physical isolation from family and friends is deeply unpleasant . Not to be deterred , Seneca asks us to reflect on the unique advantages of physical distance in another letter to his friend :\nThere \u2019 s nothing to stop you from enjoying the company of absent friends , as often as you like , too , and for as long as you like . This pleasure in their company\u2014and there \u2019 s no greater pleasure\u2014is one we enjoy the more when we \u2019 re absent from one another\u2026 Possession of a friend should be with the spirit : the spirit \u2019 s never absent . It sees daily whoever it likes . So share with me my studies , my meals , my walks . Life would be restricted indeed if there were any barrier to our imaginations , I see you , my dear Lucilius . I hear you at this very moment . I feel so very much with you at this moment that I wonder whether I shouldn \u2019 t start writing you notes rather than letters !\nThroughout both his life and his writing , Seneca showed that everyone has the strength to act heroically\u2014even if it means doing something as simple as staying glued to your couch . And if indeed \u201c everything hangs on one \u2019 s thinking , \u201d as he and his philosophical heirs frequently remind us , then this pandemic is just as much an opportunity as it is a curse .
