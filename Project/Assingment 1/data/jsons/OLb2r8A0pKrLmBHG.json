    "content": "President Trump Says He 'Fully Supports Transparency ' On Whistleblower Complaint\nPresident Trump said Wednesday that the push for his impeachment is a `` hoax , '' again denying any wrongdoing during a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during which he pushed for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden , a potential 2020 rival .\n`` No push , no pressure , no nothing \u2014 it 's all a hoax , folks . It 's all a big hoax , '' Trump said .\nTrump 's remarks capped a whirlwind day of revelations , allegations and counterclaims that have rocked Washington and are likely to play a pivotal role in the runup to the 2020 presidential election . An account of his scrutinized July call with the Ukrainian president was released Wednesday morning , and Trump 's Republican allies contend that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has made a fatal error by pursuing an impeachment inquiry into the president over the allegations . The Democrats , meanwhile , say they believe the account of the call provides sufficient evidence of Trump 's alleged wrongdoing .\nAt a news conference in New York , Trump also said that he has spoken with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Republicans and that he `` fully supports transparency '' on the whistleblower information .\nHe took few questions about the Ukraine call , instead opining mostly about the economy , trade , meetings with world leaders and other matters .\nOn Wednesday afternoon , congressional leaders and members of the House and Senate intelligence committees were allowed to view the still-classified whistleblower account .\nHouse intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , said he found the allegations set forth `` deeply disturbing , '' `` very credible , '' `` well-written '' and a road map for follow-up from `` other witnesses . ''\nRep. Eric Swalwell , D-Calif. , said the report was `` serious , urgent and credible and we should hear from the whistleblower '' via testimony .\nHe also told NPR 's All Things Considered that he did not see the full report and that the committee will ask acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire for more materials in a meeting Thursday .\n`` It 's really unfortunate that for the first time in the history of the whistleblower law for the intelligence community that we are being blocked from hearing from the whistleblower or having the full report , '' Swalwell said .\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi , D-Ill. , said he plans to push Maguire for answers on what the motivations were behind not turning the whistleblower report over to Congress .\n`` It 's very well done . It 's thorough , '' Krishnamoorthi said . `` It raises a lot of questions about what else is out there . ''\nRepublicans were largely silent on Wednesday evening , but Sen. Ben Sasse , R-Neb. , told CNN 's Jeff Zeleny that there were `` real troubling things '' in the complaint .\n`` Republicans ought not just circle the wagons and Democrats ought not be using words like 'impeach ' before they knew anything about the actual substance , '' Sasse \u2014 who once frequently criticized Trump but has since garnered his endorsement \u2014 said .\nTrump has been defending the call , saying the record proves he did not pressure the Ukrainian leader . But that is n't quelling the movement toward impeachment in Congress \u2014 in fact , top House Democrats say it confirms the need for an inquiry .\nThe president said he decided to release the call recap , saying , `` I was just getting such fake news , I just thought it would be better . ''\nTrump also said he would be willing to release a prior call with Zelenskiy , along with conversations that Vice President Pence had with the foreign leader .\nEarlier on Wednesday , Trump appeared alongside Zelenskiy from New York , where both denied that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden 's son Hunter .\nTrump emphasized that there was `` no pressure '' and repeated stories that he and his private lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , have told that insinuate the younger Biden took part in corrupt activities in China and Ukraine . As explained here , Trump and Giuliani have not provided any evidence of wrongdoing .\nWhen asked whether he had been pushed to investigate Hunter Biden , Zelenskiy said , `` I 'm sorry , but I do n't want to be involved in democratic , open elections in USA . '' He described the phone call as `` good '' and `` normal . '' `` We spoke about many things , '' Zelenskiy said , adding later , `` Nobody pushed me . ''\nBut the rough transcript contradicts those denials . Trump notes at the outset that `` we do a lot for Ukraine . '' He asks Zelenskiy about a `` favor , '' later going on to tell him `` I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation in Ukraine '' and the Bidens .\nEarlier Wednesday , Pelosi said in a statement that `` the transcript and the Justice Department 's acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President 's lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry . ''\nPelosi added , `` I respect the responsibility of the President to engage with foreign leaders as part of his job .

''\n`` The notes of the call reflect a conversation far more damning than I or many others had imagined , '' he said Wednesday on Capitol Hill .\nTrump pushed back during his news conference , calling it a `` perfect '' and `` beautiful '' call .
