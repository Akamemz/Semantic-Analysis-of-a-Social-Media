The computerized records of her trades , which the White House obtained from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , show for the first time how she was able to turn her initial investment into $ 6,300 overnight . In about 10 months of trading , she made nearly $ 100,000 , relying heavily on advice from her friend James B. Blair , an experienced futures trader .
