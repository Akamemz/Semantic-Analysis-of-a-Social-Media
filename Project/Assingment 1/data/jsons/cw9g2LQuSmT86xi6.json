    "content": "President Obama , with an eye on cementing his legacy and countering the narrative on the Republican campaign trail , used his final State of the Union address Tuesday night to defend his economic record \u2013 and , in stark language , downplay the threat from the Islamic State .\n\u201c Over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands , \u201d the president said , arguing that ISIS fighters \u201c do not threaten our national existence . \u201d\nThe remarks on ISIS are sure to rile Republican critics who say the president \u2019 s strategy for confronting the group is inadequate \u2013 particularly just hours after ISIS was blamed for another deadly attack , this time in Istanbul .\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz , one of the leading candidates for the GOP presidential nomination , tweeted afterward that the address was \u201c less a State of the Union and more a state of denial . \u201d\nThe backdrop of the address undeniably was election-year politics , though Obama is not on the ballot . Throughout the speech , the president took several implicit jabs at the GOP candidates competing for his job , and in doing so sought to shore up his own legacy .\nHis message to them seemed to be : The sky is not falling .\nOn the economy and on national security , Obama called the criticism \u201c political hot air. \u201d More broadly , the president sounded a call for \u201c better politics \u201d and bipartisanship , and cast the rancor directed at his administration \u2019 s policies as the product of an overheated political system .\n\u201c Let me tell you something , the United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth . Period , \u201d Obama said , to those who say America is getting weaker .\nAnd to those who say the economy is just limping along , Obama countered : \u201c Anyone claiming that America \u2019 s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. \u201d He said America \u2019 s is the \u201c most durable economy in the world \u201d and one that has improved on his watch .\nThe defiant remarks were met with skepticism from Republicans in the audience . House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2019 s office said the \u201c lofty platitudes \u201d still did not explain how to defeat ISIS and get the economy back on track .\nIn the official GOP response , South Carolina Gov . Nikki Haley challenged the president \u2019 s message on terror , saying the country is facing threats like few others in recent memory and the president is unwilling or unable to deal with it . At the same time , she urged Americans to avoid following the \u201c angriest voices . \u201d\nOn that , Haley and Obama had a common message . In his address , Obama returned repeatedly to a warning that the country faces a choice in a time of \u201c extraordinary change \u201d \u2013 between facing the future with \u201c confidence \u201d or with \u201c fear . \u201d\nHe decried politicians who \u201c insult Muslims \u201d or target people \u201c because of race or religion , \u201d an implicit reference to some of the comments made on the Republican campaign trail including from Donald Trump . And he made a reference to remarks from Cruz , saying the answer to threats \u201c needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians . \u201d\nCruz responded on Twitter , \u201c We need a president who will defeat radical Islamic terrorism . \u201d\nBut Obama delivered pointed remarks on the nature of the terror threat . He said the priority remains protecting the American people from terrorism , but went on to play down the ISIS problem .\n\u201c Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks , twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages , they pose an enormous danger to civilians . They have to be stopped . But they do not threaten our national existence , \u201d Obama said . \u201c That is the story ISIL wants to tell ; that \u2019 s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit . \u201d\nHe also dug in on what effectively is an administration policy of not referring to the terror threat as radical Islam . He urged against \u201c echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world \u2019 s largest religions , \u201d and said : \u201c We just need to call them what they are \u2013 killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out , hunted down , and destroyed . \u201d\nIn a statement after the speech , House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce , R-Calif. , accused him of \u201c pushing these growing threats to the next administration . \u201d\nThe president from the start was by turns combative and casual , delivering an unconventional address that avoided a detailed to-do list . From the outset , he said he \u2019 d \u201c go easy \u201d on the laundry list of proposals \u2013 and focus more broadly \u201c on our future . \u201d\n\u201c For this final one , I \u2019 m going to try to make it a little shorter .
