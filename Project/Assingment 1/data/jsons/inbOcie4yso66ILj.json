    "content": "The Democrats running for president in 2020 , while sharing a general goal of \u201c expanding health coverage , \u201d have two fundamental disagreements about health care .\nOne is on the policy : Would the best insurance system be one fully funded by the federal government ? The Democrats who support Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2019 s Medicare-for-all bill are saying it is , while other candidates prefer to build more gradually on the public-private system we have now or openly running against the idea of single-payer .\nThe other debate is over strategy : Even if Democrats are lucky enough to win full control of the government in 2020 , which is by no means guaranteed , should they try to enact another major health care overhaul ? Or should they use their time , energy , attention , and political capital for other pursuits ?\nThe delineations on policy are obvious as candidates come forward with their plans . The divisions on strategy are a little more speculative : Sanders \u2019 s supporters on the left have recently been suggesting Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s more circumspect approach on the timeline for Medicare-for-all , which she supports , means she isn \u2019 t as progressive as their favored candidate .\nAs the first debate approaches , the candidates are being delicate on health care , trying to signal their support for aspirational and broad goals like universal coverage . Most of them would rather not get bogged down in the devilish details \u2014 but as long as Sanders , an unreserved supporter for single-payer , is a major figure in the race , that will be difficult to do .\nThe actual policy disagreements Democrats have about health care reform\nThis month , House Democrats held a health care hearing about \u201c paths to universal health coverage. \u201d This is the story Democratic leadership wants to tell : The party agrees America should cover more people with public programs or subsidized private health insurance ( or both ) . They are just looking for the best path forward .\n\u201c We all agree we need a stronger health care plan that covers everyone , universal coverage . We want everyone to have it , \u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this year . \u201c We \u2019 ll figure out the best way to get there . ... Different people have different views , we don \u2019 t attack each other . I think it \u2019 s great . \u201d\nBut there are meaningful differences between the current left-of-center proposals . This Venn diagram covers the bills in Congress , written into real legislative text , and ideas from two prominent DC think tanks . On critical questions about whether the 150 million people who have employer-sponsored insurance should have access to a government plan , who else would be covered , and how much they would be asked to pay out of pocket for health care , the plans have notable differences . They do also have shared features .\nSanders wrote the single-payer bill in the Senate , which would move every American into one national insurance plan and would cover most medical services at zero cost when people go to the doctor or hospital . Warren and Sens . Kamala Harris ( D-CA ) , Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) , and Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-NY ) signed onto his Medicare for All Act . The Sanders plan is the most maximalist overhaul in the field , a nationalizing of the health insurance industry .\nThe Medicare for America bill , based largely on the work of the Center for American Progress ( CAP ) and Yale professor Jacob Hacker , would maintain the employer-based system that covers half of Americans right now . It would also , however , allow almost any American move to a government plan if they wanted to . Beto O \u2019 Rourke and Pete Buttigieg have shown support for that idea . They like to say they support Medicare \u201c for all who want it , \u201d a halfway point between single-payer and more limited public options .\nJoe Biden has said he supports allowing \u201c every single American \u201d having access to a public insurance plan , but his campaign has not yet released the details on his proposal . In his record already : He called the Affordable Care Act \u201c a big fucking deal \u201d right after President Barack Obama signed it .\nThe more limited public options and buy-ins , like legislation sponsored by Sens . Amy Klobuchar ( D-MN ) and Michael Bennet ( D-CO ) , would generally allow the 10 million people who buy private insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces to join a public plan instead if they pay a premium . People on company-funded plans would not be able to buy the public plan , limiting the size and impact of the program .\nThe health care debate is also a question of priorities and politics\nBut even Medicare-for-all-supporting candidates have sought out some wiggle room on the more difficult challenges presented by the single-payer plan . The Sanders bill would largely ban private health insurance . Yet Harris and Booker \u2014 both sponsors of it \u2014 have indicated at times on the campaign trail that they do see a role for private coverage .\nThe second question on this great New York Times survey of most of the 2020 candidates revealed some telling differences : Would your focus be improving the Affordable Care Act or replacing it with single-payer ? Sanders took an absolutist tone .\n\u201c Clearly we need to replace it with a popular system , and that is Medicare , and expand Medicare to all , \u201d Sanders said .\nBut another Medicare-for-all sponsor , Booker , pledged to pursue a public option first as president .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to fight to try to expand access through things like creating a more vibrant , robust public option , \u201d Booker said .\nWarren gave a more guarded answer , not dissimilar from Harris \u2019 s general line on health care : Medicare-for-all should be the goal , but it \u2019 s something the country may have to build toward .\n\u201c There are a lot of different ways to get there , \u201d Warren told the New York Times . \u201c \u2018 Medicare for all \u2019 has a lot of different paths . \u201d\nWarren has an Obamacare improvement bill that , while not campaign stump speech material , would expand the federal subsidies available through Obamacare and extend them to more people . That plan would be one possible next step for her administration .\nThe activist and ideological left , for whom Sanders is such an important figure , have seized on Warren \u2019 s equivocation , contrasting it with her cultivated image as the bold \u201c plan \u201d candidate on other issues . From Tim Higginbotham \u2019 s essay in the socialist journal Jacobin , bearing the title \u201c Elizabeth Warren Has a Plan for Everything \u2014 Except Health Care \u201d :\nTaking this answer at face value , it seems Warren sees herself pursuing an incremental approach that expands public coverage while preserving the private insurance industry should she be elected president . This would likely surprise many of her supporters , who might view her cosponsorship of Sanders \u2019 s Medicare for All bill as an endorsement of single-payer health care . It \u2019 s fair to ask why Warren , who supports bold , progressive policies on a number of major issues , is avoiding the most important issue to voters . It could be a reluctance to attach herself to a rival candidate \u2019 s signature policy , or it could be a way to avoid conflict with the powerful health care corporations in her home state of Massachusetts .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Tara Golshan explained , Sanders and Warren are sometimes seen as so similar on policy that some people apparently have trouble telling them apart . Sanders \u2019 s side clearly sees health care as an opening to contrast them because their candidate says he is invested in passing Medicare-for-all as soon as possible .\nCandidates have other plans they want to prioritize . Warren told \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Ezra Klein the best place for her agenda to start is with an anti-corruption reform package . She \u2019 s been one of 2020 \u2019 s trendsetting candidates on taxing the rich and expanding workers rights .\nHarris , the next highest-polling Medicare-for-all sponsor , says she aspires to Medicare-for-all but has left room for leaving some kind of private insurance or incremental reforms . Her campaign also told me earlier this year that Harris \u2019 s tax plan would be at the top of her to-do list .\nHow much will these differences matter in 2020 and beyond ?\nAmong Democrats , a tug-of-war exists between governing and ideology . Some Democrats think single-payer is the only acceptable answer if health care is a human right . Others are chastened by the recent and fierce fights over more limited reforms and want to instead focus on what is politically possible . The left \u2019 s theory is that incrementalists are too timid about what is achievable with the right message and the right plan .\n\u201c Medicare for all \u201d polls well and health care is a unique issue : Americans broadly accept a role for the government in making sure people have health insurance . There are a lot of Medicare-for-all supporters in the Democratic Party now and among the people who vote in primaries . A recent survey of likely Iowa caucus-goers found about half said a candidate \u2019 s support for single-payer would be a \u201c must-have \u201d for them in 2020 . That \u2019 s quite a few voters in such a crowded field .\nOther polling indicates a lot of voters are still fuzzy on the details of Medicare-for-all , like whether it would get rid of private coverage . Support for the proposal still seems fluid , with push polls finding attacks on single-payer do significantly drive down support . The \u201c must-have \u201d number from the Iowa survey \u2014 48 percent \u2014 reveals a lot of Democratic voters who aren \u2019 t making single-payer a deciding factor . Joe Biden , doing well with and focusing on the party \u2019 s older and moderate voters , is building his candidacy with voters like that .\nPolling from public-opinion researcher Michael Perry , not done for any outside group , found Democratic voters saying that they would focus on improving Obamacare over passing single-payer in the near term . The Sanders wing is now questioning Warren \u2019 s commitment to Medicare-for-all , but so far , the 2020 polls show Warren and Sanders splitting voters who identify as progressive or liberal .\nStill , health care reform has been politically challenging and historically an electoral loser , as Democrats and Republicans saw in 2010 and 2018 , respectively . And whether Medicare-for-all can actually pass \u2014 or whether a more incremental option is the only thing that could clear a narrowly Democratic Senate with a solid cohort of centrist members \u2014 is a very different question . Sens . Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona , for starters , don \u2019 t sound onboard with single-payer right now . They just got elected for a barely-started six-year term .\nA Sanders administration would also need a Democratic Senate to change the Senate \u2019 s procedural rules , which currently set a 60-vote threshold for most bills , to pass the best version of Medicare-for-all \u2014 and on that subject , eliminating the Senate filibuster , Sanders is actually more wary than Warren .\nBut there \u2019 s also a large chance this could all be moot . Democrats will need to be a little lucky to win the Senate at all . If they don \u2019 t , Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell relishes the chance to block progressive \u2014 he \u2019 d call it \u201c socialist \u201d \u2014 legislation , as we \u2019 ve seen with a Democratic House . President Donald Trump has already called out \u201c socialist \u201d single-payer in his 2020 reelection launch speech .\nIt might seem strange for Democrats like Sanders and Warren who sponsor the same plan to be \u201c debating \u201d an issue . In this crowded field with a lot of policy overlap , campaigns are looking for every opening to stick out to voters .\nBut the party broadly does still has real differences not only on the best political path , but the right policy . Center-left Democrats really want to preserve a big role for private insurance . The candidates are asking elemental questions among themselves about the free market and the role it should have in providing health care to Americans .",
