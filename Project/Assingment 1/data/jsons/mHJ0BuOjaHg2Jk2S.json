And House Democrats really , really want it to be made public .\nIn a rare bipartisan vote , the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a nonbinding resolution Thursday to do just that . Republicans joined Democrats in a 420-0 vote to approve the resolution , with just four lawmakers declining to take a stance by voting \u2018 present . \u2019\nIt \u2019 s unclear whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will pick it up . He blocked a similar bipartisan bill from Sens . Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) and Richard Blumenthal ( D-CT ) from the Senate floor earlier this year .\nThe House , on the other hand , is intent on passing a resolution to make the report public because they \u2019 re not sure how much recourse they \u2019 ll otherwise have if the Justice Department decides to keep Mueller \u2019 s report under wraps .\nThe man who has the final say on how much of the report is released is new Attorney General William Barr , who hasn \u2019 t committed to making the report public , exactly , but insists he will follow the obligations put on him under law . When Mueller \u2019 s investigation concludes , Barr will have to give senior members of the House and Senate Judiciary committees some limited information , including why Mueller \u2019 s inquiry is wrapping up now .
