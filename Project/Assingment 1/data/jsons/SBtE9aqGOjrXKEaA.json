Secretary DeVos , a Christian grandmother and philanthropist who has spent her career trying to improve the quality of education for poor children , has been criticized and mocked relentlessly .

She is a serious threat to the status quo that has served them \u2013 if not students \u2013 so well .\nPerhaps the most significant reason , however , is the one Secretary DeVos gave in response to Stahl \u2019 s question : more than anything else , she is misunderstood .\nTo clear up any misunderstanding caused by the left \u2019 s holy war against her , here are four things Americans should understand about Secretary DeVos \u2019 educational vision :\nFirst , as she noted in the \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d interview , Secretary DeVos wants to liberate American education from encroachment by federal bureaucracy . Under the Obama administration , the federal government functioned as a giant octopus , bypassing families , communities , and states in order to reach its tentacles into school curriculum , teacher evaluation , values conformity , and even restroom policies . Betsy DeVos signals a departure from that era . Her stated educational philosophy suggests that she will not turn Democratic encroachment into Republican encroachment ; instead , she will reduce federal encroachment in order to empower families , local communities , and states .\nSecond , Secretary DeVos emphasizes freedom of thought . During her confirmation hearings , the media made much ado about her \u201c Dutch Calvinist \u201d religious views . But Dutch Calvinism is a rich religious tradition that emphasizes the rights and freedoms of families , communities , and religions . For that reason , it finds adherents on the right and on the left . Additionally , it places an especially high value on education , but emphasizes that a plural society should be tolerant enough to allow diverse families and communities to build their own educational institutions and choose which institution ( s ) their children can attend . Unfortunately , many liberal educators are quite illiberal , unwilling to tolerate any type of educational diversity that undermines the federal government \u2019 s impulse toward command-and-control .\nThird , she wants to empower financially-disadvantaged families to send their children to whichever school they deem best . Under the current system , the government taxes citizens in order to provide education , but then dictates and determines how the tax money can be used . The message is clear : the federal government\u2014rather than the family or local community\u2014is responsible for shaping the way a child understands and interprets the world .\nUnder Secretary DeVos \u2019 system of vouchers and charters , however , citizens will be able to exercise more influence over their own child \u2019 s education . They will also be able to send their children to a wider variety of schools , including those that would have been financially prohibitive without the vouchers . This sort of system is supported by prominent intellectuals and educators such as Anthony Bradley and has been supported in the past by Democratic politicians such as Cory Booker .\nFourth , Secretary Devos does not come to her job as a career politician or an educational ideologue . She comes as a lifelong education advocate and philanthropist who has given tens of millions of dollars to public and private educational institutions .\nAs her \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d interview made clear , Secretary DeVos is an imperfect Secretary of Education , as all secretaries of education have been . She is neither a career politician nor a pundit .\nWhat she is is a skilled educational advocate and a lifelong educational philanthropist whose vision for education could reduce bureaucracy , increase free thinking , and empower the financially disadvantaged , thus helping children to get the education they deserve .\nOn second thought , I guess it \u2019 s not so hard to understand why the left \u2019 s hard-core education bureaucracy is so opposed to her .
