We chose places where the president delivered speeches about his vision for America . What we collected is not the `` inside story '' of Obama 's administration . It is the outside story . By design , we questioned night shift workers , food servers , business owners and sometimes people we encountered at random . What emerged is an unfiltered look at a nation after years of political and economic struggle .\nWatch NPR 's interview with President Obama YouTube Listen to NPR 's Special Coverage : Steve Inskeep Interviews President Obama Listen \u00b7 49:55 49:55\nMany people had a wrenching personal story to share . And many spoke of Obama 's presidency as personal . They did not speak of `` the government , '' but of the president himself . He hurt my business ( or saved it ) . He stuck up for me ( or is coming for my guns ) .\n`` He 's too much in my life , '' one voter said . Another , who met Obama after losing a son in a mass shooting , said : `` He understood . ''\nHere 's a look at President Obama 's words \u2014 his promises and dreams \u2014 and assessment of where we are eight years later .\n`` What 's at stake is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family , build a modest savings , own a home , secure their retirement . '' \u2014 President Obama in a speech on the economy in Osawatomie , Kan. , Dec. 6 , 2011\nObama took office amid the worst economic crisis in generations . Banks were depending on a federal bailout to survive . The official unemployment rate had reached 7.8 percent and would soon exceed 10 percent . The numbers were even worse when the underemployed were included . Many people dropped out of the labor market entirely .\nToday the employment picture is drastically improved . Yet wages , when adjusted for inflation , remained steady for years and only recently have begun to climb . This continues a decades-old trend .\nPatrick Casica of Denver is living that trend . He has a new job in quality control for bottling firms , a tech job with benefits . But he says he 's paid less than he made eight years ago as a bartender . `` This is an investment , '' he tells us . `` I knew I was going to take a hit and work up the ladder to better myself . ''\nWe met Casica at Denver 's Union Station , where he 's catching the train to work . The station and surrounding infrastructure were restored , partly with a grant from Obama 's economic stimulus law in 2009 , an $ 833 billion spending and tax cut package geared to jump-start the economy amid the Great Recession . But Casica is not yet feeling the benefits of a stronger economy .\nIn Aurora , Colo. , John Hoody works as a server at a Red Robin restaurant . He says he 's doing better than eight years ago , having moved up from a job at McDonald 's . He 's even bought his own home \u2014 and in Denver 's rising real estate market , it 's likely worth more than he paid .\nBut to make ends meet , the 29-year-old says he 's working at two different restaurants . And he does not have health care coverage . `` With Obamacare , from my understanding of it , I ca n't get insurance unless it 's astronomically priced , '' he says . He pays a tax penalty instead .\nHoody is not alone \u2014 millions are still without insurance \u2014 though the rate of those uninsured has dropped sharply for every income group .\n`` I 'll invest $ 150 billion over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy \u2014 wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels \u2014 an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and ca n't be outsourced . '' \u2014 Obama 's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 28 , 2008\nThe president argued that the nation could improve the economy while also helping to save the planet . Republicans scorned his interest in subsidizing solar panels and windmills . They said their view was vindicated when Solyndra , a California solar company , went bankrupt in 2011 after receiving federal money .\nBut in 2016 , much has changed . The use of every kind of renewable energy , including solar , has increased . The most dramatic increase is in wind , which has increased fivefold since 2007 .\nThe windy state of Kansas now gets about 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources , even though the Republican-led state Legislature recently removed a requirement that utilities make use of such energy .\nOne wind company owner , Matt Gilhousen , believes that Obama saved his business . Standing amid 111 wind turbines that he developed on a hilltop in Elk County , he says the Great Recession nearly killed his company , Tradewind Energy . The 2009 stimulus law provided cash grants that helped the company endure three years with no new business .\nGilhousen has gone from laying off 30 employees to hiring 70 . `` We 're lucky to be here , '' Gilhousen says .\nBut it was a very different story for Matthew Anderson , who runs a small company in Denver that develops properties to drill for oil . His company , Acoma Energy , boomed with expanding domestic production .\nBut the price of oil has crashed , and Anderson has laid off some employees . Anderson knows Obama leans toward renewable energy . What has the president done for him ? `` Not one single thing . ''\n`` You know , passions may fly on immigration , but I do n't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers . '' \u2014 Obama 's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 28 , 2008\nObama tried several ways to gain legal status for many of the estimated 11 million people residing in the country illegally , but with limited results .\nUrged by some advisers to seek comprehensive immigration reform when he had a Democratic Congress in 2009 , Obama sought his health care law instead . Later , he used executive action to give legal status to `` dreamers , '' the children of immigrants who had entered illegally , a program he later expanded .\nBut the courts blocked Obama 's wider executive action . It would have allowed parents of American citizens and immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to be eligible to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation . Federal courts also stopped Obama 's expansion of the `` dreamers '' executive action . The two blocked programs would have covered an estimated 3.9 million people .\nThe court defeats dismay Jose Luis Valdez , a native of Mexico and recently naturalized U.S. citizen who is a restaurant owner in Kansas City , Kan. Obama 's administration deported many people \u2014 2 million in his first six years , at a rate higher than any of his predecessors . Because Obama did not find some way for more people to remain , Valdez feels the president never delivered on a basic promise . `` He used us , '' Valdez says . `` He used our votes . ''\nWe heard a profoundly different view from Paul Czarzasty of Marion County , Fla. `` These illegal immigrants coming over , and receiving benefits , when our own veterans are having to wait to receive theirs , '' he says . `` That bothers me a lot . ''\nIn the same conversation , Christiane Lemke said she was a naturalized citizen from the former East Germany . She had come to the U.S. legally and felt others must do the same .\n`` I know there are differences on same-sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in a hospital and to live lives free of discrimination . '' \u2014 Obama 's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 28 , 2008\nAt the time he won his party 's nomination in 2008 , Obama only endorsed civil unions ; he did not overtly support the right for gays and lesbians to marry . The president 's position did not change until 2012 , as public opinion shifted strongly in favor of marriage . Later , in 2015 , the U.S Supreme Court ruled that the right to same-sex marriage would be accepted across the country .\nFran and Anna Simon spent years as marriage activists ; now , they say , they are able to live a `` normal '' family life , spending time volunteering at their son 's school .\nAt their home in Colorado , the family debated the president 's role in that change . `` The president barely did anything , '' their 8-year-old son , Jeremy , told us .\nBut his mom , Anna , says Obama changed the tone . `` It was so exciting to have a president finally , who could even say the words gay and lesbian in a respectful way . ''\n`` The anger [ in the black community ] is real ; it is powerful ; and to simply wish it away , to condemn it without understanding its roots , only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races . In fact , a similar anger exists within segments of the white community . '' \u2014 Sen. Barack Obama in Philadelphia , March 18 , 2008\nEvery presidency for generations has featured a debate about race \u2014 but none quite like Obama 's years . This era has seen a nation becoming more diverse ; a number of incidents of police killings of black citizens , which sparked the Black Lives Matter movement ; a rise in white identity politics ; and the first black president presiding over it all .\nAs Obama approaches his final months , a Pew Research Center survey finds a narrow majority of African-Americans today believes Obama `` made progress '' toward improving race relations . But a majority of white respondents found Obama `` tried but failed to make progress '' or even `` made race relations worse . ''\nIn Florida , Paul Czarzasty has come to see President Obama as a divisive force . The Marion County deputy sheriff cited the president 's public statements about some high-profile incidents in which African-Americans have been killed by white officers .\n`` We have concerns with the way that the president 's been dividing the country , '' says Czarzasty , who 's white . `` In any profession you 're going to have good and bad . ... It 's made our job harder for the president with his lack of support . ''\nKwame Rose had virtually the opposite assessment . He did n't find Obama to be supportive of protesters . Rose was a prominent African-American protester in Baltimore in 2015 , amid the unrest after the death of Freddie Gray , a black man who died after being placed in a police van . President Obama said most protesters were peaceful , but also criticized `` criminals and thugs '' who looted a number of stores .\n`` You do n't know the story behind each one of those individuals , '' Rose says , insisting that demonstrators were simply trying to survive . `` I do n't think President Obama at that moment looked inside the mirror and saw that there were people who looked like him who were n't as fortunate as he was . And he chastised them . ''\nPhiladelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross had more sympathy for Obama 's position . It was Philadelphia where Obama delivered his famous 2008 speech on race . Like Obama , Ross faces the challenge of being an African-American leader in a diverse community .\n`` This is going to get me in trouble , '' Ross says , `` but you asked it and I 'm going to answer it . I think there are some people who believe that because they have an African-American president , he was supposed to be an African-American president only . He 's the president of the United States . ''\nRoss offers his own assessment of Obama 's presidency , which , he says , has brought out `` the best and worst in people . '' Millions of Americans of all races proved they could vote for a black man for president , whatever his policies might be . At the same time , Ross asserted that the first black president faced unprecedented attacks .\n`` I have not told you whether I 'm a Republican or Democrat and I wo n't , '' he says . But I do believe this nation will miss this president . I really do . Like it or not , he brought us through a recession . Like it or not , he bailed out an auto industry . Like it or not , he found and dealt with one of the biggest terrorists that we 've ever seen ... in our history . And the list could go on and on . And yet they call him a weak president , and I 'll never understand that . ''",
