To hear them tell it , they are a government poised to reclaim power from the Shiite Houthi militia and allied fighters that call the shots in much of their country .\nBut their blueprint for victory may contain the seeds of defeat for a unitary Yemeni state . As in Libya , the arming of local militia to oust a common enemy could make it even harder to restore central authority in the aftermath of a civil war .\nOver the last two weeks , the UN-backed Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has been working feverously to patch together a broad coalition of Yemeni tribes backed by Arab military intervention against the Iranian-allied Houthis .\nThe result is a tribal coalition of some 70,000 fighters \u2013 and the pledge of a Saudi-Egyptian expeditionary force . Yemeni officials say they are preparing to retake the southern port city of Aden \u201c within days , \u201d and thence fight for control over the rest of Yemen .\n\u201c From day one , we have been building a coalition across all segments of Yemeni society to return the rule of law , \u201d says Yasseen Makawi , a close aide to Hadi who has led several talks here with Yemeni tribal leaders . Hadi is currently in Riyadh , living under tight security .\n\u201c We will be in Aden soon to start the long fight , \u201d Mr. Makawi says .\nSo far , the Saudi-led bombing campaign hasn \u2019 t stopped the advance of the Houthis , which are backed by military units loyal to former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh . On Thursday , these forces captured Ataq , the provincial capital of oil-rich Shabwa province , after days of clashes followed by negotiations with local Sunni tribes , according to news reports .\nFor Hadi \u2019 s exiled government , the stakes are high . In order to win over the support of dozens of tribes in south and central Yemen , officials have agreed in future to devolve more government powers to the provinces and tribal regions , threatening the unity of a state that was only reunified in 1990 .\nYemeni tribal leaders see the situation as an opportunity to press for greater autonomy \u2013 and perhaps independence .\n\u201c We are all for a democratic Yemen with greater powers in the hands of the people , \u201d says Abdullah Kathiri , head of the largest tribe in Hadrawmout , a wealthy province in eastern Yemen who speaks openly about independence . \u201c With this understanding , tribes across the country are now willing to rise up . \u201d\nSuch ambitions speak to the centrifugal forces being unleashed in Yemen . Exiled officials concur that by arming and militarizing Sunni tribes across the country , they may create a \u201c second Libya \u201d where tribal militias roam unchallenged and refuse to answer to a weak central government .\n\u201c We do not want to place heavy arms into the hands of tribes and have them act outside the army , \u201d says Transport Minister Badr Mubarak Ba-Salma , who has led talks with tribal representatives .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t want to finally rid ourselves of Ali Abdullah Saleh to find ourselves with dozens of more Ali Abdullah Salehs , \u201d Mr. Ba-Salma adds , referring to the longtime ruler who stepped down in 2012 .
