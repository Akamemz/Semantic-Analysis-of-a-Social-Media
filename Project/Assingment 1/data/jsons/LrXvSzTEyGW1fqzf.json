    "content": "Arkansas , which like much of the South dodged the worst of the pandemic in the spring and did not have a stay-at-home order , has seen cases nearly double over the past three weeks as more businesses reopened . No community has been harder hit than Latino and Marshallese workers in the northwest part of the state .\n\u201c We were not prepared to handle this pandemic at all , but we were especially unprepared to protect these minority groups , \u201d said Greg Leding , a Democratic state senator who represents the area .\nLatinos make up about 8 percent of the state \u2019 s population , but a fourth of coronavirus cases . Marshallese and other Pacific Islanders make up less than a half a percent of the population \u2014 and 7 percent of cases .\nMireya Reith , executive director of the immigrant advocacy group Arkansas United hopes the recent deployment of a CDC team to investigate disparities will mark a turning point . Inadequate testing and outreach to Arkansans of color early on , combined with a high proportion of essential workers unable to stay at home , fueled the spread .\n\u201c We weren \u2019 t counted . Data wasn \u2019 t collected . There was no information available in other languages , \u201d she said . The outbreak , she added , \u201c was preventable . \u201d\nThe Arkansas health department confirmed that just five of its roughly 200 contact tracers speak Spanish and only one speaks Marshallese \u2014 though they will soon hire hundreds more tracers , some bilingual . Additionally , phone alerts that went out as part of contact tracing were all in English until a Spanish option was added June 6 . There are still no alerts in Marshallese , isolating a population that migrated here in large part after U.S. nuclear tests left their homeland awash in radiation . The five-person CDC team dispatched to the state plans to share its findings soon on how to mitigate spread `` specifically within the Hispanic and Marshallese populations , \u201d the state \u2019 s health department told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nMelisa Laelan , executive director of the Arkansas Coalition of Marshallese , surveyed nearly 1,000 Marshallese households and found that more than 80 percent had a family member designated an essential worker . More than half had a family member with diabetes , obesity or high blood pressure , conditions that increase their risk of death from Covid-19 . Adding to their vulnerability , Marshallese were cut off from Medicaid during the 1990s .\n\u201c I had to leave Facebook because I couldn \u2019 t bear it anymore to see that we were losing so many important community members , '' Laelan said .\nIn Florida , where Trump is set to visit Friday for a briefing on drug trafficking , cases have surpassed 220,000 . Coronavirus deaths in heavily Latino counties in Florida are occurring at twice the rate of other counties . In Texas , which Vice President Mike Pence visited last week , deaths in disproportionately Latino counties are occurring at 1.2 times the rate of other counties , according to an amFar analysis .\nTwo public hospitals in Houston that serve majority-minority , largely uninsured populations feel the racial disparity acutely . Nearly two-thirds of the coronavirus patients in the intensive care unit at Ben Taub and Lyndon B. Johnson hospitals are Latinos , said Dr. Esmaeil Porsa , CEO of Harris County Health System . Most counties talk about an infection curve ; Porsa said Harris County \u2019 s is a \u201c straight line up . \u201d\nCases are hitting record levels in some Democratic-led states too , notably California . But the different political sensibility didn \u2019 t shield people of color .\nLos Angeles County is a big , racially mixed area . In the mostly white Santa Monica Mountains , cases per 100,000 rose sixfold from mid April to the end of June . But the rate of infection was even higher in majority Black and Latino cities , according to an analysis by Advancement Project California for \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn San Jose Hills , where Latinos account for roughly 85 percent of the population , the number of cases per 100,000 was 143 times greater than it was during the second week of April . In Willowbrook , one of the communities in L.A. County with the highest percentage of Black residents , the rate of infections per 100,000 was 22 times greater in the third week of June than in early April .\nAs cases surged across the South and Southwest in June , the response from state leaders was slow and inconsistent , some local and public health officials said . Republican governors have largely mirrored Trump \u2019 s response , declining to mandate masks or imposing and extending stay-at-home orders .\nSome governors , despite earlier resistance , have paused or reversed reopening certain businesses in recent weeks , including those in Alabama , Arkansas , Arizona and Florida .\nIn Texas , Gov . Greg Abbott , after opposing mask mandates and even banning cities from enforcing such rules , changed his mind as hospitals reached capacity . He issued a statewide mask mandate , and expressed regret for reopening bars .\n`` It 's really been inconsistent messaging that has made things complicated , if not dangerous , '' said Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia .\nIn that county , Latinos make up more than 60 percent of the cases \u2014 and 40 percent of the county 's population , said Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve said : \u2018 Wear your MAGA mask , \u2019 \u201d Hidalgo , a Democrat , added . `` This is not about politics . ''\nIn Alabama , \u201c our state leaders have taken their cues from national leaders , \u201d said Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed , who added that in June , 70 percent of new cases in Montgomery County were among Black people . He instituted a citywide mask mandate in mid-June , although Republican Gov . Kay Ivey hasn \u2019 t done so statewide .\nIn Arizona , Gov .

By mid June , cases among Latinos \u2014 who disproportionately work in essential services like agriculture , meatpacking and hospitality \u2014 started to skyrocket across the country .\n\u201c All Covid did was accelerate the inequities that we already know , \u201d said Martha Moore-Monroy , a public health lecturer at the University of Arizona , whose work focuses on improving health in underserved communities . \u201c People can \u2019 t ignore it anymore . \u201d\nDaniel Dawes , director of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute at Morehouse School of Medicine , is crafting a national plan to address the uneven impact of coronavirus on minorities \u2014 trying to change a pattern of inequality that has been a hallmark of other public health crises .\nThe three-year initiative , which has a $ 40 million grant from the federal Department of Health and Human Services and includes a network of national and local health organizations , will start in the South .

By Year Two , Dawes hopes to focus on vaccine education and access .\nIn the meantime , local officials are getting creative .
