    "content": "It 's hard not to feel some schadenfreude at the defeat of Eric Cantor in last night 's primary election . The Republican House majority leader outspent his Tea Party opponent Dave Brat by a 25-1 margin , and was widely expected to sail on to a fairly easy victory . Cantor was on track to become the next speaker of the House , despite consistently taking stances aggressively hostile to compromise with Democrats and often directly at odds with Speaker Boehner . So it is n't exactly surprising to see many denizens of the left cheer in celebration at Cantor 's unexpected downfall .\nBut that reaction , while understandable , is foolish and shortsighted . Brat 's victory was a momentous , unequivocal win for the far right . Tea Party types had been strongly pressing for Cantor 's removal for a long time , particularly because Cantor was seen as insufficiently hostile to immigration reform . Assuming that Democrats can not take control of the House in 2014 , Cantor 's defeat means that our broken immigration system will not see any significant fixes from the legislative branch until 2017 at the earliest .\nMore than that , however , this historic election should serve as a lesson for the left . It is the clearest demonstration yet of how and why American politics continues to drift inexorably to the right on all but a few social issues . The conservative base pulled off its biggest upset yet against a powerful establishment candidate , but underfunded radicals defeating establishment incumbents is a regular feature of the GOP primary process in a way that has few parallels on the Democratic side . Even in New York where anti-establishment progressives have a strong base in the Working Families Party , there was little appetite for directly challenging centrist Gov . Andrew Cuomo . In fact , the most noteworthy challenge to a Democratic congressional incumbent this year is occurring from the right in CA-17 , as business-friendly millionaire * Ro Khanna challenges longtime progressive Democratic incumbent Mike Honda .\nIt is not an accident that the Republican Party continues to move rightward even in the face of negative public polling on most issues , even as the Democratic Party seems unable and often unwilling to advance legislation that meets with approval among majorities of the public . It 's not just the corruption of money in politics . It 's the direct result of the difference between voter engagement on each side of the aisle .\nDemocrats reliably vote in presidential elections , but tend to skip voting in midterms and are practically electoral truants in mid-cycle primaries . Republicans , by contrast , are much more motivated to vote in both midterms and intra-party contests . This is not just a function of economic and lifestyle differences . It is also , crucially , a function of political cultures and instincts .\nBack in the 1960s there was a battle within the conservative ranks between the adherents of William F.

Buckley won that battle for the heart and soul of the conservative base , a victory that led inexorably to a slow but certain mobilization of radical conservatives to take over the GOP from the ground up .
