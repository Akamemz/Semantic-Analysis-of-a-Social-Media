Ann Rivers . `` Medical marijuana is an avenue to sidestep the laws and regulations and the revenue . ''\nBackers of legalization touted an expected $ 500 million tax windfall each year from selling recreational pot . But the state 's pot consultant , UCLA professor Mark Kleiman , warns competition from medical marijuana could cut in half the amount of tax revenue the state receives .\n`` The two are not going to be able to exist side by side for very long , '' said Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs Mitch Baker .\nWashington state passed its medical marijuana law in 1998 .
