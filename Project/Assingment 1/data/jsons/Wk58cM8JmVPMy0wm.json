NPR commentator Cokie Roberts ' column outlining her opposition to Mr. Trump drew ire from conservatives and prompted NPR to issue a clarification of her role at the company as a commentator , not a journalist . Mr. Hannity is also considered a commentator and therefore free to voice his opinion . His appearance in an advertisement for the Trump campaign , however , appears to have crossed a line for Fox executives , and could spell legal trouble for the network , some political scientists say .\nAppearing for a 30-second spot in an eight-minute-long ad titled \u201c # HEARTLAND4TRUMP , \u201d uploaded to the candidate 's YouTube channel on Sunday , Mr. Hannity detailed why he supports Mr. Trump .\nOne of the reasons I \u2019 m supporting Donald Trump this year is , number one , he \u2019 s going to put originalists on the Supreme Court , people that believe in fidelity to the Constitution , separation of powers , co-equal branches of government . He \u2019 s a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe . And , of course , he \u2019 s gon na build that wall . He says he \u2019 s gon na have Mexico pay for it . That \u2019 s fine , as long as we secure the country and , of course , we don \u2019 t want people competing for jobs . He said he will eliminate Obamacare , make us energy-independent .
