More than 70 universities have contacted them to use course materials .\n\u201c The problem is not new . BS has been around forever . But it \u2019 s the way that technology has exploded that has really scaled up the amount of information and the amount of BS and how much we \u2019 re required to filter , \u201d said Carrie Diaz Eaton , a professor of computational studies at Bates College in Lewiston , Maine , who tweaked the syllabus to work in statistics in the programming language R .\nThe class focuses on a pernicious form of misinformation that can be especially misleading : the kind that comes cloaked in data and figures .\n\u201c We grant this unwarranted authority to numbers . Numbers feel hard and crisp and sort of unquestionable , \u201d said Bergstrom , a computational biologist . \u201c We wanted to show our students that you don \u2019 t have to have a master \u2019 s degree in statistics or computer science to be able to call bullshit on this stuff . \u201d\nA right-wing media site , for example , blared in a headline that several thousand DACA beneficiaries ( undocumented children shielded from deportation by an Obama-era policy ) have committed crimes against U.S. citizens , Bergstrom said . \u201c But it \u2019 s an extremely low percentage of DACA recipients , \u201d he pointed out . \u201c Which means they \u2019 re being accused of crimes at substantially lower rates \u2014 massively lower rates \u2014 than American citizens . Of course the article doesn \u2019 t say that . \u201d\nThe course includes training in practical skills , with no advanced mathematical knowledge required . West and Bergstrom said they have taught defense against BS to librarians and to high-schoolers , who \u201c love calling bullshit on adults , \u201d Bergstrom observed .\nThe class teaches students that a thing can be true and also BS . Whole Foods sells a product advertised as \u201c non-GMO \u201d Himalayan pink salt , to pluck an example from the course \u2019 s @ Callin_bull Twitter account . Technically speaking , the claim is true : the pink salt was made without genetic modification . But it \u2019 s also BS , because salt , a mineral , doesn \u2019 t have any genes to modify .\nIn one lecture , West uses \u201c Spurious Correlations , \u201d a project made by a Harvard Law School student . The website pairs unrelated trends , based on actual data , that have no meaningful relationship . Except they happen to show a mathematical correlation \u2014 the decrease in Kentucky \u2019 s marriage rate happens to correspond with a nationwide drop in drownings on fishing trips , for instance . The point : Statistical correlations are useful tools , but students should ask whether the relationships make sense .\nThe professors have had a long history of mutual BS-calling while trying to test the limits of each other \u2019 s scientific conclusions . West was a graduate student in Bergstrom \u2019 s laboratory more than a decade ago , and they have written numerous research papers about patterns in how scientists publish their work , including the observation that male scientists cite themselves far more frequently than female scientists self-cite .\nReviewing thousands of journal articles and scientific grants , West said , has honed their ability to sniff out data-driven BS .\nMeanwhile , they increasingly saw misinformation in their lives outside work . The professors worried about their students \u2019 exposure to BS . \u201c When we had print media , the stuff that we consumed was predominantly filtered through professional editors , \u201d Bergstrom said . But social media has made all of us \u201c the gatekeepers of what \u2019 s worth seeing for our colleagues , our friends and our families . \u201d\nThey designed the course as an online syllabus without knowing whether they could teach it themselves , because the professors are in different departments with different academic requirements \u2014 and there was also some friction with the university committee that decides names and course descriptions .\nThe website includes tools to disarm BS . Here are a few : Bar charts , but not necessarily line graphs , should include zero on their axes ; there \u2019 s no guarantee a scientific paper is correct , but publication in a well-known and peer-reviewed journal is a sign the research was legitimate ; computers can generate realistic human faces although algorithms struggle with hair , backgrounds and symmetrical glasses . The latter forms the basis of their spinoff project , Which Face is Real , a website where users can test their ability to distinguish bona fide humans from an AI \u2019 s creation .\nWest and Bergstrom are not the first to teach people how to recognize and fight BS . Journalist Darrell Huff wrote \u201c How to Lie With Statistics \u201d in 1954 . Astronomer Carl Sagan published \u201c The Demon-Haunted World \u201d in 1995 , in which he offered to readers a \u201c baloney detection kit. \u201d Sagan encouraged readers to look for multiple sources of verification , for instance , and to test every link in an argument \u2019 s chain .\nPrinceton University philosopher Harry Frankfurt published an influential 1986 essay , \u201c On Bullshit , \u201d in which he theorized that BS is distinct from a lie . Truth and falsehood are beside the point of BS , Frankfurt concluded .
