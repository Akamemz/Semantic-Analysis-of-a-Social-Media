Prior to Tuesday 's clash , England coach Phil Neville had questioned the `` etiquette '' of the American team after officials visited his team 's hotel .\n`` I wanted to keep it interesting , '' she told reporters . `` I know Megan Rapinoe has the best celebration . I had to try and step up this game . I feel like this team has had so much thrown at them and us . I feel like we did n't take an easy route through this tournament and 'that 's the tea .
