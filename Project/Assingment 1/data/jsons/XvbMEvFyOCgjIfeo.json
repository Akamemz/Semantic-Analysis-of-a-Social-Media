Michael Bloomberg , whose rise in the polls is fueled by more than $ 300 million in ad spending .

And really , it \u2019 s the first time he has engaged with other Democratic candidates at all since entering the race . Polls released over the last few days have shown Bloomberg overtaking Joe Biden , nationally , as the moderate runner-up to Bernie Sanders , the front runner , thanks to hundreds of millions of dollars that Bloomberg has poured into advertising . But for most Americans , this was the first time that they have really been introduced to the man himself . So going in , we knew that all the other candidates were going to try to make that a rough introduction to scuff up the glossy image of himself that Bloomberg puts in TV ads . And right away , they did .\narchived recording ( amy klobuchar ) I think we need something different than Donald Trump . I don \u2019 t think you look at Donald Trump and say , we need someone richer in the White House . archived recording ( lester holt ) Thank you .

At 2015 , this is how you described your policing policy as mayor . Quote , \u201c We put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. \u201d And you explain that is , quote , \u201c because that \u2019 s where all the crime is . \u201d\nAnd early on , NBC moderator , Lester Holt , asked Bloomberg to address it .\narchived recording ( lester holt ) You went on to say , \u201c And the way you should get the guns out of the kids \u2019 hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them. \u201d You \u2019 ve apologized for that policy . But what does that kind of language say about how you view people of color or people in minority neighborhoods ? archived recording ( michael bloomberg ) Well , if I go back and look at my time in office , the one thing that I \u2019 m really worried about , embarrassed about was how it turned out with stop-and-frisk . And we started a \u2014 we adopted a policy , which had been in place , the policy that all big police departments use \u2014 of stop-and-frisk . What happened , however , was it got out of control .\narchived recording ( michael bloomberg ) And we have to keep the lid on crime . But we can not go out and stop people \u2014 archived recording ( lester holt ) All right , mayor . archived recording ( michael bloomberg ) \u2014 indiscriminately . archived recording ( lester holt ) Mayor , thank you . Let me go to \u2014\nThis was the number one question that Bloomberg would have known was coming . More than any other policy issue , this is the one his campaign has worried about from the start of the race . But \u2014\narchived recording ( michael bloomberg ) I \u2019 ve sat . I \u2019 ve apologized . I \u2019 ve asked for forgiveness . But the problem \u2014\nBloomberg is a man known for his political agility , or his comfort expressing contrition , or for his thick skin . And it showed .\narchived recording ( michael bloomberg ) And if we took off everybody that was wrong off this panel , everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers , there \u2019 d be nobody else up here .\nAnd the attacks were just sort of unrelenting . Up until this point , Elizabeth Warren has mostly avoided direct confrontation in debates with other candidates . She has been calling herself , \u201c the unity candidate. \u201d But she took a totally different approach , a far more aggressive approach . And Mike Bloomberg was her favorite target .\narchived recording ( elizabeth warren ) I \u2019 d like to talk about who we \u2019 re running against .\nShe landed some of the most stinging blows in the debate , drawing a connection between Bloomberg and public enemy number one for the Democrats .\narchived recording ( elizabeth warren ) A billionaire who calls women , \u201c fat broads \u201d and \u201c horse-faced lesbians. \u201d And no , I \u2019 m not talking about Donald Trump ; I \u2019 m talking about Mayor Bloomberg . Democrats are not going to win \u2014\nPerhaps , the most contentious exchange of the night , and the toughest one for Bloomberg , was a lengthy back and forth between him and both Warren and Joe Biden about a number of women who have signed nondisclosure agreements with Bloomberg and his company .\narchived recording ( elizabeth warren ) He has gotten some number of women \u2014 dozens ? who knows \u2014 to sign nondisclosure agreements both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace . So Mr. Mayor , are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements so we can hear their side of the story ? [ APPLAUSE ] archived recording ( michael bloomberg ) We have a very few nondisclosure agreements . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) How many is that ? archived recording ( michael bloomberg ) Let me finish . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) How many is that ? archived recording ( michael bloomberg ) None of them accused me of doing anything other than \u2014 maybe they didn \u2019 t like the joke I told .
