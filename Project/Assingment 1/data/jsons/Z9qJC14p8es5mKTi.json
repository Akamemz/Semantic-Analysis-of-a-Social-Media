    "content": "Despite a barrage of bad headlines , lagging poll numbers and mounting evidence that she 's in a dogfight with Bernie Sanders , Democratic insiders overwhelmingly think Hillary Clinton would win Iowa and New Hampshire if the contests were held this week .\nThat 's the assessment of this week 's \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus , our weekly bipartisan survey of the top strategists , activists and operatives in the two early-voting states .\nDriving the high degree of confidence in Clinton 's chances is a belief that her field organization is too formidable for Sanders to overcome . `` Best campaign infrastructure ever built , '' said an uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat . `` They can overcome any deficit . ''\nBoth in Iowa and New Hampshire , eight out of 10 Democrats surveyed said Clinton would win if the contests were held this week . Those responses come even as the Vermont senator pushed past Clinton in an Iowa poll released Thursday , something he has already done in New Hampshire .\n`` Although the polls say otherwise right now , I think Hillary will win the primary , '' a New Hampshire Democrat said . `` It is still early , she retooled her campaign to better reflect her authenticity , trustworthiness and exceptional qualifications . Polls have been proven wrong , especially in NH ! ''\nBut , cautioned another Granite State Democrat who selected Clinton , `` Sanders continues to gain momentum with the most ardent primary goers -- they will definitely show up to vote . If the Clinton camp does n't get their collective act together she can easily lose this primary . Also , if O'Malley catches a bit of fire or Biden gets in , all bets are off . Bernie 's support is rock solid . The rest will divide the votes as they all pull from the same establishment voters . ''\nWhile few insiders discounted the polls , or the notion that Sanders is riding a wave of momentum , some hold the view that Sanders has peaked , and that the organization , money and historic nature of the Clinton campaign still position the former secretary of state best for when voters actually head to the polls .\n`` Sanders is nearing his plateau , '' an uncommitted Iowa Democrat said . `` Hillary still has room to grow - I ca n't see the people holding out for Biden switching all the way to Sanders . I think a lot of caucus vets are holding out , waiting for the event where they will get their one on one moment with Hillary , their three minutes on their pet issue . About mid-November , they 'll realize it is not going to happen this time , because those moments are reserved this cycle in this campaign for Real Voters not county chairs . They may quietly resent it , but not enough to make them caucus for someone else . ''\nClinton has been under heavy scrutiny all summer over her email practices while at the State Department , which triggered the interest of the FBI and which ultimately led the former secretary of state to finally offer an unqualified apology this week . But Democratic insiders suggested the controversy would n't make a tangible dent in her support when it comes down to the actual casting of ballots .\n`` I have never been more positive that HRC will be President . Even the press is sick of hearing themselves talk about email , '' an Iowa Democrat said .\nSeventeen percent of Democratic respondents overall said Sanders would win if the contests were this week , but even some of those insiders said they ultimately see Clinton winning .\n`` This is when insurgent challengers ( Howard Dean , Bill Bradley , etc . ) generally have their day in the sun in New Hampshire , so if the primary were held this week Sanders would probably win , '' said one Granite State Democrat . `` But it 's not this week . When it is held in early 2016 , I expect Hillary Clinton will win . ''\nAdded an Iowa Democrat , `` Right now , he has momentum which ca n't be tracked in a poll and if he does well in Iowa and he has the momentum coming out of Iowa it [ could ] become a ripple effect . But it is n't February yet . ''\nA New Hampshire Democrat who said it 's a toss-up between Clinton and Sanders , described the Democratic race this way : `` Bernie is legitimately ahead in two recent and credible polls in NH , but ... his margin is not large . This is where campaigns can make the difference . Clinton 's team is super-organized , and has veterans who know where every last vote is . Sanders ' field and GOTV are n't nearly as well established . In a close race this counts , so if it were today : tossup . ''\nOn the Republican side , pointing to the polls , the vast majority in both early states agreed that Donald Trump would win their contests if they were held this week . In New Hampshire , nine out of 10 GOP insiders said Trump would be the victor . In Iowa , the numbers were lower -- 75 percent of insiders thought Trump would win . The results revealed Ben Carson 's strength in Iowa -- a quarter of Iowa GOP insiders said he would win if the caucuses were held today . In New Hampshire , none of the insiders cast a vote for Carson .\n\u201c It 's September and he 's lapped all the other candidates in the polls at least once -- - scarier than a Stephen King movie ! \u201d a New Hampshire Republican said of Trump .\nOthers , even as they said Trump would win this week , were more sanguine about his long-term prospects .\n`` But it 's not being held this week , '' noted a New Hampshire Republican . `` Thank God . I am still confident he will be taken down before voters go to the polls . Yes , he 's already lasted longer than expected . But 6 more months of this ? Hard to see . ''\nAdded another Granite State Republican , `` Can not deny the poll- right now he would win and probably easily- but when the electorate votes it will have taken a much harder , more decisive look at the candidates and no poll can model that result now . ''\nAn Iowa Republican attributed Trump \u2019 s stature in the polls right now to the \u201c overwhelming \u201d media coverage of him , but expects that will get old .\n\u201c At a certain point , we will see voters turn the channel , and cable news directors will follow , \u201d the Iowa insider said . \u201c Manufactured controversy and self-obsessed celebrity will give way to the seriousness of electing a president . Voters will take over ( thankfully ) and the field will start to settle into a process that is less poll-driven . What will happen when Trump 's numbers start to soften ? What happens when it becomes clear he will lose a state ?\n\u201c How he reacts to political failure will be telling . When he has to answer questions about his plane being repossessed by the banks . When he has to acknowledge that his company has hired hundreds -- maybe thousands -- of illegal immigrants . He will implode at some point . It might take months , but it is a certitude . \u201d\nInsiders expect Bush , Christie and Fiorina will try to take down Trump in the GOP debate\nJeb Bush is the candidate most likely to take on Trump -- and damage him -- in the GOP primary debate next week , according to the bulk of insiders on both sides of the aisle . Among Republicans , 44 percent of New Hampshire insiders said that was the case , while 20 percent of Iowans offered that assessment . Iowa Republicans were evenly divided between Bush , Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina in guessing who would most aggressively , and successfully , challenge Trump , while 40 percent of Democrats overall pointed to Bush .\n`` Someone has to call BS on Trump and Bush is doing it , '' an unaligned Granite State Republican said . `` Right on policy , and good politics too : It appeals to the 60 % of voters who would never vote for Trump under any circumstances . ''\nA New Hampshire Democrat , one of the 40 percent of Democrats who named Bush , added : `` At this point , Bush probably has the most to lose if the Trump surge continues . Plus , he desperately needs to show some passion and some mettle . Trump has totally eclipsed Walker as well but Walker does n't have the smarts or the confidence to take him on - any attack is more likely to blow up in his face , like Boris and Natasha trying to take out Rocky the Squirrel . ''\nTwenty percent of Iowa Republicans , and 21 percent of Granite State Republicans , pointed to Christie as the likeliest aggressor .\n`` Christie has nothing to lose and can land an effective left hook on the hair , '' said one Iowa Republican .\n`` Christie 's ship has sailed and he wo n't be the nominee let alone POTUS , '' said another Hawkeye State Republican . `` About all he can do is reclaim the title of chief straight talker , calling out Trump for what he is , helping the Party , and maybe himself down the road . ''\nSaid a third Iowa Republican who named Christie : `` He is about to lose his place on the big stage , and if he does , there goes the money and any hope to make a comeback . He has the ability and demonstrated against Rand he 's not afraid to throw punches . ''\nEqual numbers of Iowa and New Hampshire Republicans said Fiorina was the best bet for successfully tussling with Trump .\n`` Even though Trump survived the Megyn Kelly fracas , you still have to think that he will come off as a bully ( or maybe immature ) if Carly pins him down on issues and he responds by calling her schoolyard names , '' a Granite State Republican said .\nAgreed another New Hampshire Republican , `` I think Carly really could do some damage and she should attack him as anti-woman . ''\nBut , cautioned several insiders , it 's not at all clear that any attacks will stick to Trump -- after all , they have n't so far .\n`` The real question really is , who will be Trump 's kryptonite as so far he has survived more than any traditional candidate could , '' a New Hampshire Republican said . `` Jeb has continued to send smoke signals that he is going to be the one to take on Trump , but like the Teflon Don , attacks are just deflecting off him in a staggering way that no other candidate understands .
