'' He thinks he knows us so well .\nIn another video released earlier , he said that to pass new health care legislation , the Obama administration successfully relied on an electorate -- again , you and me -- that did n't really understand it .\n`` It 's a very clever , you know , basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter , '' he tells the Honors Colloquium 2012 at the University of Rhode Island .\nThere appears to be a bottomless well of Gruber 's greatest hits .\nIn yet another , from a speech at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013 , he explains that the very function of the law -- doing what it was designed to do -- was totally unpalatable to voters ( that is , if only we 'd turned away from our Cheetos bags and NASCAR races long enough to catch it ) .\n`` If you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money , it would not have passed . ''\nTo hammer the point home , he admits that the sales pitch was one big cover-up operation : `` Lack of transparency is a huge advantage . And basically , you know , call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever . But basically that was really , really critical to getting the thing to pass .
