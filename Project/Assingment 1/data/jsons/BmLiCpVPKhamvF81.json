She \u2019 s signed on to a bipartisan letter urging Trump to end the shutdown in exchange for a three-week immigration debate , which was promptly rejected by the White House , according to sources familiar with the talks . She \u2019 s even endorsed moving forward with no wall money .\nOn Thursday , her plans to travel to Europe for a conference on the Arctic had been canceled .

Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) and Rob Portman ( R-Ohio ) . They hoped to get as many as 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats to sign their letter to Trump , with the hopes that a substantial Democratic commitment to debating border security and a push from Trump \u2019 s own party could shift Washington \u2019 s stalemate .\nBut Republican support for the letter cratered this week amid a widespread belief that the president won \u2019 t support opening up the government without a border wall guarantee . The letter still might get sent , according to two people familiar with it . But nobody is superenthused .\n\u201c They came up with about nine or 10 Republicans .

The move was so last-minute that other lawmakers scheduled to accompany Pelosi had already boarded a charter bus set to take them to the airport .\n\u201c Pretty foul , \u201d said Sen.
