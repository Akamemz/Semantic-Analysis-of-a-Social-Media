Four Trump losses ( TX , OK , MN , AK ) & three very close shaves ( VA , VT , AR ) out of 11 ST states . https : //t.co/IYAQGdz2P2 \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) March 2 , 2016\nMore than 1 million people voted in Virginia 's GOP primary today , passing Cuccinelli 's gubernatorial vote total in '13 . \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) March 2 , 2016\nCruz and Rubio camps are no longer pretending they can win this nomination before Cleveland . Both camps pushing convention scenarios . \u2014 Chuck Todd ( @ chucktodd ) March 2 , 2016\nOnce you accept that nobody is leaving ( barring the hard $ spigot running dry ) , it 's easy to see a useful strategic role for everyone . \u2014 Liam Donovan ( @ LPDonovan ) March 2 , 2016\nIt 's much easier to envision a two-front war in which Cruz siphons delegates from Trump in red zones , Kasich/Rubio in blue zones . \u2014 Dave Wasserman ( @ Redistrict ) March 2 , 2016\nThe `` you drop out , no you drop out '' talk is as useless now as it was 2wks ago . Cruz and Rubio need to continue the all-out assault on Trump . \u2014 Sean Davis ( @ seanmdav ) March 2 , 2016\nSuper Tuesday 's nominating contests went ... roughly as expected , actually , with a notable twists and turns along the way . In short , Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee -- and while Donald Trump remains firmly in the GOP driver 's seat , his night was n't quite as dominant as you may have thought when you fell asleep . Details : The Democratic race is n't technically over , but it might as well be.won seven states tofour , but her delegate lead keeps expanding , thanks in part to powerful superdelegates . Between her victories and her party 's establishment circling the wagons , she will likely achieve her goal of putting Sanders away in the coming weeks . Perhaps her most symbolic victory last night was pulling out a win in Massachusetts , into which her campaign poured resources and effort in a successful bid to make a statement in Sanders ' backyard . She also crushed Sanders in the South , beating him badly among voters of color . Sanders ' campaign may be vowing to fight to the Philadelphia convention , but Hillary more or less ignored him in her victory remarks ( despite cribbing some of his material ) , attacking Donald Trump and Republicans instead . It was a `` presumptive nominee '' speech . is on track to become the Republican nominee , although warning signs exist that a substantial segment of the party wo n't go quietly . For example Trump fell well short of claiming a majority of the delegates allocated on Super Tuesday ; by comparison , Mitt Romney did so by a healthy margin in 2012 . Trump also lagged slightly behind Romney 's performance in terms of his popular vote victory percentage . ( Same goes for McCain in 2008 ) . If Trump 's rivals continue bagging chunks of available delegates over the next few weeks , and manage to win several big prizes ( Ohio , Florida , etc . ) when the calendar moves into the winner-take-all zone on March 15 , Trump may be deprived of the 1,237 delegates he needs to stave off a contested convention . Nevertheless , Trump undoubtedly remains the strong frontrunner in this race , and will be difficult to beat at this rate . His decision to hold a press conference , rather than a celebratory speech , was strategic and worked well . The tone he adopted seemed intentionally subdued , as he laid out what is sure to be one of his themes against Hillary Clinton if he is nominated : She 's been a huge part of the creating the mess we 're in over many years , so she can not be part of the solution . He expressed hope that he 'd get along with GOP Congressional leaders if elected , but also issued something of a threat against House Speaker Paul Ryan . He again disavowed white supremacist David Duke , arguing that he thought he had been clear in his ( anything but clear ) controversial interview on Sunday . He once again did not explicitly denounce the KKK , a subject that led to much-buzzed-about fireworks on CNN between Trump supporter Jeffrey Lord and liberal commentator Van Jones . Trump backers and some conservatives may believe Lord at least battled to a draw here by invoking the Klan 's historical ties to Democrats , but in the 21st century , this is ... not a helpful debate for any Republican campaign to be engaged in : Even though the odds are tough to stop him , this simply is n't the mark of a truly dominant frontrunner : had a very good night , romping in his home state of Texas , and picking off neighboring Oklahoma while he was at it ( with Alaska coming in late as a very close win ) . Cruz also picked up delegates across a number of Southern states , in which he finished second or third . Following his Texas and Oklahoma triumphs , Cruz gave a rare prepared speech in which he attempted to re-frame the GOP race as a two-person affair ( as I predicted ) , arguing that he 's the only candidate who 's beaten Trump anywhere . This was before Minnesota went for Rubio . The Texan slammed his celebrity billionaire competitor repeatedly , signaling that Thursday night 's debate in Michigan is likely to be another bruising event . As of this writing , he finished the night with at least one hundred more delegates than Rubio -- fueling his point about who is best positioned to fight Trump one-on-one . The trouble for Cruz is that the primary map becomes much less hospitable to him after March 5th . Having seriously under-performed his campaign 's targets among evangelicals ( whom he 's been losing outright to Trump in many places ) and demonstrating limited appeal among other Republican demographics , a strong case can be made that by the end of the week , Cruz 's best territory will be in the rearview mirror . His `` firewall `` was n't what it needed to be to allow him to march down the victory path he 'd envisioned . That said , those future concerns do n't negate the fact that Ted Cruz enjoyed a much better Super Tuesday than any other Republican not named 'Donald Trump . ' Do n't believe me ? Ask ... Lindsey Graham learned the hard way that the difference between earning a shining media narrative and being branded the loser of the night can hinge on a handful of percentage points , and the timing of breaking news . At the onset of the evening , Rubio caused a stir when exit polls showed him winning late-deciders and running neck-and-neck with Donald Trump in Virginia -- where public polling had pegged Trump 's lead at 15 points . He 'd stormed into a virtual tie , it seemed , and had a chance to win the state . Ultimately , Trump hung on by less than three points , winning just one more delegate than Rubio in the Old Dominion . Still , because Rubio had n't won a state at that point , the `` winless streak '' talking point began to fly . By the time Rubio finally claimed a victory in Minnesota , all of the candidates had already addressed supporters and the conventional wisdom had begun to congeal . The good news for Rubio in Gopherland is that he shed the `` no wins '' monkey off is back , beat Cruz soundly , and crushed third-place Trump by double digits . The bad news is that because of the state 's delegate rules , his sizable win did n't build him much of an advantage on that front . Rubio picked up delegates in a slew of states , finishing in second and third place across the board . But his failure to hit statewide delegate thresholds in Alabama , Vermont and especially Texas was costly . As was John Kasich 's strong showing in northern Virginia , which played a large role in denying Rubio a major upset win early in the night . Because of the Cruz dynamic mentioned above , Rubio is n't going anywhere .
