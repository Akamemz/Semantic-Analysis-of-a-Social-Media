    "content": "Okay\u2014we had Hollywood liberal go insane last week . We had Kathy Griffin do a disastrous mock beheading photo shoot , where she holds up a bloodied head of the president . Then , after the horrific terror attack in London over the weekend , which left seven people dead , including over 40 injured , Bette Midler tweeted that \u201c men and religion are useless. \u201d Now , on the news media side , you have MSNBC host Thomas Roberts asking whether President Trump is trying to provoke another terror attack to exploit for political gain . Roberts was referencing the president \u2019 s tweets after the London attack .\nWe need to be smart , vigilant and tough . We need the courts to give us back our rights . We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 3 , 2017\nWe must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people . If we do n't get smart it will only get worse \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 4 , 2017\nIn two separate interviews , one with Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and the other with former Vermont Governor Howard Dean , Roberts asked the question . Both men refused to answer the question directly . Reed said that Twitter isn \u2019 t the best medium to address the issue of terrorism . Dean was more taken aback , opting to say that Trump is just incompetent .\n\u201c Uh , I just think he 's \u00ad\u2013well , I think he 's totally incompetent , \u201d he replied ( via RCP ) [ emphasis mine ] :\nTHOMAS ROBERTS , MSNBC : We do n't know more about the three suspects , Howard , but we do know that the president found that inappropriate of the mayor and went after him saying at least seven dead and 48 wounded , and the mayor of London says there 's no reason to be alarmed , and he also said we have to quit being politically correct , get down to the business of security for our people , if we do n't get smart it is only going to get worse . ' I asked this of Mayor Reed , but seems like the president is trying to provoke something that he can politicize more for his own gain in America . Do you feel that way ?\nIs this a fair question ? Would Obama be accused of this if he went off half-cocked on Twitter after a terrorist attack in an alternate universe ? With Trump , it \u2019 s a multi-layered hate cake because he \u2019 s a Republican , who also beat Hillary Clinton , which wasn \u2019 t supposed to happen . So , what to do if you \u2019 re the liberal media elite ? Well , you peddle stories about Russian collusion that turn out to be nothing burgers and wage an incessant campaign to mock and denigrate his presidency . Some might say that \u2019 s what they should be doing , others might say it \u2019 s a sign that Trump is winning .\nThe notion that the president of the United States wanting a terrorist attack to exploit for political gain is a throwback to the progressive nutjobs who thought the 9/11 attacks were an inside job . It was insane then , and it \u2019 s still crazy now . Roberts may think this line of questioning is legitimate , but without hard evidence\u2014it \u2019 s rather irresponsible to bring up on live television . I know it may be hard for some on the Left to comprehend this , but Donald J. Trump is not evil . That would be ISIS . You \u2019 re getting your enemies mixed up ( shocker ) .",
