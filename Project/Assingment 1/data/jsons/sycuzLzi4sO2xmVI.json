    "content": "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte ( R-Va. ) and Judiciary Committee Republicans today sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein calling for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate unaddressed matters , some connected to the 2016 election and others , including many actions taken by Obama Administration officials like Attorney General Loretta Lynch , FBI Director James Comey , and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . The letter follows yesterday \u2019 s House Judiciary Committee approval of H. Res . 446 , as amended , to request documents pertaining to the FBI \u2019 s investigation of former Secretary Clinton . In their letter , the Judiciary Committee members express concern that the directive given to Special Counsel Robert Mueller is narrow in scope and many concerns arising out of the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath are not being investigated . The members call for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate grave concerns such as former Attorney General Lynch \u2019 s directive to former FBI Director Comey to mislead the American people on the nature of the investigation into former Secretary Clinton ; the FBI and Justice Department \u2019 s investigative decisions related to the Clinton email investigation , including the immunity deals given to potential co-conspirators ; selected leaks of classified information that unmasked U.S. persons incidentally collected upon by the intelligence community ; and the FBI \u2019 s reliance on \u201c Fusion GPS \u201d in its investigation of the Trump campaign , among many others issues .\nIf you \u2019 re sick and tired of the never-ending \u201c Trump And The Russians \u201d scandal , which for all its hype has produced scant little actual evidence of anything other than desultory cooperation on the part of the president \u2019 s camp with an investigation it quite reasonably believes is a kangaroo court , this letter from Goodlatte \u2019 s committee might just be what the doctor ordered .\nBecause as Washington scandals go , Trump And The Russians doesn \u2019 t even make it out of Double-A ball . What Goodlatte and the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee want is a special counsel to take us up to the Triple-A or major league scandal level , because there are opportunities for playing time available .\nThe unmasking issue still has a lot of undiscovered meat on its bones ; we \u2019 ve already seen a little evidence of that . The Lynch-Comey-Phoenix Airport nexus deserves a lot more scrutiny than it \u2019 s received , as do those immunity grants . And the leaks without a doubt deserve a full investigation , and some smug SOB \u2019 s from the Deep State surely deserve lengthy prison terms .\nBut the Fusion GPS business \u2014 and the long-simmering and now-burgeoning Awan brothers scandal \u2014 are monsters hiding in D.C. \u2019 s closet . Here \u2019 s to both those scandals continuing to crackle and spark over the next several months , on the way to full explosions the legacy media can no longer contain .\nThe central figure in this scandal is a Pakistani national named Imran Awan , who appears to be connected in some way to his country \u2019 s intelligence service . Awan is an IT professional who was hired in 2004 to handle computer equipment for Florida Democrat congressman Robert Wexler , and he then picked up a job as a shared staffer to work for Wexler \u2019 s colleague Debbie Wasserman Schultz .\nAwan rode along with Wasserman Schultz as she ascended to the top of the Democratic Party structure , and soon not only was his boss the chair of the Democratic National Committee but Awan \u2019 s relationship with her led to his building a client list of some 80 Democrat House members who were using either Imran or other members of his family ( a pair of brothers , one of their wives , his own wife ) in a sizable little empire he \u2019 d built .\nAnd in the meantime , the Awan family was engaging in a pattern of financial activities that looked a whole lot like a mafia operation \u2014 questionable real estate deals , bank fraud , kidnapping and extortion , a used-car dealership that might well have been a front for moving stolen cars to Pakistan for sale , and so on . Awan was arrested at Dulles International Airport on Monday as he tried to flee the country while the FBI and Capitol Hill Police were closing in on a bank fraud indictment . In January he had wired some $ 283,000 from the Congressional Federal Credit Union to two individuals in Pakistan ; he was trying to board a flight to Lahore when he had the cuffs put on him .\nBut the real juice with the Awans isn \u2019 t the bank fraud or the possible stolen cars . The real scandal here is the stolen computers \u2014 and the stolen information . It \u2019 s alleged that the Awans illegally downloaded documents from their clients , some of whom were on the House Intelligence Committee and other sensitive committees , and even walked off with congressional computers . The FBI , in fact , seized a number of CPU \u2019 s and hard drives found at a house owned by Imran that he was renting to a military couple after the tenants had found the equipment partially destroyed in the garage and called the authorities . We don \u2019 t know what was on those hard drives .\nThere are even allegations the Awans were blackmailing their clients with information they \u2019 d found in their e-mails . Your imagination can likely conjure up all kinds of entertaining scenarios around that theme .\nBut the piece de resistance with the Awan brothers scandal is the revelation that Imran Awan , with his foreign intelligence connections , his criminal appearance and his persistent financial problems despite apparently not lacking in the ability to make a buck , had the password to Wasserman Schultz \u2019 iPad from which she answered her e-mail\u2026 as DNC chair .\nForget about the Russians and their supposed hacking of the DNC e-mails . If you \u2019 re really curious about who got to that information and would have been in a position to shop it to the highest bidder , Imran Awan is the most likely culprit in the room .\nThings are moving very quickly on this case , and it \u2019 s somewhat telling that Awan was released on bond after being caught trying to flee the country . He has a tracking bracelet on his ankle , but what makes more sense is that he may have turned states \u2019 evidence in exchange for being let out of jail . Awan \u2019 s attorney is former Bill Clinton go-fer Chris Gowen , and the lawyer \u2019 s statement after he \u2019 d been arrested reads like a press release from a campaign operative rather than a criminal attorney ; bizarrely so , one might say . It might be that Awan is rolling on Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons have decided to hang her out to dry in order to insulate themselves from whatever blowback the DNC e-mails might generate for them .\nOr maybe that isn \u2019 t possible anymore . Former Washington police detective Rod Wheeler , who you \u2019 ve probably seen on Fox News from time to time and who most recently was in the news as having done some private snooping in the Seth Rich case , has intimated there is a connection between that case and that of the Awan brothers . We \u2019 re not going to try to connect those dots without more information , but one \u2019 s imagination might run riot with those .\nMeanwhile , Republicans in both the House and the Senate are exceptionally curious about Fusion GPS , and with good reason . In case you \u2019 re not familiar with this outfit , it \u2019 s the \u201c opposition research and strategic communications \u201d firm co-founded by former Wall Street Journal reporters Peter Fritsch and Glenn Simpson which played a significant role in the 2016 election . It was Fusion GPS which commissioned the infamous and debunked \u201c pee pee dossier , \u201d written by former British spy Christopher Steele , sourced largely from Steele \u2019 s Russian contacts and containing a mountain of scurrilous and implausible allegations about Donald Trump \u2019 s misbehaviors . Fusion GPS was initially contracted by anti-Trump Republican donors , but after Trump got the GOP nomination it was Democrats paying the freight for their work product\u2026 and before it was over it looks like James Comey \u2019 s FBI , amazingly , was picking up the tab .\nThat last part is of special interest to Sen. Charles Grassley and the Senate Judiciary Committee , which has made a priority out of Fusion GPS , and had called Simpson to testify . He did , but only in private , and only after threatening to take the Fifth . That \u2019 s his right , but what does an oppo researcher need the Fifth Amendment for ?\nBut there \u2019 s more with Fusion GPS . On Wednesday Tucker Carlson had as a guest on his show one Thor Halvorssen , a Venezuelan native of Norwegian descent who runs a watchdog outfit called the Human Rights Foundation , and Halvorssen told a harrowing story of Fusion GPS attempting to destroy his life with a smear campaign because he \u2019 d blown the whistle on a crooked contract one of Fusion \u2019 s clients had with the Venezuelan government to build power plants . That story also got told in a letter Halvorssen sent to Grassley \u2019 s committee . And then there is Fusion \u2019 s other client , Natalia Veselnitskaya , the \u201c Russian lawyer \u201d whose meeting with Jared Kushner , Donald Trump Jr. , and Paul Manafort has been bandied about as some sort of smoking gun proving collusion with the Russians . It turns out that Veselnitskaya had hired Fusion to help her push to overturn the Magnitsky Act , a sanctions bill targeting crooked Russian oligarchs and human rights abusers . In none of these cases did Fusion bother to register under FARA , the Foreign Agent Registry Act , which would put them on the wrong side of the law .\nGrassley \u2019 s committee , and Goodlatte \u2019 s committee , would like to know if this entire Russian business was a setup cooked-up by Fusion \u2019 s dirty-tricks shop with the collusion of a few actors in the Obama administration . It \u2019 s hard to blame them .\nThere \u2019 s a lot of debate about Trump \u2019 s \u201c drain the swamp \u201d mantra these days , but nobody is really denying the swamp exists .

Here\u2019s to both those scandals continuing to crackle and spark over the next several months, on the way to full explosions the legacy media can no longer contain.\n\nReaders of this column already have an understanding of the Awan brothers scandal, as this space covered a substantial amount of the background of it back in February when things first started happening. Click here to see that background; we\u2019ll give a very short summary of it now.\n\nThe central figure in this scandal is a Pakistani national named Imran Awan, who appears to be connected in some way to his country\u2019s intelligence service.
