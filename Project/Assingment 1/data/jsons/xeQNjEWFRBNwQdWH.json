His lackluster performance against a strong showing by Romney helped the former Massachusetts governor to catch , and in some places , pass the president in the polls .\nObama then fought back . He won the last two debates in the eyes of analysts and viewers with aggressive challenges to Romney 's changing positions , framed by the president as a question of whether voters can trust his rival .\nCNN Poll : Nearly half of debate watchers say Obama won showdown\nThe roller-coaster ride of the 2012 campaign has been particularly volatile because of an unprecedented number of debates . There were more than 20 in the GOP primary campaign followed by the three presidential showdowns and one between the vice presidential contenders .\nThe multiple 90-minute sessions were almost all broadcast nationally on network or cable television . Voters were able to see an array of presidential hopefuls deal with the unique campaign pressure-cooker of differing styles , settings , moderators , audiences and issues -- all under the bright glare of stage lights and intense public scrutiny .\nIn the end , the debates likely did as much or more to shape public perceptions of the two final contenders than the billions of dollars spent on mostly negative advertising that have filled the airwaves nationally , particularly in the handful of battleground states still up for grabs and therefore crucial to winning the White House on November 6 .\nFor Romney , the debates presented the last chance to fully introduce himself to a nationwide audience , and he waited until the first encounter in Denver on October 3 to make his strongest pitch for independent and moderate voters considered key to winning the election .\nRomney could have started the shift a month earlier at the Republican National Convention in Tampa , but instead used his acceptance speech to focus on his personal qualities as a husband , father , local and regional Mormon church leader and successful businessman .\nRich Galen , a conservative commentator who formerly worked for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , last week described a patient Romney strategy . The campaign waited until the home stretch to unveil a long-expected shift toward the middle by the candidate , who described himself as `` severely conservative '' during the primaries to try to appeal to the conservative base .\n`` They hold their fire , hold their fire , hold their fire , and then they sprint to the finish , '' Galen said , referring to what he called a `` change in what he 's saying and how he 's saying it . ''\nThe shift `` tells me that they had planned for a late-game surge , '' he said .\nIt appeared to work , with Romney 's assertive debate performance in Denver providing traditionally Republican voters who questioned his presidential credentials with the validation they needed to support him .\nRomney repeatedly invoked what he called the consequences of Obama 's failed policies -- high unemployment , sluggish economic recovery , an onerous regulatory system that stifled growth -- with little challenge from the president .\nReaders respond : 5 things you learned from the final debate\nHe insisted his tax reforms to cut rates across the board and eliminate unspecified deductions would not increase the deficit , rejecting Obama 's claim that it would .\nAt the same time , Romney also touted the health care reforms enacted in Massachusetts while he was governor , seeking to benefit from an issue that caused him trouble in the Republican primaries with conservatives who detest Obama 's national health care reforms .\nThe Romney team `` kind of reshaped his image at the debate to make him a more moderate figure , '' said Ron Brownstein , the National Journal editorial director and CNN senior political analyst , adding that it `` would have been dangerous to do that earlier . ''\nRomney `` talked to the voters who are dissatisfied with Obama and reminded them why they were was dissatisfied and helped cross the threshold on why he would do better , '' while Obama `` did nothing to frame the case against Romney '' or explain what he would do in a second term to make things better , Brownstein said .\nUntil the first debate , he explained , Obama benefited from `` a slice of the electorate who were clearly dissatisfied with his first term , were not sure he deserved a second term , but were n't sure if Romney was a viable alternative , '' thereby providing the president some margin of comfort .\n`` I think that permanently changed at the first debate , '' Brownstein said .\nAn immediate CNN/ORC International poll showed more than 60 % of respondents who watched the Denver debate considered Romney the winner . In following weeks , Romney 's poll numbers rose steadily , bringing him even with Obama in an aggregate of major national surveys and moving in front in key battleground states such as Florida and North Carolina .\nWith less than a month to go in the campaign , the Romney rise presented a potentially unstoppable problem for Obama . In response , the president adopted a more aggressive posture in the second and third debates . It focused on Romney 's political shifts following his days leading moderate Massachusetts to his effort to win conservative support in the GOP primary , and then his latest move back toward the political center .\nAt Monday night 's third and final debate in Florida , which highlighted foreign policy issues , Romney shifted or modified previous positions to agree with Obama on how to respond to the Syrian conflict and when to pull combat troops out of Afghanistan .\nHe also supported Obama 's decision to take out al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , and to expand the use of drones to go after terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan . But Romney also sought to present himself as a reasonable -- and possibly more reasonable -- alternative to the president .\n`` We ca n't kill our way out of this mess , '' Romney said of combating terrorism , and he pushed for `` a comprehensive strategy '' to curb violent extremism in the Middle East .\n`` The key that we 're going to have to pursue is a -- is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own , '' Romney said , proposing U.S. policies to promote economic development , better education , gender equity and to help create institutions .\nHowever , he was unable to express any significant policy difference with Obama on how that would happen .\nObama responded by criticizing his opponent for proposing `` wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map , '' and analysts described Romney 's positions as attacking Obama from the left , rather than the right .\nFareed Zakaria of CNN and Time magazine joked that Romney 's stance invoked the spirit of anti-war Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern , who died over the weekend .\nMeanwhile , Republican strategists said Romney achieved his goal of coming off as presidential , an assertion backed by the CNN/ORC poll that showed both candidates got high marks from respondents for leadership ability .
