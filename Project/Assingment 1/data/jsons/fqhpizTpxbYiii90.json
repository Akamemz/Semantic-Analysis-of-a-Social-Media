''\nSelinger said she even reached out to her unnamed mother-in-law to discuss the impact of the Charlottesville , Virginia , riots and the death of Heather Heyer in an effort to criticize President Donald Trump and his supporters .\n`` As a Jewish woman with half-Jewish children , I wanted her to know that her support of a president who says incendiary , race-baiting things affects people like me , '' Selinger said in a text to her mother-in-law . `` It affects my kids . ''\nSelinger was apparently put off by her mother-in-law 's short response : `` Thank you for your note . '' Selinger then explained that that lack of conversation was causing a rift in the family and insisted that she did n't want to cut them out of the family 's lives , but she was n't optimistic .\n`` In the case of this deep kind of intolerance , there is no solution , '' she complained . `` I believe it has to be vanquished entirely . ''\nResigned , Selinger said that she was just simply unable to pretend `` that we 're a normal family . ''\n`` It 's not like I can just leave them with the kids for the night and hope they do n't say something awful about a marginalized group of people while I 'm out enjoying a martini with my husband , '' she complained . `` That safety has been stolen from both of us . ''\nSelinger 's mother-in-law was less than pleased over her daughter-in-law 's thoughts .\n`` Really , I 'm choosing my own family over her politics , over her intolerant behavior , '' Selinger reasoned . `` Exposure to racism , or sexism , or homophobia is dangerous for young children . ... Exposing [ children ] to bigotry is simply not healthy .
