    "content": "The greenhouse gas reductions required by the Obama administration \u2019 s proposed rule on power plants will not get the world to where it has to go to avert the worst consequences of climate change . But they are likely to be enormously beneficial : good for the nation \u2019 s health , good for technological innovation , good for President Obama \u2019 s credibility abroad , and , in time , good for the planet and future generations .\nThe proposed rule \u2014 and the importance of this can not be overstated \u2014 signals the end of an era in which polluters could dump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere without penalty . It would set new emissions standards for America \u2019 s existing power plants , which generate 38 percent of the emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas , and one-third of overall greenhouse gas emissions . The broad goal is to cut these emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 . This means that many of the nation \u2019 s roughly 550 coal-fired power plants , which are much dirtier than plants powered by natural gas , will have to close or undergo expensive upgrades .\nThe 2030 target is ambitious but hardly unattainable . Emissions from power plants have already fallen roughly 13 percent from the 2005 baseline partly because tougher rules on pollutants like mercury have forced some coal-fired plants to close or become more efficient and partly because cheap and cleaner natural gas is edging out coal as the fuel of choice among big generators . In other words , the country is almost halfway to its goal . A recent study by M.J. Bradley , a Boston consulting firm , showed that 100 of the largest power producers steadily reduced pollutants of all kinds , including carbon dioxide , between 2008 and 2012 .\nIf it withstands almost certain legal and legislative challenges , the rule also means that Mr. Obama \u2019 s pledge in Copenhagen in 2009 to cut America \u2019 s overall greenhouse gases by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 202o is well within reach . And it will give him leverage as he leads this country into the next round of global climate negotiations . World leaders will meet this fall in New York with an eye to producing ambitious new national emissions targets by next spring and , perhaps , a new global climate treaty by the end of 2015 .",
