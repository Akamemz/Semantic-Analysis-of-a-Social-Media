    "content": "( CNN ) For a little while on Tuesday , a document posted to The Gateway Pundit , a popular right-wing blog prone to peddling conspiracy theories , must have seemed to some of its readers like the perfect story .\nThe document was not just an allegation of sexual assault against Special Counsel Robert Mueller , a favorite enemy of President Trump 's supporters -- it was also an opportunity to troll liberals , supporters of the # MeToo movement , and the media .\n`` We believe the victim ... we believe the victim ... we believe the victim ... , '' the top comment read . `` Proof does n't matter . It 's the seriousness of the charge , '' another commenter responded . A reply to that said , `` Absolutely . Anyone who does n't believe her is supporting sexual assault and attacking alll women . '' And then another : `` Lol time to rub it in . ''\nJust a few hours later , however , the story collapsed . Journalists and internet sleuths tied a scheme to smear Mueller with charges of sexual assault to an entity called Surefire Intelligence . That firm was tied to 20-year-old Jacob Wohl , a far-right internet personality who has written for The Gateway Pundit and who was previously banned from financial trading by the National Futures Association over allegations of fraud , and to a number of fake LinkedIn profiles apparently intended to create the impression that Surefire Intelligence was a legitimate and impressive organization with several employees .\nThe Gateway Pundit 's founder , Jim Hoft , removed the document from his website and published an editor 's note in its place . He said that there were `` very serious allegations against Jacob Wohl '' and that he was `` looking into '' them . Hoft did not respond to phone calls or an email from CNN seeking comment .\nIt is still unclear exactly who or how many people were involved with the scheme , or what their motives were . Did they want to discredit Mueller ? Were they trying to setup reporters in an attempt to smear them ? Were they just in it for themselves ?\nThe bizarre saga appeared to have kicked into gear over the last few weeks when reporters from various news organizations were emailed by a person or people who identified themself as Lorraine Parsons . Parsons , who did not respond to requests for comment from CNN and has reportedly declined to speak to several other media organizations , said she had been offered money in exchange for making a sexual assault allegation against Mueller .\nThe matter has now been referred to the FBI for investigation .\n`` When we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the Special Counsel , we immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation , '' Peter Carr , a spokesman for the Special Counsel 's office , said in a statement on Tuesday .\nIn the email to reporters , Parsons claimed to have worked at a law firm with Mueller in the 1970s , though the law firm has said it had no records of her being employed there . Parsons said that the person who had contacted her about making a sexual assault allegation in exchange for money said he was working for Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman .\nOn Tuesday morning , Wohl tweeted that a `` scandalous story about Mueller '' would be `` breaking tomorrow . ''\nBurkman announced shortly after that he would be holding a press conference on Thursday to `` reveal the first of Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's sex assault victims . ''\nThe Gateway Pundit , which Wohl writes for , then published the document detailing what it portrayed as an unidentified woman 's accusation that Mueller had raped her .\nAs the story gained media attention , Vermont Law School professor Jennifer Taub , who has previously written for CNN 's opinion section , said she too had received an email from an individual offering to compensate her `` at whatever rate you see fit '' for discussing `` past encounters with Robert Mueller . ''\nTaub told CNN she had never met or spoken with Mueller , and that she had forwarded the email to the Department of Justice .\nThe individual who emailed Taub identified himself as Simon Frick , who claimed to be a researcher for Surefire Intelligence . Ed Krassenstein , a liberal Twitter personality who writes for HillReporter.com , said he had also been contacted by an individual claiming to work for Surefire Intelligence after he looked into claims from Parsons .\nPhone numbers listed on the Surefire Intelligence website , however , automatically redirected callers to a voicemail for Wohl 's mother .\nTwitter users pointed out that the same Google user who had uploaded images for the Surefire Intelligence website had also previously uploaded images for a website Wohl used for an asset management firm .\nAric Toler , a researcher for Bellingcat , an organization that uses online and open source material to conduct investigations , also noted that a LinkedIn profile for Simon Frick used a picture of Christoph Waltz , an actor who has starred in movies including `` Django Unchained , '' `` Muppets Most Wanted , '' and the James Bond film `` Spectre . ''\nAnd Jane Mayer , a writer for The New Yorker , noted that a LinkedIn photo of an individual claiming to be the head of Surefire Intelligence appeared to simply be a darkened photograph of Wohl . ( The picture had been removed from the profile by the time CNN viewed it Tuesday afternoon . )\nOdd . Jacob Wohl says he does n't know nuttin ' about Surefire Intelligence , the firm tied to the bizarre Mueller allegations . Take a look at the photos below of Mathhew Cohen , head of 'Surefire , ' and of Jacob Wohl . pic.twitter.com/Q1rAW4wkPO \u2014 Jane Mayer ( @ JaneMayerNYer ) October 30 , 2018\nWohl himself even apparently confirmed a link between Burkman and Surefire Intelligence . He told The Daily Beast that Burkman had hired Surefire Intelligence to help him investigate Mueller 's past . Burkman , however , told CNN that he does n't `` comment on any employees or subcontractors . ''\nWhen reached for comment through Twitter 's direct message feature and asked about his ties to Surefire Intelligence , Wohl said , `` Sounds like a kooky Russiagate conspiracy theory . ''\nWhen CNN dialed a number listed on Surefire Intelligence 's website , an unknown individual answered . That person told CNN that he did n't know what Surefire Intelligence was -- `` it does n't ring a bell '' -- and , when asked to identify himself , said `` do n't call '' if `` you are n't sure '' who the number belongs to .\nSeveral hours later , phone numbers listed for Surefire Intelligence on its website had been disconnected . At least some of the LinkedIn profiles that showed purported employees of Surefire were also taken down , as were two articles on Medium promoting the company under the guise of news stories .\nBurkman said on Twitter Tuesday night that `` the allegations of paying a woman are false . ''\nBurkman is a Republican operative who has a history of organizing stunts that get him attention , present narratives aimed at benefitting the GOP , and ultimately fall apart in spectacular fashion .\nFor instance , earlier this year , Burkman helped peddle conspiracy theories about the murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich when he announced a press conference in which he said he would `` present a witness '' who would identify two individuals who had information about Rich 's murder .\nHowever , when reporters arrived , Burkman said the witness would call in , and not appear in person . After technical difficulties establishing a phone connection , the witness , who was not identified by name , rambled instead of providing actual information .\nThe press conference was executed so poorly , it was even lambasted by individuals on the far-right who believe or at least give credence to the Seth Rich conspiracy theory .",
