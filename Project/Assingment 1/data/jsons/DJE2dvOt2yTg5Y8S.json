Gorsuch dissented .\nThe court refused to consider a challenge to the Department of Veterans Affairs ' system for evaluating disability claims . Gorsuch dissented .\nThe court declined to hear a challenge to a California law limiting who can carry a concealed gun in public . Gorsuch dissented .\nAnd the court turned aside a challenge to the meager sum Mississippi paid when it converted a former landowner 's property into a park .
