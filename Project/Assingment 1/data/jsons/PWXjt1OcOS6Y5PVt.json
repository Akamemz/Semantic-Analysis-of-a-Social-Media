    "content": "Hillary Clinton was the subject that consumed the political talk shows , as questions continued to be raised about Karl Rove \u2019 s comments regarding her health .\nWhile Republicans attacked the noncandidate , Democrats defended her but also expressed concern over her strategy so far in advance of the next presidential election .\nIf you missed the Sunday political talk shows , we \u2019 ll get you up to speed on the latest events and opinion in Washington with this comprehensive roundup of all things political :\nHillary Clinton : It \u2019 s widely accepted that it hasn \u2019 t been a good couple of weeks for Hillary Clinton . She is being attacked by Republicans over various foreign policy problems , including Benghazi and Boko Haram ; her approval ratings are sliding , Monica Lewinsky spoke out , and Bill Clinton \u2019 s vocal defense could be making things worse .\nAnd now some Democrats are questioning aspects of her strategy .\nMassachusetts Gov . Deval Patrick said he is concerned about the \u201c inevitability \u201d factor with a potential Clinton nomination .\n\u201c I do worry about the inevitability thing , \u201d Patrick said on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union , \u201d adding that it \u2019 s \u201c off-putting to the \u2026 average voter . \u201d\n\u201c I think that was an element of her campaign the last time , \u201d he said , without having to specify how that turned out ( Barack Obama won ) . \u201c I just hope that the people around her pay attention to that this time around . \u201d\nClinton said she was going to take it easy and catch up on her sleep after she stepped down as secretary of state last year , but she took little downtime and immediately turned to writing a book , \u201c Hard Choices , \u201d that is to be released next month . She has also been traveling the country to make paid speeches , stoking speculation that she is strategically plotting a presidential run .\n\u201c I did talk with her and thought it would be better that she not get out there early , because her favorability was so high , that all that could happen in this is go down , \u201d Feinstein said on \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\nCalifornia Gov . Jerry Brown , who is dealing with severe wildfires in his state , said on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week \u201d that while Clinton is the \u201c overwhelming favorite \u201d for the Democrats in 2016 , front-runner status comes with challenges .\n\u201c Being a front-runner is being on a perch that everyone else is going to try to knock you off of , \u201d he said on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week , \u201d adding that Clinton needs to be \u201c wise \u201d on how she proceeds .\nFeinstein , however , is still a fan . She said Republican strategist Karl Rove \u2019 s public speculation that Clinton might have brain damage is \u201c pathetic . \u201d\n\u201c She \u2019 s in the prime of her political life , \u201d Feinstein said .\nOn \u201c Fox News Sunday , \u201d Rove said the Clintons are hypocritical for crying foul .\n\u201c I love President Clinton \u2019 s comments the other day , \u201d Rove said . \u201c Let \u2019 s remember , this is a guy who ran for office savaging Bob Dole . \u201d\n\u201c I love being lectured by Bill Clinton , \u201d Rove said sarcastically .\nBill Clinton didn \u2019 t necessarily lecture Rove , but he did defend his wife last week , saying she is \u201c strong. \u201d But the former president might have made the situation worse for his wife by saying she had a \u201c terrible \u201d concussion that took six months to get over . That is the first time anyone from her team has said it was a six-month recovery .\n\u201c Karl Rove is struggling to be relevant , \u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri shot back on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press , \u201d calling the former Bush adviser \u2019 s super PAC , which spent more than $ 175 million trying to elect Republican Mitt Romney , an \u201c abject failure . \u201d\nMcCaskill - who has had a complicated relationship with Hillary Clinton ever since the 2008 campaign , when she backed Clinton \u2019 s challenger , then-Sen. Barack Obama - called Rove \u2019 s remarks \u201c a cheap political shot . \u201d\nWhile the Rove talking point was a central point of discussion , Republicans on the talk shows didn \u2019 t jump to defend him .\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-Independent , said on CBS News \u2019 \u201c Face the Nation \u201d that Rove \u2019 s remarks were \u201c outrageous and over the pale . \u201d\nOn Fox , former Vice President Dick Cheney - who has had severe health problems , including five heart attacks - didn \u2019 t question Clinton \u2019 s health but said , \u201c Any presidential candidate \u2026 is going to have to answer questions about their health . \u201d\nCheney \u2019 s take was similar to the one by Reince Priebus , head of the Republican National Committee , but neither refused an opportunity to criticize Clinton - which brings us to Benghazi .\nBenghazi : \u201c I think she clearly bears responsibility for whatever the State Department did or didn \u2019 t know about it , \u201d Cheney said about Clinton and the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya . \u201c I do think it \u2019 s a major issue . I don \u2019 t think we \u2019 ve heard the last of it yet . \u201d\nPriebus said Clinton \u2019 s health isn \u2019 t an issue for him , but that she \u201c is trying to sweep Benghazi under the rug . \u201d\nDemocrats , who have dismissed Republicans \u2019 ongoing attempts to find more damaging information on Benghazi , played down the GOP \u2019 s criticisms again .\nMcCaskill again defended Clinton with a huge compliment - perhaps a public attempt at mending their relationship with a slight against Obama : \u201c She has got the strongest resume for president of anyone who had run in a very long time . \u201d\nFeinstein said the special committee on Benghazi launched by House Republicans is \u201c ridiculous . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s a hunting mission for a lynch mob , \u201d she said on \u201c State of the Union. \u201d She pointed to the previous four reports , numerous hearings , and thousand-page document reviews as proof that there is nothing left to uncover .\nBut Republicans know that keeping Benghazi in the spotlight could , at best , peel away at Clinton \u2019 s favorability and , at worst , implicate her for her role . Given that , Priebus was out with a bold prediction : \u201c Given the month she just had , I actually doubt very much whether she actually will run for president in 2016 . \u201d\nOn @ meetthepress @ GOP chair @ Reince says @ HillaryClinton probably wo n't run if she has another month like the last one \u2014 Sean Spicer ( @ seanspicer ) May 18 , 2014\nThe VA : Amid the growing scandal about wait times and care at veterans ' hospitals , President Obama 's chief of staff , Dennis McDonough , said the President is `` madder than hell and I have got the scars to prove it .
