    "content": "Senate Republicans , led by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham , are pushing for a federal ban on abortions after the end of the 20th week of pregnancy.Graham is expected to introduce the bill this upcoming week , reports The Washington Examiner , and the legislation will be a companion bill for the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act , passed in the House earlier this year.The planned legislation , though , will face many challenges , not only from the Democratic-controlled Senate , but from some Republicans like Sen. Mike Lee , Utah , who has concerns about Congress ' authority to regulate commerce as the law 's basis.Back in 2003 , a partial-birth abortion plan based on the Commerce Clause was upheld by the Supreme Court , with Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia emphasising that the `` court 's abortion jurisprudence has no basis in the Constitution . `` Graham is up for re-election in South Carolina next year , so his push on the late-term abortion ban may help him fight challengers in the Republican primary . He holds the lead by 51 percent , according to current surveys , but several conservative groups , including the Senate Conservatives Fund , for one , have in an effort to oust the veteran senator.But Graham has backed pro-life legislation long before this challenging election year . In 1999 , when he was still a member of the House of Representatives , Graham introduced the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.Pro-life groups were quick to commend Graham for his plans to introduce the bill . `` Ten states have already enacted the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act , and it is National Right to Life 's top congressional priority , '' said Carol Tobias , president of National Right to Life , The Christian Post reports . `` We commend Sen. Lindsey Graham for his leadership in bringing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act before the Senate . `` National Right to Life , in a letter to senators encouraging them to pass late-term abortion rules , said that a recent survey by The Polling Company showed that 64 percent of respondents would support a late-term abortion bill , unless the life of the mother is in danger.The legislation still allows abortions after 20 weeks , the group pointed out , if the mother 's life is endangered or in cases of rape or incest reported prior to the abortion to the appropriate authorities.Late abortions are not rare , the NRLC said . At least 140 abortion providers in the united states offer procedures past the 20 week point , using a variety of techniques . `` The American public understands the vital importance of protecting pain-capable unborn children from the violent act of a dismemberment abortion , '' Tobias said .
