On Wednesday afternoon , 18 House Republicans told leadership that they \u201c can not and will not support any funding resolution \u2026 that contains any funding for Planned Parenthood. \u201d Meanwhile , GOP social conservatives like Sens . James Lankford of Oklahoma and Jeff Sessions of Alabama said they \u2019 d consider supporting an effort to attach a spending rider that would eliminate Planned Parenthood \u2019 s $ 528 million in annual government funding to must-pass spending legislation this fall .\nIt \u2019 s a potentially ominous sign for GOP leaders desperate to avoid another shutdown debacle . While Cruz may be radioactive in the Senate GOP conference after calling his leader a liar , his analysis of next week \u2019 s vote has merit : With Democrats vowing to block the measure , Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) won \u2019 t be able to get the 60 votes he needs to advance the bill next week , a result that likely won \u2019 t satisfy a conservative base itching for confrontation over abortion .\nIn a Wednesday interview , Cruz said the GOP should go as hard as it can to block funding for Planned Parenthood , including the same strategy he tried to use to defund Obamacare in 2013 : force the issue by blocking funding in a government spending bill that must pass by Sept. 30 .\nAsked whether he would support such a maneuver again , Cruz replied : \u201c I would support any and all legislative efforts to defund Planned Parenthood . We do not need a legislative show-vote . \u201d\nOn the other side of the Capitol , Rep. Mick Mulvaney ( R-S.C. ) said dozens of House Republicans will back his effort to oppose any spending bill \u2014 whether a continuing resolution stopgap or longer-term funding package \u2014 that includes any money for Planned Parenthood .\n\u201c This is one of those line-in-the-sand type of issues , \u201d Mulvaney said Wednesday . \u201c Every time we say we don \u2019 t want to spend money on something , the answer is it will provoke a shutdown . \u201d\nThis weekend , Senate conservatives had pushed to attach defunding provisions to the must-pass transportation bill , but now they are shifting their sights to this fall \u2019 s government spending bill . Lankford , both a social conservative and an ally of leadership , said he \u2019 d support defunding Planned Parenthood \u201c wherever we can get it , \u201d and Sessions said Republicans \u201c don \u2019 t need to take no for an answer \u201d after Democrats reject the GOP defunding bill next week .\n\u201c Congress doesn \u2019 t have to fund any program it doesn \u2019 t think is justified . How does it get to be that a minority of the Democrats can dictate that a majority party has to fund programs it doesn \u2019 t believe in ? \u201d Sessions added . \u201c We don \u2019 t need to go at it halfheartedly . \u201d\nDemocrats say the GOP efforts will be futile . Republicans lost a 2011 fight to defund Planned Parenthood and a 2013 push to defund Obamacare plunged the government into a shutdown . Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) said a repeat of that show would be \u201c gridlock \u201d \u2014 but other party insiders warned the results could be even more consequential .\n\u201c The immovable object is about to meet the unstoppable force : Republicans can not pass a bill that funds Planned Parenthood and congressional Democrats and President [ Barack ] Obama can not vote for or sign a bill that defunds it , \u201d said a senior Senate Democratic aide .\nBut many Republicans aren \u2019 t willing to go there yet , including the recipient of Cruz \u2019 s \u201c show-vote \u201d diss , Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) , who \u2019 s working with Lankford , Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa and party leaders to set up next week \u2019 s vote to slash Planned Parenthood \u2019 s funding .\n\u201c First things first . We \u2019 re going to try to see if we can win this vote . It \u2019 s a big , big battle and we \u2019 re going to try to see if we can get some Democrats to vote with us on this , \u201d Paul said . \u201c We are going to bring the fight to them . \u201d\nAnother Republican presidential hopeful , Sen.
