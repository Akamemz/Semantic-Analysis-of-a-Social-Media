A thinly sourced right-wing conspiracy theory also holds that it was Ukraine , not Russia , that was behind the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign officials . Mr. Trump asked for investigations of both these things in the July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart .\nThe mainstream media , for its part , puts little credence in these charges , says Dr. Rosenwald .
