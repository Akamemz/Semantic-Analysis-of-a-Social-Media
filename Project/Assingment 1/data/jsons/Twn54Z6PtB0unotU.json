''\nSanders already had a formidable task ahead of him in Arizona , where Clinton won 13 of the state \u2019 s 15 counties in her victory over Barack Obama in 2008 and the state \u2019 s sizable Hispanic population worked to her advantage . Then came losses in all five states that voted this week , and his wife Jane Sanders \u2019 ill-fated visit the day before to conservative Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2019 s `` Tent City '' outdoor jail , an event that went awry when the lightning-rod sheriff unexpectedly joined the senator \u2019 s wife on the tour .\nIn a state where Hispanics make up roughly 30 percent of the population , the Clinton campaign quickly seized on the appearance with Arpaio , one of the nation \u2019 s best-known immigration hardliners .\n`` When Jane Sanders visited Joe Arpaio 's inhumane detention center , the Sanders campaign had a chance to tell Arpaio to his face that he was wrong and that he needed to resign -- as many of us have said for years , '' said Illinois Congressman Luis Gutierrez , a leading immigration rights advocate , in a statement released Tuesday by the Clinton campaign . `` Instead , they heard him out , thanked him for his hospitality and , contrary to their claims , made their criticisms through a press release and a series of tweets .

Sanders has lined up endorsements from more than a dozen prominent Latino Democrats in the state and on Thursday , it released a trio of ads featuring Tucson-based Congressman Raul Grijalva , a leading progressive who represents much of southern Arizona .

Half of the [ early ] white vote that \u2019 s in is over 65 , '' Quinlan said , pointing to that as a positive sign for Clinton . `` Frankly I just think Hillary 's organization is stronger and the fact is I just think she has a built-in Demographic advantage .
