The phrase was the only one heard as often as `` Hurricane Isaac . ''\nThe national party chairman , the speaker of the House , the keynoter and the vice presidential nominee all hit the mark like clockwork . Every major speaker on stage returned to the theme , talking about what they and others had built for themselves and how it was theirs and not the government 's . Even Mitt Romney , in the final speech of the Tampa convention , said President Obama `` had almost no experience working in a business ... jobs to him are about government . ''\nOn the final night , delegates were shown a video of President Obama actually uttering the fateful words `` You did n't build that ... somebody else made that happen '' at a July 13 campaign stop in Roanoke , Va .
