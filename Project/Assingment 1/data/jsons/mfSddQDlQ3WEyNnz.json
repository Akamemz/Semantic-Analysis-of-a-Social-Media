    "content": "Yesterday witnessed an historic moment : The opening of America 's embassy in Jerusalem , the capital of Israel . In the lead-up to the dedication ceremony , Hamas-orchestrated riots led to dozens of deaths along the Gaza-Israel border , with protesters paying a heavy price for ignoring explicit IDF warnings against invading sovereign Israeli territory ( many with malicious intentions ) . On policy , many Trump critics have decried the president 's decision to formally relocate the US embassy as an impediment to peace that derails the possibility of a sustainable two-state solution . In response to this critique , President Obama 's ambassador to Israel from 2011 to 2017 took to Twitter and offered an extended , detailed refutation :\n1 . One hears some strong reactions to the move of the US embassy to Jerusalem : `` It 's the death of peace ! '' `` It marks Israel 's ultimate victory over the Palestinians !

Long a taboo in Israeli & US politics , the ice is beginning to break .

He goes on to write that he wishes Trump 's dramatic move were integrated into a broader strategy of establishing two states and two capitals , and also reiterates Obama-era criticisms of the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank -- but he ultimately concludes that `` the US embassy belongs in Jerusalem , '' celebrating what he calls an `` overdue step . '' He also warns that future Israeli governments will still face `` wrenching choices '' in a future peace deal , but firmly admonishes Palestinians over the ongoing failures of their leadership : `` Palestinian can hold out and refuse to tell hard truths to their own people about the legitimacy of a Jewish state , Israel 's permanence , and the immorality of violence , but their ability to generate pressure on Israel is declining , '' Shapiro writes .
