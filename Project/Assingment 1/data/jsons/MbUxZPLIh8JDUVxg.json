Any constructive proposal to deal with the issue must balance re-establishing the rule of law with safeguarding prosperity and civil liberties . With many political leaders paralyzed by this difficult compromise , xenophobes and bigots gain public attention with simplistic policies\u2014including the recent Arizona law\u2014that are likely to exacerbate the adverse impacts of illegal immigration . Policy makers must recognize the benefits derived from low-skilled immigration while reducing illegal immigration . In making these difficult policy trade-offs , they must , at a minimum , reject those proposals that would make the situation worse .\nAny approach to sensible policies should begin by distinguishing between low-skilled immigration and illegal immigration . The effects of the two differ in important ways .\nProductivity : They increase the productivity of skilled workers and the stock of machines and buildings by carrying out essential tasks , and they further increase the productivity of American workers , including working parents , by freeing up their time . They also enable the productive use of agricultural land that would be unprofitable to exploit in the absence of immigration .\nThey increase the productivity of skilled workers and the stock of machines and buildings by carrying out essential tasks , and they further increase the productivity of American workers , including working parents , by freeing up their time . They also enable the productive use of agricultural land that would be unprofitable to exploit in the absence of immigration .\nServices Costs : They reduce the cost of services , thereby increasing the purchasing power of U.S. consumers .\nThe two most common concerns over low-skilled immigration\u2014that it burdens government finances and decreases native wages\u2014are of limited importance . The impact of low-skilled immigration on the federal budget is small , although some state and local governments do face a greater fiscal burden.1 Similarly , while low-skilled immigration does benefit skilled workers and owners of capital and can hurt low-skilled workers , most studies find that the impact is small , particularly over the long term . Evidence suggests that even the sharp rise in low-skilled immigration over the past 20 years has had a surprisingly small impact on the wages of native , low-skilled workers.2 This is for two principal reasons : low-skilled immigration attracts investment in industries that use low-skilled labor , thus increasing demand for these workers ; 3 and the rising educational levels of the workforce means that few native workers compete directly with low-skilled immigrants.4,5\nIt is possible to have legal low-skilled immigration ; the benefits of low-skilled immigration need not come with the costs of illegal immigration , which are significant .\nThere are perhaps 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States , and the number of undocumented workers is probably more than 8 million . Some 60 percent of illegal immigrants live in six states , where their share of the population is about 6 percent on average , compared to less than 3 percent in the rest of the United States .\nLike low-skilled immigration in general , illegal immigration generates economic benefits for native Americans . However , illegal immigration also imposes significant costs :\nLegal System : Perhaps the most serious cost of illegal immigration concerns the quality of our society rather than economics . Illegal immigrants are often hesitant to cooperate with law enforcement , which increases their own vulnerability and makes it difficult for the police to obtain necessary information . The failure to enforce immigration laws erodes respect for the legal system , encouraging vigilantism and violence against ethnic minorities . The presence of large numbers of people who live outside the law \u2019 s protection and have little long-term stake in the country erodes the social contract and impedes the cooperation required to establish safe and vibrant communities . And some efforts to address illegal immigration threaten the civil liberties that Americans view as their birthright .\nPerhaps the most serious cost of illegal immigration concerns the quality of our society rather than economics .

Moreover , their vulnerable position may cause illegal immigrants to accept lower wages 6 \u2014again , some employers and U.S. households benefit from this .\nUndocumented status can intensify wage competition because some illegal immigrants ( and their employers ) do not pay taxes on wages .

Depending on the take-up of regularization programs , there may be scope for increasing low-skilled immigration .\nEnforce Immigration Policy : Measures to improve the enforcement of immigration laws should avoid exacerbating the social cost of illegal immigration by attempting to arrest individual immigrants , which degrades our civil liberties , increases the vulnerability of immigrant communities , and reduces their willingness to cooperate with the police . Instead , illegal immigration should be reduced by compelling large employers to check documents , as well as imposing significant fines for violations and devising efficient but minimally-obtrusive schemes for policing these efforts .\nArizona \u2019 s recent law\u2014which imposes jail sentences on illegal immigrants ( while entering the United States illegally and harboring illegal immigrants is a federal crime , residing illegally in the United States is generally treated as a civil offense ) and requires that police check immigration documents\u2014will be damaging and counterproductive .\nThough concern over illegal immigration in Arizona is doubtless the result of the high share of illegal immigrants in the state \u2019 s population ( the highest in the United States ) , the new law is unlikely to have much impact on the level of illegal immigration , as many immigrants take much greater risks than police harassment or even jail terms to travel to the United States.10 These measures could , however , substantially reduce immigrants \u2019 willingness to cooperate with the police and subject the native Hispanic population to document checks that would further inflame ethnic tensions . Since about 30 percent of Arizona \u2019 s population is Hispanic , the potential for social conflict is great .\nNevertheless , this law highlights how the failure of federal policy increases the potential for ill-conceived state decisions , perhaps giving impetus to more sensible solutions at the national level .\nThe proposal to reinterpret the fourteenth amendment to exclude children of illegal immigrants from citizenship is another dead end . Refusing to educate or provide health care to children who could become long-term members of American society would be stupid and brutal , as would be deporting children or adults who grew up in the United States to foreign countries that they have never seen . In addition , such measures would have only a limited impact on the level of illegal immigration , since wage differentials are sufficient incentive for migration .\nIllegal immigration is inevitably a difficult and divisive issue , given its distributional implications and the infections of racism and xenophobia . At a minimum , we should reject policies that would make a bad situation worse .\nWilliam Shaw is a visiting scholar in Carnegie \u2019 s International Economics Program .\n1 .
