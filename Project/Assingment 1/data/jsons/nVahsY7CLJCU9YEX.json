    "content": "Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is resigning , President Obama will announce on Monday . Obama appointed Hagel , a former Republican senator , as Defense Secretary in early 2013 . He was expected to serve all four years of Obama 's second term , so this is an early retirement . Hagel has had a rough two years at the Pentagon , but this is also , to some degree , about the Obama administration trying to fix its increasingly broken foreign policy . READ : Why Obama should blame himself , not Chuck Hagel , for Hagel 's failure as Defense Secretary\nHagel had two kinds of failures as Secretary of Defense .\nThe first kind are policy failures , and they 're not insignificant . In Afghanistan , Hagel failed to gain enough ground against the Taliban to force them to accept some kind of peace deal ; instead , the Taliban sees itself as winning outright and is largely ignoring American negotiators . In Egypt , Hagel took the lead in trying to convince defense minister Abdel Fatah el-Sisi not to depose Egypt 's first-ever democratically elected president in a coup ; Hagel failed and the coup went ahead . In Iraq and Syria , Hagel failed to devise a strategy that would prevent the rise of ISIS or that would roll it back . In Ukraine , Hagel has not contributed to the effort to roll back or deter Russia 's still-ongoing invasion . In Hagel 's defense , he is not the lead on Russia and the Afghanistan policy was failing before he took office , but ISIS and Egypt are definitely under his purview .\nThe second set of failures , though , are bureaucratic , and that 's more important than you might think . In some ways , Hagel 's biggest job is to be the Pentagon 's representative to the White House and to Congress , as well as to bring White House-set policy to the Pentagon . Hagel did n't really succeed at either . He was viewed skeptically in the Pentagon as an ineffective representative and manager who failed to advocate on behalf of the vast institution that is the US military . Within the White House discussions that set American foreign policy , he was lax and ineffective , known as not good at steering debate or contributing . The New York Times writes , damningly , `` Hagel has often had problems articulating his thoughts \u2014 or administration policy \u2014 in an effective manner . ''\nThere 's a much deeper issue : Obama 's team is adrift on foreign policy\nTo some extent , though , you ca n't totally blame Hagel : Obama has insisted on setting foreign policy within the White House , which means excluding agencies like the Pentagon and the State Department . That policy has largely failed ( look at the struggling efforts with ISIS and Russia 's Ukraine invasion ) , and now Obama appears to be pinning the failure on Hagel \u2014 which is not going to fix the problem , given that Obama had already neutered Hagel 's ability to set and shape foreign policy .\nWhat 's telling about all of this is that there 's been speculation for a couple of months that , after the midterm elections , the Obama administration would fire some lead foreign policy people to try to fix the problems . But everyone thought he would fire someone who works in the White House , such as National Security Advisor Susan Rice , because Obama has forced all foreign policy-making to happen within the White House . Instead he 's fired someone outside of the White House , which suggests that Obama is going to keep the White House foreign policy team that is actually leading things , and that is more culpable for the failures .",
