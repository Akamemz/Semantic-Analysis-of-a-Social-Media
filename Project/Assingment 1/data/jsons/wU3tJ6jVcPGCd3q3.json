The freshman representative in Congress is feisty , charismatic , and quick on her feet . She is fast to note that the socialism she endorses , which includes universal and free health care , day care , college and housing , with high taxes on the rich to pay for the freebies , is not the bad socialism of Cuba , Venezuela , or North Korea .

Has she been to Europe lately ? The continent is economically comatose , with no growth and poor living standards . Sweden is moving away from its socialist tax and welfare policies , and its open immigration policies , as workers run out of money needed to pay for their failing workers paradise .\nOcasio-Cortez wants a \u201c Green New Deal \u201d in which the federal government dictates , through command and control economics , that America move from 5 percent wind and solar energy to 100 percent wind and solar energy over the next several decades to power our $ 20 trillion economy .

Amazingly , the richest 1 percent of Americans paid 19 percent in the federal income taxes when the top tax rate was 70 percent . They now pay 37 percent in federal income taxes with the top rate closer to 40 percent . As Kennedy put it in 1963 , \u201c Tax rates are too high , and tax revenues are too low , and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now. \u201d He was right . At lower tax rates , revenues exploded because of economic improvement .\nAlso , back in the 1960s and 1970s , almost all nations had 70 percent and 80 percent tax rates , so it was difficult for the wealthy to relocate their money or businesses to lower tax jurisdictions . Now , most nations have tax rates about half of what they were 40 years ago , and some have cut tax rates into the teens . Raise taxes to 70 percent , and with a click of a computer button , trillions of dollars will escape across the our borders and beyond the grasp of the IRS , which will collect 70 percent of zero dollars . That means zero revenues to fund the federal government .\nBut even if we could force the millionaires to surrender up to 70 percent of their income , would it be fair to do so ?
