This is \u201c The Daily . \u201d\nToday , Joe Biden is the first candidate in U.S. history to wage a presidential campaign in quarantine . Alex Burns on the strange new reality of the 2020 race . It \u2019 s Thursday , April 30 . Alex , the last time that we spoke with you , Joe Biden had just become the de facto Democratic nominee . Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race , and the pandemic was just really beginning to wash over the United States . Now , of course , the coronavirus is very much here , so I wonder if you could describe the state of the Biden campaign .\nWell , the state of the Biden campaign is super weird , which is a technical term .\nYou know , since the last time we spoke , Joe Biden has not held one public event in person as a candidate , and his campaign has been really restricted to the telephone and to Zoom and FaceTime , like so much of life for so many Americans . He is campaigning , he likes to say , from his basement , kind of as a joke , but it \u2019 s true that he has a video uplink in a refurbished rec room in his enormous house in Delaware . But he is basically unable to do almost any of the traditional activities of a presumptive candidate . There was no unity rally with his defeated primary opponents , and there are certainly no in-person fundraisers .\nSo what does the virtual element of this campaign actually look like , the part where he \u2019 s on Zoom in his basement with all those books behind him ?\narchived recording ( joe biden ) Look , folks , I want to say good evening , and thank you for taking the time to speak with me .\narchived recording We \u2019 re going to take a question now from Maureen Jenkins . Maureen , you are unmuted . archived recording ( joe biden ) Maureen , are you there ?\nThey have done what they call virtual rope lines , where Biden gets on his video stream and talks to a succession of voters the way he would if he were greeting them at the end of an event .\narchived recording Good evening , Mr. President , and that has such a nice ring to it .\nExcept it didn \u2019 t quite work that way , because on an actual rope line , you talk to a voter for , you know , maybe 10 or 15 seconds , a minute if it \u2019 s a really important conversation .\nHis first virtual rope line , I spoke to one of the voters who was on it . Voters said that it went for more than an hour , right ?\nSo this is not \u2014 yeah , exactly . These became very involved conversations .\narchived recording And will you prohibit animals from being hunted and brought into this country for trophies ? archived recording ( joe biden ) Yes and yes . archived recording Oh , I love you . archived recording ( joe biden ) But look , I want to say something beyond that . One of the things that I \u2014\nRight . The whole point of a rope line , as I \u2019 ve observed them , is that the minute you bump into someone you don \u2019 t want to talk to , you literally just turn your head and you are done with them .\nAnd here , it feels like you would be locked into a Zoom conversation with somebody and it would be hard to get out of it .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) There \u2019 s a lot more to say , but I \u2019 ve already probably said too much to you . archived recording Thank you to everybody for joining . You know , we appreciate this , and we do apologize for the technical difficulties that we had .\nThe campaign has tried other formats . Virtual town halls . He has held virtual endorsement events .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) My friend , Senator Bernie Sanders . Bernie , welcome . archived recording ( bernie sanders ) Joe thank you very much for your remarks , and thank you for welcoming me to your livestream , here .\nThere is definitely a stilted and sometimes artificial quality to these events .\narchived recording ( bernie sanders ) I \u2019 m asking every independent , I \u2019 m asking a lot of Republicans , to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy , which I endorse .\nGetting Bernie Sanders \u2019 s endorsement , you ended up with these two guys pushing 80 on a livestream talking to each other , and there is something about it that \u2014 you know , it doesn \u2019 t have the same kind of emotional kick that a unity rally would , for instance .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) I \u2019 m looking forward to working with you , pal . I really , genuinely mean it from the bottom my heart . Thank you for being such a gentleman . Thank you for being so generous , and I give you my word , I \u2019 ll try my best not to let you all down . archived recording ( bernie sanders ) Thank you very much , Joe . archived recording ( joe biden ) Thanks , pal . archived recording ( bernie sanders ) Say hello to \u2014 archived recording ( joe biden ) I will . archived recording ( bernie sanders ) Jane and I say hello to Jill , as well . archived recording ( joe biden ) I will .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) Well hey , folks , this is Joe Biden , and we \u2019 re listening to \u201c Here \u2019 s the Deal , \u201d and I \u2019 m sitting here in Wilmington , Delaware , in my basement . I \u2019 m excited to bring you our next podcast episode .\n\u2014 where he does these , I think , rather charming interviews with other prominent Democrats \u2014\narchived recording ( joe biden ) On the show with me today is a great friend and a really incredible governor , Governor Jay Inslee . You know , the coronavirus \u2014\n\u2014 where they talk in a fairly unstructured-seeming way about just sort of what \u2019 s on their minds , what their lockdown experience has been .\narchived recording ( jay inslee ) Mr. Vice President , you look like a million bucks . That basement or wherever you are is working pretty well . archived recording ( joe biden ) Well , I tell you what , I \u2019 m living down here . I never thought it \u2019 d turn into a quasi-studio .\nWhat sort of their big policy agendas are and their ideas are .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) What lessons can the American people learn from this pandemic to help ensure we move quickly to address climate change before it \u2019 s too late , or is there a connection ? Are there lessons learned ? archived recording ( jay inslee ) Oh yeah , big connection . You know , you could think of Covid-19 as a metaphor for the \u2014 it \u2019 s kind of a fast-acting climate change .\nAlex , do you have the sense that the virtual components of this campaign that have been cobbled together \u2014 the podcast , the town halls , the rope line \u2014 do you sense that any of these are really breaking through and that the voting public is actually consuming them ?\nYou know , I think they have done some things that have broken through .\narchived recording As you know , the coronavirus has hit Milwaukee particularly hard . What specific steps would you take to address this crisis ? archived recording ( joe biden ) Well , number one , you may recall \u2014\nHe has begun doing local TV hits in swing states , in markets like Milwaukee and Detroit and Pittsburgh .\narchived recording When you think of Pittsburgh , what do you think of ? archived recording ( joe biden ) I spent a lot of time in Pittsburgh , too , as you probably know . As I said , they \u2019 re the people I grew up with . They \u2019 re the middle class , working class folks who bust their neck , you know \u2014\nAnd that is an important way to get in front of people , especially at a time when so many people are staying at home and watching television all day .\narchived recording Good morning , everyone . We \u2019 re coming on the air to bring you live coverage of today \u2019 s White House briefing on the coronavirus pandemic . Here is the president . archived recording ( donald trump ) Thank you very much , everybody . Thank you very much .\nAnd in that sense , it feels like fundamentally not quite an even playing field when you think about his opponent , the incumbent president of the United States . Because incumbency has always carried massive advantages for publicity , right , and commanding the spotlight . But here , we have an incumbent in the middle of a national crisis with daily news briefings .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) While we mourn the tragic loss of life , and you can \u2019 t mourn it any stronger than we \u2019 re mourning it , the United States has produced dramatically better health outcomes than any other country with a possible exception of Germany , and I think we \u2019 re as good , or better .\nAnd on the other side is Joe Biden at home in isolation , trying to get on TV or do an online event .\nRight . You know , Donald Trump is also stuck at home doing video and television appearances from his residence , but his residence is the White House , and he \u2019 s the incumbent president .\nAnd that commands a different level of public attention . And this is something in the course of our reporting on , you know , Biden \u2019 s life in lockdown , is that he has been frustrated with not so much the differential between the attention he gets and the attention Trump gets , but with the criticism he has gotten for being so much less visible than the president . Because I think the view among people close to Biden is , you just can \u2019 t put yourself on an equal footing with the president in a national crisis when you \u2019 re not allowed to leave your house .\nRight . And that frustration , I imagine , reflects a fear that this crisis is just going to make it much harder for Joe Biden to win .\nI think the view in the Biden camp , and I think increasingly the view as well among a lot of senior Republicans , is that the huge differential in media exposure in the president \u2019 s favor is maybe not working so much in the president \u2019 s favor .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) So supposing we hit the body with a tremendous \u2014 whether it \u2019 s ultraviolet or just very powerful light \u2014 and I think you said that hasn \u2019 t been checked , but you \u2019 re going to test it .\nHe is out there , yes , getting tons of eyeballs on him every single day , but his numbers have steadily fallen , not just overall in terms of where he is in the election , but in how the public feels about his handling of the crisis .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) Right . And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute , one minute , and is there a way we can do something like that ?\nA lot of people are looking at him very closely . They don \u2019 t really seem to like what they see . On the other hand , people are paying far less attention to Joe Biden , but let \u2019 s think back on the Joe Biden who we knew during the Democratic primaries , who was not exactly mister crisp , clean , and confident when it came to delivering a public message every single day out on the campaign trail .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids \u2014 wealthy kids , black kids , Asian kids . [ APPLAUSE ] I really mean it , but think how we think about it .\nRight . There were a lot of gaffes . There were a lot of missteps , a lot of misspoken words and thoughts .\narchived recording You \u2019 re selling access to the president just like he is . archived recording ( joe biden ) You \u2019 re a damn liar , man . That \u2019 s not true , and no one has ever said that , no one has proved that . archived recording The hell it ain \u2019 t . I see it on the \u2014\nThis is not a candidate with a really flawless performance as a public campaigner , so there is a trade-off here . And right now , I think on balance , it seems to be working for Biden to be this largely unseen figure who people basically have a favorable impression of . So to have him more offstage at a moment when the president is struggling at least creates the possibility that he continues to gain relative political strength mostly by default .\nSo there is a version of this where Joe Biden meaningfully benefits from being the candidate of isolation .\nYes , and that is the scenario that we are living in right now .\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . So Alex , you have just described what the Biden candidacy looks like in isolation . I want to turn to the broader campaign . What does that start to look like under these very strange circumstances ?\nYou know , I don \u2019 t think anybody knows the answer to that for sure , but I think that what we can say today , with half a year left in this campaign , is that it is going to be a shadow of the kind of presidential campaign that we are used to .\nWe don \u2019 t know whether either of these candidates will ever hold a conventional campaign rally again .\nWe still don \u2019 t know whether either party will hold any semblance of a national convention , and these are restrictions driven by a public health catastrophe with a very , very uncertain trajectory ahead of us .\nIt \u2019 s really hard to imagine presidential campaigns without conventions . We \u2019 ve both attended these conventions , and they are these really important moments in a campaign , right ? I mean , in many ways , a candidate is introduced to the country \u2014 their biography , their story . There are the slickly produced videos , family members come out . You know , elaborate tributes are made , and without those , kind of , when does the general election really even kick off ?\nWell , that \u2019 s the big question . I think right now , if one of the parties is going to forge ahead with a convention , it will clearly be the Republicans . The president has said to be very determined to hold a convention \u2014\n\u2014 in Charlotte , but he is a prisoner to circumstance and public health as much as anybody here . Biden has gone much further in suggesting that it may need to be some kind of virtual convention , and it \u2019 s hard to imagine a virtual convention getting the same kind of attention as the spectacle that you just described .\nAnd if you are deprived of that opportunity , you know , not just to introduce yourself to the country , but to introduce yourself to the country with your running mate , and your ideas , and your general election slogan and message , it is a much , much bigger challenge of political stagecraft to make it really count the way I think both campaigns would really like it to this year .\nWell , so I \u2019 m curious whether we end up having anything resembling a normal convention or not . How are you seeing the pandemic start to influence the kind of visions that both of these candidates are going to be running on in the next few months ?\nI don \u2019 t think that I can recall another presidential campaign where the two parties \u2019 eventual nominees end up having to move so far away from the message that they set out to deliver at the beginning of the campaign .\nLook , President Trump came into this election season expecting to run on four more years of peace and prosperity , and a booming stock market , and economic growth . That is obviously not a viable message at this point . Joe Biden entered the presidential race with , essentially , a message of returning to normalcy , where , \u201c You all remember what the Obama years were like , and we can do , you know , more of that. \u201d That also seems like a pretty defunct message under current conditions .\nRight . Well , what is it starting to mean for those two kind of assumed visions for the campaign ? I mean , what are you seeing Joe Biden do to pivot away from the , \u201c I want to return to normal \u201d because there kind of is no normal anymore , and what are you seeing from President Trump , who wanted to campaign on a record stock market and economic expansion ?\nIt is a huge question mark for both of them even at this point , and I think the eventual answers are going to be heavily driven by the external realities of the campaign . If President Trump winds up in a position next fall to make the case that , you know , you are seeing the green shoots of an economic recovery , then that will be his message . If he doesn \u2019 t have that , I think it \u2019 s really hard to see what kind of positive , forward-looking message he can deliver . What we have seen from his campaign the last few weeks is a combination of attacking congressional Democrats \u2014\narchived recording ( donald trump ) They want to make Trump look as bad as they can , because they want to try and win an election that they shouldn \u2019 t be allowed to win .\n\u2014 for being very liberal and not being cooperative enough with him , and attacking Joe Biden personally .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to who doesn \u2019 t want to do debates because of Covid .\nAnd then , you have seen the president at a number of points revive the red meat issue of immigration as sort of a stimulus to his political base .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) By pausing immigration , we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens . So important .\nI don \u2019 t know that that adds up to a cohesive message about , \u201c Look at all the things I accomplished . Here are all the things I will accomplish for you with the second term. \u201d I think the closest we heard President Trump get to that kind of message was when he said , somewhat off the cuff , in one of his briefings a few weeks back that we built the greatest economy in the world .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) I \u2019 ll do it a second time .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) So I \u2019 m very proud of this country , I have to say . I \u2019 m very proud to be your president , and I \u2019 m very proud of this country . Thank you very much everybody . [ APPLAUSE ]\narchived recording ( joe biden ) You and I , and anybody who gets re-elected or elected in November , is going to face a circumstance nationally and internationally that hasn \u2019 t been seen for a long , long time .\nBiden has increasingly begun to talk about the next presidency not as a return to normalcy kind of event \u2014\narchived recording ( joe biden ) A whole range of things are going to be , I think , as difficult as they were when Franklin Roosevelt got elected .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) I think we have an opportunity to turn , generating a fundamentally green infrastructure , and turning it around in a way that can be the very thing that helps us get through this existential threat to our economy .\nHe has talked about doing much more in terms of investing in economic stimulus , income support , business rescues , infrastructure spending . We just haven \u2019 t seen it all come together in some kind of big , \u201c Joe Biden \u2019 s National Rescue Plan. \u201d This is what the Joe Biden version of a 21st century New Deal would look like . I can \u2019 t tell you that , from my own reporting on the Biden campaign , they are moving in that direction . They are having those conversations , and I think it is generally the view , not just in the Biden camp , but among Democrats more broadly . That the party needs to offer something much bigger than the Joe Biden primary season agenda , an agenda that many Democrats found totally worthy based on the conditions they knew about in February , but that doesn \u2019 t match the severity of the moment today .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) I pray to God this is one of those moments where we move beyond where we were , not just back to where we were .\nAlex , I want to turn now to the state of the race , Trump versus Biden . What exactly are polls telling us at this point , with the enormous caveat that it \u2019 s six months before election day ?\nWell , with that enormous caveat , the picture is quite clear at this point that Biden has an early upper hand over the president .\nIn terms of the head-to-head between the two of them , Biden has an advantage of some size in basically everything that we consider this year a swing state .\nWell , there are the big three from 2016 , the historically Democratic Midwestern states that flipped to Trump \u2019 s column and delivered him the presidency : Pennsylvania , Michigan , Wisconsin . As of today , Republicans feel very pessimistic about Michigan , somewhat less pessimistic but still pretty pessimistic about Pennsylvania , and they see Wisconsin as a real nail biter , a place where Biden probably has a sliver of an advantage , but you know , not a state that has swung back to the Democrats decisively by any means . The shortest path for any Democrat to 270 electoral college votes is winning those three states , and holding the rest of the states that Hillary Clinton won .\nSo at this point , Biden has real electoral advantages , but Alex , doesn \u2019 t a president in charge in the middle of a national crisis almost by definition benefit politically from the spotlight ? From people rallying around the flag , even if he is seen to be screwing up ?\nThe short answer is yes , and we did see that initially with President Trump . Not in a really pronounced way , but at the end of March , the middle of March , he was a couple points higher in the polls than he had been previously .\nThere is a precedent for a president initially getting a political bounce in a national crisis , and then watching it fade rapidly and disastrously for his own re-election as it becomes clearly he has mismanaged the crisis . That \u2019 s Jimmy Carter . It all started with the Iranian hostage crisis , when Iran seized the American embassy , took American hostages . There was a rally around the flag effect for Jimmy Carter as he got kind of that aura of , not exactly a wartime president , but a crisis president . And as the crisis dragged on and on , and as the president seemed more and more impotent to resolve it , it really doomed him politically .\nRight . And Carter would go on to lose to Ronald Reagan , and he would become a one-term president because of that crisis .\nThat \u2019 s right . And that was an election that was really just about one thing , and that was the country \u2019 s perception that the president was weak .\nI think for those of us who are covering this election , we can \u2019 t say today that that is how voters will make up their mind in November . Something could come up that changes the entire framing of the race for either candidate . Take the allegation of sexual assault by a former Biden aide , which he denies , but that could get traction . Progressives in the Democratic Party have already pushed him to address the allegation . He has so far been silent on the matter . But we do have to contemplate the possibility that this election is ultimately just about one thing , and that \u2019 s the pandemic , and what voters think of the president \u2019 s role in marshaling a government response . And if the conditions that exist today exist in the fall , that is a very , very hard campaign for the president to win . And if those conditions change very substantially , then maybe Trump has a chance to run some version of the campaign he was hoping to run in the first place . But all of that is contingent not on the choices the candidates make and not on the tactics and strategy of the campaigns , but on this overwhelming external event that none of them is in a position to control .\n[ LAUGHS ] That \u2019 s a very dark way to put it , but I think that \u2019 s basically true .\nThe Times reports that President Trump has become increasingly frustrated with polling that shows him trailing behind Joe Biden in crucial swing states , and that last week , he berated his campaign manager , Brad Parscale , over the situation . During a phone call , the president insisted that the polling was incorrect , blamed Parscale for his poor standing , and threatened to sue Parscale . It was unclear if the threat was serious . We \u2019 ll be right back . Here \u2019 s what else you need to know today . A large-scale clinical trial sponsored by the U.S. government has shown that treatment with an experimental antiviral drug , remdesivir , can speed recovery from the coronavirus .\narchived recording The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut , significant , positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery . This is really quite important for a number of reasons .\nThe trial found that the recovery time for patients using the drug was 11 days , compared with 15 days for those who did not receive the drug .\narchived recording Although a 31 percent improvement doesn \u2019 t seem like a knockout , hundred percent , it is a very important proof of concept , because what it has proven is that a drug can block this virus .\nAs a result , President Trump said that the drug is likely to receive emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration and become the first federally-approved treatment for Covid-19 .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) We want everything to be safe , but we do \u2014 we would like to see very quick approvals , especially with things that work .",

You know, you could think of Covid-19 as a metaphor for the \u2014 it\u2019s kind of a fast-acting climate change.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, do you have the sense that the virtual components of this campaign that have been cobbled together \u2014 the podcast, the town halls, the rope line \u2014 do you sense that any of these are really breaking through and that the voting public is actually consuming them?\n\nalex burns\n\nYou know, I think they have done some things that have broken through.\n\narchived recording As you know, the coronavirus has hit Milwaukee particularly hard. What specific steps would you take to address this crisis? archived recording (joe biden) Well, number one, you may recall \u2014\n\nalex burns\n\nHe has begun doing local TV hits in swing states, in markets like Milwaukee and Detroit and Pittsburgh.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nInteresting.\n\narchived recording When you think of Pittsburgh, what do you think of? archived recording (joe biden) I spent a lot of time in Pittsburgh, too, as you probably know. As I said, they\u2019re the people I grew up with. They\u2019re the middle class, working class folks who bust their neck, you know \u2014\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd that is an important way to get in front of people, especially at a time when so many people are staying at home and watching television all day.\n\narchived recording Good morning, everyone. We\u2019re coming on the air to bring you live coverage of today\u2019s White House briefing on the coronavirus pandemic. Here is the president. archived recording (donald trump) Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd in that sense, it feels like fundamentally not quite an even playing field when you think about his opponent, the incumbent president of the United States. Because incumbency has always carried massive advantages for publicity, right, and commanding the spotlight. But here, we have an incumbent in the middle of a national crisis with daily news briefings.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) While we mourn the tragic loss of life, and you can\u2019t mourn it any stronger than we\u2019re mourning it, the United States has produced dramatically better health outcomes than any other country with a possible exception of Germany, and I think we\u2019re as good, or better.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd on the other side is Joe Biden at home in isolation, trying to get on TV or do an online event.\n\nalex burns\n\nRight. You know, Donald Trump is also stuck at home doing video and television appearances from his residence, but his residence is the White House, and he\u2019s the incumbent president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd that commands a different level of public attention. And this is something in the course of our reporting on, you know, Biden\u2019s life in lockdown, is that he has been frustrated with not so much the differential between the attention he gets and the attention Trump gets, but with the criticism he has gotten for being so much less visible than the president. Because I think the view among people close to Biden is, you just can\u2019t put yourself on an equal footing with the president in a national crisis when you\u2019re not allowed to leave your house.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And that frustration, I imagine, reflects a fear that this crisis is just going to make it much harder for Joe Biden to win.\n\nalex burns\n\nYou know, I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s exactly right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think the view in the Biden camp, and I think increasingly the view as well among a lot of senior Republicans, is that the huge differential in media exposure in the president\u2019s favor is maybe not working so much in the president\u2019s favor.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) So supposing we hit the body with a tremendous \u2014 whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light \u2014 and I think you said that hasn\u2019t been checked, but you\u2019re going to test it.\n\nalex burns\n\nHe is out there, yes, getting tons of eyeballs on him every single day, but his numbers have steadily fallen, not just overall in terms of where he is in the election, but in how the public feels about his handling of the crisis.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Right. And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute, and is there a way we can do something like that?\n\nalex burns\n\nA lot of people are looking at him very closely. They don\u2019t really seem to like what they see. On the other hand, people are paying far less attention to Joe Biden, but let\u2019s think back on the Joe Biden who we knew during the Democratic primaries, who was not exactly mister crisp, clean, and confident when it came to delivering a public message every single day out on the campaign trail.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids \u2014 wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids. [APPLAUSE] I really mean it, but think how we think about it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. There were a lot of gaffes. There were a lot of missteps, a lot of misspoken words and thoughts.\n\nalex burns\n\nRight. There were arguments with voters.\n\narchived recording You\u2019re selling access to the president just like he is. archived recording (joe biden) You\u2019re a damn liar, man. That\u2019s not true, and no one has ever said that, no one has proved that. archived recording The hell it ain\u2019t. I see it on the \u2014\n\nalex burns\n\nThis is not a candidate with a really flawless performance as a public campaigner, so there is a trade-off here. And right now, I think on balance, it seems to be working for Biden to be this largely unseen figure who people basically have a favorable impression of. So to have him more offstage at a moment when the president is struggling at least creates the possibility that he continues to gain relative political strength mostly by default.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo there is a version of this where Joe Biden meaningfully benefits from being the candidate of isolation.\n\nalex burns\n\nYes, and that is the scenario that we are living in right now.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Alex, you have just described what the Biden candidacy looks like in isolation. I want to turn to the broader campaign. What does that start to look like under these very strange circumstances?\n\nalex burns\n\nYou know, I don\u2019t think anybody knows the answer to that for sure, but I think that what we can say today, with half a year left in this campaign, is that it is going to be a shadow of the kind of presidential campaign that we are used to.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nalex burns\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether either of these candidates will ever hold a conventional campaign rally again.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nalex burns\n\nWe still don\u2019t know whether either party will hold any semblance of a national convention, and these are restrictions driven by a public health catastrophe with a very, very uncertain trajectory ahead of us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to imagine presidential campaigns without conventions. We\u2019ve both attended these conventions, and they are these really important moments in a campaign, right? I mean, in many ways, a candidate is introduced to the country \u2014 their biography, their story. There are the slickly produced videos, family members come out. You know, elaborate tributes are made, and without those, kind of, when does the general election really even kick off?\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, that\u2019s the big question. I think right now, if one of the parties is going to forge ahead with a convention, it will clearly be the Republicans. The president has said to be very determined to hold a convention \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nInteresting.\n\nalex burns\n\n\u2014 in Charlotte, but he is a prisoner to circumstance and public health as much as anybody here. Biden has gone much further in suggesting that it may need to be some kind of virtual convention, and it\u2019s hard to imagine a virtual convention getting the same kind of attention as the spectacle that you just described.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd if you are deprived of that opportunity, you know, not just to introduce yourself to the country, but to introduce yourself to the country with your running mate, and your ideas, and your general election slogan and message, it is a much, much bigger challenge of political stagecraft to make it really count the way I think both campaigns would really like it to this year.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, so I\u2019m curious whether we end up having anything resembling a normal convention or not. How are you seeing the pandemic start to influence the kind of visions that both of these candidates are going to be running on in the next few months?\n\nalex burns\n\nI don\u2019t think that I can recall another presidential campaign where the two parties\u2019 eventual nominees end up having to move so far away from the message that they set out to deliver at the beginning of the campaign.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nalex burns\n\nLook, President Trump came into this election season expecting to run on four more years of peace and prosperity, and a booming stock market, and economic growth. That is obviously not a viable message at this point. Joe Biden entered the presidential race with, essentially, a message of returning to normalcy, where, \u201cYou all remember what the Obama years were like, and we can do, you know, more of that.\u201d That also seems like a pretty defunct message under current conditions.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. Well, what is it starting to mean for those two kind of assumed visions for the campaign? I mean, what are you seeing Joe Biden do to pivot away from the, \u201cI want to return to normal\u201d because there kind of is no normal anymore, and what are you seeing from President Trump, who wanted to campaign on a record stock market and economic expansion?\n\nalex burns\n\nIt is a huge question mark for both of them even at this point, and I think the eventual answers are going to be heavily driven by the external realities of the campaign. If President Trump winds up in a position next fall to make the case that, you know, you are seeing the green shoots of an economic recovery, then that will be his message. If he doesn\u2019t have that, I think it\u2019s really hard to see what kind of positive, forward-looking message he can deliver. What we have seen from his campaign the last few weeks is a combination of attacking congressional Democrats \u2014\n\narchived recording (donald trump) They want to make Trump look as bad as they can, because they want to try and win an election that they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to win.\n\nalex burns\n\n\u2014 for being very liberal and not being cooperative enough with him, and attacking Joe Biden personally.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to who doesn\u2019t want to do debates because of Covid.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd then, you have seen the president at a number of points revive the red meat issue of immigration as sort of a stimulus to his political base.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) By pausing immigration, we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens. So important.\n\nalex burns\n\nI don\u2019t know that that adds up to a cohesive message about, \u201cLook at all the things I accomplished. Here are all the things I will accomplish for you with the second term.\u201d I think the closest we heard President Trump get to that kind of message was when he said, somewhat off the cuff, in one of his briefings a few weeks back that we built the greatest economy in the world.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) I\u2019ll do it a second time.\n\nalex burns\n\nWe\u2019ll do it again.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) So I\u2019m very proud of this country, I have to say. I\u2019m very proud to be your president, and I\u2019m very proud of this country. Thank you very much everybody. [APPLAUSE]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So that\u2019s Trump. What about Biden?\n\narchived recording (joe biden) You and I, and anybody who gets re-elected or elected in November, is going to face a circumstance nationally and internationally that hasn\u2019t been seen for a long, long time.\n\nalex burns\n\nBiden has increasingly begun to talk about the next presidency not as a return to normalcy kind of event \u2014\n\narchived recording (joe biden) A whole range of things are going to be, I think, as difficult as they were when Franklin Roosevelt got elected.\n\nalex burns\n\n\u2014 but as really a national emergency presidency.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) I think we have an opportunity to turn, generating a fundamentally green infrastructure, and turning it around in a way that can be the very thing that helps us get through this existential threat to our economy.\n\nalex burns\n\nHe has talked about doing much more in terms of investing in economic stimulus, income support, business rescues, infrastructure spending. We just haven\u2019t seen it all come together in some kind of big, \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s National Rescue Plan.\u201d This is what the Joe Biden version of a 21st century New Deal would look like. I can\u2019t tell you that, from my own reporting on the Biden campaign, they are moving in that direction. They are having those conversations, and I think it is generally the view, not just in the Biden camp, but among Democrats more broadly. That the party needs to offer something much bigger than the Joe Biden primary season agenda, an agenda that many Democrats found totally worthy based on the conditions they knew about in February, but that doesn\u2019t match the severity of the moment today.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) I pray to God this is one of those moments where we move beyond where we were, not just back to where we were.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, I want to turn now to the state of the race, Trump versus Biden. What exactly are polls telling us at this point, with the enormous caveat that it\u2019s six months before election day?\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, with that enormous caveat, the picture is quite clear at this point that Biden has an early upper hand over the president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nalex burns\n\nIn terms of the head-to-head between the two of them, Biden has an advantage of some size in basically everything that we consider this year a swing state.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you mention swing states, which ones?\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, there are the big three from 2016, the historically Democratic Midwestern states that flipped to Trump\u2019s column and delivered him the presidency: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. As of today, Republicans feel very pessimistic about Michigan, somewhat less pessimistic but still pretty pessimistic about Pennsylvania, and they see Wisconsin as a real nail biter, a place where Biden probably has a sliver of an advantage, but you know, not a state that has swung back to the Democrats decisively by any means. The shortest path for any Democrat to 270 electoral college votes is winning those three states, and holding the rest of the states that Hillary Clinton won.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo at this point, Biden has real electoral advantages, but Alex, doesn\u2019t a president in charge in the middle of a national crisis almost by definition benefit politically from the spotlight? From people rallying around the flag, even if he is seen to be screwing up?\n\nalex burns\n\nThe short answer is yes, and we did see that initially with President Trump. Not in a really pronounced way, but at the end of March, the middle of March, he was a couple points higher in the polls than he had been previously.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nalex burns\n\nThere is a precedent for a president initially getting a political bounce in a national crisis, and then watching it fade rapidly and disastrously for his own re-election as it becomes clearly he has mismanaged the crisis. That\u2019s Jimmy Carter. It all started with the Iranian hostage crisis, when Iran seized the American embassy, took American hostages. There was a rally around the flag effect for Jimmy Carter as he got kind of that aura of, not exactly a wartime president, but a crisis president. And as the crisis dragged on and on, and as the president seemed more and more impotent to resolve it, it really doomed him politically.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And Carter would go on to lose to Ronald Reagan, and he would become a one-term president because of that crisis.\n\nalex burns\n\nThat\u2019s right. And that was an election that was really just about one thing, and that was the country\u2019s perception that the president was weak.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think for those of us who are covering this election, we can\u2019t say today that that is how voters will make up their mind in November. Something could come up that changes the entire framing of the race for either candidate. Take the allegation of sexual assault by a former Biden aide, which he denies, but that could get traction. Progressives in the Democratic Party have already pushed him to address the allegation. He has so far been silent on the matter. But we do have to contemplate the possibility that this election is ultimately just about one thing, and that\u2019s the pandemic, and what voters think of the president\u2019s role in marshaling a government response. And if the conditions that exist today exist in the fall, that is a very, very hard campaign for the president to win. And if those conditions change very substantially, then maybe Trump has a chance to run some version of the campaign he was hoping to run in the first place. But all of that is contingent not on the choices the candidates make and not on the tactics and strategy of the campaigns, but on this overwhelming external event that none of them is in a position to control.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn other words, it becomes up to the virus.\n\nalex burns\n\n[LAUGHS] That\u2019s a very dark way to put it, but I think that\u2019s basically true.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Alex, thank you very much.\n\nalex burns\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe Times reports that President Trump has become increasingly frustrated with polling that shows him trailing behind Joe Biden in crucial swing states, and that last week, he berated his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, over the situation. During a phone call, the president insisted that the polling was incorrect, blamed Parscale for his poor standing, and threatened to sue Parscale. It was unclear if the threat was serious. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. A large-scale clinical trial sponsored by the U.S. government has shown that treatment with an experimental antiviral drug, remdesivir, can speed recovery from the coronavirus.\n\narchived recording The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery. This is really quite important for a number of reasons.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe trial found that the recovery time for patients using the drug was 11 days, compared with 15 days for those who did not receive the drug.\n\narchived recording Although a 31 percent improvement doesn\u2019t seem like a knockout, hundred percent, it is a very important proof of concept, because what it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAs a result, President Trump said that the drug is likely to receive emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration and become the first federally-approved treatment for Covid-19.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) We want everything to be safe, but we do \u2014 we would like to see very quick approvals, especially with things that work.\n\nmichael barbaro",
