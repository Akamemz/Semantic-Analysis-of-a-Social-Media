Such hearings can take years , analysts say . In the meantime , the children and parents are safe in the US .\nThe paradox here is that the lies told by the smugglers appear to have come true , at least for some migrants .\n\u201c What the smugglers will do is say , you pay me $ 5,000 and I \u2019 ll take your kid to the border , \u201d says Jason De Leon , a University of Michigan anthropology professor studying Central American smugglers . \u201c They \u2019 ll go into detention and then they \u2019 ll get released to a family member \u2013 which oftentimes is actually what happens . \u201d\nThe legs of Carolina \u2019 s pants below the knees are still damp from her watery arrival in the US .

The fear and apprehension on their faces begins to melt away . Elena even manages a brief , slight smile .\nCarolina is asked what she and her daughter were thinking upon arriving in the US . \u201c We knew that they would not kill us , \u201d she says , referring to the Border Patrol agents . \u201c The United States has always been supportive and protective of rights . \u201d\nElena says they paid $ 9,000 to a smuggler who abandoned them in Mexico . They paid a second smuggler $ 4,500 . \u201c It was our life savings , \u201d she says . \u201c We sold our house and everything . \u201d\nFor Carolina , the trip to the US has a double objective . She says it is aimed at improving her daughter \u2019 s life and saving Julianni \u2019 s .\nThe criminal gangs in El Salvador begin recruiting at age 10 or 12 , she says . But they had already started demanding money .\nCarolina , Elena , and Julianni weren \u2019 t the only new arrivals in the Rio Grande Valley that morning . About three hundred yards away and around a corner , other Border Patrol agents were busy with a different group of 23 , also from El Salvador .\nOscar , 30 , stands in the shade with his 7-year-old son , Daniel . He says he paid the smugglers $ 4,000 for him and $ 1,000 for his son . They \u2019 d been on the road 28 days .\nAsked why he came to the US , Oscar says simply : \u201c The future of my child . \u201d\nWarren Richey/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Danel ( left ) and Oscar crossed the US border near McAllen , Texas , with a group of 23 unauthorized immigrants from El Salvador .\nThe trip was necessary , he says , because a criminal gang had killed his two brothers . Afterward , gang members came to him and demanded $ 5,000 , he says .\nInstead of paying the gang , he decided to pay smugglers . \u201c The risk is much higher to stay there than to come here , \u201d he says .\nAnd your wife , he is asked . Where is she ? He does not answer . He is unable to speak the words . His eyes have filled with tears .\n\u201c I will work here as much as I can , \u201d Oscar says , \u201c and send money back [ to her ] . \u201d\nWhat happens next for the newly arrived has become an established routine .\nAfter turning themselves in , the unauthorized migrants are interviewed by Border Patrol agents who must verify their identities . They check to make sure she or he isn \u2019 t on a terror watch list or have a criminal record . Then they are interviewed by other federal agents . When that review is complete , most are given a notice to appear before an immigration judge . It is in that hearing that they must prove why they should not be deported .\nMost unauthorized migrants from Central America are seeking refugee status .\nMr. Cabrera says Border Patrol agents recognize a familiar pattern among new arrivals from Central America . He says they appear to have been coached on how to make a claim for asylum . To do so , they must demonstrate they have a credible fear of persecution or severe mistreatment if returned to their home country .\n\u201c They \u2019 ll tell you three or four times their story and all their stories are cookie-cutter stories , \u201d he says . \u201c I \u2019 m sure there are quite a few bona fide asylum cases , but when you hear the same story 100 times a day word-for-word exactly the same way , you start to doubt it after a while . \u201d\nCabrera says the smugglers and their clients are exploiting a loophole in US immigration policy . He calls it a new version of \u201c catch and release . \u201d\n\u201c If someone comes in and claims a credible fear , we give them [ a notice to appear in immigration court ] , and now they are free to move about the country for an indefinite period of time until their case can be adjudicated , \u201d he says .\nThe agent says that years ago it took six months to convene that hearing . Now it can take years because of a shortage of immigration judges and a growing backlog of immigration cases \u2013 even when Central American cases are supposed to be expedited .\nIn the meantime , the migrant is living and working in the US . In effect , the so-called unauthorized immigrant is nonetheless authorized to remain in the country \u2013 pending her deportation .\nSome walk through that open door with no intention of ever showing up for their court hearing or complying with a removal order , analysts say . Given the government \u2019 s priority of focusing on noncitizen criminals for deportation , they are unlikely to face serious consequences for gaming the immigration system in this way provided they are not convicted of committing a serious crime , these analysts say .\n\u201c The single biggest factor driving our illegal immigration right now is our catch and release program , \u201d Brandon Judd , president of the National Border Patrol Council , told a Senate panel in May .\nHe said once a notice to appear for an immigration hearing is issued to an individual , other legal constraints fall away . \u201c If you are an unaccompanied minor we will not only release you , but will escort you to your final destination , \u201d he said .\n\u201c If you are a family unit , we will release you . If you claim credible fear , we will release you , \u201d he added .\nIt is not merely a policy preference . Under a longstanding federal court order , this release process must be expedited when migrant children are involved .\nThe government is not without tools to force compliance with immigration laws . In some cases , officials are requiring unauthorized migrants to wear a tracking device on their ankle to guarantee court appearances and , if necessary , departure from the country .\nNonetheless , critics say inconsistent US policies are sustaining a lucrative black market in the smuggling of children .\nIt is the policy of the US government to help a child who arrives alone at the border to reunite with a parent in the US , even if that parent does not have legal authorization to live or work in the US .\nThis creates a strong incentive for unauthorized migrants in the US to pay smugglers to bring their children across the border illegally , often at great risk to the children . Once the child surrenders to the Border Patrol , the US government helps facilitate the reunion with the parent .\n\u201c So for the smugglers all they have to do is drop someone off \u201d on the US side of the border , says Professor De Leon .\nIt is a money-making machine for Central American smugglers and the Mexican cartels that control the south side of the US-Mexico border , officials say .\nIt is also an effective way for the cartels to divert Border Patrol resources that might otherwise be in position to intercept illicit narcotics , human trafficking victims , or other unauthorized migrants with criminal records who are still being smuggled into the US , these officials say .\nNonetheless , the US government itself is helping to complete the final stage of child-smuggling operations run by criminals in Central America and Mexico . It is an illicit smuggling operation in which parents themselves are also complicit .\n\u201c How could any parent put their child to that risk , \u201d Cabrera asks . \u201c It would have to be pretty dire circumstances at home for me to risk my child \u2019 s life . And if I thought such a trip was necessary you can bet I am going with them , \u201d he says . \u201c I am not going to leave them in the care of a stranger . \u201d\n\u201c You can \u2019 t leave kids in a car alone for 20 minutes in a Wal-Mart parking lot , and yet we are having parents put their kids on top of a train and travel through three countries to get here and then [ the US government ] is reuniting them with their parents , \u201d he adds .\nCabrera says a US citizen who engaged in similar conduct would lose his or her parental rights . \u201c But here we are giving the child back to that parent who put them in that situation , \u201d he says .\n\u201c Are there dire circumstances [ in Central America ] ? Yes , but still you can \u2019 t make that child go it alone , \u201d he says . \u201c It is just inconceivable . \u201d\nIn April , a 2-year-old girl was deposited on the north bank of the Rio Grande by a smuggler . He had used a Sharpie to write the girl \u2019 s name , her mother \u2019 s name , and the mother \u2019 s US-based telephone number on the girl \u2019 s white T-shirt .\n\u201c We have seen kids 2- and 3-years-old , who are by themselves , \u201d says Cabrera . \u201c When you see an 11-year-old or a 6-year-old by themselves , it is scary . But to have a 2-year-old abandoned alone on the riverbank is just insane . \u201d\nBorder Patrol agents have a responsibility as law enforcement officers to uphold the law . But most of them are parents , too .\n\u201c I remember a little girl in downtown Nogales [ Arizona ] , she was maybe 10 years old , \u201d says Border Patrol Agent Felipe Jimenez .\n\u201c She was walking up the street towards me . She had a little backpack and I thought she was getting ready to go to school , \u201d he says .\n\u201c She knocks on the side window [ of the Border Patrol truck ] . I rolled down the window . She asked , \u2018 Can you help me ? I \u2019 m trying to find my mom . \u2019 \u201d\nThe agent says he started to reach for his cellphone to call the Nogales Police Department . But then the girl added : \u201c I think she \u2019 s in the Carolinas . \u201d\n\u201c I said , \u2018 Hold on , you think she \u2019 s in the Carolinas ? \u2019\n\u201c Then I asked her , \u2018 Did you just come across the border illegally ? \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c She said , \u2018 Yeah. \u2019 The girl pointed to a spot down the street in the shadow of the 20-foot rust-colored fence that divides the US side of Nogales from the Mexican side . \u2018 I spent the night over there in that ditch . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c I had to actually break away from the situation for a little bit , \u201d to collect his emotions , Agent Jimenez says . The agent \u2019 s daughter was about the same age at the time .\nJimenez said he was wondering how she did it , how she could make it all the way from Honduras to Arizona . That \u2019 s when she pulled a Bible out of her backpack .\n\u201c Jesus protected me , that \u2019 s what she told me , \u201d Jimenez said . \u201c She was 10 , and it broke my heart . \u201d\nUS Border Patrol A 2-year-old girl was dropped on the American side of the Rio Grande in this T-shirt , which stated her name , her mother 's name , and her mother 's phone number in the US . ( The personal information has been blurred out for the photo . )\nSuch stories are hardly unusual . Ms. Molina tells of a 19-year-old Honduran woman who crossed the desert in Arizona two years ago in the middle of the summer with her newborn son in her arms .\n\u201c I asked her why would she take such a huge risk with her infant son , \u201d Molina says .\nThe woman told Molina that when she was late in her pregnancy , criminal gang members killed her husband and threatened that the moment she gave birth they would return , kill the child , and force her into sex industry work . \u201c They wanted to make her a sex slave within the cartel , \u201d Molina says .\nDesperate , the woman formed an escape plan . \u201c Every day after she gave birth she got up and started walking around and walking around , \u201d Molina says , describing a makeshift training regimen . \u201c About three days after giving birth she felt she was strong enough to make the journey. \u201d And she did .\nThe young mother told Molina : \u201c I would rather die trying to live than to just sit there [ in Honduras ] and wait for a horrible fate . \u201d\nThere are two kinds of smuggling operations involving parents and children from Central America .\nOne facilitates a mother or father traveling with their own child .\nIn the second , parents already living or working in the US without legal authorization are paying smugglers to transport their child away from that dangerous region and across the US-Mexico border . These children are traveling unaccompanied .\nAs director of Catholic Charities in the Rio Grande Valley , Sister Norma Pimentel rejects the suggestion that parents are wrong to put their lives and the lives of their children in the hands of smugglers .\nShe recalls the biblical story of Moses and what his mother did to save his life , placing him in a floating basket and trusting that the river would carry him to safety .\n\u201c I think parents [ in Central America ] are having no other option than saying this is a death sentence if they stay here . I can only have compassion for a mother or a father who finds themselves with no other option but to send the child into the unknown and danger , and to not know whether he or she will be alive . \u201d\nShe says that people who doubt this truth should travel to the Rio Grande Valley and witness what is happening .\n\u201c They need to see for themselves that mother , that child , that face , and tell them that they wouldn \u2019 t help them , \u201d she says .\nIn the summer of 2014 , with thousands of Central American children and families arriving in the US , the Border Patrol was overwhelmed trying to process them all . Some families released into the community were overwhelmed , too .\nWhat they needed was a safe place where they could rest and have a nutritious meal before starting the next phase of their journey .\nSeeing that need , Sister Norma \u201c borrowed \u201d the parish hall adjacent to the Sacred Heart Catholic Church and opened the Immigrant Relief and Welcome Center . It is two blocks from the bus station in downtown McAllen .\nShe put out an invitation on social media to the community for all those who wanted to help . The response was overwhelming .\n\u201c Everybody , every denomination , doctors , nurses , students , families , the county government , even the Border Patrol , thought let \u2019 s be part of this response , \u201d she says .\nThe effort was positive and unifying across the community because it focused on helping individuals in need . \u201c We are all about helping that family , that child , that mother \u2013 it is a human response to a human crisis , \u201d Sister Norma says .\nThe families arrive at the center after being released from Border Patrol processing . They have been given a date to appear in immigration court . In addition , they \u2019 ve had time to contact a family member or friend in the US to send money to pay for a bus ticket .\nThey are permitted to spend one night at the immigrant relief center while waiting for their bus . The center serves sandwiches and the Salvation Army provides soup every day . They are also provided sandwiches for their bus trip .\nWarren Richey/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 The shelves of the Immigrant Relief and Welcome Center in McAllen , Texas , hold items donated from members of the community .\nThe relief center is jammed with tables overflowing with donated clothing sorted by size for children and adults , shoes , baby supplies , and other essentials . Two large , air conditioned tents have been set up outside in the parking lot . Each contains 30 cots . One tent is for men and one for women .\nVolunteers at the center say that more than 100 family members pass through the center on an average day . On the day in mid-September when a news reporter visited , the count was 170 .\nIn the past two years , Sister Norma estimates that the Immigrant Relief and Welcome Center has helped 45,000 individuals .\nAmong them is Jose , a 40-year-old baker from El Salvador , who made the month-long trip to the US with his 16-year-old daughter . They crossed much of Mexico inside the refrigerated trailer of an 18-wheeler . That part of the trip was very difficult , he says . \u201c It was cold . \u201d\nAfter six days in a Border Patrol detention facility , they were dropped off at the immigrant relief center and had tickets for a midnight bus to Oakland , Calif. , where Jose \u2019 s brother lives . The brother sent money for bus fare .\nHis plan is to work in Oakland and eventually raise enough money to return to El Salvador to bring the rest of his family \u2013 a wife and a daughter , 14 , and son , 12 \u2013 to the US . \u201c We are not members of a gang , we just want a better life , \u201d he says .\nAlso part of the plan ; his eldest daughter will attend high school in the US \u2013 and , hopefully , college . \u201c She would be the first . \u201d\nWarren Richey/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Jose made the monthlong journey to the US from El Salvador with his 16-year-old daughter . He now has to work off $ 7,000 in debt .\nJose had to borrow the $ 7,000 to pay the smuggler . It is an enormous amount of money in El Salvador , and before anything else , he has to pay back that loan or it will fall to his wife and children .\nFor Jose it is not just getting to America , it is being able to stay in America long enough to work and pay off that debt .\nBefore being released to travel to Oakland , Jose was instructed that he and his daughter must appear at a future hearing before a US immigration judge to determine if they can remain in the US or be removed immediately to El Salvador .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

His eyes have filled with tears.\n\n\u201cShe stayed behind,\u201d he finally says.\n\n\u201cI will work here as much as I can,\u201d Oscar says, \u201cand send money back [to her].\u201d\n\nWhat happens next for the newly arrived has become an established routine.\n\nAfter turning themselves in, the unauthorized migrants are interviewed by Border Patrol agents who must verify their identities. They check to make sure she or he isn\u2019t on a terror watch list or have a criminal record. Then they are interviewed by other federal agents. When that review is complete, most are given a notice to appear before an immigration judge. It is in that hearing that they must prove why they should not be deported.\n\nMost unauthorized migrants from Central America are seeking refugee status.\n\nMr. Cabrera says Border Patrol agents recognize a familiar pattern among new arrivals from Central America. He says they appear to have been coached on how to make a claim for asylum. To do so, they must demonstrate they have a credible fear of persecution or severe mistreatment if returned to their home country.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll tell you three or four times their story and all their stories are cookie-cutter stories,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are quite a few bona fide asylum cases, but when you hear the same story 100 times a day word-for-word exactly the same way, you start to doubt it after a while.\u201d\n\nCabrera says the smugglers and their clients are exploiting a loophole in US immigration policy. He calls it a new version of \u201ccatch and release.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone comes in and claims a credible fear, we give them [a notice to appear in immigration court], and now they are free to move about the country for an indefinite period of time until their case can be adjudicated,\u201d he says.\n\nThe agent says that years ago it took six months to convene that hearing. Now it can take years because of a shortage of immigration judges and a growing backlog of immigration cases \u2013 even when Central American cases are supposed to be expedited.\n\nIn the meantime, the migrant is living and working in the US. In effect, the so-called unauthorized immigrant is nonetheless authorized to remain in the country \u2013 pending her deportation.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSome walk through that open door with no intention of ever showing up for their court hearing or complying with a removal order, analysts say. Given the government\u2019s priority of focusing on noncitizen criminals for deportation, they are unlikely to face serious consequences for gaming the immigration system in this way provided they are not convicted of committing a serious crime, these analysts say.\n\n\u201cThe single biggest factor driving our illegal immigration right now is our catch and release program,\u201d Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, told a Senate panel in May.\n\nHe said once a notice to appear for an immigration hearing is issued to an individual, other legal constraints fall away. \u201cIf you are an unaccompanied minor we will not only release you, but will escort you to your final destination,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you are a family unit, we will release you. If you claim credible fear, we will release you,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is not merely a policy preference. Under a longstanding federal court order, this release process must be expedited when migrant children are involved.\n\nThe government is not without tools to force compliance with immigration laws. In some cases, officials are requiring unauthorized migrants to wear a tracking device on their ankle to guarantee court appearances and, if necessary, departure from the country.\n\nNonetheless, critics say inconsistent US policies are sustaining a lucrative black market in the smuggling of children.\n\nIt is the policy of the US government to help a child who arrives alone at the border to reunite with a parent in the US, even if that parent does not have legal authorization to live or work in the US.\n\nThis creates a strong incentive for unauthorized migrants in the US to pay smugglers to bring their children across the border illegally, often at great risk to the children. Once the child surrenders to the Border Patrol, the US government helps facilitate the reunion with the parent.\n\n\u201cSo for the smugglers all they have to do is drop someone off\u201d on the US side of the border, says Professor De Leon.\n\nIt is a money-making machine for Central American smugglers and the Mexican cartels that control the south side of the US-Mexico border, officials say.\n\nIt is also an effective way for the cartels to divert Border Patrol resources that might otherwise be in position to intercept illicit narcotics, human trafficking victims, or other unauthorized migrants with criminal records who are still being smuggled into the US, these officials say.\n\nNonetheless, the US government itself is helping to complete the final stage of child-smuggling operations run by criminals in Central America and Mexico. It is an illicit smuggling operation in which parents themselves are also complicit.\n\n\u201cHow could any parent put their child to that risk,\u201d Cabrera asks. \u201cIt would have to be pretty dire circumstances at home for me to risk my child\u2019s life. And if I thought such a trip was necessary you can bet I am going with them,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not going to leave them in the care of a stranger.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leave kids in a car alone for 20 minutes in a Wal-Mart parking lot, and yet we are having parents put their kids on top of a train and travel through three countries to get here and then [the US government] is reuniting them with their parents,\u201d he adds.\n\nCabrera says a US citizen who engaged in similar conduct would lose his or her parental rights. \u201cBut here we are giving the child back to that parent who put them in that situation,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAre there dire circumstances [in Central America]? Yes, but still you can\u2019t make that child go it alone,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is just inconceivable.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIn April, a 2-year-old girl was deposited on the north bank of the Rio Grande by a smuggler. He had used a Sharpie to write the girl\u2019s name, her mother\u2019s name, and the mother\u2019s US-based telephone number on the girl\u2019s white T-shirt.\n\n\u201cWe have seen kids 2- and 3-years-old, who are by themselves,\u201d says Cabrera. \u201cWhen you see an 11-year-old or a 6-year-old by themselves, it is scary. But to have a 2-year-old abandoned alone on the riverbank is just insane.\u201d\n\nBorder Patrol agents have a responsibility as law enforcement officers to uphold the law. But most of them are parents, too.\n\n\u201cI remember a little girl in downtown Nogales [Arizona], she was maybe 10 years old,\u201d says Border Patrol Agent Felipe Jimenez.\n\n\u201cShe was walking up the street towards me. She had a little backpack and I thought she was getting ready to go to school,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cShe knocks on the side window [of the Border Patrol truck]. I rolled down the window. She asked, \u2018Can you help me? I\u2019m trying to find my mom.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe agent says he started to reach for his cellphone to call the Nogales Police Department. But then the girl added: \u201cI think she\u2019s in the Carolinas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Hold on, you think she\u2019s in the Carolinas?\u2019\n\n\u201cThen I asked her, \u2018Did you just come across the border illegally?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 The girl pointed to a spot down the street in the shadow of the 20-foot rust-colored fence that divides the US side of Nogales from the Mexican side. \u2018I spent the night over there in that ditch.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI had to actually break away from the situation for a little bit,\u201d to collect his emotions, Agent Jimenez says. The agent\u2019s daughter was about the same age at the time.\n\n\u201cI would have adopted her in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nJimenez said he was wondering how she did it, how she could make it all the way from Honduras to Arizona. That\u2019s when she pulled a Bible out of her backpack.\n\n\u201cJesus protected me, that\u2019s what she told me,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cShe was 10, and it broke my heart.\u201d\n\nUS Border Patrol A 2-year-old girl was dropped on the American side of the Rio Grande in this T-shirt, which stated her name, her mother's name, and her mother's phone number in the US. (The personal information has been blurred out for the photo.)\n\nSuch stories are hardly unusual. Ms. Molina tells of a 19-year-old Honduran woman who crossed the desert in Arizona two years ago in the middle of the summer with her newborn son in her arms.\n\n\u201cI asked her why would she take such a huge risk with her infant son,\u201d Molina says.\n\nThe woman told Molina that when she was late in her pregnancy, criminal gang members killed her husband and threatened that the moment she gave birth they would return, kill the child, and force her into sex industry work. \u201cThey wanted to make her a sex slave within the cartel,\u201d Molina says.\n\nDesperate, the woman formed an escape plan. \u201cEvery day after she gave birth she got up and started walking around and walking around,\u201d Molina says, describing a makeshift training regimen. \u201cAbout three days after giving birth she felt she was strong enough to make the journey.\u201d And she did.\n\nThe young mother told Molina: \u201cI would rather die trying to live than to just sit there [in Honduras] and wait for a horrible fate.\u201d\n\nThere are two kinds of smuggling operations involving parents and children from Central America.\n\nOne facilitates a mother or father traveling with their own child.\n\nIn the second, parents already living or working in the US without legal authorization are paying smugglers to transport their child away from that dangerous region and across the US-Mexico border. These children are traveling unaccompanied.\n\nAs director of Catholic Charities in the Rio Grande Valley, Sister Norma Pimentel rejects the suggestion that parents are wrong to put their lives and the lives of their children in the hands of smugglers.\n\nShe recalls the biblical story of Moses and what his mother did to save his life, placing him in a floating basket and trusting that the river would carry him to safety.\n\n\u201cI think parents [in Central America] are having no other option than saying this is a death sentence if they stay here. I can only have compassion for a mother or a father who finds themselves with no other option but to send the child into the unknown and danger, and to not know whether he or she will be alive.\u201d\n\nShe says that people who doubt this truth should travel to the Rio Grande Valley and witness what is happening.\n\n\u201cThey need to see for themselves that mother, that child, that face, and tell them that they wouldn\u2019t help them,\u201d she says.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIn the summer of 2014, with thousands of Central American children and families arriving in the US, the Border Patrol was overwhelmed trying to process them all. Some families released into the community were overwhelmed, too.\n\nWhat they needed was a safe place where they could rest and have a nutritious meal before starting the next phase of their journey.\n\nSeeing that need, Sister Norma \u201cborrowed\u201d the parish hall adjacent to the Sacred Heart Catholic Church and opened the Immigrant Relief and Welcome Center. It is two blocks from the bus station in downtown McAllen.\n\nShe put out an invitation on social media to the community for all those who wanted to help. The response was overwhelming.\n\n\u201cEverybody, every denomination, doctors, nurses, students, families, the county government, even the Border Patrol, thought let\u2019s be part of this response,\u201d she says.\n\nThe effort was positive and unifying across the community because it focused on helping individuals in need. \u201cWe are all about helping that family, that child, that mother \u2013 it is a human response to a human crisis,\u201d Sister Norma says.\n\nThe families arrive at the center after being released from Border Patrol processing. They have been given a date to appear in immigration court. In addition, they\u2019ve had time to contact a family member or friend in the US to send money to pay for a bus ticket.\n\nThey are permitted to spend one night at the immigrant relief center while waiting for their bus. The center serves sandwiches and the Salvation Army provides soup every day. They are also provided sandwiches for their bus trip.\n\nWarren Richey/The Christian Science Monitor The shelves of the Immigrant Relief and Welcome Center in McAllen, Texas, hold items donated from members of the community.\n\nThe relief center is jammed with tables overflowing with donated clothing sorted by size for children and adults, shoes, baby supplies, and other essentials. Two large, air conditioned tents have been set up outside in the parking lot. Each contains 30 cots. One tent is for men and one for women.\n\nVolunteers at the center say that more than 100 family members pass through the center on an average day. On the day in mid-September when a news reporter visited, the count was 170.\n\nIn the past two years, Sister Norma estimates that the Immigrant Relief and Welcome Center has helped 45,000 individuals.\n\nAmong them is Jose, a 40-year-old baker from El Salvador, who made the month-long trip to the US with his 16-year-old daughter. They crossed much of Mexico inside the refrigerated trailer of an 18-wheeler. That part of the trip was very difficult, he says. \u201cIt was cold.\u201d\n\nAfter six days in a Border Patrol detention facility, they were dropped off at the immigrant relief center and had tickets for a midnight bus to Oakland, Calif., where Jose\u2019s brother lives. The brother sent money for bus fare.\n\nHis plan is to work in Oakland and eventually raise enough money to return to El Salvador to bring the rest of his family \u2013 a wife and a daughter, 14, and son, 12 \u2013 to the US. \u201cWe are not members of a gang, we just want a better life,\u201d he says.\n\nAlso part of the plan; his eldest daughter will attend high school in the US \u2013 and, hopefully, college. \u201cShe would be the first.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s his plan. But there\u2019s a catch.\n\nWarren Richey/The Christian Science Monitor Jose made the monthlong journey to the US from El Salvador with his 16-year-old daughter. He now has to work off $7,000 in debt.\n\nJose had to borrow the $7,000 to pay the smuggler. It is an enormous amount of money in El Salvador, and before anything else, he has to pay back that loan or it will fall to his wife and children.\n\nFor Jose it is not just getting to America, it is being able to stay in America long enough to work and pay off that debt.\n\nBefore being released to travel to Oakland, Jose was instructed that he and his daughter must appear at a future hearing before a US immigration judge to determine if they can remain in the US or be removed immediately to El Salvador.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
