( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )\nAccording to Axios , President Trump is gearing up to sign an executive order that would , in their words , \u201c remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens born on U.S. soil. \u201d There is some ambiguity in this formulation . Will the executive order in question limit birthright citizenship to the children of U.S. citizens , or will it extend citizenship to the children of lawful permanent residents , as in the case of most market democracies that have revised their birthright citizenship rules in recent decades ? It is not clear from the video clip provided by Axios on HBO .\nIn truth , Trump \u2019 s response to reporter Jonathan Swan \u2019 s question seems rather off the cuff . At first , the president explains that while he once thought bringing an end to automatic birthright citizenship \u2014 presumably for the children of any class of non-citizens born in the U.S. , whether legally present or otherwise \u2014 would require a constitutional amendment , he has since been persuaded that a statute would do , or even an executive order . Pressed by Swan as to whether such an executive order was in process of being drafted , Trump confidently replied that \u201c it \u2019 s in the process , it \u2019 ll happen. \u201d Will it happen , though ? I \u2019 m skeptical .\nFirst , I should stipulate that I have in the past argued for an amnesty for the long-settled unauthorized-immigrant population that would be accompanied by a constitutional amendment that would do two things : ( a ) grant Congress the authority to revise the rules around automatic birthright citizenship and ( b ) allow naturalized U.S. citizens who are otherwise eligible to serve as president . I \u2019 ve since changed my mind .\nThough an amendment along these lines would have a hard time clearing the high hurdles we rightly put in the way of new constitutional amendments , it struck me as a tough-minded but ultimately fair way to address a serious and legitimate concern often raised by critics of an expansive amnesty : that such an amnesty would encourage further unauthorized inflows , future unauthorized immigrants would form families in the U.S. ( including native-born citizen children ) , and these mixed-status households have long been among the most sympathetic cases , as most Americans are , for good reason , reluctant to divide families . If mixed-status households are a barrier to stringent enforcement , revising the rules around automatic birthright citizenship seemed like a legitimate solution \u2014 indeed , a solution that has in the past appealed to partisans of more open borders .\nIf you believe that opponents of an expansive amnesty ought to be anathematized , a sentiment often expressed by admissionists , addressing their concerns is an inciting thing to do in itself .

To give any illegal immigrant a path to citizenship constitutes \u2018 amnesty , \u2019 an act that transgresses respect for the law , rewards violators , and unjustly pushes aside those who have \u2018 played by the rules. \u2019 \u201d Wright et al . are favorably disposed to legalization , as they call it , but they acknowledge that much of the opposition to it is driven by categorical moral judgments that can \u2019 t be reduced to , say , ethnic or racial bias , which is often cited as a driving force .
