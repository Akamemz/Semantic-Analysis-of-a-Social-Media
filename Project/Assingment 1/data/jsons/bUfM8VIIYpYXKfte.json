Pritzker tried to play nice . He limited criticisms of the federal government \u2019 s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and asked for medical supplies through official channels .\nBut nothing came , so he went on television . The first-term Democrat blasted the Trump administration Sunday on CNN for failing to help states obtain masks , gloves and other protective gear .\nIt got President Donald Trump \u2019 s attention . After a Twitter feud and some mudslinging ( Pritzker compared Trump to a \u201c carnival barker \u201d ) , the two got on the phone Monday , and Trump promised Illinois 250,000 masks and 300 ventilators .\nFacing an unprecedented public health crisis , governors are trying to get what they need from Washington , and fast . But that means navigating the disorienting politics of dealing with Trump , an unpredictable president with a love for cable news and a penchant for retribution .\nRepublicans and Democrats alike are testing whether to fight or flatter , whether to back channel requests or go public , all in an attempt to get Trump \u2019 s attention and his assurances .\nAt stake may be access to masks , ventilators and other personal protective gear critically needed by health care workers , as well as field hospitals and federal cash . As Gov . Gretchen Whitmer , D-Mich. , put it , \u201c I can \u2019 t afford to have a fight with the White House . \u201d\nUnderlying this political dance is Trump \u2019 s tendency to talk about the government as though it \u2019 s his own private business . The former real estate mogul often discusses government business like a transaction dependent on relationships or personal advantage , rather than a national obligation .\n\u201c We are doing very well with , I think , almost all of the governors , for the most part , \u201d he said during a town hall on Fox News on Tuesday . \u201c But you know , it \u2019 s a two-way street . They have to treat us well . \u201d\nOn a private conference call Thursday with Trump , governors from both parties pressed the president for help \u2014 some more forcefully than others .\nWashington Gov . Jay Inslee , a Democrat , urged Trump to use his full authority to ramp up production of necessary medical equipment , according to an audio recording of the call obtained by AP . But Trump said the federal government is merely the \u201c backup . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want you to be the backup quarterback , we need you to be Tom Brady here , \u201d Inslee replied , invoking the football star and Trump friend .\nWest Virginia Gov . Jim Justice , a Republican , meanwhile , was lavish in his praise .\n\u201c We \u2019 re just so appreciative , but we really need you , \u201d Justice told Trump .\nIn an interview Thursday night on Fox News Channel \u2019 s \u201c Hannity , \u201d Trump groused , \u201c Some of these governors take , take , take and then they complain . \u201d\nOf Whitmer , he said , \u201c All she does is sit there and blame the federal government. \u201d And he said Inslee \u201c should be doing more , \u201d adding , \u201c He \u2019 s always complaining . \u201d\nCalifornia \u2019 s Gavin Newsom , usually a fierce Trump critic , is among those who have gone out of their way not to lay the federal government \u2019 s failings during the coronavirus outbreak at Trump \u2019 s feet .\nNewsom complimented Trump for \u201c his focus on treatments \u201d for the virus and thanked him for sending masks and gloves to California . He said the president was \u201c on top of it \u201d when it came to improving testing and said Trump was aware \u201c even before I offered my own insight \u201d of the state \u2019 s need for more testing swabs .\nIt \u2019 s an approach informed by Newsom \u2019 s past dealing with Trump during devastating wildfires . While Trump always has approved California \u2019 s requests for disaster declaration following fires , just days into Newsom \u2019 s tenure last year Trump threatened the state \u2019 s access to disaster relief money .\nTrump has kept a close eye on the coronavirus media coverage and noted which local officials were praising or criticizing him , according to three aides who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the president \u2019 s private deliberations . In conversations , Trump has blasted Whitmer and praised Newsom , they said .\nThere \u2019 s no evidence that Trump has held up a governor \u2019 s request for assistance for personal or political reasons . Still aides say it \u2019 s understood that governors who say nice things about the federal response are more likely to be spared public criticism from the White House or threats of withheld assistance .\nTrump approved California \u2019 s request for a statewide disaster declaration within hours of Newsom asking on Sunday .
