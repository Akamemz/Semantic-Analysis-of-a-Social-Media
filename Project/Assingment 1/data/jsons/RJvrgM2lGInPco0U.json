He was 68 .\nA sharecropper 's son , Cummings became the powerful chairman of a U.S. House committee that investigated President Donald Trump , and was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his black-majority district , which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore as well as more well-to-do suburbs .\nAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee , Cummings led multiple investigations of the president 's governmental dealings , including probes in 2019 relating to the president 's family members serving in the White House .\nTrump responded by criticizing the Democrat 's district as a `` rodent-infested mess '' where `` no human being would want to live . '' The comments came weeks after Trump drew bipartisan condemnation following his calls for Democratic congresswomen of color to get out of the U.S. `` right now , '' and go back to their `` broken and crime-infested countries . ''\nCummings replied that government officials must stop making `` hateful , incendiary comments '' that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems , including mass shootings and white supremacy .\n`` Those in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear , using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior , '' Cummings said in a speech at the National Press Club .\nCummings ' long career spanned decades in Maryland politics .
