    "content": "The remaining four GOP candidates dropped the personal insults and stuck to the issues tonight during the final debate before Tuesday 's winner take all primaries . In a subdued tone , the candidates focused on their records and covered topics ranging from illegal immigration , HB-1 visas , the U.S. relationship with Cuba , Social Security reform , the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and more .\nTonight 's debate did n't have a definitive winner and all of the candidates did a generally good job of presenting their positions .\nThe candidates . The Republican Party . The voters\u2026 \u2014 Frank Luntz ( @ FrankLuntz ) March 11 , 2016\nInternet focus group consensus : `` We wanted to attack Trump more ! ! ! '' \u2014 Frank Luntz ( @ FrankLuntz ) March 11 , 2016\nTRUMP : Trump took an obviously calmer tone tonight , which was expected as the candidate prepares for a general election . However , Trump 's worst moments came when he answered questions directed at his praise of authoritarian regimes and dictators , his plan to stay neutral as Palestinian terrorists continue to murder innocent Israelis and when asked about the violence playing out at his rallies , he denied incitement . It should be noted that just week ago , he told a rowdy crowd to `` knock the crap '' out of protestors . Today a Trump supporter was charged with assault for punching a black protestor in the face at an event .\nCRUZ : After recently opening 10 new campaign offices in the Sunshine State in an effort to compete with Trump and Rubio , Cruz was able to steer the conversation tonight on a variety of issues . One of his strongest points came when he exposed Donald Trump 's proposal to put a 45 percent tariff on imported goods from China as an enormous tax increase for lower and middle class working families . Transcript courtesy of CNN :\nTAPPER : ... Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote . Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party . What do you think is wrong with that vision ?\nCRUZ : Well , Donald is right , for example , he was just talking about international trade . He 's right about the problems . But his solutions do n't work . So , for example , his solution on international trade , he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods .\nNow he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight . I do n't know where he 'll be tonight . But I 'll tell you what happens . You know , we 've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs , you know , Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression .\nAnd the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store , when you go to Walmart , when you are shopping for your kids , the prices you pay go up 45 percent . But not only that , when you put those in place , because a tariff is a tax on you , the American people , but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs .\nA much better solution that works is the tax plan I 've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free , would tax our imports , would not raise prices for Americans , and would not result in reciprocal tariffs . Fix the problem and that 's what 's missing from what Donald says .\nRUBIO : Coming off of what he described as `` embarrassing behavior '' over Trump 's hand size , Rubio needed to have a strong night on his home turf . By sticking to the issues he knows best , telling stories about the American Dream and his family history , Rubio certainly delivered .\nKASICH : Banking on a win in Ohio next week , Kasich delivered a consistent tone and record of experience getting things done as a governor . He was the only candidate on stage who embraced climate change as a man made problem .\nDuring the debate , Ted Cruz reminded the audience only two candidates on the stage can move forward in a serious primary contest . Based on the math , he 's right and it will be him and Trump so long as Trump does n't completely dominate the delegate count on Tuesday .",
