Sen. Mark Warner , D-Va. , who faces a Republican challenge from former GOP chairman Ed Gillespie in November , on Wednesday urged the Obama administration to present a `` clear strategy '' for `` eliminating '' the Islamic State threat .\n`` The United States should not take any military options off the table , because stopping ISIL is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S. and our European allies , '' Warner said in a statement .\nThe sudden focus on foreign policy poses a challenge for both parties .\nRepublicans , who have been pulled in an isolationist direction by Sen.
