Particularly when we have huge problems facing us as we do today .\nBut the founders knew what they were doing setting up the checks and balances of our constitutional republic . The delicate arrangement we call freedom should never submit with ease to a charismatic demagogue or to an emotion filled crisis .\nThe current push for gun control is case and point . It is at a time like this that we should be grateful that changing our laws is hard to do .\nEvery normal and decent American wants to live in a country where we will never again see life lost as result of a weapon held and fired by some deranged individual .\nIf we knew how to prevent it from ever happening again , we all would sign off in a minute .\nIronically , President Obama acknowledges that we don \u2019 t know what causes the irrational violent incidents we have witnessed . It is the reason one part of the proposal he has put forth is to provide funding to the Centers for Disease Control to study the problem .\nYet , despite acknowledging lack of understanding about what drives gun violence , the president and Senator Dianne Feinstein do not hesitate to offer what they claim is a solution . They propose further controls on gun ownership that are deeply problematic in their intrusion on our freedoms and right to bear arms , guaranteed under the second amendment of our constitution .\nWhy are the president and Senator Feinstein so ready to compromise basic American freedoms with gun control measures , that already have a dubious record of success , to solve a problem that President Obama acknowledges we don \u2019 t understand ?\nTo the president \u2019 s credit , in his remarks introducing his gun control initiative , he acknowledges that there may be cultural reasons that contribute to this sick , violent behavior .\nBut he defines the cultural parameters of what he chooses to look at in such narrow terms that you have to question his seriousness or sincerity .\nThe president said , \u201c Congress should fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young minds . \u201d\nHas the president walked by a local movie theater complex recently to see what is playing ? How about the local fare on television ? Or what about the content of rap music ?\nCan it possibly be that the disproportionate support that the Democratic Party gets from the entertainment industry - major sources of gratuitous violent media \u2013 gets them a pass from today \u2019 s discussion ?\nPresident Obama outraised Mitt Romney five to one from the movie/TV/music industry .\nThis business was in the top ten sources of business funding for Senator Feinstein \u2019 s re-election in 2012 , with election funding sources showing these entertainment businesses didn \u2019 t provide a dime to her Republican opponent .\nWhat about other major themes in American culture today that contribute to a sense of meaningless and lack of respect for the sacredness of life ?\nOf course , I am talking about our indifference to the lives of unborn children , who are murdered in our country with impunity . Somehow those who want to intrude on gun ownership can live with the violence perpetrated on the unborn and have little interest in seeing its implications on violence in other areas of our society .\nAnother part of this discussion is about the mentally ill.
