    "content_original": "And you thought Obama\u2019s economic policies were indefensible.\n\nWait until you hear him debate foreign policy.\n\nHis foreign policy is unique in the history of the American presidency in that it almost completely ignores American self-interest. It can only be described as the first anti-American foreign policy crafted by an American president.\n\nOur contributor, former Congressman Bob Beauprez summed it up in September: Only America\u2019s enemies are better off than they were four years ago.\n\nWrote Beauprez :\n\nThe question comes up a lot these days, \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" But, the question is almost always asked in a personal economic context. Jed Babbin, a former deputy undersecretary of defense and widely published author, analyzed the \"Are you better off\u2026\" question from a foreign policy/national security perspective. His conclusion: \"America's enemies are, not our allies.\"\n\nMany of these same enemies Obama actually considers our friends.\n\nLibya provides the most recent example.\n\nIn Libya, Obama helped topple one anti-American regime to help install another that was even more anti-American.\n\nHe\u2019s even gone so far to condone the capture and sacking of our consulate in Benghazi and the death of American diplomats.\n\nAnd by changing his story 26 times in a quest to avoid personal responsibility for the \u201cglorious\u201d outcome in his Libyan war, Obama has left the impression that the only people responsible are the ones who died.\n\nI bet you didn\u2019t know that the country in which our consulate resides is ultimately responsible for the security of the consulate there.
