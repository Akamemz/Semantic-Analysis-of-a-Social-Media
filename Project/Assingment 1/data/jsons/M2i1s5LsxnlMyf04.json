    "content": "Today , the Supreme Court let Wisconsin keep its extremely gerrymandered political map , which gave Republicans 60 % of the seats in the state assembly despite having won only 47 % of the vote .\nMore importantly , the Court did so unanimously , saying that the plaintiffs in the case had no standing to sue Wisconsin at all , because they didn \u2019 t prove any individual harm arising from the map . The case was kicked down to the district court to give them a chance to do so .\nAlready , this decision is being described as a \u201c punt \u201d but that \u2019 s wrong . Actually , it was a score for conservatives , because the Court \u2019 s five conservatives made it extremely hard to bring cases like these in the future . It \u2019 s more like a field goal .\nHere \u2019 s why . The plaintiffs in Gill v. Whitford did a bunch of math to show how slanted the Wisconsin map is overall . The 60 % vs. 47 % number isn \u2019 t enough , because after all , individual politicians attract cross-party voters all the time . So the Gill team cited a new statistic called the \u201c efficiency gap , \u201d which basically measured the difference between fair districts and unfair ones . In the case of Wisconsin , the gap was 7 % .\nAt oral argument , the Court \u2019 s conservatives were extremely skeptical of this number , the math that went into it , and the reasoning that 7 % is too much but 6 % isn \u2019 t too much . Infamously , Chief Justice Roberts called this \u201c sociological gobbledgygook . \u201d\nIn today \u2019 s decision , it threw out the math entirely . In fact , the Court said , no one can challenge the map as a whole \u2013 individual citizens may only challenge their individual districts , arguing that their individual votes have been diluted .\nThe trouble is , that will be very hard to do , because the real harm of gerrymandering is in the aggregate , not in the individual . Suppose I live in District 1 , which would be 65 % Democratic under a normal map , but which is 80 % Democratic in a \u201c packed \u201d political map which packs as many Democrats into as few districts as possible . Sure , my vote is not that meaningful , like living in New York or California during a presidential election . But how do I prove that ? Is there a magic number at which I \u2019 m so diluted that the map is unconstitutional ?\nUnless there \u2019 s a smoking gun \u2013 the minutes of a meeting where someone says \u201c Hey , let \u2019 s screw over District 1 by adding even more Democrats to it ! \u201d \u2013 it \u2019 s hard to see how I make out that claim . At least the \u201c efficiency gap \u201d had mathematical evidence .\n\u201c Is there a magic number at which I \u2019 m so diluted that the map is unconstitutional ? \u201d\nJustice Kagan , in a concurring opinion joined by the court \u2019 s three other liberals , tried to paint lipstick on the pig , saying that with enough plaintiffs aggregated together , the entire map could be challenged and redrawn . Moreover , she added , there are other claims besides voter dilution , such as First Amendment claims of free association .\nUnusually , the Chief Justice \u2019 s opinion specifically dismissed that view , saying that \u201c the opinion of the Court rests on the understanding that we lack jurisdiction to decide this case , much less to draw speculative and advisory conclusions regarding others . The reasoning of this Court with respect to the disposition of this case is set forth in this opinion and none other . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s what trash talk sounds like at the Supreme Court .\nIt also has a point . Justice Kagan \u2019 s opinion basically makes two or three hypothetical cases instead of the one that plaintiffs actually brought . It \u2019 s a bit like her concurring opinion in Masterpiece Cakeshop , in which she described what the case would have looked like had it not been the case that it was . Not coincidentally , both cases were high-profile battles that ended with a complex legal holding , a conservative substantive victory and a near-unanimous court .\nBut unlike Masterpiece , which was so narrow as to break no new ground whatsoever , Gill spoke clearly to the several other gerrymandering cases winding their way through the courts \u2013 most importantly , two from Maryland and North Carolina . The restrictions are clear : no systemic harms , no statewide relief , no taking account of the overall , cumulative effect of the partisan maps .\nZooming back from the legal details , there are two important takeaways .\nFirst , the conservatives on the Court clearly do not want to decide these cases at all . Partisan gerrymandering , as everyone agrees , has long been a swamp . It seems essentially political \u2013 which is to say , none of the courts \u2019 business . That \u2019 s even more the case given the Chief Justice \u2019 s judicial minimalism , and his perhaps futile wish to keep the Supreme Court out of politics .\nMoreover , while everyone agrees that too much partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional , no one \u2013 including Justice Kagan \u2019 s concurrence \u2013 can really say how much is too much .\nMaybe the best football metaphor for Gill v.
