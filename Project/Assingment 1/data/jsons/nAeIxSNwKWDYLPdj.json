Bernie Sanders hoped to defy the polls and pull off upset victories in Monday night 's caucuses .\nAfter months of campaigning and more than $ 150 million spent on advertising , the race for supremacy in Iowa is close in both parties .\nAmong Republicans , the latest polls show real estate billionaire Donald Trump holding a slim edge over Cruz . Cruz , who became the first major candidate from either party to enter the presidential race 315 days ago , has pinned his hopes to a sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation . Cruz has also modeled his campaign after past Iowa winners , visiting all of the state 's 99 counties and courting influential evangelical and conservative leaders .\n`` If you had told me 10 months ago that the day before the Iowa caucuses we 'd be in a statistcal tie for first place I would have been thrilled and exhilarated , '' Cruz told \u2588\u2588\u2588 late Sunday .\nThe Republican caucus is also the first test of whether Trump can turn the legion of fans drawn to his plainspoken populism into voters . The scope of the billionaire 's organization in Iowa is a mystery , though Trump himself has intensified his campaign schedule during the final sprint , including a pair of rallies Monday .\n`` I do n't have to win it , '' Trump said on CBS ' \u201c Face the Nation '' Sunday . `` I 'm doing really well with the evangelicals in Iowa . But I 'm also doing tremendously well all over the country with the evangelicals . \u2026 I think we have a good chance of winning Iowa .

''\nCruz has also spent the closing days of the Iowa campaign focused on Marco Rubio , trying to ensure the Florida senator does n't inch into second place . Rubio is viewed by many Republicans as a more mainstream alternative to Trump and Cruz , though he 'll need to stay competitive in Iowa in order to maintain his viability .\nOn the Democratic side , Sanders has rallied to close a 40-point polling deficit against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , reviving memories of her disappointing showing in Iowa eight years ago .\n`` Stick with me , '' Clinton said as she rallied supporters Sunday in Council Bluffs . `` Stick with a plan .

'' The self-described democratic socialist 's message that the U.S. economy is \u201c rigged \u201d against the middle class has appeared to resonate with an electorate that has grown frustrated with Washington and given rise to insurgent candidates like Sanders and Trump .\nThe campaigns were anxiously keeping an eye on the weather , but a snowfall forecast to start Monday night appeared more likely to hinder the hopefuls in their rush out of Iowa than any potential voters .
