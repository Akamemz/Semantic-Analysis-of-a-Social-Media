Martha McSally , the winner of Arizona \u2019 s Republican primary for Senate , is doing something few women in the GOP have done this cycle : putting gender at the forefront of her campaign .\nIt \u2019 s a move that Republican women have by and large shied away from , likely due to concerns about being too closely affiliated with identity politics . This doesn \u2019 t seem to be the case for McSally \u2014 the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat , who \u2019 s up against Democrat Kyrsten Sinema , another woman \u2014 in the general election this fall .\nMcSally first highlighted gender in her campaign announcement and has continued to focus on it in the course of her Senate run . \u201c I \u2019 m a fighter pilot , and I talk like one , \u201d she says in her announcement video . \u201c That \u2019 s why I told Washington Republicans to grow a pair of ovaries and get the job done . \u201d\n\u201c She \u2019 s broken so many barriers in her career , \u201d says Lisa Askey , the president of the Chandler Republican Women , noting that \u201c there was such prejudice against her and she \u2019 s made great strides . \u201d\nSince she joined the race , McSally has made her groundbreaking service in the Air Force a cornerstone of her campaign and debuted a Women \u2019 s Coalition made up of Arizona women leaders including former Gov . Jan Brewer and former Secretary of State Betsey Bayless . ( Some of the women who support her have taken to offering a pithy nod to her military service and referring to themselves as her \u201c Wing Women . \u201d )\nHer approach to gender is in stark contrast to that of Marsha Blackburn and Diane Black , two Congress members who ran in the Tennessee Senate and governor \u2019 s primaries while skirting the issue .\nMcSally \u2019 s emphasis on gender could offer key advantages in this race . One of the main demographics she \u2019 ll have to win over in November is women , a group that makes up 52 percent of Arizona \u2019 s registered voters . A growing proportion of women are also identifying as independents who are increasingly looking to be the deciding factor in the upcoming Senate race .\nWith two women going up against each other , gender is no longer a liability .\nMcSally \u2019 s record centers on breaking gender barriers \u2014 and supporters see this as part of her qualifications\nFor many McSally supporters , her mentions of gender don \u2019 t read so much as an overt effort to draw attention to it as they do a straightforward way to describe her professional record and highlight her qualifications .\nMcSally has said she was shocked by the way the Air Force was set up when she first enrolled in the Academy after graduating high school . \u201c I find out when I get to the Academy that it \u2019 s against the law for women to be fighter pilots , and I \u2019 m like , What ?

While overseas in Saudi Arabia , McSally also challenged a rule that required female service members to wear traditional abayas \u2014 long-sleeve , floor-length dresses \u2014 when they traveled off base . She ultimately sued then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld over the requirement , noting that male service members were not required to wear the formal dress of their host country in the same circumstances \u2014 and secured a change in policy .\nDuring her time in the House , the two-term Congress member has continued to champion gender equality , establishing a working group to examine disparities in the workplace around pay and confronting the House \u2019 s stringent dress code .\n\u201c From a personal standpoint , she \u2019 s a highly accomplished woman , \u201d says Scottsdale Mayor Jim Lane , an Arizona official who has endorsed McSally . \u201c I don \u2019 t know that there \u2019 s an overemphasis on [ gender ] . \u201d In her approach toward gender , McSally seems to be doing something that \u2019 s seen more frequently on the Democratic side : simply noting how it informs her life experience and perspective .\nArizona Republicans have a history of promoting women in politics , even if the broader GOP doesn \u2019 t\nThe Republican Party has long been criticized for its lethargic approach to promoting women among its ranks , and this year , the GOP could see the number of Republican women in the House go down even as Democrats experience an unprecedented slew of wins among female candidates .\nFor some GOP women , there \u2019 s also a concern that being too outspoken about issues like gender equality could associate them with identity politics , something the party has actively tried to distance itself from .
