There was the misleading story of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch , who was said to have founded a group in high school called the \u201c Fascism Forever Club. \u201d There was the viral photo of a boy handcuffed at Dulles airport near Washington after the president \u2019 s immigration ban last week \u2013 it was a fake , taken in 2015 .\nThe term \u201c fake news \u201d has become one of the most charged political terms in the emerging rough-and-ready digital era of the Trump presidency . He uses the term almost daily , charging mainstream news outlets such as CNN and The New York Times with trafficking in \u201c fiction \u201d and even outright lies . At the same time , he spreads falsehoods , like his claim Tuesday that \u201c the murder rate in our country is the highest it \u2019 s been in 47 years. \u201d In fact , the murder rate is near historic lows .\nThe confusion and misinformation creates an environment where it is increasingly normal to accept facts only if they conform to one 's own worldview . But something else is at work , as well , many observers say . The penchant to believe fake news is often rooted in a deep-seated feeling of alarm and powerlessness .\n\u201c Of course , when you feel disempowered , you want to strike back with everything you got , and you feel like the whole world is against you , \u201d says Brooke Binkowski , managing editor of Snopes , a fact-checking website that has debunked many of the false stories circulating around the internet .\n\u201c People who think they \u2019 ve been pushed out of the political world as it is right now are going to be susceptible to misinformation \u2013 they \u2019 re going to focus on whatever makes them feel better , \u201d she says .\nRight now , that \u2019 s liberals . Ms. Binkowski says she has seen an uptick in liberals sharing misleading stories on their news feeds . Others agree .\n\u201c Certainly , you can see more examples in the kind of stuff that people of the left are now fascinated by , \u201d says Judith Donath , a faculty fellow at The Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University . \u201c Liberals were not being terribly alarmist before the election , but now there \u2019 s this nonstop sense of emergency .... You don \u2019 t really want to stop and smell the flowers , because you think that if I miss something , disaster might happen . \u201d\nBefore the election , fake news stories abounded on conservative feeds , according to a number of studies . Headlines claiming that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump or that President Obama had banned the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools were shared hundreds of thousands of times . The most notorious fake news story \u2013 the fabricated story that Mrs. Clinton was tied to a child sex ring at a Washington pizza parlor \u2013 led an armed man to investigate and fire a shot during business hours .\nThe trend represents a perfect storm of several crises converging , many scholars say .\n\u201c There \u2019 s the platform crisis of social media as a news distributor , there is the industrial crisis of mainstream journalistic venues closing and downscaling , and there is the larger cultural crises of the epistemological devaluation of verifiable truth , \u201d says Aram Sinnreich , professor at American University \u2019 s School of Communication in Washington . \u201c Then there \u2019 s also the political crisis with opportunistic public officials and voters both privileging politically convenient stories over truthful ones . \u201d\nFake news has generally trended conservative . In the last three months before the election , 17 of the top 20 most-shared fake news stories favored Trump , according to a study by Buzzfeed last November .

That trend has also bolstered mainstream newspapers including The Washington Post , The New York Times , and The Wall Street Journal , which have each seen their circulations surge after the election .\n\u201c So if you have a huge multiplier in the news people are consuming , while keeping the same percentage of these outlets that really aren \u2019 t trustworthy , you \u2019 d of course have more of the fake stuff , \u201d says Donath .\nAnd new fake stories keep circulating . An article from AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com last week claimed that police officers had burned the camps of indigenous activists fighting the Dakota Access pipeline at Standing Rock .
