This summer , she cleared boulders and marked trails for Iceland \u2019 s environment agency while living in a tent . The only steady job she \u2019 s had over the past eight months is generating leads for a Texas solar company .\nWherever she happens to be in the world , she logs into the satellite feature of Google maps to see which commercial buildings in San Antonio have rooftops suitable for solar panels . \u201c It does n't pay me a lot , \u201d she says . But \u201c I 've done it in Iceland , I 've done it in Bosnia , I 've done it in Kansas . \u201d\nWelcome to 21st century work . Instead of holding full-time jobs , millions of workers are contracting out their labor for minutes to months at a time . Called contingent , independent , or solo works \u2013 or sometimes alt-labor \u2013 it is not particularly new ( think temp workers or substitute teachers ) . What is new is their ranks are growing , apparently rapidly .\nThe rise of alt-labor is so rapid it can account for virtually all America \u2019 s job growth since 2005 , according to one new study for the National Bureau of Economic Research . That \u2019 s a startling \u2013 and controversial \u2013 finding . It suggests that of the 9.1 million net jobs created in the past decade , only 6 percent were traditional full-time positions , conclude Harvard economist Lawrence Katz and Princeton economist Alan Krueger . The rest were temp , on-call , contract , or freelance jobs .\nThe same phenomenon is happening in western Europe . To some , this means that developed economies are on the cusp of redefining their social contracts with workers , offering unprecedented freedom and flexibility to build the kind of employment trajectory they want . The Internet makes it much easier and faster for employers and workers to match up , perhaps making the need for traditional companies less compelling .\n\u201c Just as working models changed in the wake of the Industrial Revolution , the nature of work may be evolving again as the digital revolution takes hold , \u201d says a new study by McKinsey Global Institute .\nBut others say all this is backward . As economies have become more developed during the past century , corporations have offered an increasing share of workers steady , full-time jobs , often with high pay and benefits such as paid vacation , free or low-cost health care , and funding for retirement . If alt-labor labor is reemerging , it \u2019 s a backward step that may make income inequality worse , these analysts add .\n\u201c What we 're doing is returning to an historical norm , \u201d says Arun Gupta , a freelance journalist in New York who has covered labor issues and protests . Except for a few decades in the 20th century , \u201c contingent workers have always been the norm . \u201d\nAt this point , alt-labor is creating both positive and negative effects .\nWhen Trevor Chamberlain soured on videography as a career , he moved to San Diego looking for a fresh start . He began working for the county \u2019 s voter registration board , but it was hard work and paid only $ 10 an hour . So in May , he switched to driving for Lyft , the ridesharing service , and , eventually , its competitor , Uber . He also taught some videography courses .\nThen this summer , he landed a contract with a major ad agency for videography editing that paid him what he was used to making when he was working full time . But \u201c it 's only a two month contract , \u201d he says . \u201c In a couple weeks , I 'll be back looking . And I 'll probably drive for Lyft and Uber . \u201d\nIf he had his druthers , Mr. Chamberlain would make his own movies , but it \u2019 s too hard to break in . \u201c I 'm already tired of this life , \u201d he says . \u201c I 'm in a boatload of debt from film school and investing in my portfolio and camera equipment . I live in a very small studio with a cat . I 've never been married . I 'm not financially secure whatsoever . I live check to check . \u201d\nOn balance , however , independent workers are satisfied more often than not with their employment . The McKinsey report survey found that 68 percent of those who make most of their money from independent work would like to continue that arrangement . Also , 32 percent of those who supplement their work with freelance jobs would like to make most of their living from independent work . Even among traditional workers , 12 percent would like to go freelance as their primary source of income .\nAlt-labor is an international phenomenon . Some 94 million people in the more developed nations of the European Union ( EU-15 ) are independent workers , according to the McKinsey study . Up to 68 million people in the US fall into the same category . Combined , that represents some 28 percent of their combined working-age populations . ( But half of those are full-time workers moonlighting on the side . )\nMcKinsey Global Institute The US has seen rapid growth in alt-labor jobs since 2008 . In Europe , the sector is big but growth is flat .\nOne of the myths surrounding independent workers is that they are mostly Millennials driving for Uber \u2013 the so-called gig economy . In fact , older Americans age 55 to 75 are nearly four times more likely to be independent workers than 16- to 24-year-olds are , according to the study by Professors Katz and Krueger . And independent workers are twice as likely to use offline means of finding work or customers offline rather than new online platforms .\nMr. Gupta , the freelance journalist , considers himself fortunate because he and his partner can pursue their dreams , while many other freelancers have given up . But \u201c I do n't think the freelance economy should be romanticized , \u201d he says .\nGupta and his partner earn about $ 30,000 a year each . They have a rent-stabilized apartment in New York , some savings built up ( he from previous advertising jobs , she from work in Hollywood ) , and a huge network of friends who can step in to support .\n\u201c We 're willing to put up with a lot of circumstances , \u201d Gupta says . \u201c We do n't want to own a home . We 're willing to live in strangers ' living rooms for three days when we 're covering an assignment\u2026 . But for us , it gives us such incredible freedom . We are thankful we can do this kind of work . \u201d\nThere are other privations freelancers often endure : no benefits , no company matching of retirement investments . Gupta has to spend a significant amount of time making sure he gets paid , including a year \u2019 s worth of compensation from an independent publication he founded .\nNew York City is considering a new measure to make it easier for freelancers to collect . The bill would require companies hiring freelancers to use written contracts and to pay them within 30 days of the completed assignment or the due date on the contract . Penalties for not paying could include double damages , attorney \u2019 s fees , and civil penalties .\nIt \u2019 s a start . But much more needs to be done if alt-labor is going to thrive , the McKinsey report says , including the creation of income-security measures and training and credentials .\nNot everyone believes the independent workforce is growing that much . For one thing , the numbers don \u2019 t add up . Inexplicably , there are fewer self-employed workers today than a decade ago , according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) . And the number of workers with multiple jobs \u2013 a hallmark of the gig economy \u2013 has barely changed since 1994 , labor historian Kim Moody points out in a recent article . \u201c The evidence on recent growth in the independent workforce is thin , \u201d the McKinsey report concedes .\nA big reason is that the BLS hasn \u2019 t studied the issue since a 2005 survey , a gap that Labor Secretary Tom Perez promises to remedy next year . In the meantime , the Katz and Krueger study has attempted to update the 2005 BLS survey with 2015 data . It is that survey that leads them to conclude that independent workers \u2019 share of the workforce has risen from 10.7 percent in 2005 to 15.8 percent by 2015 .\nFurthermore , they point out , Internal Revenue Service data contradict the BLS self-employment contraction . Tax returns show that the share of taxpayers identifying themselves as self-employed or independent contractors , consultants , or freelancers has climbed from 6.9 percent to 8.4 percent during the same period .\nAnd the Internet-fueled gig part of the alt-labor is growing furiously . In one year , Uber doubled the number of daily rides it handles from 1 million to 2 million . Between 2012 and 2015 , the number of adults using digital platforms to find work grew an astonishing 47-fold , according to a 2016 study by the JPMorgan Chase Institute .\nIt \u2019 s unlikely that alt-work will replace the great bulk of traditional full-time jobs , says David Hale , chief executive officer of Gigwalk , a mobile platform for managing large distributed workforces based in San Francisco .\nSix years ago , Gigwalk started as a website where freelancers could bid for projects from companies . But the company found that firms were really interested in its scheduling software to schedule their own workforces . So Gigwalk has begun selling its software to insurance companies , retailers , and even other staffing companies .\n\u201c There are benefits of companies bringing people together around their core values , and there are benefits of having people work for you , \u201d says Mr. Hale . \u201c My view , and honestly my hope , is that we will not just become a workforce of entirely contingent workers . \u201d\nThe growth of alt-labor could reinforce the inequality already apparent in US and European societies . Research shows that a healthy share of workers strike out on their own as specialists because they can make more money than at their firms . Independent contractors , for example , earn more per hour than their traditional colleagues , but they end up making less per year because they work fewer hours , the Katz and Krueger study suggests . Meanwhile , temp workers and even gig workers usually get paid less than their traditional colleagues .\nFor example , US workers who sign up for jobs at Amazon \u2019 s Mechanical Turk rarely make more than $ 8 an hour , according to a recent study .
