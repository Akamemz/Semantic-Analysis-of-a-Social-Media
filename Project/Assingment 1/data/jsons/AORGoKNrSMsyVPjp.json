'' The cuts came as the city is grappling with losing $ 9 billion in revenue amid the coronavirus pandemic .\nThe budget cuts nearly $ 484 million from the NYPD 's annual $ 6 billion budget and shifts funding to other agencies as well as youth and social services programming .\nThe changes will cancel a nearly 1,200-person police recruiting class set for next month ( though another class in October is scheduled to go forward ) , curtail overtime spending and shift school safety , crossing guards and homeless outreach away from the NYPD .\n\u201c That work is not over , and while we have made progress , we are also vowing to keep fighting for fundamental changes to how we approach safety in schools , mental health and homelessness , '' said council Speaker Corey Johnson . `` Over the coming weeks , the council will be working on hearings and legislation to make sure that these changes are real .
