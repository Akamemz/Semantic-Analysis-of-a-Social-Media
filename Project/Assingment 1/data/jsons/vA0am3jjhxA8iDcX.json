But I am a troublemaker , \u201d Yin told Motherboard . \u201c I really wanted the Chinese engineers to stand up and speak for ourselves . \u201d\nIn late September , Yin , who worked for Facebook 's push notifications team , agreed to speak on the record to a local ABC station at a protest over Facebook \u2019 s handling of the suicide of Qin Chen , who jumped off the fourth story of an office building at Facebook \u2019 s Menlo Park , California campus on September 19 .\nChen \u2019 s suicide raised concerns among Facebook employees and the Chinese community about the working conditions of Silicon Valley tech workers on visas . Since Chen \u2019 s suicide , former and current Facebook employees have started posting online about the mistreatment of international workers at the company . Meanwhile , the Chinese community in Silicon Valley responded to the company \u2019 s handling of Chen \u2019 s death by organizing a protest and memorial for Chen at Facebook \u2019 s headquarters on September 26 .\nA GoFundMe fundraiser called \u201c Say NO To Toxic Work Environment \u201d raised over $ 6,000 for the events . Since then , a second GoFundMe page has raised over $ 122,000 for Chen \u2019 s wife and child , who are reportedly in the United States on H4 visas .\nAt the protest , Yin led a large crowd of employees and non-employees near a giant \u201c thumbs up \u201d sign on the company \u2019 s Menlo Park campus , chanting \u201c Chinese Lives Matter , Zuckerberg \u201d and \u201c Give Us the Truth Zuckerberg. \u201d Roughly 400 Facebook employees and non-employees attended the protest , according to a Bloomberg report .

We want to know what happened between Mr. Chen and his manager before his suicide. \u201d Yin said he doesn \u2019 t have proof , but believes rumors that Chen was bullied by his manager at Facebook and given an unfair performance review .\nThe day after the protest , in an email reviewed by Motherboard , a Facebook human resources manager wrote to Yin , referencing his interview with ABC , \u201c To respect the privacy of the employee and his family please do not discuss the incident with anyone especially outside the company \u201d and suggested that he contact Lyra , the company \u2019 s psychological health service . Days later , Yin received a \u201c final \u201d warning , which he says did not mention any violations of Facebook rules .\nOn October 7 , Facebook informed Yin that he had been fired , that he has to pay back a sign-on bonus , and that the company would no longer pay for a trip home to China . \u201c The team clarified that you will not be receiving a flight home check .
