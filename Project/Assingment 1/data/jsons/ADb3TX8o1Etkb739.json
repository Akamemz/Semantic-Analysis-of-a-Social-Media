That 4-percentage-point edge may seem small , but it 's notable because Democrats traditionally fare better among registered voters than they do among those who actually cast ballots , especially in low-turnout midterms .\n`` It 's huge , '' says former Virginia congressman Tom Davis , who twice chaired the Republican congressional campaign committee .
