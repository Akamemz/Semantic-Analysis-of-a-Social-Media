Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , declared Sunday that `` every major policy issue has been resolved , '' and said he anticipates a bill on the floor as early as May .\nIt comes after Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , in a comment Republicans took as a signal the chairman intends to rush the bill through , stressed that his committee has already held dozens of hearings .\nA program to bring tens of thousands of low-skilled workers into the country as part of a guest worker system .\nA pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants . The proposal would include a 10-year wait for a green card , and a total 13-year wait to apply for citizenship .\nStrengthened border security , likely tied to the pathway to citizenship .\nRequiring employers to use E-Verify to check immigration status of workers .\nOverhauling the legal immigration system , authorizing more visas for high-skilled workers .\nBut top Republicans are worried mistakes could be made if leaders rush the bill to the floor .\nSen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , one of eight senators in the bipartisan group drafting the proposal , said Sunday that it `` will only be a starting point '' and other senators need to weigh in .\n`` Eight senators from seven states have worked on this bill to serve as a starting point for discussion about fixing our broken immigration system , '' he said . `` But arriving at a final product will require it to be properly submitted for the American people 's consideration , through the other 92 senators from 43 states that were n't part of this initial drafting process . In order to succeed , this process can not be rushed or done in secret . ''\nRubio also wrote to Leahy on Saturday cautioning that `` excessive haste in the pursuit of a lasting solution '' is `` dangerous '' to the goals of immigration reform .
