Bush , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an exclusive interview . He said the way the situation in the country has been handled by the Obama administration and , earlier , by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , `` it seems to me was not terribly skillful . `` On Thursday , security forces struggled to clamp a lid on Egypt after hundreds of people were killed when authorities forcibly broke up camps of supporters protesting the ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi , in the worst nationwide bloodshed in decades.Islamists clashed with police and troops who used bulldozers , teargas , and live fire on Wednesday to clear out two Cairo sit-ins that had become a hub of Muslim Brotherhood resistance to the military after it deposed Morsi on July 3.The clashes spread quickly , and a health ministry official said about 400 people were killed and more than 2,000 injured in fighting in Cairo , Alexandria , and numerous towns and cities around the mostly Muslim nation of 84 million.Rumsfeld said the administration misread the effect of early elections that voted in Morsi as president . `` The Muslim Brotherhood \u2026 is not secular as someone in the Obama administration has suggested , the director of national intelligence ; it 's not secular , '' Rumsfeld said . `` It 's Islamic and because they 're the best organized and the toughest and the most ruthless , they won the election and control of the parliament and the effect has been that they 've tried to impose a rule over the Egyptian people which is not what the people who have demonstrated in Tahrir Square wanted . `` He also decried the deadly situation the Egyptian military must now manage , jeopardizing its `` critical relationship '' with the United States and its ability to remain an `` anchor of stability in the country and in the region . `` `` The military has a tough relationship now to manage this situation because the country 's in turmoil , '' Rumsfeld said . `` The people that we 've sent there to deal with the problem have not done a particularly skillful job in my view . It 's unfortunate . `` Still , Rumsfeld said it would be disastrous to cut off aid to a nation teetering on the brink of civil war . `` Egypt is an enormously important country , '' he said . `` We ca n't determine the outcome there but we can play at the margins , so to speak , and we can be helpful and try to encourage a freer political system and a freer economic system and greater opportunity for the people there . Cutting off aid would be like severing our relationships with them and would be kind of a mindless act . `` Rumsfeld said one only has to look at Syria to see what could ultimately happen in Egypt . `` There have been something between 80,000 and 100,000 people dead in Syria in opposition to the Assad regime , '' he said . `` It 's conceivable that could happen in Egypt , '' warning that the United States should not expect Egypt to mirror our own aspirations \u2014 and to not tie those aspirations to aid , saying it would be `` an unrealistic , juvenile attitude . `` Rumsfeld also blasted the Obama administration 's head-in-the-sand anti-terrorism strategy , calling relations with terrorists `` much more like the Cold War . `` `` The administration has been uniformly desirous of de-emphasizing the threat from Islamists and suggesting that it is something that they can prevail \u2026 with bullets and drone strikes , which is not the case , '' he said . `` This is much more like the Cold War . It 's going to last decades , not years , and it 's going to take perseverance and persistence on the part of the United States and we have to be realistic . And the administration is not realistic about it . They 're unwilling to even identify what the enemy is . They wo n't even use the word Islamist . `` They do n't even acknowledge the fact that there are people being trained in a number of countries to go out and kill innocent men , women , and children who are American . And unless you 're willing to do that , you 're not likely to prevail over the long term . `` Regarding Israel , Rumsfeld said our ally could do nothing but defend its people in the face of continuing threats from Iran . `` If you were an Israeli prime minister or ... you had a country that 's very small with a population that 's very small and you heard every week what the Iranians say about eradicating and incinerating and eliminating the state of Israel , and then you watch their progress toward a nuclear weapon , I do n't see how leadership in that country has any choice other than to defend the people of Israel , '' he said .",
