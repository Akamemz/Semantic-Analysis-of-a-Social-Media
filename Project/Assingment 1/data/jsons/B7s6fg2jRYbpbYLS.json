    "content_original": "WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for former national security adviser Michael Flynn have halted communications with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team, a potentially critical step in the probe into contacts between Trump\u2019s election campaign and Russia, sources familiar with the investigation said on Friday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn speaks at the White House in Washington, U.S. on February 1, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo\n\nFlynn\u2019s lawyer, Robert Kelner, called John Dowd, Trump\u2019s private lawyer, on Wednesday to say the matter had reached a point where the two could no longer could discuss it, two people familiar with the call told Reuters on Friday.\n\nThe New York Times first reported that the two sets of lawyers had stopped communicating.\n\nFlynn, a retired Army general, is a central figure in a federal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Trump aides colluded with alleged Russian efforts to boost his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIt was not clear whether Kelner made the call because he had negotiated a plea agreement with Mueller for Flynn to cooperate in the probe, or because Flynn had decided to engage with Mueller, said two other sources.\n\n\u201cNo one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about General Flynn cooperating against the president,\u201d Jay Sekulow, another attorney for Trump, said on Thursday.\n\nDowd on Friday declined to comment on the matter, as did Peter Carr, Mueller\u2019s spokesman.
