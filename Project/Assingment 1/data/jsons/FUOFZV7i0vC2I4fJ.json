You may know that an opposition demonstration in Tirana on Friday resulted in the deaths of three people and the destruction of property . There are serious concerns about further unrest connected to a counter-demonstration to be organized by the governing party on Wednesday and a follow-up event by the opposition two days later to memorialize the victims . The prospect of tens of thousands of people entering the streets in an already inflamed political environment bodes ill for the return of public order and the country \u2019 s fragile democratic process . I believe two things need to be done urgently : 1 . Bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to forestall further public demonstrations and to tone down public pronouncements . 2 . Appoint a senior European official as a mediator . While I am concerned about the rhetoric being used by both sides , I am particularly worried about the actions of the Prime Minister . There is videotape of National Guard members firing on demonstrators from the roof of the Prime Ministry . The Prosecutor ( appointed by the Democratic Party ) has issued arrest warrants for the individuals in question . The Prime Minister had previously accused the opposition of intentionally murdering these activists as a provocation . After the tape came out deputies from his party accused the Prosecutor of planning a coup d \u2019 etat in collaboration with the opposition , a charge Mr. Berisha repeated today . No arrests have been made as of this writing . The demonstration resulted from opposition protests over the conduct of parliamentary elections in 2009 . The political environment has deteriorated ever since and is now approaching levels of 1997 , when similar issues caused the country to slide into anarchy and violence . There are signs that Edi Rama \u2019 s control of his own people is slipping , which may lead to further violence . The US and the EU must work in complete harmony over this , but given Albania \u2019 s European aspirations the EU must take the lead .
