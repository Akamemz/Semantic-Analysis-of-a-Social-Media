His \u201cClimate Action Plan\u201d is neither necessary nor effective, but it will be costly.\n\nBy promoting limits on greenhouse-gas emissions from U.S. power plants while increasing \u201cgreen\u201d-energy incentives, the president is trying to steer our energy choices away from the free-market course and toward the direction of his liking.\n\nThis is a dangerous undertaking, and one with a far-from-certain outcome. Government intervention in financial markets was the root of the Great Recession. Government intervention in the energy market carries an even greater risk, as energy drives everything.\n\nThe justification for this risk is just not there.\n\nU.S. greenhouse-gas emissions are already on the decline and have been for about a decade now. The majority of this downward trend is not the result of government regulations restricting greenhouse-gas emissions, but rather technological innovations in the energy industry. Techniques such has horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking, have opened expansive natural gas and oil reserves that were considered unrecoverable only a few years ago.\n\nConsequently, cheap, reliable electricity produced by coal is being replaced by even cheaper, reliable electricity from natural gas.\n\nBecause of its chemical makeup, natural gas, when burned, produces about half the amount of greenhouse gas emissions as burning coal. Therefore, as natural gas replaces coal as fuel for generating electricity, our greenhouse-gas emissions fall.\n\nGranted, this is an unforeseen outcome. Natural gas fracking was developed to produce a cheaper fuel and outperform the competition, not to produce less greenhouse-gas emissions. The net result, though, is exactly the type of outcome that Mr. Obama wants to happen \u2014 a reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions \u2014 and it has been achieved without government incentives, taxes, or restrictions.\n\nAll the government had to do was stay out of the way.\n\nIn fact, it is arguable that had the government imposed regulations handicapping fossil fuels, these production techniques \u2014 now a cornerstone of Mr. Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan \u2014 may never have been fully developed as research efforts could have been diverted elsewhere.\n\nGreenhouse-gas emissions in the U.S. are falling at a rate that is greater than the one laid out in the president\u2019s plan. So why get involved at all?\n\nWhen it comes to significantly slowing human-caused climate change \u2014 the reason for the Climate Action Plan in the first place \u2014 none of this matters anyway.\n\nScientific research suggests that global warming is proceeding, and will continue, at a slower pace, with fewer negative impacts than current projections indicate, including those underlying the president\u2019s plan. On top of this, the U.S. relative contribution to climate change is declining year after year as greenhouse-gas emissions from developing nations, such as China, expand rapidly.\n\nTogether, this means that the president\u2019s plan for reducing emissions in the United States effectively will have no impact on the local, regional or global climate.
