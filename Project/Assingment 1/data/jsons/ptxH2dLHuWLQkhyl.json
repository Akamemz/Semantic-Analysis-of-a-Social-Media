However , the provision was changed so that plans that undergo `` significant changes '' could lose that special status .\nThe IRS document estimated that `` 40 percent to 67 percent '' of policies would in fact lose the status , meaning customers could be kicked off those plans because they do n't meet minimum coverage requirements .
