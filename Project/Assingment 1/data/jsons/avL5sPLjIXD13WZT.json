    "content": "On three separate occasions this July , staffers for Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) began preparing for the rollout of his new single-payer health care bill .\nBut every time they started to do so , Senate Republicans would improbably revive their push to repeal Obamacare \u2014 and Sanders \u2019 s team would postpone the launch of their \u201c Medicare-for-all \u201d campaign , according to aides to the Vermont senator .\n\u201c Bernie has repeated to us over and over and over again , \u2018 Our top priority is doing everything in our power to make sure 20 million people don \u2019 t lose their health care , \u2019 \u201d said Ari Rabin-Havt , a senior adviser to Sanders .\nThis was something of a relief to some Democrats . Just last year , the party warily eyed Sanders as a potential liability as much as a potential ally . After all , he has repeatedly insisted that Obamacare was , at best , a way station on the road to single-payer .\n\u201c Obamacare was a small victory for the uninsured , but it is time to take the fight against inadequate coverage even further , \u201d he said .\nAfter the election , some feared the Vermont independent would continue to torch Obamacare \u2019 s inadequacies , while turning his passionate followers against the Democratic Party .\nBut at least during the Obamacare repeal fight in Congress , Sanders was a team player . He brought crowds to dozens of rallies with Senate Democrats who had once opposed him . He shut a Republican attempt to expose Democrats \u2019 divisions , despite the interest of some of his team . And , perhaps most importantly , he marshaled his resources and newfound star power in defense of Democrats \u2019 top priority : showing what it might look like for his movement to be incorporated into the party apparatus , rather than having it try to knock down its gates .\n\u201c Our job today is to defend the Affordable Care Act , \u201d Sanders said at several of his rallies this year . `` Our job tomorrow is to create a Medicare-for-all single-payer system . \u201d\nSanders \u2019 s rallies with Democrats kick off a campaign to save Obamacare\nThe Vermont senator \u2019 s defense of the law didn \u2019 t come out of nowhere . In the early evening hours of December 9 , 2016 , roughly a dozen Sanders staffers crowded around a conference table in room 332 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building .\nIt was one of their first strategy meetings since the election . Sanders told them that they were being tasked with getting \u201c out in front \u201d of Republicans \u2019 health care agenda , according to aides who attended the meeting . At that point , nobody knew what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would propose \u2014 or if he \u2019 d propose anything at all . Sanders said he wanted the assembled aides , including his chief of staff and senior aides , to preemptively plan on holding health care rallies in states across the country focused on defending the Affordable Care Act .\nSanders \u2019 s team left the meeting baffled by the request . One wondered how they were expected to draw crowds to rallies over an unknown bill . \u201c We walked out of it and said , \u2018 How are we going to do this ? This is crazy , \u2019 \u201d one recalled .\nThey started in the freezing cold . On January 15 , as temperatures hit the low teens , Sanders joined Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( NY ) and Michigan Sens . Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters onstage at Macomb County Community College . Eight thousand people showed up .\n\u201c Sanders knew he had a unique megaphone in American politics , and he used it to shout it at the top of his lungs at a time when few were paying attention to the health care fight , \u201d said Ben Wikler , Washington director of MoveOn.org .\nHe kept shouting . In Portland , Maine , long before Sen. Susan Collins ( R-ME ) proved a crucial health care \u201c no \u201d vote , about 1,000 people watched Sanders decry the bill . After his favored candidate lost the contentious race to lead the Democratic National Committee , Sanders led an eight-state , 6,000-mile tour with new DNC Chair Tom Perez to kill \u201c Trumpcare. \u201d For two days in June , his team and its gray van traveled 348 miles in Appalachia to build public opposition to the Republican health bill .\nActivists say that proved a crucial step in showing Democratic lawmakers that the public would join them in fighting for the ACA .\n\u201c There were thousands of people at these rallies \u2014 in state after state after state after state . It was transformative for Democratic senators to see , \u201d said Wikler . \u201c They learned that people will show up , even in the bitter cold , to fight for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which had once been written off as an unpopular and potentially doomed chunk of the Obama legacy . \u201d\nAs the debate over the Senate Republican bill stretched from one month to four , and then from four months to seven , Sanders resisted the temptation to make his whirlwind tour across the country primarily about single-payer health care .\n\u201c Throughout this whole thing , there was always the temptation to pivot to make a stronger case for Medicare-for-all , rather than keeping the ACA at the center of our focus , \u201d one aide recalled . \u201c Bernie always insisted to us : \u2018 No , no , no . \u2019 \u201d\nIn March , Sanders was already promising to \u201c soon \u201d announce his single-payer bill . It still hasn \u2019 t been released .\nRepublicans even tried to force the single-payer out of him . On July 26 , Sen. Steve Daines ( R-MT ) announced he would introduce a single-payer amendment in an upcoming vote-a-rama that he himself opposed . Daines \u2019 s amendment was an attempt to splinter the Democratic caucus , thereby exposing the minority party \u2019 s divisions on how to reform the health care system .\nAt least some members of Sanders \u2019 s team saw it as a golden opportunity .\n\u201c There were definitely people \u2014 both inside and outside our office \u2014 who were saying , \u2018 This is it ! This is what we 've been waiting for ! \u2019 \u201d one Sanders aide said .\nAfter speaking with Schumer , Sanders himself shut down the idea , telling his staffers that they would not be going along with Daines \u2019 s gambit . Sanders and all but five Democratic senators abstained from the vote , and the story was quickly buried . \u201c Bernie \u2019 s instinct immediately was to say , \u2018 We 're not going to engage on this , \u2019 \u201d according to the aide .\nAs Sanders barnstormed across the country to defend Obamacare , his rallies looked like a new fusion in the party \u2014 partly the Sanders faithful , but they were complemented by organizations and voters who had been faithful to Hillary Clinton too .\nAbout 10 minutes after Sanders concluded one speech in downtown Pittsburgh in late June , Jared McCray and his sister remained behind the crowd . They looked out at the empty stage where Sanders had just stood .\n\u201c This is about people \u2019 s lives , \u201d said McCray , echoing a line from Sanders \u2019 s speech .\nBoth had refused to support Clinton in the general election . \u201c We have no regrets \u201d about sitting out the election , said McCray , 24 , a touch defensively .\nA few feet away from them stood Dean Ofran , 54 . A lifelong Pittsburgh resident , Ofran had voted for Clinton in the primary , though he said he harbored no animus toward the Vermont senator .\n\u201c Of course I support single-payer \u2014 the primary wasn \u2019 t about that , \u201d Ofran said . \u201c I just didn \u2019 t think he could beat Trump . I still don \u2019 t think he could . \u201d\nIt was a similar story in West Virginia . In the crowd in Charleston , two young men \u2014 Sean McAllister , 18 , and Sean Hill , 17 \u2014 said they both cast write-in ballots for Sanders in the general election . Though they wouldn \u2019 t vote for Hillary Clinton , they had showed up to a rally to defend Obamacare , in part because they feared the impacts of the Republican bill \u2019 s Medicaid cuts . The \u201c Bernie or Bust \u201d voters who wouldn \u2019 t defend President Barack Obama \u2019 s legacy against Trump last November now , suddenly , were .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been trying to persuade my mom that she was misled by Trump and that Bernie wouldn \u2019 t betray her like this , \u201d Hill said .\nThe work behind the scenes also reflected how Sanders \u2019 s tour for Obamacare patched up the old party divisions , at least temporarily .\nOn the ground , Sanders \u2019 s campaign helped endear him to local Democrats who once implacably opposed his candidacy . \u201c There were a significant number of Clinton people who were there , \u201d said Joe Meyer , the mayor of Covington , in an interview about a Sanders rally in his city . \u201c They certainly didn \u2019 t stay home \u2014 and I think that tells you something . It shows the appeal of the message and the substance of the issue . \u201d\nIn late February , Sanders spoke at a dinner of the Kansas Democratic Party . He appeared onstage not just with Schumer and Stabenow , both of whom endorsed Clinton , but with Tom Perez and other Clinton backers such as Sens . Chris Van Hollen ( MD ) , Kamala Harris ( CA ) , Kirsten Gillibrand ( NY ) , and Chris Murphy ( CT ) .\nPlanned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in the primary , leading to an ugly public rift with Sanders in January 2016 . But during the Obamacare fight , the two were closely allied . Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards appeared with Sanders and Perez at a rally in Nevada , and Planned Parenthood volunteers stood alongside Sanders \u2019 s supporters at events around the country . In last Thursday \u2019 s rally outside the Capitol , Sanders returned the favor and specifically thanked Richards and Planned Parenthood \u2014 another sign that the party \u2019 s internal grievances had been patched up , at least as long as Senate Republicans \u2019 bill hung overhead .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Matt Yglesias noted , Sanders is doing everything you \u2019 d expect him to do in order to run in 2020 . He \u2019 s beefed up his Washington staff , is working to build a national organization called Our Revolution , and has held rallies across the country that still draw thousands of people .\nPerhaps most importantly , he \u2019 s shifted some of his policy positions to the center , while also retaining what separates him from most national Democrats .\n\u201c Sanders has deeply engaged his base using Medicare-for-all while reconfiguring other elements of his platform into something more moderate than the one he actually ran on and for which a much stronger electability argument can be made , \u201d Yglesias wrote . \u201c In subtle ways he \u2019 s shifted his policy commitments to the center , making himself a more broadly acceptable figure in the party . \u201d\nBut even as he reaches a detente with national Democrats , Sanders continues to try to revive the movement beyond Washington that fueled his primary campaign . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Ezra Klein noted , Sanders ran for office believing that President Obama \u2019 s core failure was in surrendering the \u201c outside game \u201d \u2014 that Democrats had to learn to take their message far beyond Capitol Hill for it to impact Washington .\n`` The major political , strategic difference I have with Obama , '' Sanders told \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Andrew Prokop way back in 2014 , `` is it \u2019 s too late to do anything inside the Beltway . You got ta take your case to the American people , mobilize them , and organize them at the grassroots level in a way that we have never done before . ''\nSanders is now determined to transform his movement campaign to save Obamacare into one to pressure Democrats to embrace Medicare-for-all . On Wednesday , the Guardian \u2019 s Lauren Gambino reported that Sanders had started a six-figure digital advertising campaign on Facebook and Google to generate public \u201c co-sponsors \u201d of his single-payer bill . He \u2019 s sent a message to supporters asking for ideas about the plan , and is expected to soon hold rallies to push explicitly for Medicare-for-all .\nPrivately , Senate Democratic staffers were thankful that Sanders brought the \u201c outside game \u201d to Obamacare \u2019 s defense . But when he does so this September , it may not be as much to national Democrats \u2019 liking .\n\u201c What you saw was a rising up of the American people , \u201d Sanders told Chris Hayes after Republicans failed to pass their bill . \u201c That \u2019 s why it was a victory . \u201d",
