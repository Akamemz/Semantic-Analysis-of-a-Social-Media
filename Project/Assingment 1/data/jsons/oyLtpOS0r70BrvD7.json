Four Americans were killed in the attack , including U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens .\nThe internal email on Sept. 14 , 2012 , was to White House press officials from Ben Rhodes , President Obama \u2019 s assistant and deputy national security adviser . In the email , Mr. Rhodes listed as a \u201c goal \u201d the White House desire \u201c To underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video , and not a broader failure or policy . \u201d\nThe email was titled , \u201c RE : PREP CALL with Susan , Saturday at 4:00 pm ET \u201d and covered White House involvement in preparing Ms. Rice , then-U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , for her upcoming appearance on Sunday television talk shows .\nThat email and others provide the clearest evidence to date that top presidential aides sought to use anti-American protests sweeping across the Middle East in 2012 \u2014 as well as the aftermath of the Benghazi terrorist attack \u2014 to push an image of President Obama \u2019 s foreign policy as \u201c steady and statesmanlike , \u201d just weeks before his re-election .\nMr. Carney said the White House withheld the Rhodes memo from congressional and media inquiries because \u201c it was explicitly not about Benghazi . \u201d\n\u201c The overall issue of unrest in the Muslim world and the danger posed by these protests \u2026 was very much a topic in the news , \u201d Mr. Carney said .
