Now , if the House has ideas on how to improve the Senate bill , let \u2019 s hear them . Let \u2019 s start the negotiations . But let \u2019 s not leave this problem to keep festering for another year , or two years , or three years . This can and should get done by the end of this year . \u201d\nAnd yet Obama spent the bulk of his 20-minute address taking whack after whack at the same House Republicans he \u2019 ll need to pass that agenda , culminating in a jab at the GOP over the results of the 2012 election \u2014 and a dare to do better next time .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t like a particular policy or a particular president ? Then argue for your position , \u201d Obama said . \u201c Go out there and win an election . Push to change it . But don \u2019 t break it .
