Bush was more effective at managing the federal government . Thirty-eighty percent named Bush , while 35 percent preferred Obama . A quarter of respondents said the two men were equally competent .\n- Ebola : Only 22 percent of respondents said they had a lot of confidence that the government is doing everything it can to contain the contagious disease .
