Don \u2019 t be fooled \u2014 they \u2019 re very much related .\nThe first was a rather surprising result in a presidential poll of New Mexico , a state Democrats have carried in five of the last six presidential elections ( George W. Bush won a 49.8-to-49.0 squeaker over John Kerry in 2004 ) . The Land of Enchantment wasn \u2019 t supposed to be much of a battleground in this year \u2019 s campaign , but nevertheless the Reuters/Ipsos survey popped out a 43-38 lead there for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton on Sunday . And while that result could be dismissed due to a small sample size ( Reuters/Ipsos polled New Mexico as part of a larger series of survey data and there were only 141 respondents ) , the findings in that poll echoed those of another similar survey done a week earlier by Morning Consult which had Trump ahead of Clinton 43-40 in a two-way race and in a virtual tie ( 35.9-34.7 for Clinton ) in a four-way race which includes Gary Johnson , the former governor of that state .\nTrump carrying New Mexico would be a major shock . The findings of those two polls are unusual . On the other hand , there are lots of other state polls over the past week which indicate the real estate magnate is pulling even or surpassing the former first lady and holder of high government offices with little positive result \u2014 ahead in Iowa , Nevada , Florida , Ohio , and Colorado ; within striking distance in Michigan and Virginia .\nAnd the second ? You know about the second , which is that in Minnesota , New York , and New Jersey a familiar pattern played out . That being an atrocity or attempt at same perpetrated by a Muslim immigrant from a hostile alien society following an ISIS or Al Qaeda playbook to attempt a mass killing of unarmed innocents , together with stupid politicians denying the obvious nature of the act and then insultingly admonishing against reprisals by unwashed Americans .\nIn New York and New Jersey , the suspect \u2019 s name is James Smith . Just kidding \u2014 it \u2019 s Ahmad Khan Rahami , and he comes , just as Orlando shooter Omar Mateen did , from Afghanistan . We don \u2019 t know much about Rahami yet , though we do know that he was a plaintiff in a failed lawsuit alleging that the fried-chicken joint his family owned in Elizabeth , New Jersey was persecuted by local officials because of Islamophobia and not because of the loud noise and sketchy activity happening there 24 hours a day . Having found no purchase for his grievances against the infidels through the American legal system , the 28-year old instead decided to leave a number of Boston Marathon-style pressure cooker bombs scattered across the tristate landscape . One in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea went off in a dumpster Saturday night , wounding two dozen people . The others , thankfully , did not .\nAnd in Minnesota , a Somali by the name of Dahir Adan went on a crazed rampage through the Crossroads Mall in the Minneapolis suburb of St . Cloud , bellowing \u201c Allahu Akbar \u201d as he stabbed nine people before an off-duty cop and concealed-carry instructor named Jason Falconer turned Adan into a martyr for the jihadist cause with a few well-placed shots from his pistol .\nShortly after this NRA commercial played out in real life , Minnesota \u2019 s loony leftist governor Mark Dayton took to the local airwaves to proactively denounce any retribution against that state \u2019 s Muslims . \u201c I ask everyone in the St . Cloud area and throughout Minnesota to rise above this atrocity and act to make religious and racial tolerance one of the ways in which Minnesotans again lead our country , \u201d said the governor . Dayton \u2019 s statements essentially warning the citizens terrorized by an attacker ISIS lauded as a Soldier of Allah were echoed by the Minneapolis Star Tribune , which published an article \u2014 and then removed it \u2014 decrying the \u201c anti-Muslim tensions \u201d in St . Cloud , where there is a sizable unassimilated Somali population .\nBack in the Big Apple , New York mayor Bill de Blasio \u2019 s reaction to the Chelsea bombing was marked by a definitive aversion to labeling it jihadist terrorism . Hot Air has a terrific chronicle of the bumbling Sandinista veteran \u2019 s attempts to wish away Rahami \u2019 s evil deeds , including this keeper of an initial quote\u2026\n\u201c Here is what we know : It was intentional , it was a violent act , it was certainly a criminal act , it was a bombing \u2014 that \u2019 s what we know , \u201d he said on Sunday , flanked by law enforcement officials at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan . \u201c To understand there were any specific motivations , political motivations , any connection to an organization \u2014 that \u2019 s what we don \u2019 t know . \u201d\nDe Blasio said on MSNBC Monday morning , after members of a suspected terror cell had been arrested at a New Jersey train station in connection with the bombings and Rahami \u2019 s name and photo were about to be released to the public ( not long thereafter Rahami was found sleeping in a vestibule of a Linden , New Jersey watering hole , and local police apprehended him after a brief gun battle ) that he was \u201c leaning toward \u201d terrorism .\nMeanwhile , the Democrats \u2019 presidential candidate appeared over the weekend in front of cameras on her campaign plane to discuss what she called the bombings , in such a state giving one cause to wonder whether she herself was the one who got bombed . After describing them as such , Clinton then took a question asking whether it was appropriate for Donald Trump to have characterized them as bombings and proceeded to trash Trump as jumping to conclusions .
