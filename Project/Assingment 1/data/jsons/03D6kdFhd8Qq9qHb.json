    "content": "A Bay Area Assemblyman got an earful last week as he pushed a largely symbolic bill that would have made it legal for California public employees to be members of the Communist Party . Rob Bonta of Oakland contritely withdrew the measure , which had passed out of committee , after leaders from the state \u2019 s large Vietnamese community gave him an earful .\nI know of no public employee who had been fired for such membership , or for virtually any reason for that matter . Nevertheless , conservatives took the bait and one mentioned the threat from North Korean and Chinese communists . But it \u2019 s not like they are flooding the Department of General Services with job applications . It was typical Sacramento , as Democrats introduce meaningless legislation designed to burnish their progressive credentials .\nAs I argued in my Orange County Register column , California has many problems \u2014 none of which are the doing of avowed communists in state government . Instead of worrying about this nonsense , Republicans should be gearing up to fight a frightening Bonta-coauthored bill that makes no direct reference to communism , but apparently was inspired by the same kind of thinking despite its benign name , \u201c The Healthy California Act . \u201d\nThe legislation would toss out our existing , quasi-private health care marketplace and replace it with a mandatory , universal single-payer system . Everyone would get \u201c free \u201d health care \u2014 even people residing in the state illegally . It would create a new state bureaucracy run by a nine-member panel appointed by legislators and which includes union members . Legislators proudly declared that the bill would make health care in California a \u201c right . \u201d\nThis is crazy stuff , but it easily passed out of the Senate health committee . And support for Senate Bill 562 or something like it is becoming a line in the sand for Democrats . At the Democratic Party convention last weekend , the big news was the hundreds of activists who lobbied the party to embrace a single-payer plan . Even the foul-mouthed outgoing chairman of the party John Burton told the demonstrators to shut the f * * * up or go outside . Burton is a San Francisco lefty , showing just how far to the Left the state party keeps going .\nOK , it \u2019 s not going to become law anytime soon . Elements of the hastily drafted bill would need to go before voters , and it \u2019 s unlikely that even Californians would toss aside their health care and dive into the deep unknown .

But this is indeed the next \u201c big \u201d thing here .\nThe most telling part of the debate came early in the week when the Senate Appropriations Committee released a staff report analyzing the costs of the bill in anticipation of a committee vote . Even in this land of free money , the report \u2019 s conclusions were stunning \u2014 and enough to send the bill to the \u201c suspense \u201d file for further financial review .\nAccording to the appropriations committee report , this legislation would have annual costs of about $ 400 billion .
