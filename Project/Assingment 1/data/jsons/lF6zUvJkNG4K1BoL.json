    "content": "It was only a few months ago that someone last treated Cassie Johns like a freak .\nDuring a doctor \u2019 s office visit in February , she was asked to list her emergency contacts . Johns , a preschool teacher in Seattle , wrote down two people -- Chris and Joan -- and identified both as her \u201c partners. \u201d They are two of the four romantic interests Johns has been involved with for many years .\n\u201c \u2018 Oh , that \u2019 s so dirty , \u2019 \u201d Johns recalled the receptionist saying . \u201c And the receptionist literally stepped back from me , in a doctor \u2019 s office . \u201d\nJohns , 58 , is a polyamorist . She follows a non-monogamous lifestyle in which multiple partners give each other consent to date and have sex with others . Johns \u2019 s longest polyamorous relationship has lasted 36 years , twice as long as her former marriage to a polyamorous man . She talks openly about her partners to her preschool students and others .\n\u201c I have lost jobs , I \u2019 ve lost an apartment , I \u2019 ve lost a car loan , \u201d because of her lifestyle , Johns said . \u201c I \u2019 ve lost friendly relations with neighbors . \u201d\nDespite the acceptance of campus hook-up culture and Tinder-arranged trysts , more intentional forms of consensual non-monogamy \u2013 which can include polygamy , polyamory , open marriages , group marriages , swinging and \u201c relationship anarchy \u201d \u2013 are highly stigmatized . Such behavior is widely considered to be abusive , immoral , or emotionally stunted . People in such relationships not only face rudeness and public shaming , they also lack legal protections against discrimination in employment , housing and child custody disputes .\nPolyamorists distinguish their lifestyle from cheating and adultery because , they say , it hinges on the consent of all parties , and can involve unmarried people . Activists say such behavior is more common than many people presume . Some studies suggest that as many as a fifth of Americans have engaged in consensual non-monogamy at some point in their lives . The studies show that at any given time , an estimated 4 % to 5 % of the population is in a consensually non-monogamous relationship .\nKatie Hill in a pro-equality appearance in California -- before her fledgling congressional career was brought up short by allegations of being involved in a \u201c throuple \u201d including a staffer .\nWhile the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing are expected to put a temporary damper on polyamory , those numbers could rise if the social disincentives were removed \u2013 in part because some adulterers and cheaters could become consensual non-monogamists .\nActivists are moving to dismantle the legal and social barriers , and say their goals are beginning to take shape .\nThey are laying the groundwork to have their cause become the next domino to fall in a long line of civil rights victories secured by trans people , gays , lesbians , women and blacks . Not too long ago , those marginalized groups were also viewed as unnatural , depraved or inferior , until negative judgments became socially unacceptable and often illegal .\nThe aspirations of non-monogamists don \u2019 t sound like such a moonshot in an increasingly tolerant society where a transgender man can menstruate and experience childbirth , and Pete Buttigieg , a gay man married to another man , can make a serious run for U.S. president .\nAs the topic breaks into the mainstream , some churches are beginning to grapple with the issue , and polyamorous students are forming university clubs and organizing events . Last fall polyamory got attention , some of it sympathetic , when California Rep. Katie Hill , was forced to resign over allegations she was having an affair with a campaign staffer in a \u201c throuple \u201d with her then-husband . A recent TV episode of \u201c House Hunters '' featured three adults searching for a home to build their polyamorous nest , and Hollywood celebrities are opening up about their polyamorous lifestyles as well .\nLifestyle personality Aubrey Marcus says he has been in an open relationship with his fiance Whitney Miller since 2013 . He gives advice on ethical non-monogamy on his website .\n\u201c There is plenty of evidence that consensual non-monogamy is an emerging civil rights movement , \u201d said Heath Schechinger , a counseling psychologist at the University of California , Berkeley , and co-chair of the Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force , recently created within the American Psychological Association . \u201c I 've heard from a number of people advocating for relationship structure diversity over the past 20 years who are elated about this issue finally gaining traction . \u201d\nActivists are already working with elected officials in more than a dozen local governments , especially in California , to expand local anti-discrimination ordinances to include a new protected class , \u201c relationship structure , \u201d said Berkeley psychologist and poly activist Dave Doleshal .\nMost efforts are at the informal stage but the city of Berkeley did consider a formal proposal to extend protections in housing , employment , business practices , city facilities or education to swingers , polyamorists and other non-monogamists . The proposal stalled last year amid concerns that it would have required employers to provide health insurance to numerous sexual and romantic partners outside of marriage .\nPro-polyamory marchers in San Francisco in 2004 . Especially in California , there are moves afoot to expand local anti-discrimination ordinances to include a new protected class : \u201c relationship structure . \u201d\nUndaunted by that setback , advocates continue to generate a body of ideas and theories that normalize non-monogamy as a form of positive sexuality -- and possibly an identity -- following a script followed by other marginalized groups . Their efforts have led to reassessments of non-monogamy in the psychological and legal fields , contending the relationships are emotionally healthy and ethical , and thus forging a social movement with a shared identity , shared vocabulary , shared history and a shared desire for full recognition .\nOver the past two decades , nearly 600 academic papers have been written on the subject of non-monogamy , according to one count , including an assessment of the benefits to children in polyamorous families . Such research creates a body of scholarship to counteract ingrained social attitudes that poly advocates call prejudices and misconceptions . At the same time , the field has spawned more than 50 books , mostly written by women , said Kenneth Haslam , 85 , a retired anesthesiologist and polyamorist in Durham , N.C. , who helped create the polyamory history archive at the Kinsey Institute in Bloomington , Ind .\nBrian Watson , author of \u201c Annals of Pornographie : How Porn Became \u2018 Bad \u2019 \u201d ( 2016 ) , is co-authoring a book on non-monogamy throughout history . He said it will feature 50 to 100 prominent figures , such as Victor Hugo and Virginia Woolf , and is deliberately modeled on earlier works about famous gay people .\nJust as women \u2019 s rights grew from feminist legal theory and LGBTQ rights from queer theory , non-monogamy is also developing its own historiography , scholarship and theoretical frameworks .\nThe polyamory flag . Advocates are laying the groundwork to have their cause become the next domino to fall in a long line of civil rights victories secured by trans people , gays , lesbians , women and blacks .\nStill , it 's not easy to pinpoint a polyamorist profile . They are less likely to identify as heterosexual or to conform to gender norms , but academic studies and anecdotal evidence do n't tell a single story . While some non-monogamists consider themselves neo-pagans , anarchists or socialists , others are libertarians or outwardly conventional suburbanites . Some studies say the lifestyle attracts more men , others say more women ; some say it appeals to affluent whites , others say a polyamorist 's average annual income is under $ 40,000 .\nIn the legal arena , sympathetic scholars are arguing for the extension of legal reforms adopted in family law in recent decades in response to the continued erosion of the nuclear family , which is no longer America \u2019 s dominant family structure .\nAt least a dozen states now recognize or allow for the possibility of a child having more than two parents , an accommodation for surrogate parents , grandparents , stepparents and other nontraditional families , according to a February legal article by Edward Stein , a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York .\nThese expansions of the legal concept of family are potential pathways for non-monogamous families to win legal rights of their own , Stein said . Another potential legal opening could be the existing precedents in domestic partnerships and civil unions that were set up locally for gays and lesbians before same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 . In both cases , legal victories for one group could be extended to another group , a common way that legal developments happen , he said .\nThe first steps would likely have to be decriminalizing of adultery in the 38 states that don \u2019 t distinguish between consensual and non-consensual non-monogamy . The prohibition of adultery is comparable to anti-sodomy laws whose repeal by the Supreme Court in 2003 cleared an obstacle for recognizing gay marriage , Stein said .\nThe 1961 science fiction classic often cited as an inspiration by non-monogamists .\n\u201c I think what we will see is a lot of chipping away at the edges of some of the restrictions we put on what a family is and what a family does , \u201d said Janet W. Hardy , who has written on polyamory for more than 20 years . \u201c When the legal challenge comes \u2013 and it will \u2013 I don \u2019 t think it will be from people who identify themselves as poly . I think it will come from blended families and some of the other ways that we are reforming around the idea of family that are legally challenging . \u201d\nOne such example was a recent effort by Hartford , Conn. , authorities to evict eight adults and three children living as a single family in a 6,000-square-foot mansion .\nThe combined family was not polyamorous , said their lawyer , Peter Goselin , but shared financial , domestic and child-rearing responsibilities . In 2014 the city alleged a violation of its zoning rules for single-family homes , but after two years of litigation , the city dropped its case .\nThe joint owners and residents of the home claimed a constitutional right to define a family . The octet \u2019 s lawsuit against the city includes a brief history of communal family living , from Iroquois longhouses , which housed up to 20 family units , to the communes , cooperatives and collective households of the 19th and 20th centuries .\n\u201c They saw the implications of it , \u201d Goselin said . \u201c Privately they said to me we know this would be encouraging to a lot of people who are in polyamorous relationships . \u201d\nAdvocates say that the warnings against the perils of non-monogamy echo the now-debunked concerns about same-sex marriage .\n\u201c All of the well-known objections made against multi-person intimate relationships can be made against same- or opposite-sex monogamy as well , resulting in an indefensible double standard , \u201d Ronald C. Den Otter , a political science professor at California Polytechnic Institute wrote in a 2015 article in the Emory Law Review . \u201c Sadly , many two-person intimate relationships are dysfunctional , and a closer , more brutally honest look at them should not inspire confidence in their superiority . \u201d\nOnce changes get under way , things can move quickly . The rise of the modern gay rights movement in the mid-20th century led to a decision by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973 to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders ( gender dysphoria was de-pathologized in 2012 ) . Those medical reversals are seen as analogous to the American Psychological Association \u2019 s creation last year of its Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force , formed to destigmatize such relationships and explore changes in public policy .\nSchechinger , the task force co-chair , said it \u2019 s much easier to stereotype and hate a marginalized group when people in the normative majority operate by stereotypes and misinformation .\n\u201c That \u2019 s part of what the task force is seeking to accomplish \u2013 to gather empirical data , promote accurate information about CNM relationships , and ask if these relationships are causing harm or are not , \u201d he said . \u201c And what are the implications on society for promoting a one-size-fits-all model versus promoting people being in touch with what \u2019 s the good fit for them . \u201d\nAs with the debates over human nature during the gay rights struggle , non-monogamy advocates are also raising the possibility that desiring multiple sexual partners is less a lifestyle choice and more of a sexual orientation . But there can be little doubt that non-monogamy , the norm in the animal kingdom , is natural , and that monogamy is a cultural ideal that developed in humans .\nBut the yen for sexual variety and adventure competes with an equally insistent bugbear : jealousy . And some believe that \u201c green-eyed monster of jealousy \u201d is the more powerful force , making it unlikely that most people could tolerate consensual non-monogamy for their partners and accept it is a social norm .\nKay Hymowitz : \u201c Normalizing consensual non-monogamy will become yet another way to \u2018 privilege \u2019 male desire . \u201d\n\u201c In the long run there \u2019 s going to be some resistance because it \u2019 s threatening to everybody else , because they recognize the desire for multiple partners is something they have , too , \u201d said David Barash , a zoologist and a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle , and author of \u201c The Myth of Monogamy : Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People \u201d ( 2001 ) . \u201c They recognize it touches something within themselves that they \u2019 d rather keep hidden . And something in their partner that they don \u2019 t want to acknowledge , either . \u201d\nKay Hymowitz , a scholar at the conservative Manhattan Institute , is also skeptical . Her concern is the unintended harmful consequences of disrupting long-established social norms developed to ensure that men commit to rearing their own children , and that powerful , wealthy men don \u2019 t hoard women and create a deficit of available options for other males . \u201c Normalizing consensual non-monogamy will become yet another way to \u2018 privilege \u2019 male desire , \u201d she said . \u201c I know , I know : There are women who believe strongly in consensual non-monogamy [ and who ] may truly be happier in those relationships than they would be in vanilla relationships . Good for them . But they are a small minority . \u201d\nHymowitz said that the individual rights of polyamorists , swingers and commune members have to be weighed against the greater social interest , and that case has yet to be made .\n\u201c You \u2019 re creating one more arrangement that will be less stable for children and less permanent , \u201d she said . We have enough problems as it is keeping couples together . \u201d\nNonetheless , longer life expectancies , greater personal freedoms for women , dating apps and the internet are transforming sexual expectations and sexual opportunities , said Elisabeth \u201c Eli \u201d Sheff , CEO of Sheff Consulting in Chattanooga , Tenn. , which specializes in sex and gender minorities , and provides expert witness services and relationship coaching . She \u2019 s also the author of the 2014 book , \u201c The Polyamorists Next Door : Inside Multiple-Partner Relationships and Families , \u201d based on a longitudinal study of more than 500 polyamorists .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t live in a monogamous society . We live in a society in which people pretend monogamy is the norm , \u201d said Johns , the Seattle polyamorist who offered the poly mantra that it \u2019 s possible to romantically love more than one friend just as it \u2019 s possible to love more than one child .\nNon-monogamy has a long history , more ancient than King David \u2019 s multiple wives and concubines in the Old Testament . Today \u2019 s non-monogamists often cite as their inspiration novelist Robert Heinlein \u2019 s treatment of the subject in his 1961 sci-fi classic \u201c Stranger in a Strange Land. \u201d Gay men are sometimes hailed as trend setters because they are accustomed to flexible \u201c monogamish \u201d marital arrangements that allow for outside dalliances .\nThe Bible includes numerous instances of non-monogamy , including King Solomon , depicted in his old age being led astray into idolatry by his wives .\nOne of the primary texts associated with the contemporary movement is Janet W. Hardy and Dossie Easton \u2019 s 1997 \u201c The Ethical Slut \u201d which lays out the best practices for what advocates hold up as consensual , ethical and responsible non-monogamy .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it has ever had the groundswell that it has now , \u201d said Hardy , who now is running into polyamorous adults brought up by polyamorous parents . \u201c A lot of us are second-generation now . \u201d\nPoly activists point to many parallels between earlier movements that were born underground and operated under the radar : secret clubs , insider argot , referral networks for poly-friendly therapists , doctors and lawyers . The National Coalition for Sexual Freedom 's Kink and Poly Aware Professionals referral list includes about 300 lawyers , said Susan Wright , the Baltimore-based organization 's executive director .\nThe world of polyamory overlaps with the subculture of kink and BDSM , which refers to the erotic practices of bondage , domination , submission and sadomasochism . As a sign of the movement \u2019 s maturation , some now embrace the kind of middle-class respectability that made gay marriage palatable to mainstream society .\n`` We \u2019 re a very boring and respectable couple ! '' polyamorist Carrie Ichikawa Jenkins beamed to The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2017 . Jenkins , a University of British Columbia philosophy professor , has a husband and a boyfriend , both of whom teach at UBC . The Chronicle article paints a portrait of the polyamorous triad in domestic hues befitting Norman Rockwell : \u201c On the wall hang sepia-toned photographs of someone \u2019 s relatives . On the front porch are a swing and a coffee table with an ashtray on it . \u201d\n`` Love Outside the Box '' symbol on the polyamory Wikipedia page\nThe civil rights concerns of the non-monogamous and other minorities are dissimilar in some ways . Unlike earlier civil rights movements , non-monogamy has the potential of affecting a majority of the population , since membership in the group is theoretically open to everyone .\n\u201c In a way , poly is a deeper threat to the dominant culture than gay culture , \u201d said Geoffrey Miller , a polyamorist in an open marriage and a psychology professor at the University of New Mexico .\nMiller , a member of the APA task force , compares the state of non-monogamy movement to gay rights in 1966 , in the calm before the storm of the Stonewall Riots , the 1969 protests that launched the modern gay rights movement . The closeted movement had about 50 organizations in the late 1960s but exploded to 1,000 by the mid-1970s , said John D \u2019 Emilio , a retired professor at the University of Illinois , Chicago , who taught on the history of sexuality and the LGBTQ movement , and is co-author of \u201c Intimate Matters : A History of Sexuality in America \u201d ( 1988 ) .\nConservatives had long warned that redefining marriage to allow same-sex unions would throw open the door to allowing any kind of marriage , from polygamy to incest . Those arguments reached a crescendo when gay marriage was winding its way through the legal system , en route to the 2015 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage . In that 5-4 decision , Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a dissenting opinion warning of what was to come .\n\u201c It is striking how much of the majority \u2019 s reasoning would apply with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage , \u201d Roberts wrote . \u201c Why would there be any less dignity in the bond between three people who , in exercising their autonomy , seek to make the profound choice to marry ? \u201d\nRobert P. George , law professor : `` We have quickly gone from , \u2018 It will never happen , \u2019 to \u2018 You \u2019 re a bigot for thinking there is anything wrong with it . \u2019 \u201d\nPrinceton professor of jurisprudence Robert George was among those who warned of the slippery slope . In a 2015 article , he predicted that the civil rights challenges were inevitable , but initially judges would \u201c swat away on procedural grounds the first few constitutional challenges to marriage laws. \u201d Gradually the legal objections will give way to the force of logical consistency .\nHe told RealClearInvestigations in an email that this process is often characterized by indignant dismissal of the logical implications , followed by total capitulation .\n\u201c Of course , advocates of revising the law denounced us not only as \u2018 bigots \u2019 but as \u2018 scare-mongers , \u2019 \u201d George said . \u201c There was , they insisted , no \u2018 slippery slope \u2019 from same-sex marriage to polyamory . The two concepts had nothing to do with each other .\n\u201c I could see that this was nonsense \u2014 often disingenuous nonsense , \u201d George said . \u201c So I am not in the least surprised to see what is happening now . We have quickly gone from , \u2018 It will never happen , \u2019 to \u2018 You \u2019 re a bigot for thinking there is anything wrong with it . \u2019 \u201d",

I think it will come from blended families and some of the other ways that we are reforming around the idea of family that are legally challenging.\u201d\n\nOne such example was a recent effort by Hartford, Conn., authorities to evict eight adults and three children living as a single family in a 6,000-square-foot mansion.\n\nThe combined family was not polyamorous, said their lawyer, Peter Goselin, but shared financial, domestic and child-rearing responsibilities. In 2014 the city alleged a violation of its zoning rules for single-family homes, but after two years of litigation, the city dropped its case.\n\nThe joint owners and residents of the home claimed a constitutional right to define a family. The octet\u2019s lawsuit against the city includes a brief history of communal family living, from Iroquois longhouses, which housed up to 20 family units, to the communes, cooperatives and collective households of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\u201cThey saw the implications of it,\u201d Goselin said. \u201cPrivately they said to me we know this would be encouraging to a lot of people who are in polyamorous relationships.\u201d\n\nAdvocates say that the warnings against the perils of non-monogamy echo the now-debunked concerns about same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cAll of the well-known objections made against multi-person intimate relationships can be made against same- or opposite-sex monogamy as well, resulting in an indefensible double standard,\u201d Ronald C. Den Otter, a political science professor at California Polytechnic Institute wrote in a 2015 article in the Emory Law Review. \u201cSadly, many two-person intimate relationships are dysfunctional, and a closer, more brutally honest look at them should not inspire confidence in their superiority.\u201d\n\nPaul Mazursky's early Hollywood take on non-monogamy, 1969.\n\nOnce changes get under way, things can move quickly. The rise of the modern gay rights movement in the mid-20th century led to a decision by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973 to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders (gender dysphoria was de-pathologized in 2012). Those medical reversals are seen as analogous to the American Psychological Association\u2019s creation last year of its Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force, formed to destigmatize such relationships and explore changes in public policy.\n\nSchechinger, the task force co-chair, said it\u2019s much easier to stereotype and hate a marginalized group when people in the normative majority operate by stereotypes and misinformation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of what the task force is seeking to accomplish \u2013 to gather empirical data, promote accurate information about CNM relationships, and ask if these relationships are causing harm or are not,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what are the implications on society for promoting a one-size-fits-all model versus promoting people being in touch with what\u2019s the good fit for them.\u201d\n\nAs with the debates over human nature during the gay rights struggle, non-monogamy advocates are also raising the possibility that desiring multiple sexual partners is less a lifestyle choice and more of a sexual orientation. But there can be little doubt that non-monogamy, the norm in the animal kingdom, is natural, and that monogamy is a cultural ideal that developed in humans.\n\nBut the yen for sexual variety and adventure competes with an equally insistent bugbear: jealousy. And some believe that \u201cgreen-eyed monster of jealousy\u201d is the more powerful force, making it unlikely that most people could tolerate consensual non-monogamy for their partners and accept it is a social norm.\n\nKay Hymowitz: \u201cNormalizing consensual non-monogamy will become yet another way to \u2018privilege\u2019 male desire.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the long run there\u2019s going to be some resistance because it\u2019s threatening to everybody else, because they recognize the desire for multiple partners is something they have, too,\u201d said David Barash, a zoologist and a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle, and author of \u201cThe Myth of Monogamy: Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People\u201d (2001). \u201cThey recognize it touches something within themselves that they\u2019d rather keep hidden. And something in their partner that they don\u2019t want to acknowledge, either.\u201d\n\nKay Hymowitz, a scholar at the conservative Manhattan Institute, is also skeptical. Her concern is the unintended harmful consequences of disrupting long-established social norms developed to ensure that men commit to rearing their own children, and that powerful, wealthy men don\u2019t hoard women and create a deficit of available options for other males. \u201cNormalizing consensual non-monogamy will become yet another way to \u2018privilege\u2019 male desire,\u201d she said. \u201cI know, I know: There are women who believe strongly in consensual non-monogamy [and who] may truly be happier in those relationships than they would be in vanilla relationships. Good for them. But they are a small minority.\u201d\n\nHymowitz said that the individual rights of polyamorists, swingers and commune members have to be weighed against the greater social interest, and that case has yet to be made.\n\nWho was afraid of non-monogamy? Not Virginia Woolf\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re creating one more arrangement that will be less stable for children and less permanent,\u201d she said. We have enough problems as it is keeping couples together.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, longer life expectancies, greater personal freedoms for women, dating apps and the internet are transforming sexual expectations and sexual opportunities, said Elisabeth \u201cEli\u201d Sheff, CEO of Sheff Consulting in Chattanooga, Tenn., which specializes in sex and gender minorities, and provides expert witness services and relationship coaching. She\u2019s also the author of the 2014 book, \u201cThe Polyamorists Next Door: Inside Multiple-Partner Relationships and Families,\u201d based on a longitudinal study of more than 500 polyamorists.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t live in a monogamous society. We live in a society in which people pretend monogamy is the norm,\u201d said Johns, the Seattle polyamorist who offered the poly mantra that it\u2019s possible to romantically love more than one friend just as it\u2019s possible to love more than one child.\n\nNon-monogamy has a long history, more ancient than King David\u2019s multiple wives and concubines in the Old Testament. Today\u2019s non-monogamists often cite as their inspiration novelist Robert Heinlein\u2019s treatment of the subject in his 1961 sci-fi classic \u201cStranger in a Strange Land.\u201d Gay men are sometimes hailed as trend setters because they are accustomed to flexible \u201cmonogamish\u201d marital arrangements that allow for outside dalliances.\n\nThe Bible includes numerous instances of non-monogamy, including King Solomon, depicted in his old age being led astray into idolatry by his wives.\n\nOne of the primary texts associated with the contemporary movement is Janet W. Hardy and Dossie Easton\u2019s 1997 \u201cThe Ethical Slut\u201d which lays out the best practices for what advocates hold up as consensual, ethical and responsible non-monogamy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has ever had the groundswell that it has now,\u201d said Hardy, who now is running into polyamorous adults brought up by polyamorous parents. \u201cA lot of us are second-generation now.\u201d\n\nPoly activists point to many parallels between earlier movements that were born underground and operated under the radar: secret clubs, insider argot, referral networks for poly-friendly therapists, doctors and lawyers. The National Coalition for Sexual Freedom's Kink and Poly Aware Professionals referral list includes about 300 lawyers, said Susan Wright, the Baltimore-based organization's executive director.\n\nThe world of polyamory overlaps with the subculture of kink and BDSM, which refers to the erotic practices of bondage, domination, submission and sadomasochism. As a sign of the movement\u2019s maturation, some now embrace the kind of middle-class respectability that made gay marriage palatable to mainstream society.\n\n\"We\u2019re a very boring and respectable couple!\" polyamorist Carrie Ichikawa Jenkins beamed to The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2017. Jenkins, a University of British Columbia philosophy professor, has a husband and a boyfriend, both of whom teach at UBC. The Chronicle article paints a portrait of the polyamorous triad in domestic hues befitting Norman Rockwell: \u201cOn the wall hang sepia-toned photographs of someone\u2019s relatives. On the front porch are a swing and a coffee table with an ashtray on it.\u201d\n\n\"Love Outside the Box\" symbol on the polyamory Wikipedia page\n\nThe civil rights concerns of the non-monogamous and other minorities are dissimilar in some ways. Unlike earlier civil rights movements, non-monogamy has the potential of affecting a majority of the population, since membership in the group is theoretically open to everyone.\n\n\u201cIn a way, poly is a deeper threat to the dominant culture than gay culture,\u201d said Geoffrey Miller, a polyamorist in an open marriage and a psychology professor at the University of New Mexico.\n\nMiller, a member of the APA task force, compares the state of non-monogamy movement to gay rights in 1966, in the calm before the storm of the Stonewall Riots, the 1969 protests that launched the modern gay rights movement. The closeted movement had about 50 organizations in the late 1960s but exploded to 1,000 by the mid-1970s, said John D\u2019Emilio, a retired professor at the University of Illinois, Chicago, who taught on the history of sexuality and the LGBTQ movement, and is co-author of \u201cIntimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America\u201d (1988).\n\nConservatives had long warned that redefining marriage to allow same-sex unions would throw open the door to allowing any kind of marriage, from polygamy to incest. Those arguments reached a crescendo when gay marriage was winding its way through the legal system, en route to the 2015 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage. In that 5-4 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a dissenting opinion warning of what was to come.\n\n\u201cIt is striking how much of the majority\u2019s reasoning would apply with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cWhy would there be any less dignity in the bond between three people who, in exercising their autonomy, seek to make the profound choice to marry?\u201d\n\nRobert P. George, law professor: \"We have quickly gone from, \u2018It will never happen,\u2019 to \u2018You\u2019re a bigot for thinking there is anything wrong with it.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrinceton professor of jurisprudence Robert George was among those who warned of the slippery slope. In a 2015 article, he predicted that the civil rights challenges were inevitable, but initially judges would \u201cswat away on procedural grounds the first few constitutional challenges to marriage laws.\u201d Gradually the legal objections will give way to the force of logical consistency.\n\nHe told RealClearInvestigations in an email that this process is often characterized by indignant dismissal of the logical implications, followed by total capitulation.\n\n\u201cOf course, advocates of revising the law denounced us not only as \u2018bigots\u2019 but as \u2018scare-mongers,\u2019\u201d George said. \u201cThere was, they insisted, no \u2018slippery slope\u2019 from same-sex marriage to polyamory. The two concepts had nothing to do with each other.\n\n\u201cI could see that this was nonsense \u2014 often disingenuous nonsense,\u201d George said. \u201cSo I am not in the least surprised to see what is happening now. We have quickly gone from, \u2018It will never happen,\u2019 to \u2018You\u2019re a bigot for thinking there is anything wrong with it.\u2019\u201d",
