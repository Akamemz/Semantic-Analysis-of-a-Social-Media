The new rule , which replaced the Obama-era Waters of the United States rule , exempts ephemeral headwaters that feed into larger rivers and lakes from regulation under the Clean Water Act .\nFor months now , a rumbling carousel of rock trucks and backhoes expands the already expansive open pit mine at the 4,600-acre Haile Gold Mine here in Kershaw . The hunt for tiny specks of gold hidden deep in the Southern slate has sparked a gold rush among prospectors eyeing surrounding land \u2013 including Mr. Blackmon \u2019 s farm .\nThe rush to revive one of America \u2019 s oldest gold mines was only bolstered last week when the Trump administration replaced the Obama-era Waters of the United States rule with the Navigable Waters Protection rule .

Writ broadly , the shift underway is an experiment in environmental federalism that pushes regulation closer to the people \u2013 but also leaves it more vulnerable to powerful corporate lobbyists .\n\u201c Environmental federalism gets cloaked in the language and rhetoric of constitutional law , but it \u2019 s really a simpler , more pragmatic concept : Who is responsible for cleaning up a toxic waste landfill that \u2019 s reached into a nearby river ? \u201d says law professor Cale Jaffe , director of the Environmental and Regulatory Law Clinic at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville . \u201c Is it the local government that allowed the landfill through zoning ? Is it the state , which issued the permit ? Or is it the federal government , which established the hazardous waste standards ? \u201d\nOceanaGold \u2019 s country director , David Thomas , says the main effect of the rule change will be more clarity around permitting . But he says that the mine will remain under \u201c profound regulations \u201d that fit into an evolving business model that mandates environmental stewardship and transparency as core corporate values . In the last two decades especially , he says , \u201c the industry has seen a significant shift in terms of that attitude . \u201d\nFor OceanaGold , he says , that means zero discharge operations from its processing plant , preservation of miles of pristine streams , and a $ 65 million restoration fund for when the mine closes in an estimated 15 years .\n\u201c Every industry has bad actors , so it is incumbent on us to stick decisively to our values , particularly when it comes to environmental and operational integrity , \u201d says Mr. Thomas . \u201c If we don \u2019 t , it will have an adverse impact on what we do . \u201d\nFederal oversight , in essence , provides a floor for water and air quality , allowing states and local communities to exceed those standards if they wish .\nAt the same time , \u201c in a lot of states you have industry pushing to limit state authority to only what is provided at the federal level , which makes [ taking away federal oversight ] a bait and switch , \u201d says Kelly Hunter Foster , a senior attorney at the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance .\n\u201c The federalism balance is important , where there is a strong federal stance , support for states , and then an engaged citizenry pushing back on the other side against industry ... to minimize impacts to people downstream , \u201d says Ms. Hunter Foster . \u201c That \u2019 s really the original common law of how you \u2019 re supposed to do things : You can use your land to the extent that it doesn \u2019 t harm others . \u201d\nPatrik Jonsson/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 A streak of gold buried in a layer of slate extends from Virginia to Georgia . In the early 19th century , miners discovered gold here at Lynches River . The Trump administration last week removed federal protections from parts of the watershed that feeds Lynches River .\nMany of the miners who flocked to California during the gold rush first dipped their pans in Carolina waters like Lynches River , the genesis of the Haile Mine . But modern-day pit mining also unearths toxic wastes , including cyanide , arsenic , and sulfuric acid .\nPresident Donald Trump has stated that \u201c crystal clear \u201d waters are a goal of his administration . But earlier this month he chided the Obama-era rule as one \u201c that basically took your property away from you. \u201d ( The rule required landowners to seek permits for changes that would affect seasonal , standing , and unconnected waters , as well as some headwater streams and wetlands . )\nKey beneficiaries are golf course developers like Mr. Trump , farmers like Mr. Blackmon , and extractors \u2013 like the OceanaGold outfit here in Kershaw .\n\u201c If it \u2019 s not farmed , it \u2019 s mined , \u201d says Chris Smith , executive director of the Mining Association of South Carolina , in Chapin . \u201c And anytime that something to do with the waters of our state is granted more leniency so we can do our job , that is very beneficial to us . \u201d\nThe U.S. has as many as half a million abandoned mine sites , of which at least 33,000 have degraded the environment around them , according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office . South Carolina has two smaller mines that are now part of federal Superfund cleanups after waste contaminated surrounding wetlands .\nObama administration officials said the rule was intended to clarify legal confusion sown in part by two separate U.S. Supreme Court decisions on whether the federal government could regulate smaller and more seasonal bodies of water on private land .\nThe Trump administration peeled back that rule against the advice of its own scientific advisory board , laying the groundwork for lawsuits by states and environmental groups .\n\u201c This modernization is a retreat , \u201d says Pat Parenteau , an environmental law professor at Vermont Law School in South Royalton . \u201c Their best argument is , let the states take care of this . \u201d\nThere is one overarching problem with the federalist approach to water regulation , he says . Flowing waters pay no heed to political boundaries . And depending on geography and political leanings , states have wildly different priorities when it comes to environmental protection .\n\u201c States are not stepping up to fill the gaps on nonpoint pollution , \u201d which includes agricultural and mining interests , adds Professor Parenteau . \u201c That \u2019 s why we have more and more dead zones all over the place and stinky , filthy , algae-choked waters , simply because the Clean Water Act is not strong enough now . The response [ from the Trump administration ] is to weaken it further . \u201d\nFederal oversight of U.S. waters began with the 1972 Clean Water Act , enacted after industrial pollution had caused rivers and lakes to catch fire for nearly a century before a Cuyahoga River fire in 1969 galvanized the environmental movement .\nToday , Gallup regularly finds that having swimmable and fishable water near one \u2019 s home ranks as Americans \u2019 top environmental concern .

But looked at another way , about half of U.S. rivers and lakes are violating one or more federal water quality standards .\n\u201d Right now , we don \u2019 t know how much is being regulated or deregulated , and we also don \u2019 t know much about the consequences of the new rule , \u201d says resource economist Joseph Shapiro , who studies the impacts of water pollution at the University of California , Berkeley . \u201c But where you get your water matters . \u201d\nBut those complexities and uncertainties around how watersheds work can get glossed over when measured against the immediate economic impact : By one estimate , the Haile Mine generates some $ 87 million a year in Lancaster County alone , employing over 600 locals .\nFor miners like Steven Dabbs , the new regulations are likely a huge boon . The mine has brought a raft of high-paying jobs to Lancaster County , not far from Charlotte , North Carolina .\n\u201c The pace is ferocious , but the pay is good , \u201d he says \u2013 as much as $ 19 per hour for a rookie miner , he estimates .\nBut it \u2019 s not just a struggling old textile town like Kershaw welcoming the economic boost from looser regulations on water quality .\nThe Trump administration has also been giving extensions to liberal-leaning cities that entered consent decrees to fix up inadequate sewage treatment plants .
