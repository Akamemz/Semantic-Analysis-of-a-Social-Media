    "content": "After 2\u00bd years of civil war in Syria , President Barack Obama 's larger policy is in disarray even as his administration , with help from Russia , averted a military showdown for the time being .\nIn an address to the American people , Obama said he was working with U.S. allies to `` provide humanitarian support , to help the moderate opposition and to shape a political settlement '' for ending a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people and made refugees of millions more .\nThat simple message belies a hodgepodge of often contradicting goals and strategies unlikely to be resolved by the new international effort to get Bashar Assad 's government to relinquish its chemical weapons or by any U.S. military action if diplomacy fails .\nThese include Obama 's vacillations on providing military assistance to rebels as part of a peace strategy and his repeated demand that Assad relinquish power but still retain a veto over any replacement government .\nThe difficulty in understanding what America is trying to do in Syria has persisted in the current debate over how to respond to the Assad government 's alleged use of chemical weapons .\nThreatening military reprisals , Obama said that the `` United States military does n't do pinpricks '' only a day after his top diplomat , Secretary of State John Kerry , promised an `` unbelievably small '' operation .\nThe administration 's top national security officials have spoken ambiguously about doing anything militarily to shift the battlefield momentum toward rebels trying to overthrow the Syrian leader \u2014 a stated U.S. policy objective .\nIn the last few days Obama has turned again to help from Russia , a Syrian ally the U.S. repeatedly has accused of being complicit in the Assad government 's wartime atrocities .\nA look at how U.S. policy in Syria has evolved :\nArab Spring-inspired demonstrations erupt across Syria in March 2011 . The unrest comes as the Obama administration is hoping to coax Assad into ending Syria 's alliance with Iran and support for militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah . As the protests spread and reprisals worsen , U.S. engagement narrows to trying to get the Syrian government to respect political opponents and move toward democracy .\nAmid calls for a tougher U.S. response , then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says Assad is seen by some U.S. lawmakers as a `` reformer . '' Days earlier , Kerry , then a U.S. senator , argues that Syria is poised for change `` as it embraces a legitimate relationship with the United States and the West . ''\nThe administration resists calls over the next months to recall the U.S. ambassador , the first senior American posted to Damascus in five years . Obama reacts to increased brutality by Assad 's forces in April by ordering the first of several new sets of sanctions against Syria . Violence escalates , with Assad sending tanks into cities throughout the summer .\nCitizens and defecting soldiers take up arms against government . By August , Obama has seen enough . He publicly calls on Assad to resign .\nThe U.S. and allies take their case to the United Nations in October 2011 , asking the Security Council to condemn human rights violations in Syria and demand an end to violence . Russia and China veto the resolution .\nThat month , the U.S. pulls Ambassador Robert Ford out of Damascus because of security concerns as Washington 's relationship with Assad 's government worsens . Ford returns in December , then leaves for good two months later .\nThe U.S. tries anew at the U.N. in February 2012 , backing an Arab-proposed plan to hold Syrian human rights violators accountable . Russia and China again exercise their veto ; Clinton calls their actions `` despicable . ''\nStymied at the U.N. , the U.S. turns to its Arab and European allies and convenes the first `` Friends of Syria '' conference in Tunisia to find ways to support Syria 's opposition and weaken Assad 's control .\nU.S. intelligence officials start warning for the first time about al-Qaida and other extremist militants joining the fray . Still hopeful of finding a peaceful resolution , the U.S. urges that no one send weapons to either the government or the rebels . The violence worsens . In March 2012 , Obama pledges `` nonlethal '' aid to the rebels . The U.N. says about 8,000 are dead after a year of violence .\nSecretary of State Clinton believes she secures Russia 's commitment on a path forward in June 2012 with the `` Geneva process . '' It calls for a Syrian transitional government through negotiation between Assad 's government and the opposition . The diplomatic strategy is presented as a way out of the crisis because both Assad and the rebels would be able to veto any transition government candidates .\nWithin hours of signing on to the strategy , the U.S. and Russia bicker over whether the agreement includes Assad relinquishing power . Russia and China veto a third U.N. resolution in July after the U.S. and its allies try to make the agreement enforceable . The process fizzles out without delivering any peace talks or progress toward forming a new government .\nArab governments disregard the U.S. call for a weapons embargo and supply the rebels with increasingly advanced weaponry . Obama rebuffs suggestions by Clinton , CIA Director David Petraeus and other senior U.S. officials to provide weapons to moderate opposition forces . By July , the U.N. says 5,000 Syrians are dying each month in the fighting .\nResponding to worrying intelligence indications , Obama declares in August 2012 that the use or deployment of the Syrian government 's chemical weapons stockpiles is a `` red line , '' which if crossed would change America 's calculus in the conflict . He says any such chemical weapons activity would entail `` enormous consequences . ''\nRebel military advances stall . At the behest of Washington and others , the Islamist-dominated political opposition reforms itself in November 2012 to include more moderates and minorities .\nThe U.N. puts the death toll since the beginning of the conflict at 60,000 .

Washington also puts one rebel faction , the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front , on the U.S. terrorism blacklist .\nObama starts his second term as president and Kerry replaces Clinton as secretary of state . The U.S. becomes more assertive in its rhetoric about shifting the Syrian civil war 's momentum and trying to convince Assad that he can not prevail militarily and should relinquish power .\nIn February 2013 , the U.S. decides to send medical kits , ready-made meals and other forms of nonlethal aid directly to the rebels but refuses to join its Arab partners in providing weapons . In March , Syrian rebels and Assad 's government accuse each other of using chemical weapons .\nThe U.S. begins investigating . In May , Kerry travels to Moscow and revives the Geneva peace process .
