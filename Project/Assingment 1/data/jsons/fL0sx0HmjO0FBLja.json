    "content": "President Donald Trump departs Friday for his first foreign trip , a nine-day voyage that will take him across the Middle East and Western Europe . Although the trip will be shadowed by Trump \u2019 s growing problems at home , it could shape his foreign policy in important and lasting ways .\nTrump will encounter a slew of thorny foreign policy issues on his trip , which features stops in Saudi Arabia , Israel , a G7 meeting in Sicily , a NATO summit in Brussels and a visit to the Vatican .\nDuring his first stop in Saudi Arabia , Trump will give a speech focused on Islam and terrorism . He might come in with rhetorical guns blazing . Trump once said that Saudi Arabia \u201c blew up the World Trade Center \u201d and has accused it and other Gulf Arab states of supporting terrorism . He said in March 2016 that \u201c Islam hates us . \u201d\nBut fans of Trump \u2019 s tough talk may be disappointed . His Saudi hosts , and the Muslim leaders who will gather in Riyadh for a summit while Trump is there , would be infuriated by such rhetoric from their guest . They will be expecting a more temperate message in the vein of Trump \u2019 s predecessors , George W. Bush and Barack Obama , who argued that Islam is a religion of peace and that the United States is not at war with the world \u2019 s Muslims . In a briefing last week , national security adviser H.R . McMaster said Trump \u2019 s speech would be \u201c respectful . \u201d\nOne thing to watch is whether Trump \u2019 s address uses the phrase \u201c radical Islamic terrorism. \u201d McMaster has urged Trump to avoid using that phrase , which Trump often repeated as a candidate but which Obama and Bush both avoided because it offends many Muslims . Trump has used the construction publicly at least twice since McMaster took the job in February\u2014though McMaster hinted at a possible compromise during a briefing at the White House last week , when he said Trump would speak about \u201c radical Islamist ideology , \u201d which he said \u201c uses a perverted interpretation of Islam to justify crimes against all humanity . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s second stop will be in Israel . The visit itself will draw an implicit contrast with Obama , who had testy relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and who did not stop in Israel during his first visit to the Middle East in 2009 . Despite the controversy over whether Trump shared classified intelligence provided by Israel with Russian officials in the Oval Office last week , a bigger focus of his visit will be the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Trump insists he wants to broker a historic agreement between the two sides , despite decades of failed efforts to reach one\u2014and despite wariness among Israeli officials that Trump might want a deal more than they do .\nClose observers of the region will be watching not only Trump \u2019 s interactions with Netanyahu but also with the Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas . Trump has a meeting with Abbas planned , but a key question is whether he will convene Abbas and Netanyahu in an effort to jump-start peace talks that have been dormant for three years . \u201c Will there be a three-way Trump-Bibi-Abbas meeting\u2014and if so will there be any announced understandings from it ? \u201d asked Dennis Ross , a former Middle East policy adviser to several presidents .\nTrump spent much of the 2016 campaign criticizing NATO . Many European leaders were relieved to hear Trump say in an April press conference with Italy \u2019 s prime minster that the 28-member military alliance is \u201c no longer obsolete. \u201d But Trump said that in response to what he says is NATO \u2019 s new attention to terrorism , which in fact remains a secondary mission for the alliance .\nWhat Trump has still not done as president is affirm NATO \u2019 s role as a guarantor of European security\u2014particularly against Russia , the country NATO was formed to defend against . Trump has also not committed to observe the part of the treaty that commits every member to defend one another against aggression . During the campaign , Trump suggested that the United States might not come to the defense of a NATO member that had not met its budgetary commitments to the organization . ( Most NATO members spend less on defense than they have pledged . )\n\u201c To me the big question is if he endorses the original mission , which he hasn \u2019 t done , \u201d said Thomas Wright , director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution .\nLongtime Trump watchers are keen to see how he \u2019 ll handle the many opportunities to stray from the script prepared for him by McMaster and other national security professionals . A shoot-from-the-hip president on a long and tiring first trip out of the country is a recipe for multiple missteps , gaffes and comments that could send confusing messages about U.S. policy . Distracted by a barrage of controversies at home , including Wednesday \u2019 s appointment of a special prosecutor to probe Russia \u2019 s involvement in the 2016 election , Trump has had little time to focus on the briefing materials his staff has prepared for him .

Will he say \"radical Islamic terrorism\"?\n\nDuring his first stop in Saudi Arabia, Trump will give a speech focused on Islam and terrorism. He might come in with rhetorical guns blazing. Trump once said that Saudi Arabia \u201cblew up the World Trade Center\u201d and has accused it and other Gulf Arab states of supporting terrorism.

They will be expecting a more temperate message in the vein of Trump\u2019s predecessors, George W.

McMaster said Trump\u2019s speech would be \u201crespectful.\u201d\n\nOne thing to watch is whether Trump\u2019s address uses the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d McMaster has urged Trump to avoid using that phrase, which Trump often repeated as a candidate but which Obama and Bush both avoided because it offends many Muslims.

Will he play Middle East peacemaker?\n\nTrump\u2019s second stop will be in Israel. The visit itself will draw an implicit contrast with Obama, who had testy relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and who did not stop in Israel during his first visit to the Middle East in 2009. Despite the controversy over whether Trump shared classified intelligence provided by Israel with Russian officials in the Oval Office last week, a bigger focus of his visit will be the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Trump has a meeting with Abbas planned, but a key question is whether he will convene Abbas and Netanyahu in an effort to jump-start peace talks that have been dormant for three years. \u201cWill there be a three-way Trump-Bibi-Abbas meeting\u2014and if so will there be any announced understandings from it?\u201d asked Dennis Ross, a former Middle East policy adviser to several presidents.\n\n3. Does he really support NATO?\n\nTrump spent much of the 2016 campaign criticizing NATO. Many European leaders were relieved to hear Trump say in an April press conference with Italy\u2019s prime minster that the 28-member military alliance is \u201cno longer obsolete.\u201d But Trump said that in response to what he says is NATO\u2019s new attention to terrorism, which in fact remains a secondary mission for the alliance.\n\nWhat Trump has still not done as president is affirm NATO\u2019s role as a guarantor of European security\u2014particularly against Russia, the country NATO was formed to defend against.
