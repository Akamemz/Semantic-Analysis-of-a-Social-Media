''\nThat , in response to a line of attack from Massachusetts Sen.

Bloomberg got onstage but had an uneven performance.\n\nAll that money bought Bloomberg a raised profile \u2014 and a slot on the debate stage. But he had a spotty debate.\n\nBloomberg had his good moments, talking about how to beat President Trump and why Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in his view, would lose, and defending capitalism against socialism.\n\n\"What a wonderful country we have,\" Bloomberg said before taking aim at Sanders. \"The best-known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses.

Warren was the most aggressive she has been during the campaign, but it's not clear what that accomplished.\n\nWarren torched everyone in her way.

But it's not clear that Warren helped herself or that this version of Warren is one that can convince voters she can win in November. Still, Warren has a strong organization and a chance to exceed expectations, starting in Nevada.\n\n3. The centrists are not uniting.\n\nIt's pretty clear that Klobuchar and Buttigieg either don't like each other very much or at least get under each other's skin. Buttigieg had a strong debate, for the most part, except when going after Klobuchar for not remembering the name of Mexico's president during a candidate forum.\n\nIt felt petty.
