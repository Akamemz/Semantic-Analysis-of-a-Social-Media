The dynamics are exhaustingly familiar : Someone attacks the president , the president responds inappropriately , opponents of the president recoil in horror , and supporters of the president cheer him on for `` fighting back . '' To be clear , under the rules of playground justice , MSNBC co-host Mika Brzezinski `` started it '' this morning by mocking Trump 's fragile ego and remarking upon his `` teensy '' hands :\n. @ morningmika : `` he 's covering his hands here [ on the fake Time mag cover ] because they 're teensy .

Just kidding , he did this\n... to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year 's Eve , and insisted on joining me . She was bleeding badly from a face-lift . I said no ! \u2014 Donald J.
