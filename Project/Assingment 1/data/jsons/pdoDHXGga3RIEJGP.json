But Republicans say they believe Democrats failed to land a fatal blow .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , said he had no doubts \u201c whatsoever \u201d that Kavanaugh would ultimately be confirmed .\n\u201c I think any doubts anybody might have had been dispelled by his virtuoso performance before the Judiciary Committee , \u201d McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt . `` I mean , it \u2019 s stunning . He \u2019 s just a stellar nomination in every respect . \u201d\nAfter grilling Kavanaugh for two days , senators on Friday heard from outside witnesses both supporting and opposing the nominee , marking the end of the hearing process . Among those invited by the Democrats on the committee was John Dean , the former Nixon White House counsel who turned against the administration during Watergate .\nDean , a Trump critic , predicted that with Kavanaugh on the high court , it will become `` a weak check , at best , on presidential power . '' He called the scenario `` deeply troubling , '' adding that there is `` much to fear from an unchecked president who is inclined to abuse his powers . ''\nMeanwhile , members of an American Bar Association committee gave Kavanaugh their highest rating of `` well qualified '' based on his integrity , competence and judicial temperament .\nJohn Tarpley , the lead evaluator in the review , told the committee Friday it was clear based on interviews with peers that Kavanaugh learned integrity at an early age . He said Kavanaugh received high praise for his knowledge of the law and for his judicial temperament , with reviewers saying he was affable and kept an open mind .\nThe Judiciary Committee , in the coming days and weeks , is expected to vote on Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation before the nomination heads to the full Senate for a final vote .\n\u201c We look forward to the Judiciary Committee completing its review and advancing his nomination , \u201d said White House Spokesman Raj Shah .\nDemocrats were always going to have a tough time defeating Kavanaugh . But with Republicans enjoying only a 51-49 majority , a couple defections would be enough to stall his confirmation .
