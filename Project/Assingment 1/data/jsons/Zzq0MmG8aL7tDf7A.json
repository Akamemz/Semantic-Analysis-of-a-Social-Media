    "content": "Democrats and Republicans in the United States live in different worlds . Democrats talk about `` undocumented workers , '' `` tax breaks for the rich , '' and `` estate taxes , '' while Republicans refer to `` illegal aliens , '' `` tax reform , '' and `` death taxes . `` A new study finds that American political speech has become more polarized across party lines over time , with a clear trend break around 1980 , and that current levels are unprecedented.In the working paper , `` Measuring Polarization in High-Dimensional Data : Method and Application to Congressional Speech , '' by University of Chicago Booth School of Business Associate Professor Matt Taddy , Stanford University Professor Matthew Gentzkow and Brown University Professor Jesse M. Shapiro , researchers developed a new approach for measuring political polarization that breaks down and analyzes the differences in rhetorical choices among U.S. political party members.This model-based measure of polarization improves upon traditional standard measures and finds that , in contrary to previous studies , the polarization of speech was in fact quite low until the 1980s when it began a rapid rise . `` We 've come up with a new way to measure segregation where the old methods did n't work , '' said Taddy . `` When using this new method to model word choices , we find this pattern of clearly increasing polarization after 1980 . And this just confirms what most people expect\u2014that the parties are growing further apart in the subjects they care about and how they talk about issues . `` To develop their model , the researchers used an automated script that sorted the text from the U.S. Congressional Record from 1873 to 2009 into individual speeches . They also matched the speaker of each line of text to the same lawmaker listed in the Database of Congressional Historical Statistics.The `` bag of words '' approach disregards grammar and word order and focuses instead on counting the frequency of so-called bigrams , or two-word phrases appearing across speeches . The method allowed the researches to compile a sample of 723,198 unique phrases spoken a total of 271 million times by 7,285 unique speakers . The measurement method corrects for sample bias , a factor that may have led previous research to conclude that partisan speech was higher at the turn of the 20th century . `` These differences in speech may contribute to cross-party animus and ultimately to gridlock and dysfunction in the political system , '' the researchers said in the study.The new approach to measuring polarization has implications for analyzing a wide range of divides . Researchers have already begun to apply the method to measuring segregation and web browsing behavior according to race , as well as segregation in product choices according to education level .",
