    "content": "A network of secret-money nonprofit groups has spent millions of dollars attacking swing-seat House Republicans on health care and taxes , quietly becoming one of the biggest players in the 2018 political landscape .\nThe groups have local members and names like Floridians for a Fair Shake , Michigan Families for Economic Prosperity and North Carolinians for a Fair Economy . But they are all linked to one obscure nonprofit in downtown Washington , D.C. : the Sixteen Thirty Fund , which has funneled millions of dollars to progressive causes in recent years and set up each of the new groups , according to D.C. corporation records .\nAdded together , the Sixteen Thirty Fund groups have been among the most prolific political advertisers of 2018 . They have aired 6,885 broadcast TV ads since Jan. 1 , according to Advertising Analytics , a TV tracking firm \u2014 more than the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and almost as many as Americans for Prosperity , two of the five biggest nonprofit political advertisers focused on the House and Senate in the first half of this year .\nThe network , which has spent over $ 4.6 million on TV alone , has also been one of the top political advertisers in the country on Facebook , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis of data from the social media company \u2019 s new political ad archive .\nThe ads don \u2019 t expressly advocate voting against House Republicans , but they do blast incumbents for their votes on Obamacare repeal and the new tax law in more than a dozen congressional districts . The two issues are ones that Democrats want at the forefront of their campaign to take back the House , though keeping the focus on those issues has been difficult amid a maelstrom of other stories involving President Donald Trump , including the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election .\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings , in your inbox .

Rod Blum of Iowa , one of the most endangered Republicans in the House . Stone continues : \u201c People need to call Rod Blum and tell him to please quit voting to take away affordable coverage . \u201d\nThese multimillion-dollar issue ad campaigns have been a hallmark of Republican politics in recent years , especially since 2010 , when conservative nonprofits spent millions criticizing House Democrats over Obamacare and cap-and-trade climate change proposals before the fall elections . But this activity shows that the left is increasingly embracing the same tactics \u2014 even while criticizing \u201c dark money \u201d and its effects on politics .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t believe in unilateral disarmament , \u201d said Cliff Schecter , the CEO of Ohioans for Economic Opportunity , a group that is pressing Rep. Steve Chabot ( R-Ohio ) on his votes ahead of what could be the Republicans ' first competitive reelection race in years . \u201c I \u2019 d be happy to disclose all my donors if [ the Koch groups ] disclose them . But not having a fair playing field does a disservice to people worried about their health care and taxes . \u201d\nThe groups can accept unlimited contributions but do not have to reveal their donors . Tax forms outlining even the most basic details about the nonprofits \u2019 fundraising and spending this year don \u2019 t need to be filed until the end of 2019 .\nThis progressive nonprofit network is not the biggest out there \u2014 American Action Network , the conservative nonprofit aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan , raised $ 41.9 million in its most recent fiscal year , including $ 24.6 million from a single secret donor , and it has spent millions promoting GOP legislation and members who voted for those bills . But the combined efforts of the Sixteen Thirty Fund groups have played an outsize role shaping the 2018 field .\nOne group , Floridians for a Fair Shake , takes credit for the recent revelation that GOP Rep. Vern Buchanan , a wealthy former businessman serving his sixth term in the House , purchased a yacht soon after voting for the Republican tax bill .\n\u201c Giving himself a tax break on the same day he bought a multimillion-dollar yacht \u2014 that \u2019 s a visceral example of what we \u2019 re trying to convey , \u201d said Stephen Gaskill , a spokesman for Floridians for a Fair Shake , which has spent over $ 1 million on TV ads criticizing Buchanan and Rep. Brian Mast ( R-Fla. ) and has organized health care town halls and other events in their districts . \u201c The tax bill was written for the wealthy and for people who don \u2019 t need help . \u201d\nThe people involved in setting up Ohioans for Economic Opportunity \u201c all have preexisting conditions , \u201d said Schecter , a veteran of Democratic political campaigns . \u201c We thought , people should be holding Steve Chabot accountable for his votes on health care . \u201d\nSchecter reached out to his network of contacts , eventually connecting with the Sixteen Thirty Fund and its donors . Eric Kessler , a former staffer in the Clinton administration , is president of the organization . Its board includes several other current and former Democratic political operatives .\n\u201c They helped us all organize , helped with research , giving us ideas and helped us raise money , quite frankly , too , \u201d said Schecter . \u201c We have complete local control and come up with our own ideas for ads , but no doubt they have played a big role . \u201d\nThe North Carolina nonprofit \u2019 s advertising prompted an unusual early response from GOP Rep.
