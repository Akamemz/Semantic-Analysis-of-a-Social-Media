They convey a sense that anybody who disagrees with them is either stupid or corrupt .\nWatching all this makes many people fighting mad and fills them with a burning desire to beat the other team . Far too many nice and reasonable people get so riled up by partisanship that they do rude and obnoxious things . Friends begin to tune them out and avoid them because their intensity and single-minded focus is tiresome .\nThe saddest part of all comes when the campaigning ends and people learn the ultimate futility of engaging in politics .

Politicians grasping for power and money need polarization to pose as heroes protecting `` their '' voters from the `` other '' side .\nPolarization distracts attention from the reality that politicians are less important than they think they are .
