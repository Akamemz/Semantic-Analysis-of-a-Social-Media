Terrill/AP/File A voter fills out a registration form before getting in line at the Los Angeles County registrar 's office on Nov. 6 , 2018 .\nSince 1789 , periodic waves of reform have greatly enlarged the eligible U.S. voting population . In the 1800s , many states struck the \u201c property owner \u201d requirement , opening up voting to most white males . In 1870 , the ratification of the 15th Amendment to the Constitution technically gave all African Americans , including former slaves , access to the ballot . In response , Southern states adopted poll taxes and literacy tests , and employed open violence to disenfranchise African Americans and retain white political hegemony .\nSome states opened the voting franchise to women in the decades before and after the turn of the 20th century , but women weren \u2019 t fully allowed ballot access until the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920 . The most recent reform wave crested with the 1965 Voting Rights Act , which banned discriminatory voter qualification practices , and authorized deployment of federal officials to register voters and oversee elections in areas with a history of blocking minorities from the polls .\nA key enforcement provision of the Voting Rights Act ordered states with a poor minority voting record , most of them Southern , to ask Washington for permission before doing almost anything to change voting procedures , from moving a polling place to redrawing legislative districts . It \u2019 s this part of the law that the Roberts court deemed no longer necessary and struck down in 2013 .\nIn the context of the long rise of democracy throughout the Western world , the voting record of the United States is mixed . The U.S. was indeed one of the first democratic countries to expand its electorate by knocking down explicit economic barriers to political participation , writes Alexander Keyssar , a Harvard professor of history and social policy , in his book \u201c The Right to Vote : The Contested History of Democracy in the United States. \u201d Alexis de Tocqueville and other foreign observers were struck by what they perceived as the nation \u2019 s powerful democratic spirit in the early decades of the 1800s .\nBut the U.S. was also unusual in that it experienced a contraction of voting rights as Southern segregationists essentially negated the 15th Amendment following Reconstruction .\n\u201c Despite its pioneering role in promoting democratic values , the United States was one of the last countries in the developed world to attain universal suffrage , \u201d writes Dr. Keyssar .\nToday , the story of voting rights in America is largely a tale of two kinds of states , moving in two different directions .\nSome states \u2013 mainly but not exclusively blue ones \u2013 are adopting measures to make it easier to register and vote . Automatic voter registration , for example , is a system where citizens who interact with government agencies are automatically added to the voter rolls , or automatically have their address or other voter information updated , unless they opt out of the process . Fifteen states covering about a third of the U.S. population , from Vermont and New Jersey to Nevada and California ( plus the District of Columbia ) , now have some form of automatic registration , according to data from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law .\nBruce Newman/Oxford Eagle/AP/File A poll worker checks a voter 's identification against a list before allowing her to vote in the party primary , June 3 , 2014 , at the Oxford Park Commission in Oxford , Mississippi .\nOther states \u2013 mainly but not exclusively red ones \u2013 are going in the opposite direction and tightening voting rules . These changes range from strict requirements for photo IDs to cutbacks in the time allowed for early voting to the winnowing of presumed nonvoters from the rolls and other general registration restrictions . Since the 2010 midterms , at least 25 states have enacted tougher ballot laws , according to the Brennan Center .\nSome of these changes , in basic form , garner widespread approval among voters . This is particularly true of photo ID . A 2016 Associated Press poll found that 79 % of respondents favored requiring all voters to provide some form of photo identification .\nProponents frame many of the changes as a means to defend against fraud . But the days of deceased voters allegedly casting ballots in Illinois \u2019 Cook County , and voter turnout in some Louisiana precincts reaching 120 % , are long over . Documented cases of in-person fraud are \u201c super rare , \u201d says Dan Hopkins , a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania whose research focuses on elections and public opinion .\nOne 2014 study in an academic journal , Dr. Hopkins points out , concluded that in the U.S. voter impersonation \u2013 the fraud against which photo ID is meant to defend \u2013 is reported at about the same rate as instances of alleged abduction by extraterrestrials .\nThe problem , Dr. Hopkins notes , is America \u2019 s long and troubled history of denying racial minorities their right to vote . Today \u2019 s new restrictions are inevitably seen in that old context .\nTake photo ID . Many Americans see that as an easy hurdle to surmount . Who doesn \u2019 t have a driver \u2019 s license or a passport or something like that ?\nLots of people , actually . And they tend to be those on the edges of mainstream economic society . People of color , poorer people , both young and elderly , tend to be most affected by ID requirements .\nThe effects of the restrictions can also depend on the way they are set up . Dr. Anderson of Emory University uses the example of Alabama . In that state , you have to have a government-issued ID to vote \u2013 but a public housing ID doesn \u2019 t count . Seventy-one percent of public housing occupants in the state are African Americans . Also , Alabama has been closing Department of Motor Vehicle offices in black counties .\nYou create an obstacle , then you create an obstacle to the obstacle , says Dr. Anderson . \u201c We believed we had overcome , \u201d she says . \u201c We haven \u2019 t . \u201d\nDr. Anderson says that one of her goals when writing her 2018 book \u201c One Person No Vote \u201d was to counter the idea that many of the new voting restrictions are just reasonable responses to concerns about the integrity of America \u2019 s voting systems .\nPoor people move often , so they miss the official postcards asking if they wish to remain on the voting rolls . Young people , students , and minorities disproportionately don \u2019 t vote regularly . After missing a few ballots , their names start to be crossed out as well .\nRight now America isn \u2019 t a real democracy , Dr. Anderson says .\n\u201c We came close to being a democracy with the Voting Rights Act , \u201d she says . \u201c But the forces of white supremacy have kept fighting back . \u201d\nDo voting restrictions actually affect elections ? If so , how much ?\nDr. Anderson and other fierce critics would certainly say yes . Their Exhibit A is the 2016 presidential election in Wisconsin . Wisconsin \u2019 s voter ID law , passed under GOP Gov . Scott Walker , requires all voters to present a driver \u2019 s license , state ID , passport , military ID , naturalization papers , or tribal ID to vote . ( Other forms of ID are acceptable under certain circumstances . ) Voters without proper identification can cast a provisional ballot , which will count if they present the document at a state office within 72 hours of the election .\nIn 2016 , the first presidential election affected by the new law , there were 60,000 fewer votes for president than in 2012 , says Dr. Anderson . Sixty-eight percent of the decline was in Milwaukee alone , a heavily Democratic and minority area .\nMorry Gash/AP/File Observers look over test results as a statewide presidential election recount began Dec. 1 , 2016 , in Milwaukee . Donald Trump won Wisconsin by less than a percentage point over Hillary Clinton after polls had predicted a Clinton victory .\nDonald Trump won Wisconsin by roughly 20,000 votes . It was a harbinger of similarly close triumphs in other Rust Belt states that helped provide his margin of victory .\nBut many political scientists have a more nuanced view on the subject .\nEvidence shows that photo ID requirements and other restrictions indeed prevent some voters from casting ballots or going to the polls in the first place , says Dr. Hopkins of the University of Pennsylvania . But studies also show that the magnitude of the effect is not great enough to actually sway many outcomes .\n\u201c This is an important issue of voter rights and civil rights . But the levels of disenfranchisement we have seen do not indicate any election we can point to that would have been shifted , \u201d says Dr. Hopkins .\nTake Wisconsin . It \u2019 s true minority turnout dropped in 2016 relative to 2012 . But was that due to voting restrictions , or the fact that Barack Obama , the nation \u2019 s first African American president , wasn \u2019 t on the ballot ? How did party mobilization efforts compare for those years ? Could there have been some other factor ?\nLike many states , Wisconsin also has something of a split personality on voting issues . Under a GOP-led state government , it tightened ID laws \u2013 but it also allows same-day voter registration .\nThe way restrictions are drawn up and implemented also matters a lot . What IDs count ? The question of whether a student ID is acceptable makes a big difference in heavily collegiate states such as New Hampshire and Wisconsin .\nIn the short run , new restrictions can sometimes even boost turnout . Studies have shown that they can produce a powerful emotional response among Democrats in general and affected groups in particular , spurring a counter-mobilization that actually leads to higher turnout at the polls . That response might eventually wear off \u2013 but long-term effects are difficult to predict . Older voters tend to skew Republican , and as they age they become statistically less likely to have driver \u2019 s licenses , passports , or other IDs .\nNevertheless , the partisan intent seems clear . It is Republican governors and legislators who are pushing for and implementing new restrictions . In 2012 , Pennsylvania \u2019 s Republican state House leaders said publicly that the state \u2019 s new voter ID law would \u201c allow \u201d GOP candidate Mitt Romney to take the state . ( A state judge later threw out the law as contrary to Pennsylvania \u2019 s Constitution . )\nPresident Trump has called for a nationwide photo ID requirement , saying it would ensure only U.S. citizens vote in U.S. elections . ( Multiple nationwide studies have found only a handful of documented cases of noncitizen votes . )\n\u201c There are sometimes clear political motivations [ for instituting voting restrictions ] , \u201d says Dr. Hopkins .\nBut voter photo ID , \u201c purges \u201d of infrequent voters from the rolls , and other moves are not the only things affecting the voting rates of minorities . At a time when America is rapidly becoming more diverse , it is voters \u2019 own disengagement that may be most slowing the rise of the \u201c transformative \u201d coalition , and maintaining the clout of the \u201c restorative \u201d counterpart .\n\u201c It is this broader story of encouraging people to participate that \u2019 s the issue , \u201d says Bernard Fraga , assistant professor of political science at Indiana University and author of \u201c The Turnout Gap : Race , Ethnicity , and Political Inequality in a Diversifying America . \u201d\nThe U.S. has long lagged on turnout compared with other developed nations . In part , this is because registration to vote in the U.S. has traditionally been an individual responsibility . Other nations may vote on weekends , or holidays . According to Pew Research data , 24 nations make voting compulsory , including the perennial top turnout nation , Belgium , which averages close to a 90 % turnout .\nIn U.S. presidential elections , about 50 % to 60 % of eligible voting-age citizens typically turn out to vote . Midterms attract a turnout of about 40 % , while local elections draw even less . Municipal primaries may be decided by as little as 15 % of those eligible to vote .\nTurnout of minority groups in America is particularly low . Whether it is the barrier of an ID , or simply apathy \u2013 a decision to not decide on political choices \u2013 minority turnout lags far behind that of white people , says Dr. Fraga .\nIn 2016 , 65.3 % of eligible white people said they voted , according to Pew data . Forty-nine percent of black people said the same thing , representing a sharp decline from 2012 \u2019 s record 66.6 % turnout .\nLatino turnout lagged behind at 47.6 % , according to Pew . A greater number of eligible Latinos have not voted than voted in each presidential election since 1996 .\nAsian Americans historically do not break the 50 % turnout barrier , either . In 2016 , their voting percentage was 49.3 .\nVoter ID and other restrictive policies don \u2019 t explain this minority turnout gap , says Dr. Fraga . Some states that have implemented relatively tight laws actually have higher minority turnout numbers .\nAnd the gap has clear electoral effects . If minority turnout had equaled white turnout , given that minorities are preponderantly Democratic , Hillary Clinton would have won the presidency in 2016 instead of being narrowly defeated . Democrats would have regained a majority in the Senate .\nInterestingly , the turnout gap is much smaller in places where minority groups make up a larger share of the population . This may be due to the fact that African Americans or Latinos feel they have the power to affect outcomes in a way they do not in overwhelmingly white areas . Or it may be because political campaigns cater to them and target them more when they might make more of a difference .\n\u201c The broad conclusion is , this is a story about engagement , empowerment , and mobilization , \u201d says Dr. Fraga .\nAll of this \u2013 sweeping demographic change , voter ID , voter roll \u201c purges , \u201d minority turnout , plus cameo appearances by partisan gerrymandering and the Electoral College \u2013 may roll into the electoral storm of the century in 18 months .\nThe 2018 midterms saw a huge spike in voter interest and turnout . As Dr. Hopkins pointed out in his 2018 book \u201c The Increasingly United States : How and Why American Political Behavior Nationalized , \u201d the old saying that \u201c all politics is local \u201d has now been turned on its head . All politics is now national , focused on the big stories from Washington via social media and nationalized media . Midterm interest was driven by anger toward and defense of President Trump . With the president himself on the ballot next fall , turnout could be off the charts .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

A recent Fox News poll found that the percentage of voters who say today that they are \u201c extremely \u201d interested in the 2020 presidential election is already higher than the percentage who said the same thing on the day before the 2016 vote .\nMichael McDonald , an election specialist at the University of Florida , is predicting record participation levels . \u201c We are likely in for a storm of the century , \u201d he recently tweeted , \u201c with turnout levels not seen for a presidential election in the past 100 years . \u201d",

The most recent reform wave crested with the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which banned discriminatory voter qualification practices, and authorized deployment of federal officials to register voters and oversee elections in areas with a history of blocking minorities from the polls.\n\nA key enforcement provision of the Voting Rights Act ordered states with a poor minority voting record, most of them Southern, to ask Washington for permission before doing almost anything to change voting procedures, from moving a polling place to redrawing legislative districts. It\u2019s this part of the law that the Roberts court deemed no longer necessary and struck down in 2013.\n\nIn the context of the long rise of democracy throughout the Western world, the voting record of the United States is mixed. The U.S. was indeed one of the first democratic countries to expand its electorate by knocking down explicit economic barriers to political participation, writes Alexander Keyssar, a Harvard professor of history and social policy, in his book \u201cThe Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States.\u201d Alexis de Tocqueville and other foreign observers were struck by what they perceived as the nation\u2019s powerful democratic spirit in the early decades of the 1800s.\n\nBut the U.S. was also unusual in that it experienced a contraction of voting rights as Southern segregationists essentially negated the 15th Amendment following Reconstruction.\n\n\u201cDespite its pioneering role in promoting democratic values, the United States was one of the last countries in the developed world to attain universal suffrage,\u201d writes Dr. Keyssar.\n\nA tale of two kinds of states\n\nToday, the story of voting rights in America is largely a tale of two kinds of states, moving in two different directions.\n\nSome states \u2013 mainly but not exclusively blue ones \u2013 are adopting measures to make it easier to register and vote. Automatic voter registration, for example, is a system where citizens who interact with government agencies are automatically added to the voter rolls, or automatically have their address or other voter information updated, unless they opt out of the process. Fifteen states covering about a third of the U.S. population, from Vermont and New Jersey to Nevada and California (plus the District of Columbia), now have some form of automatic registration, according to data from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.\n\nBruce Newman/Oxford Eagle/AP/File A poll worker checks a voter's identification against a list before allowing her to vote in the party primary, June 3, 2014, at the Oxford Park Commission in Oxford, Mississippi.\n\nOther states \u2013 mainly but not exclusively red ones \u2013 are going in the opposite direction and tightening voting rules. These changes range from strict requirements for photo IDs to cutbacks in the time allowed for early voting to the winnowing of presumed nonvoters from the rolls and other general registration restrictions. Since the 2010 midterms, at least 25 states have enacted tougher ballot laws, according to the Brennan Center.\n\nSome of these changes, in basic form, garner widespread approval among voters. This is particularly true of photo ID. A 2016 Associated Press poll found that 79% of respondents favored requiring all voters to provide some form of photo identification.\n\nProponents frame many of the changes as a means to defend against fraud. But the days of deceased voters allegedly casting ballots in Illinois\u2019 Cook County, and voter turnout in some Louisiana precincts reaching 120%, are long over. Documented cases of in-person fraud are \u201csuper rare,\u201d says Dan Hopkins, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania whose research focuses on elections and public opinion.\n\nOne 2014 study in an academic journal, Dr. Hopkins points out, concluded that in the U.S. voter impersonation \u2013 the fraud against which photo ID is meant to defend \u2013 is reported at about the same rate as instances of alleged abduction by extraterrestrials.\n\nThe problem, Dr. Hopkins notes, is America\u2019s long and troubled history of denying racial minorities their right to vote. Today\u2019s new restrictions are inevitably seen in that old context.\n\nTake photo ID. Many Americans see that as an easy hurdle to surmount. Who doesn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license or a passport or something like that?\n\nLots of people, actually. And they tend to be those on the edges of mainstream economic society. People of color, poorer people, both young and elderly, tend to be most affected by ID requirements.\n\nThe effects of the restrictions can also depend on the way they are set up. Dr. Anderson of Emory University uses the example of Alabama. In that state, you have to have a government-issued ID to vote \u2013 but a public housing ID doesn\u2019t count. Seventy-one percent of public housing occupants in the state are African Americans. Also, Alabama has been closing Department of Motor Vehicle offices in black counties.\n\nYou create an obstacle, then you create an obstacle to the obstacle, says Dr. Anderson. \u201cWe believed we had overcome,\u201d she says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDr. Anderson says that one of her goals when writing her 2018 book \u201cOne Person No Vote\u201d was to counter the idea that many of the new voting restrictions are just reasonable responses to concerns about the integrity of America\u2019s voting systems.\n\nPoor people move often, so they miss the official postcards asking if they wish to remain on the voting rolls. Young people, students, and minorities disproportionately don\u2019t vote regularly. After missing a few ballots, their names start to be crossed out as well.\n\nRight now America isn\u2019t a real democracy, Dr. Anderson says.\n\n\u201cWe came close to being a democracy with the Voting Rights Act,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the forces of white supremacy have kept fighting back.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in Wisconsin\n\nDo voting restrictions actually affect elections? If so, how much?\n\nDr. Anderson and other fierce critics would certainly say yes. Their Exhibit A is the 2016 presidential election in Wisconsin. Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law, passed under GOP Gov. Scott Walker, requires all voters to present a driver\u2019s license, state ID, passport, military ID, naturalization papers, or tribal ID to vote. (Other forms of ID are acceptable under certain circumstances.) Voters without proper identification can cast a provisional ballot, which will count if they present the document at a state office within 72 hours of the election.\n\nIn 2016, the first presidential election affected by the new law, there were 60,000 fewer votes for president than in 2012, says Dr. Anderson. Sixty-eight percent of the decline was in Milwaukee alone, a heavily Democratic and minority area.\n\nMorry Gash/AP/File Observers look over test results as a statewide presidential election recount began Dec. 1, 2016, in Milwaukee. Donald Trump won Wisconsin by less than a percentage point over Hillary Clinton after polls had predicted a Clinton victory.\n\nDonald Trump won Wisconsin by roughly 20,000 votes. It was a harbinger of similarly close triumphs in other Rust Belt states that helped provide his margin of victory.\n\nBut many political scientists have a more nuanced view on the subject.\n\nEvidence shows that photo ID requirements and other restrictions indeed prevent some voters from casting ballots or going to the polls in the first place, says Dr. Hopkins of the University of Pennsylvania. But studies also show that the magnitude of the effect is not great enough to actually sway many outcomes.\n\n\u201cThis is an important issue of voter rights and civil rights. But the levels of disenfranchisement we have seen do not indicate any election we can point to that would have been shifted,\u201d says Dr. Hopkins.\n\nTake Wisconsin. It\u2019s true minority turnout dropped in 2016 relative to 2012. But was that due to voting restrictions, or the fact that Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first African American president, wasn\u2019t on the ballot? How did party mobilization efforts compare for those years? Could there have been some other factor?\n\nLike many states, Wisconsin also has something of a split personality on voting issues. Under a GOP-led state government, it tightened ID laws \u2013 but it also allows same-day voter registration.\n\nThe way restrictions are drawn up and implemented also matters a lot. What IDs count? The question of whether a student ID is acceptable makes a big difference in heavily collegiate states such as New Hampshire and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the short run, new restrictions can sometimes even boost turnout. Studies have shown that they can produce a powerful emotional response among Democrats in general and affected groups in particular, spurring a counter-mobilization that actually leads to higher turnout at the polls. That response might eventually wear off \u2013 but long-term effects are difficult to predict. Older voters tend to skew Republican, and as they age they become statistically less likely to have driver\u2019s licenses, passports, or other IDs.\n\nNevertheless, the partisan intent seems clear. It is Republican governors and legislators who are pushing for and implementing new restrictions. In 2012, Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican state House leaders said publicly that the state\u2019s new voter ID law would \u201callow\u201d GOP candidate Mitt Romney to take the state. (A state judge later threw out the law as contrary to Pennsylvania\u2019s Constitution.)\n\nPresident Trump has called for a nationwide photo ID requirement, saying it would ensure only U.S. citizens vote in U.S. elections. (Multiple nationwide studies have found only a handful of documented cases of noncitizen votes.)\n\n\u201cThere are sometimes clear political motivations [for instituting voting restrictions],\u201d says Dr. Hopkins.\n\nThe disengagement factor\n\nBut voter photo ID, \u201cpurges\u201d of infrequent voters from the rolls, and other moves are not the only things affecting the voting rates of minorities. At a time when America is rapidly becoming more diverse, it is voters\u2019 own disengagement that may be most slowing the rise of the \u201ctransformative\u201d coalition, and maintaining the clout of the \u201crestorative\u201d counterpart.\n\n\u201cIt is this broader story of encouraging people to participate that\u2019s the issue,\u201d says Bernard Fraga, assistant professor of political science at Indiana University and author of \u201cThe Turnout Gap: Race, Ethnicity, and Political Inequality in a Diversifying America.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has long lagged on turnout compared with other developed nations. In part, this is because registration to vote in the U.S. has traditionally been an individual responsibility. Other nations may vote on weekends, or holidays. According to Pew Research data, 24 nations make voting compulsory, including the perennial top turnout nation, Belgium, which averages close to a 90% turnout.\n\nIn U.S. presidential elections, about 50% to 60% of eligible voting-age citizens typically turn out to vote. Midterms attract a turnout of about 40%, while local elections draw even less. Municipal primaries may be decided by as little as 15% of those eligible to vote.\n\nTurnout of minority groups in America is particularly low. Whether it is the barrier of an ID, or simply apathy \u2013 a decision to not decide on political choices \u2013 minority turnout lags far behind that of white people, says Dr. Fraga.\n\nIn 2016, 65.3% of eligible white people said they voted, according to Pew data. Forty-nine percent of black people said the same thing, representing a sharp decline from 2012\u2019s record 66.6% turnout.\n\nLatino turnout lagged behind at 47.6%, according to Pew. A greater number of eligible Latinos have not voted than voted in each presidential election since 1996.\n\nAsian Americans historically do not break the 50% turnout barrier, either. In 2016, their voting percentage was 49.3.\n\nVoter ID and other restrictive policies don\u2019t explain this minority turnout gap, says Dr. Fraga. Some states that have implemented relatively tight laws actually have higher minority turnout numbers.\n\nAnd the gap has clear electoral effects. If minority turnout had equaled white turnout, given that minorities are preponderantly Democratic, Hillary Clinton would have won the presidency in 2016 instead of being narrowly defeated. Democrats would have regained a majority in the Senate.\n\nInterestingly, the turnout gap is much smaller in places where minority groups make up a larger share of the population. This may be due to the fact that African Americans or Latinos feel they have the power to affect outcomes in a way they do not in overwhelmingly white areas. Or it may be because political campaigns cater to them and target them more when they might make more of a difference.\n\n\u201cThe broad conclusion is, this is a story about engagement, empowerment, and mobilization,\u201d says Dr. Fraga.\n\nA perfect storm\n\nAll of this \u2013 sweeping demographic change, voter ID, voter roll \u201cpurges,\u201d minority turnout, plus cameo appearances by partisan gerrymandering and the Electoral College \u2013 may roll into the electoral storm of the century in 18 months.\n\nThat\u2019s because the 2020 presidential election is coming.\n\nThe 2018 midterms saw a huge spike in voter interest and turnout. As Dr. Hopkins pointed out in his 2018 book \u201cThe Increasingly United States: How and Why American Political Behavior Nationalized,\u201d the old saying that \u201call politics is local\u201d has now been turned on its head. All politics is now national, focused on the big stories from Washington via social media and nationalized media. Midterm interest was driven by anger toward and defense of President Trump. With the president himself on the ballot next fall, turnout could be off the charts.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
