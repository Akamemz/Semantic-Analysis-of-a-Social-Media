Chris Christie in a dispute with public employee unions and the state legislature over pension cuts .\nThe 5-2 ruling spares Christie \u2019 s signature policy achievement \u2014 pension reform \u2014 an expected scrapping and immediately improves his standing in his undeclared presidential bid . The decision also gives the state legislature more time to fix the state \u2019 s financially troubled pension system .\nPatrick Murray , director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute said Christie \u201c dodged a bullet. \u201d A ruling against Christie , he said , would have undercut his claim that he fixed New Jersey \u2019 s state finances when he came into office . It was , Murray said , \u201c the best possible solution for him politically \u201d because a \u201c potentially embarrassing situation has gone away . \u201d\nThe case weighed whether Christie broke his own 2011 pension reform law , which he once described as his \u201c biggest governmental victory. \u201d Christie \u2019 s office had said the law would resolve the state \u2019 s severely underfunded public pension system and would \u201c bring to an end years of broken promises. \u201d But tax revenues fell far below state projections , leading Christie to make $ 1.57 billion in additional cuts without consulting the state legislature . Public-sector unions filed a lawsuit in response .\nThe ruling overturns a lower court decision and frees New Jersey from having to revise its budget for fiscal year 2016 , which allocates $ 1.3 billion to the public pension system \u2014 three-tenths of the state \u2019 s required contribution . A spokesperson for Christie said last month that as much as $ 200 million in surplus state revenue could go towards the state pension fund in June . But that represented only about 13 percent of the required funds .\nAfter months of bad news for Christie \u2014 indictments of aides in the Bridgegate traffic scandal , plummeting poll numbers at home and nationally \u2014 there \u2019 s a sense in his orbit that things are finally looking up . The ruling comes as Christie has ramped up his political activity \u2014 he was wrapping up a swing in New Hampshire when the decision came down \u2014 and he may announce a presidential bid within weeks .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s huge , \u201d said Bill Kilberg , who along with his wife , Bobbie , is a major Christie donor . Kilberg is also an expert on labor and employment law . \u201c Obviously it \u2019 s important politically , because he won\u2026 . He inherited a state that was in terrible fiscal shape , one of the worst in the country , if not the worst .
