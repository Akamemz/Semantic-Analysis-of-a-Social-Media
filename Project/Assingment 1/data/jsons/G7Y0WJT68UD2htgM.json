O \u2019 Sullivan , Bloomberg\nThe right applauds Trump \u2019 s speech and argues that his Iran strategy has been successful .\nThe right applauds Trump \u2019 s speech and argues that his Iran strategy has been successful .\n\u201c President Trump is not usually known for restraint , but his brief speech to the nation Wednesday morning showed tough-minded restraint of just the right sort\u2026\n\u201c By announcing a further tightening of the sanctions that are already crippling Iran \u2019 s economy , Trump shows that the U.S. will not meekly accept even a largely failed missile attack on its military bases \u2014 and he does it without further violence . By leading with the assertion that the U.S. will never allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons , and by returning to it several times , the president made clear the main imperative that has driven , and must drive , American grand strategy toward Iran . Yet , by refraining from any immediate military action , Trump provided room for Iran to de-escalate and accept his closing offer of peace . \u201d\n\u201c Military experts will be debating this for a while , but if a country fires 22 missiles at targets and doesn \u2019 t kill anyone , either they \u2019 re really bad at their jobs or this operation was primarily symbolic . The Iranians could have tried other methods more likely to kill Americans last night , but they didn \u2019 t . The Iranian Air Force stayed within its own territory . They \u2019 re telling their people that they won a great victory . The message to us , between the lines , is that they don \u2019 t want this fight to get any bigger\u2026\n\u201c If the fight ends now , the United States is the big winner . We killed Soleimani , demonstrated that we can target just about anyone in the Iranian regime and eliminate them without warning , and have , so far , not lost any American lives in the Iranian counterattack , nor have our Iraqi allies . \u201d\n\u201c In the run-up to the attack on Soleimani , Shiite militias under the general 's ultimate direction were firing rockets at U.S. troops , and Iran had orchestrated an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad . This came on top of months of broader escalation , including the targeting of drones and tankers in the Arabian Sea and attacks on Saudi oil fields . It was necessary for Trump to do something significant to reestablish deterrence against Iran . Killing Soleimani was a way to weaken Iran severely and reestablish deterrence in a targeted way\u2026 Trump \u2019 s foreign policy positions have been criticized as incoherent . But his recent actions on Iran are the most consistent manifestation yet of his foreign policy impulse to project strength while avoiding protracted wars . \u201d\n\u201c President Trump has demonstrated that he is uninterested in the lofty goals of nation-building and regime change that once characterized his party\u2026 On Wednesday , he vowed that Iran would not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon \u2018 as long as I am president. \u2019 And yet in that same speech , Trump extended a hand of cooperation to Iran . \u2018 The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran , \u2019 he said . \u2018 We should work together on this and other shared priorities. \u2019 This doesn \u2019 t sound like a man bent on regime change by military force . They are the words of a president who seeks to deter Iran from targeting Americans and building nuclear weapons\u2026\n\u201c It \u2019 s sometimes said that war is the failure of diplomacy . That \u2019 s not quite right . More often , war is the failure of deterrence . \u201d\n\u201c The [ Iranian ] regime received windfall concessions upon signing the 2015 nuclear deal , the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , including tens of billions in cash and billions more from new access to the global economy . But instead of using its newfound riches to invest in the Iranian people \u2014 as hoped for by Obama and his supporters \u2014 Tehran instead doubled down on its efforts to disrupt the Middle East\u2026 It is true that a more aggressive U.S. posture against Iran could lead to additional threats against U.S. installations and interests , such as Tuesday \u2019 s limited missile strikes against bases housing American troops in Iraq . But that possibility has to be weighed against the fact that Iran has already claimed hundreds of American lives and has been busy plotting and planning future attacks\u2026\n\u201c After two years of crippling U.S. sanctions ( Iran \u2019 s GDP contracted by nearly 10 percent in 2019 ) , a restive public , and a U.S. administration willing to back up its diplomacy with force , the regime confronts existential choices . Will it try to maintain its position as the world \u2019 s leading state sponsor of terror while squandering countless resources on internal repression and nuclear and ballistic missile programs ? Or , will it choose the path of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s , recognizing it is backed into a strategic corner , and negotiate a peaceful way out ? \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency .
