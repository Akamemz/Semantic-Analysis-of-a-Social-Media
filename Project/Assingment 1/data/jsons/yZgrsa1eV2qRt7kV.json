'' House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio asked in a statement , echoing a theme also asserted by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky .\n`` Surely the president wo n't cut funds to first responders when just last year Washington handed out an estimated $ 115 billion in payments to individuals who were n't even eligible to receive them , or at a time when 11 different government agencies are funding 90 different green energy programs , '' McConnell said in a statement . `` That would be a terrible and entirely unnecessary choice by a President who claims to want bipartisan reform . ''\nAt the White House , Obama said the mechanics of the forced spending cuts prevented such decision-making .\n`` If Congress allows this meat-cleaver approach to take place , it will jeopardize our military readiness , it will eviscerate job-creating investments in education and energy and medical research , it wo n't consider whether we 're cutting some bloated program that has outlived its usefulness or a vital service that Americans depend on every single day , '' Obama said . `` It does n't make those distinctions . ''\nSenate Democrats have proposed replacing the imminent cuts with a combination of more tax revenue from millionaires , ending agriculture subsidies and reducing defense spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan .\nHouse Republicans , who control the chamber , reject any increased tax revenue as a solution , setting up another in a series of congressional showdowns over spending and taxes that dominated Obama 's first term .\nObama repeated his call from last week for Congress to agree to a temporary respite from the forced spending cuts while possible negotiations continue on a larger solution .\nHe also complained that Republican ideas so far for avoiding forced budget cuts `` ask nothing '' from the wealthiest Americans or big corporations . He added that the GOP prefers having the reductions take effect instead of having `` a single tax loophole '' disappear for those who do n't need it .\n`` None of us will get 100 percent of what we want , '' the president said . `` But nobody should want these cuts to go through because the last things our families can afford right now is pain imposed unnecessarily by partisan recklessness and ideological rigidity here in Washington . ''\nRepublicans were forced to concede on their steadfast opposition to increased taxes by agreeing in early January to higher rates on top income earners as part of a deal to avoid some of the harshest impacts of what was known as the fiscal cliff , which included the forced spending cuts of sequestration as well as automatic tax hikes .\nThat agreement put off action on the sequester cuts , which were mandated by a 2011 agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling .\nThe purpose of the deep cuts to all discretionary programs and the military was to motivate Congress to reach a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement that would replace them .\nHowever , such a deal has proved impossible , leading to the imminent application of $ 85 billion in spending cuts for 2013 and almost $ 1 trillion over 10 years .\nDefense Secretary Leon Panetta and other officials warn that the cuts will have a dire impact on government operations and military readiness . The Pentagon would absorb about half of the reductions .\nIn a letter to Congress last week , FBI Director Robert Mueller said `` sequestration will require immediate and significant reductions '' to the agency and its operations .\n`` Because sequestration calls for across-the-board cuts , the FBI would be required to do less in all its programs , including against Al Qaeda and its affiliated groups , as well as the growing and sophisticated threats from cyber attacks , foreign intelligence , and national and transnational criminal activities , '' Mueller 's letter warned .\nFor example , he noted , sequestration would mean cutting 2,285 FBI employees .\nThe GOP opposes any increase in tax rates or other steps to bring in more tax revenue , saying the nation needs to reduce the cost of government .\n`` We should close loopholes and carve-outs in the tax code , but that revenue should be used to lower rates across the board , '' Boehner 's statement said . `` Tax reform is a once-in-a generation opportunity to boost job creation in America . It should not be squandered to enable more Washington spending . ''\nTo Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , the GOP stance means `` Republicans have shown that they would rather let the sequester go into effect , or make even deeper cuts to Medicare , education and medical research , than close a single wasteful tax loophole . ''\nIn their plan unveiled last week , Senate Democrats proposed replacing the forced spending cuts of sequestration through the end of this year , leaving time for possible negotiations on a broader deficit-reduction package that would eliminate sequestration entirely .\nThey called for $ 54 billion in new revenue by implementing the `` Buffett rule , '' a principle by billionaire financier Warren Buffett that he should n't pay a lower tax rate than his secretary .\nUnder it , anyone with adjusted income of more than $ 1 million after charitable deductions would pay a minimum 30 % tax rate .\nOther revenue measures in the package include ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and closing tax loopholes for the oil industry .\nIn addition , the package would cut military funding starting in 2015 , following the planned end of U.S. combat operations next year in Afghanistan . It would also end agriculture subsidies for a total saving of $ 55 billion .\nAlso Tuesday , Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson proposed a new framework to cut the country 's debt by $ 2.4 trillion over the next decade .\nBowles and Simpson were the co-chairmen of Obama 's bipartisan fiscal commission in 2010 , and their recommendations came to serve as a yardstick for other debt-reduction proposals .\nSince the fiscal commission disbanded , Congress and the White House have enacted about $ 2.7 trillion worth of savings that will occur over the next decade .\nThe $ 2.4 trillion in deficit cuts in the new Bowles-Simpson proposal would eliminate the need for the forced spending cuts of sequestration .\nBowles and Simpson called for tax reform that eliminates or reduces some write-offs and loopholes , reducing spending on Medicare and Medicaid and adopting a less generous inflation formula for entitlements and benefits such as Social Security .\nOther provisions in their new plan included curbing farm subsidies and increasing how much civilian and military personnel contribute to their health and retirement plans .\nIf the forced spending cuts of sequestration take effect on March 1 , federal workers could start facing furloughs as early as April , according to federal agencies trying to prepare for the worst .\nDaniel Werfel , a controller for the Office of Management and Budget , told a Senate panel last week that furloughs wo n't happen until after agencies negotiate with unions , and that 's not expected to be finished until after March 1 .\nAfter union bargaining , the agencies still need to give employees their official 30 days notice of impending furloughs , realistically pushing most furloughs off until April . However , some non-union employees could face furloughs in March .\nUnions usually have the final say on how the furloughs will be implemented , said Colleen M.
