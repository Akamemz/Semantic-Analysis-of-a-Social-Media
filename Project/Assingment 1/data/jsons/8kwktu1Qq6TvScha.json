Lawmakers often use it to boost their image .\nRegulations set by the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards bar lawmakers from unsolicited mass mailings , either email or \u201c snail mail , \u201d that criticize policy or legislation in a \u201c partisan , politicized or personalized \u201d manner .\n\u201c No grass-roots lobbying or soliciting support for a member \u2019 s position on a legislative , public policy , or community issue , \u201d the rules state . \u201c Members can not generate or circulate a petition under the frank . \u201d\nThe mass mailings may not go out within 90 days of a primary or general election . But those rules don \u2019 t cover the executive branch , and the White House emails such as the Daily Snapshot are not \u201c unsolicited. \u201d Recipients subscribe to them simply by signing up on the White House website .\nPete Sepp , executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union , said it \u2019 s questionable whether some of the White House emails would be permitted if congressional franking rules applied to them .\n\u201c At the very least , it would arouse criticism from political opponents of a lawmaker , and perhaps a complaint from a political challenger , \u201d Mr. Sepp said .\nAs far as policing the content of White House emails , however , Mr. Sepp said there may be \u201c practical and political problems with making sure taxpayers are getting value from a robust debate between the branches of government rather than being forced to shell out for propaganda . \u201d\n\u201c After all , Congress polices itself through the Franking Commission , which is not perfect , but who would police the White House ? The Department of Justice ? \u201d Mr. Sepp asked .\nThe White House wouldn \u2019 t answer questions about how much it spends on staff time or other expenses to produce the e-newsletters or maintain its mailing list , although emails typically are much lower in cost than the postage and paper for \u201c snail mail . \u201d\nThe number of people receiving these emails isn \u2019 t known , but it \u2019 s likely in the millions . The White House \u2019 s official Twitter account has more than 4 million followers , and the spinoff group from Mr. Obama \u2019 s 2012 campaign , Organizing for Action , has a list of supporters \u2019 email addresses that is said to number more than 12 million .\nSome specialists on campaign finance law and ethics in government don \u2019 t see anything wrong with the White House \u2019 s high-tech effort . Meredith McGehee , policy director at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington , reviewed several emails from 2013 at the request of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 and gave the opinion that they pass ethical muster .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing in them that asks for money , \u201d Ms. McGehee said . \u201c They don \u2019 t look connected to his re-election . Third , are they about policy ? Yes , they are . Now , they \u2019 re the president \u2019 s policies .
