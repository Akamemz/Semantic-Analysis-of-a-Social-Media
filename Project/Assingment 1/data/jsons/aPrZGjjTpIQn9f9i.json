It does cut benefits to current seniors . And Paul Ryan 's plan took the president 's Medicare `` savings , '' and re-routed them back into Medicare to shore up the program .

The plant finally fully closed in April of 2009 , during Obama 's presidency , as this report clearly states . Obama 's problem is that he showed up and made empty promises to pander for votes . Ryan never said Obama was personally responsible for the plant 's closure , but he accurately stated that it closed down within a year of candidate Obama 's hope-filled speech and remains closed today . Obama goes on and on about `` saving '' the auto industry and his economic recovery . That boarded-up Janesville plant tells a different story .\n( 4 ) The Stimulus - Pointing out that Paul Ryan asked that his district receive a slice of a giant , wasteful pie after it was passed -- and despite his opposition -- is at worst an instance of hypocrisy . It does not disprove anything that Ryan said in his speech , and it does not change the empirical fact that Barack Obama 's borrowed stimulus has utterly failed based on the metrics for success Obama himself set out for it .\n( 5 ) The debt commission - What Ryan said is absolutely correct . The Obama ad quotes Chris Wallace , who notes that Ryan was on that commission and voted against it . True . He refused to abide the section maintaining Obamacare , and voted no on its final findings . Still , he was intimately involved in the group 's deliberations and proposed solutions . Not fully happy with the final outcome , he went on to craft two budgets of his own , with numerous elements based on the Simpson-Bowles framework . The commission 's Democratic co-chairman ( Bowles of Simpson-Bowles ) has praised Ryan 's proposals to the hilt . Barack Obama , who convened the commission in the first place after deriding commissions on the campaign trail , completely ignored its recommendations and proceeded to propose to wildly reckless , debt-busting budgets that received a total of zero votes in either house of Congress . Correctly asserting that Ryan opposed the final Simpson-Bowles recommendations is no way absolves Obama for his demonstrable abdication of leadership on these issues . It 's more smoke and mirrors -- and more petty Obama blame , another central theme of Ryan 's address .\n( 6 ) Chris Matthews called the speech `` nasty .
