    "content": "The Senate is careening toward a historic change to its filibuster rules that takes it one step closer to a version of the majority-rule House of Representatives .\nBut no one seems to care enough to save the Senate from itself .\nUnlike past institutional crises , there \u2019 s no bipartisan \u201c gang \u201d stepping up to force a truce between the warring armies led by Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer . Acrimony between the two parties has become so routine that invoking the so-called nuclear option to get Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court is almost a ho-hum affair , assumed to be a done deal .\n\u201c The Senate has changed , \u201d said Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , who \u2019 s fought rules changes in the past . \u201c You can \u2019 t do what we used to do , what I did in the past . There \u2019 s too much ill will . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of shared concern about our direction , \u201d added Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware , one of the few Democrats willing to bargain with Republicans to maintain the filibuster . \u201c But there \u2019 s not yet a willingness to make any of the actual concessions that would require us to get back to working together in a real way . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s still a chance that lightning will strike and senators will either avert the filibuster that Democrats are prepared to mount \u2014 or find a way to prevent the nuclear option of unilaterally killing the 60-vote requirement for high court nominees , which Republicans are rounding up votes to do in response .\nBut interviews with more than two-dozen centrist-minded senators from both parties over the past week show just how remote a possibility that is .\nEight Democrats agreeing to advance Gorsuch and three Republicans opposing a change to Senate rules could conceivably avert the crisis . But attempts to form a bipartisan group toward that end have fizzled in the Senate , according to several people familiar with the matter . Republicans control 52 seats vs. Democrats \u2019 48 .\n\u201c We are gang-less , \u201d said a source familiar with those discussions .\nSome members are looking to Schumer and McConnell to keep the Senate from spiraling into a majoritarian institution without the bipartisan reputation the chamber has always enjoyed .\n\u201c It has to be resolved between the two leaders , \u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin ( D-Md . ) , who opposes Gorsuch but has not said he would join a filibuster . \u201c That \u2019 s the only way you \u2019 re going to be able to get the confidence of the members of the Senate . \u201d\nBut there have been no meaningful conversations between Schumer and McConnell about avoiding a rules change , sources said . McConnell is increasingly dug in , rallying his troops to confirm Gorsuch by any means necessary . Schumer has staked his reputation as leader to a successful filibuster of Gorsuch , with major disappointment looming on the left if he fails .\nAccordingly , the vast majority of the Senate is now resigned to further parliamentary decay .\n\u201c If Neil Gorsuch isn \u2019 t good enough , there \u2019 s never going to be a nominee good enough , and so I don \u2019 t see any advantage to rewarding bad behavior , \u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) said of a potential deal with Democrats to head off the crisis .\n\u201c To say that we will disarm and provide exactly what the majority wants while they still retain the same weapon to use in the future is probably not an actual solution , \u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley ( D-Ore. ) of an agreement that aids Gorsuch .\nLiberal and conservative activists are warning against any such agreement . When \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that Coons was speaking to Republicans about trying to preserve the filibuster , NARAL Pro-Choice America responded with ads blasting his efforts .\nAnd when Sen. Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) took to the Senate floor Tuesday to pan his own party \u2019 s \u201c audacious \u201d move to block Merrick Garland from receiving a hearing last year , McConnell quickly rebutted him during a party lunch . Attendees said McConnell argued that it was Democrats \u2014 not Republicans \u2014 who are breaking centuries of precedent by obstructing Gorsuch .\n\u201c I \u2019 m trying to stir the pot enough to get everybody concerned about where we go from here , \u201d Corker said afterward .\nSenators in both parties are growing anxious . They lament that gutting the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees will result in more ideological justices , just as the 2013 rules change on other nominees produced Cabinet picks under President Donald Trump that almost certainly would have been blocked had a 60-vote threshold remained in place .\nAnd they worry the next step is the end of the legislative filibuster , which may soon be the last remaining tool for the minority to stop the majority from running roughshod over it .\nBefore he retired late last year , former Democratic leader Harry Reid predicted the Senate would eventually do away with the filibuster altogether , saying \u201c it \u2019 s just a question of when. \u201d Reid led the 2013 effort to eliminate the filibuster for Cabinet and other nominees .\nSome members of past Senate \u201c gangs \u201d regret participating .
