''\nCNN could not independently confirm Bogomolets ' claim of sniper fire .\nAt the hotel that had been converted into a triage center , bodies covered in bloodied sheets lay on the floor . Orthodox priests prayed over them .\nThe Interior Ministry admitted Thursday that its forces used firearms , explaining that it only did so to protect unarmed police who were in danger .\nUkraine 's parliament later passed a resolution that security forces should stop using guns ( something that 's already illegal for protesters ) , back off from their positions around Maidan and denounce the `` anti-terror '' operation that had been announced earlier .\nBut whether this Thursday night resolution -- which does n't need the president 's signature -- has an impact remained to be seen .\nIn a statement that appeared to increase pressure on protesters , the Interior Ministry said it reserved the right to use force to free about 70 police officers it said had been taken hostage Thursday by protesters .\nHowever , a number of people purporting to be police officers appeared on Ukrainian television saying they had joined protesters of their own free will . It was n't clear whether those claiming to be police officers were among those allegedly taken hostage .\nThere was no sign of any captives when CNN crew went Thursday night to where they were thought to be held . A human rights group earlier claimed that any police who 'd been held against their will had been released .\nIn one way , at least , Kiev got back to a semblance of normality Thursday . In addition to announcing his resignation from Ukraine 's ruling party , the city 's mayor Volodymyr Makeenko reopened the city 's mass transit system -- which government officials had shut down to prevent protesters from reaching Independence Square .\nBut the unrest was n't just in Kiev . Anti-government protesters have also hit the streets in Lviv -- about 540 kilometers west of Kiev , near the Polish border -- among other locales . Such sentiment is particularly prevalent in western Ukraine , which is more likely to side with Europe and against Yanukovych ; Ukraine 's east , meanwhile , has tended to support him and closer ties to Russia .\n`` The people gathering here represent every demographic of the city , '' said Jason Francisco , an Emory University professor who was one of many to submit CNN iReports from Lviv . `` ... It is fair to say that the city is virtually entirely behind the opposition . And this accounts for perhaps the most conspicuous thing about the situation here : The security presence is virtually nonexistent . ''\nThe violence inflames a crisis that started in November , when Yanukovych reversed a decision to sign a trade deal with the European Union and instead turned toward Russia . Ukraine 's population has long been divided between historic loyalties to Europe and its eastern neighbor .\nThe political strife has since ballooned well beyond that one issue , however , including the opposition 's pressing constitutional reforms and to shift powers away from the president and to parliament .\nAnd the bloodshed this get week has gotten the world 's attention .\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron , for instance , talked by phone Thursday with his Polish counterpart as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin . German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Barack Obama also discussed the Ukraine .\nU.S. Vice President Joe Biden talked late Thursday with Yanukovych , who has also been in touch with Putin and U.N.

In comments Thursday , the U.N. leader called for `` genuine dialogue '' and said he was `` appalled by the use of firearms by both the police and protesters '' -- even as he stressed it is crucial , especially , that authorities exercise restraint .\nRussia , for one , has said it will send a mediator there at Yanukovych 's request to negotiate with the opposition .\nBut the Russian ambassador to the U.N. , Vitaly Churkin , said his government does n't believe the opposition wants a dialogue . He accused protest leaders of invading government facilities as a buildup to a takeover of parliament .\n`` We think that this attempt to execute a violent coup should stop , '' he said .\nJUST WATCHED New round of violence erupts in Kiev Replay More Videos ...

Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt told CNN on Thursday that `` extremes on both sides are gathering strength '' because of the instability . Even then , Pyatt said , `` It 's very clear that , for the United States , the preponderance of the responsibility rests with the President Yanukovych .

''\nThe instability extends , too , to Ukraine 's military , after its leader was replaced Wednesday by Yanukovych .\nThere have been no indications Ukrainian troops have been involved in the violence , having rather moved to protect their own facilities and weaponry , U.S. military spokesman John Kirby said . At the same time , the Ukrainian military 's new leadership has been `` unresponsive '' to U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel 's attempts to communicate with them , according to Kirby .\nAfter meeting in urgent session in Brussels , European Union officials agreed to freeze the assets of Ukrainians deemed responsible for the violence , and to prevent them from traveling into the European Union , the organization said in a statement .\n`` There is widespread horror in the European Union as well as in the United Kingdom at the scale of the loss of innocent life and the events of the last 48 hours , '' British Foreign Minister William Hague said .\nThe move comes a day after the United States announced it would n't give visas to 20 people , including government officials , tied to the unrest .

The street protests soon led to the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and triggered a chain of events that included Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and fighting in Eastern Ukraine with pro-Russian separatist forces.
