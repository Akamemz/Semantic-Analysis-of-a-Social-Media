In February the president claimed he never said the Russian election interference did not happen , but he has done so publicly multiple times . He has persistently decried as a \u201c witch hunt \u201d the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller of Russian meddling as well as possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia .\nThe president has often praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and seemed to accept his denials of his involvement in the election-influence campaign , despite conclusions from US intelligence agencies and the Senate that Putin had ordered the efforts .\nAt a recent rally in Montana , Trump , who is expected to meet with Putin a summit in Helsinki later this month , didn \u2019 t have a bad word to say about him . \u201c You know what ?
