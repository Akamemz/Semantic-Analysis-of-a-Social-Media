    "content": "It will go on . Meanwhile , Congress ought to get back to its business .\nIn Wednesday \u2019 s final impeachment vote in the Senate , only one Senate Republican , Mitt Romney , crossed party lines to vote to remove Donald Trump from office . No Senate Democrat bucked party-line discipline to vote for Trump \u2019 s acquittal . This followed last Friday \u2019 s 51\u201349 vote to conclude the trial on the basis of the evidence heard in the House , without live witness testimony . Only two Republicans ( Romney and Susan Collins ) , and no Democrats , crossed party lines in that vote .\nThere has been a great deal of hand-wringing about what it means that Senate Republicans kept enough of a united front to dispose of the charges against Trump without even a full trial . In fact , acquittal is a reasonable political judgment by Republican senators that reflects the preexisting standards for presidential impeachments , rather than a change to them .\nImpeachment for abuse of power is political . A great deal of the commentary and political argument on impeachment takes a wrong turn from the very start . The mistake is treating presidential impeachment as a purely legal question in which it is somehow inappropriate to consider politics . Taking this view , Democrats argue that if any impeachable \u201c high Crimes and Misdemeanors \u201d are proven , there is a solemn duty to remove the president , and it is a violation of the senators \u2019 oaths and an offense against the rule of law to acquit . The president \u2019 s defenders , for their part , argue that no impeachable \u201c high Crimes and Misdemeanors \u201d are even alleged , and therefore the entire process amounts to an assault by the House on the rule of law and something like a coup . Both views are wrong .\nThe Constitution says that a president or other federal officer \u201c shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for , and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. \u201d Every prior successful impeachment and removal under this standard has involved a federal judge , and almost all involved treason , bribery , or some criminal offense closely related to bribery . In such cases , where a serious crime is proven that is both illegal and related to the duties of public office , there is a stronger argument for expecting the Senate to carry out removal without regard to politics .\nTrump \u2019 s defense team , in particular Professor Alan Dershowitz , have argued that this is all there is to impeachment : proof of a serious crime or \u201c quasi-crime , \u201d or nothing . Dershowitz is , however , misreading the history of the impeachment clause . As I have explained at greater length , the Framers also intended to create a remedy for official abuses of power that did not involve an enumerated crime . The Constitutional Convention started with treason and bribery and initially considered adding \u201c maladministration , \u201d a term used in multiple state constitutions at the time , but that would have licensed too many impeachments for simply being negligent about some presidential duty . The Convention thus instead chose the term \u201c high Crimes and Misdemeanors against the United States , \u201d adapted from Edmund Burke \u2019 s then-ongoing bill of impeachment in Parliament against the Governor-General of India for abuses of power . Gouverneur Morris \u2019 s final draft dropped \u201c against the United States , \u201d arguably broadening the types of offenses covered by impeachment . Alexander Hamilton , in Federalist No . 65 , described impeachment as a remedy for \u201c offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men , or , in other words , from the abuse or violation of some public trust . They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL . \u201d\nThe central charge against Trump falls within this third and most ambiguous category : abuse of public trust . For all the rhetoric thrown around by House Democrats , there is no criminal conduct charged . Trump is principally accused of using the foreign policy powers of the presidency \u2014 including delaying congressionally authorized military aid , arguably without legal authority to do so \u2014 in order to get Ukraine to announce a criminal investigation against Joe Biden \u2019 s son , Hunter , and possibly Biden himself . The accusation is that Trump did so purely for his own political benefit against Biden , and without obtaining any legitimate public benefit to the United States .\nThis would be an abuse of public trust because Trump leveraged presidential power and the public \u2019 s money to gain something of political benefit to himself , and nothing of any benefit to the nation or the taxpayers . The way this was done departs from the proper methods for investigating public corruption in three ways :\nsiccing the dubious institutions of a foreign government on American citizens , one of them a former vice president , rather than simply asking foreign cooperation in an American Justice Department investigation ; asking that foreign government to publicly announce the investigation from the outset , for the apparent purpose of using that announcement as a club in the American presidential election ; and pressuring Ukraine to give information directly to Rudy Giuliani in his capacity as the president \u2019 s personal attorney , rather than to the proper American authorities who answer to Trump in his capacity as head of the executive branch and who have the power to convene grand juries , issue subpoenas , and prosecute crimes .\nThere remain some important facts in dispute about these charges , such as precisely what was communicated to Ukraine and when ( other than Trump \u2019 s call with President Zelensky ) . The Trump defense has other arguments for why an investigation was warranted . But many of the key facts are not really in serious doubt . Nor is the fact that Trump ultimately relented and released the aid .\nIf you see impeachment purely as a legal question , then the debate is about whether this could be an impeachable offense , and if it is , then it must lead to conviction . But abuse of power is an inherently political charge , as Hamilton recognized , and its disposition is given to a body of elected officials with the understanding that they will have to make political judgments . Those judgments are not just about the elements of the offense ( e.g. , whether the United States had any public interest in Ukraine investigating Hunter Biden ) , but also about whether the punishment fits the offense . A great many uses of presidential power could be , and have been , argued as bases for impeachment . It is a political decision for the House to choose which to charge , and a political decision for the Senate to decide when to remove .\nIn this case , there are entirely legitimate political considerations that weigh in favor of acquittal . None of these should be considered bright-line rules ; each requires precisely the sort of political prudence we expect of senators :\nThe president is duly elected to head a coordinate branch of the federal government , and so should not be removed lightly in a borderline case . This is not a complete bar to removal \u2014 it is present in every impeachment \u2014 but it separates presidential impeachments from impeachments of judges or Cabinet secretaries . There is no clear , bipartisan public support for removing Trump . Richard Nixon \u2019 s impeachment did not pass the House Judiciary Committee until there was clear , majority support : by late July 1974 , Gallup showed the public 57\u201324 behind removing Nixon , and an August 5 Harris poll taken after the Judiciary Committee vote showed 66\u201327 support . Nixon resigned four days later . The polling averages at this writing , by contrast , show 48.1 percent opposed to removing Trump compared to 47.8 percent in favor , with Republicans overwhelmingly opposed and independent voters opposing removal 46.8 percent to 45.3 percent . Those numbers have fluctuated , but when the country is roughly evenly divided and only the opposing party \u2019 s voters are clearly in favor of removal , the public legitimacy of removing the president for the first time in American history is shaky . Republican voters in particular would regard Trump \u2019 s removal as a double standard , after Bill Clinton was not removed for committing felonies in office . Every single Democrat in the Senate in 1999 voted to acquit Clinton . The case for not removing Clinton was explicitly based on his popularity and the argument that it was imprudent to remove a president over felonies aimed at covering up a political liability . Trump is running for reelection and will face the voters in nine months , so if the Senate errs on the side of acquittal , the voters can always reverse that outcome . This distinguishes the situation from those of all the previous presidents facing impeachments . Ben Franklin \u2019 s argument for allowing impeachments of presidents was that without one , the people \u2019 s only remedy would be assassination \u2014 but an impending election lets the voters decide . Removing Trump would reward the ongoing efforts of civil servants within the Executive Branch to shift power over foreign and national-security policy from the elected commander in chief to the permanent civil service , by means of generating investigations , surveillance , and legal and media campaigns against elected leaders . Trump was not even successful in his attempt ; he ultimately released the funds to Ukraine without a major delay and without conditions . ( I regard this last as the least persuasive of these arguments , but it is a mitigating factor . )\nThere are , of course , also some reasonable arguments in favor of conviction , which helps explain why Romney crossed the aisle :\nTrump \u2019 s misconduct was aimed at the upcoming election , and there is really no assurance that an unrepentant Trump will not try something similar , especially if he draws a different opponent than Biden . The failure to ever remove a president has contributed to the accumulation of power in the presidency at the expense of Congress . We are a long way from the great fear of 1868 that removing the president would fatally weaken the presidency and lead to congressional hegemony . The House has always treated oversight of the president as a purely partisan matter . While no Senator has ever voted to remove a president from his or her own party , the devolution of Senate oversight into the same dynamics as the House is unhealthy . The Clinton-acquittal standard had ripple effects in corroding our politics over the past two decades , leading to the cynicism about elite unaccountability that gave rise to Trump in the first place ; removal would act as an admission that we went down the wrong path in 1999 . Trump has shown a worrisome tendency to regard his Article II powers over foreign affairs , national security , and law enforcement as inseparable from his personal interests .\nFor Republican senators , of course , there is also the more elemental fact of political survival : Because Republican voters overwhelmingly see this as a partisan test of strength and independent voters are divided , there is a great political downside in voting to convict , and very little political price to be paid in voting to acquit . Voters who are single-issue anti-Trump in 2020 are unlikely supporters anyway , and senators up for reelection in 2022 or 2024 may find memories shorter in general elections than they are in partisan primaries . Also , a handful of Republican senators voting to convict accomplishes nothing ; only 20 yes votes would actually remove Trump .\nGiven the political nature of Trump \u2019 s abuse of power , there are more than enough legitimate reasons for Senate Republicans to vote to acquit .\nDemocrats killed censure . In a sane world , Trump should have been censured instead of impeached . Democrats knew from the outset of this process that they were going to lose the impeachment fight . They also knew that some Republican senators would have liked a way to acknowledge that Trump overstepped his bounds , without being accused of a \u201c coup. \u201d Up to the point of the House impeachment vote , Democrats had the leverage to try to work something out along those lines . But just as happened with the Clinton impeachment , once the House voted on the articles and forced the Senate to hear the case , the chance for a middle ground vanished . And once the Senate voted to proceed without live witnesses , all of the Democrats \u2019 political leverage was lost . Republicans now are right to be concerned that Democrats would use a censure not as a way to close the book on this sordid chapter , but rather as justification to restart the process .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter that there was no real trial . The Constitution provides for a trial presided over by the chief justice , but it does not say anything about the nature of that trial . That leaves the Senate in charge of its own procedures , as it normally is .\nMuch of the hue and cry against Republicans for deciding to proceed to a vote without witnesses is either just political spin or treats a trial as a political exercise in informing the voters . It is true that all prior impeachment trials have called witnesses , but witnesses are there for two reasons : to help the senators decide how to vote , and to allow the accused to present a defense that may not have been possible in the House . Neither of those reasons matters once a sufficient number of senators have decided , as a matter of political judgment , to acquit . Just as was true in the House , \u201c due process of law \u201d is an important value , but not one that Congress is required to follow within its own walls . Even in courts of law , judges throw out cases where the allegations in an indictment or civil complaint do not make out a case worth trying , or where the known and undisputed facts fail to prove some element of a charge .\nProceeding without witnesses is a political risk for pro-acquittal Republicans : There is still no way for any Senator to know if there are other shoes to drop . But if the sole point of witnesses is to provide oversight and sunlight to the public , that is something the House should have considered before voting to impeach on an inadequate record , and it is also something the House and/or Senate could still do later . Congressman Jerry Nadler has already said he is likely to subpoena John Bolton and continue the House \u2019 s investigation . And the politics of the issue simply mirror the House \u2019 s often high-handed management of its own side of the process . The House managers \u2019 crocodile tears over not getting to put on a case they should have put on in their own chamber are simply political theater .\nThe rule of law will go on . The rule of law in America will not be significantly worse off for the acquittal of Trump . The decision to acquit him was a natural and expected outcome of a process that charged him only with political offenses and failed to move a clear majority of the public against him . The result was exactly what anyone would have predicted simply from a reading of the history of the impeachment proceedings against Andrew Johnson , Richard Nixon , and Bill Clinton . If our standards for impeaching presidents are too high , all this vote did was reiterate what we already knew .\nFuture Congresses should not fear to impeach presidents \u2014 even this one , again \u2014 if they really have the goods and can get the public behind them . In the meantime , both parties in Congress ought to get back to the less glamorous but important work of reviving the other tools given by Article I to Congress to rein in the executive branch .\nIf Democrats are worried that an acquittal will embolden Trump , they should have considered that before they began down a road that was always going to end with one . They will have a second chance to make their case directly to the American people in November .",
