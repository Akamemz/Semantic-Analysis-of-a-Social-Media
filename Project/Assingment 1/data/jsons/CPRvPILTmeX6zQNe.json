Bush and George H.W . Bush .\nPresidents 41 and 43 announced in May that neither would endorse presumptive nominee Donald Trump , nor were either planning to attend the convention as reported in Politico .\nIn 2012 neither the 41st , nor 43rd former president spoke in person at the convention but did provide recorded messages .

The physical absence marked \u201c the first president in a generation to miss his party \u2019 s nominating ceremony , \u201d according to the New York Times .\nIn modern history almost all former presidents have participated in their party \u2019 s convention directly following their exit from office . Gerald R. Ford served as President from 1974 to 1977 and was the Republican Party \u2019 s 1976 nominee , but lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter . 1976 was the infamous contested Republican convention that put up Ford for the presidency over Ronald Reagan , who would become the party \u2019 s 1980 nominee and be elected President . Each of these , as well as former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W . Bush , attended the first convention for their party after leaving office , according to the Times . Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon were noted as exceptions to the tradition .\nTwo most recent Republican presidential nominees : 2008 failed nominee Sen. John McCain and unsuccessful 2012 nominee Mitt Romney also have expressed that they have no plans to attend this year \u2019 s RNC convention .\nMcCain has indicated that he will pass on the convention as he faces a tough re-election bid .

McCain has also suffered in polls when matched against Democratic Party candidate Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick . Kirkpatrick pulled slightly ahead of McCain in an early June poll . Arizona \u2019 s primary election is August 30 . Their presidential preference vote , which went hard for Trump , took place in March .\nRomney , who has continually flirted with the idea of running again , lost the nomination to McCain in 2008 , won the nomination in 2012 , but ultimately lost the election to President Barack Obama \u2019 s bid for a second term . As Trump emerged as the increasingly likely nominee , Romney held a special event at the University of Utah in March . Drawing in attention with the lure of big news he blasted Trump and begged Republicans not to nominate Trump .\nSen. Bob Dole is the sole former Republican presidential nominee that has communicated he will attend this year \u2019 s nominating convention , an aide to Dole told CNN . Dole was the nominee in 1996 but lost the general election to Democrat Bill Clinton .\nFour former presidential candidates : Ohio Gov . John Kasich , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham have expressed that they will abstain from the convention . Kasich has failed to honor an earlier pledge to support the Republican nominee as Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee . \u201c It \u2019 s painful \u201d was his response to endorsement questions during an appearance on MSNBC \u2019 s Morning Joe in June . \u201c I \u2019 m not making any final decision yet , but at this point I just can \u2019 t do it . \u201d\nKasich \u2019 s choice to dodge the convention in Cleveland piles on his opposition as it is being held in the very state of which he is governor .\nSen. Rubio \u2019 s spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas blamed Rubio \u2019 s absence on his late decision to jump into a re-election bid to retain his seat in the U.S. Senate . CNN reported her statement that the former 2016 presidential candidate previously planned to attend . Unlike Kasich , Rubio has indicated he will support the Republican nominee .\nThen there \u2019 s the Bush that sought to be the third to serve as president . Jeb Bush rebuffed a recently dubbed presumptive nominee Trump with backhanded congratulations in May , writing in part , \u201c In November , I will not vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton\u2026 \u201d Bush pledged , along with eight other candidates who took to an August debate stage , to support the Republican nominee . Trump later agreed to that pledge and re-affirmed it during a March debate .\nSen. Lindsey Graham , who only reluctantly supported Trump \u2019 s closest competitor Sen. Ted Cruz when all other viable options had fallen away , declared in May that he could not \u201c in good conscience support Donald Trump \u201d and would not attend the convention , according to TIME . Graham resigned from the race for the nomination in December with just 0.5 percent support . Less than a month later Graham endorsed establishment darling Jeb Bush .\nIn late May Graham appeared to be privately supportive of Trump in light of the alternative , Democratic presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton .\nHints of a breakdown in some of the candidates \u2019 pledge to support the nominee were highlighted in a March CNN Town Hall where Trump , Cruz , and Kasich each expressed their reconsideration .\nNew Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte has counted herself among those who will not attend the convention , citing her own tough re-election battle . In April Ayotte told CNN that her presence is \u201c unlikely . \u201d\nIllinois Sen. Mark Kirk will also be home fighting for re-election , his campaign manager said in a statement last April according to the Chicago Tribune . Kirk did , however , affirm ahead of the Illinois primary that he would \u201c certainly \u201d support Trump as the nominee . In June Kirk reversed course on support for Trump , telling CNN that he \u201c can not and will not support \u201d Trump and would write in CIA director David Petraeus in the fall .

Richard Burr expressed uncertainty as to whether he will attend in June , according to CNN .
