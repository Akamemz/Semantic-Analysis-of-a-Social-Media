But the border was more porous than ever , and workplace enforcement had all but ground to a halt , as a new cottage industry in forged identity documents erased all hope of meaningful control and a frustrated immigration service threw up its hands .\nEnter President Obama , who from day one has shown what House Republicans consider a decidedly selective approach to the law . Whatever you think of Obamacare or the Defense of Marriage Act , they are the law of the land -- but the president has enforced them only when he felt like it , if he felt like it at all -- putting a hold , for example , on the Obamacare employer mandate .
