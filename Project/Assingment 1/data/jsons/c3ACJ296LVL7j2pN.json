Elizabeth Warren at the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville , Ohio , October 15 , 2019 . ( Shannon Stapleton/Reuters )\nIn the 20th century , no Congress brought impeachment proceedings against a first-term president facing a reelection . Both the Nixon and Clinton efforts were aimed at reelected presidents , perhaps on the theory that there was supposedly no other means of bringing them to account once they had been elected twice .\nIn contrast , Trump faces reelection in about a year . The prevailing mood may soon be just to let the voters adjudicate his purported sins and for a year allow the Congress to get back to \u2014 or begin \u2014 governing .\nThe makeup of the Senate matters . Nixon resigned before House impeachment because he feared that , if he were impeached , there might be enough Republican senators to give the Democratic majority a possible two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict him , given that the media hated his guts and the economy was souring and draining public support .\nBill Clinton knew that impeachment , facts aside , did not matter much , because the Republican Senate majority was never going to find the necessary votes to convict him , the media was on his side , and the economy was still robust .\nIn Trump \u2019 s case , there is little likelihood that a Republican Senate majority will lose control of its membership to render a two-thirds majority guilty vote . The economy is strong , and impeachment will become unpopular when the public knows that it will not , and can not , remove a president . The Democrats are more likely seeking a symbolic 51 percent conviction vote , and a year of \u201c the walls are closing in \u201d anti-Trump chant in the press .\nPolls matter . When the media and Democrats started impeachment stories and investigations , Nixon \u2019 s favorability was near 70 percent , after his landslide reelection and second inaugural . After twelve months of Watergate , he ended 1973 at about 30 percent approval . When he left office in August 1973 before impeachment , his approval was at about 24 percent .\nClinton , in contrast , enjoyed about 70 percent favorability when impeachment started and he went down only about 10 points \u2014 before rebounding and leaving office impeached but quite popular at 65 percent approval . The therapeutic Clinton lived in a pre-Internet age , and \u201c I feel your pain \u201d still resonated .\nThree years \u2019 worth of talk of Trump impeachment waxes and wanes . His polls accordingly slide to the low forties when \u201c bombshells \u201d and \u201c turning point \u201d frenzies flood the media , and then they inch back up to the middle forties when the bombast passes .\nAt this point in his presidency , Bill Clinton was gradually climbing back to near 50 percent approval ; Barack Obama was right where Trump is now , at about 42-43 percent . It is hard to know whether impeachment helped or hurt Clinton because the economy was booming , he was seen as bipartisan , and the debt was finally declining . Impeachment was either irrelevant to his status or seen as a threat to it . Either way , Clinton was popular right before and after impeachment .\nIn Trump \u2019 s case , it may be that he ends up at about 44 percent favorability after the impeachment circus either fades or is realized , about where he was when the whistleblower hysteria commenced .\nBoth prior impeachment efforts were transparent , not just because key congressmen such as Peter Rodino and Newt Gingrich followed protocols , but also because both impeachments were built on damning cases from the work of special counsels . They could afford , then , to be transparent and allow the minority to make its case in the manner of most Judicial Committee hearings . In Trump \u2019 s case , however , a special-counsel investigation of 22 months \u2019 duration has already cleared the president and not recommended a criminal referral , and there is no legal case for impeachment .\nFor all the bluster , it is hard to see how the Democrats enjoy a winning hand . The catalyst for this version of the latest episode of the serial coup was the late , great \u201c whistleblower \u201d complaint . But by any definition , the anonymous leaker is by no means a whistleblower . He did not go first to the IG , but to Adam Schiff \u2019 s staff , a fact Schiff abjectly lied about . The rules prohibiting hearsay complaints were recently and mysteriously changed to facilitate the complaints like those of the current leaker \u2014 hearsay that a short time ago would not have been permissible .\nThe melodrama allegations of quid pro quo deal-making with the Ukrainian president were belied by Trump \u2019 s own release of the transcript of his call . The details showed bluster , not high crimes and misdemeanors , and it did not even match the whistleblower \u2019 s second- and third-hand versions of the call \u2014 a fact emphasized by Schiff \u2019 s bizarre made-up rendition , during a congressional hearing , of the transcript , which Schiff branded a \u201c parody. \u201d That the once coveted whistleblower will likely fade back into the bureaucratic abyss \u2014 without Democrats wanting him to be seen , heard , or cross-examined \u2014 is a testament to just how ridiculous is the latest iteration of impeaching Trump .\nThe word \u201c Ukraine \u201d now conjures up Joe and Hunter Biden as much as Trump . So its evocation serves as a boomerang , in either hurting or eventually taking out the stubborn Democratic front-runner .\nNancy Pelosi still has not called a vote for either a former inquiry or formal impeachment . She apparently wishes to allow Adam Schiff \u2019 s Intelligence Committee \u2014 the absurd place to start an impeachment \u201c hearing \u201d \u2014 to run wild behind secrecy , redactions , and refusals to call in minority witnesses and allow cross-examinations , in hopes that the carnival drives down Trump \u2019 s numbers before the public puts a stop to the freak show . Again , why not \u2014 given that the whistleblower could never sustain questions about his prior relationships with Joe Biden , Schiff , and Schiff \u2019 s staff , and about liberal lawyers prepping his complaint , and the actual leaking sources of his allegation ?\nThe impeachment modus operandi for a while longer is by now old hat : Schiff calls in a supposed friendly witness and leaks the opening statement to the media , the latter declare it proof of Trump \u2019 s guilt , and then he keeps under wraps incriminating cross-examination questioning , if it even occurs , of the witness . The public already knows that such procedures are foreign to the American experience and violate the spirit of the Constitution \u2014 the resort of a Star Chamber inquisitor afraid he has no real case and that he \u2019 ll look stupid publicly pursuing such a chimera .\nGiving Schiff such power was like arming an arsonist with a fuel tanker . Schiff has been serially caught in a number of outright lies and double-dealing . More will follow , because he is ignorant and arrogant \u2014 and oblivious to both . \u201c Impeachment \u201d is now a construct to divert from the Trump record , goad Trump into Twitter-frenzies , and drive down his polls to the high thirties \u2014 necessary for a serious impeachment bid .\nIf impeachment does not occur by Christmas , and it may well not , then the news cycle will preempt coverage of Schiff \u2019 s fading melodrama , especially if there are referrals for , or actual , indictments of , Obama-era intelligence officials . The extremism voiced on the Democratic stage will not help impeachment . The candidates themselves may come to resent the diversion of media coverage away from their candidacies and chafe if there is no compelling evidence for the impeachment stampede . In any case , far from the Horowitz , Barr , and Durham investigations being diversions from impeachment , the latest round of impeachment frenzy was likely designed to divert from the final unfolding of the greatest political scandal of the last half-century : the Obama-era intelligence agencies \u2019 efforts to derail a campaign and then subvert a presidency .\nNone of the major issues aired on the democratic debates poll at 51 percent or above \u2014 not the Green New Deal , reparations , the abolishment of ICE , open borders , Medicare for all , free tuition and cancellation of student debt , a wealth tax , legal infanticide and late-term abortions , and on and on .\nRather than introduce any of these agendas in Congress , Democratic House and Senate members obsess over Trump . Democrats may scream \u201c Now Trump has a record , \u201d and he certainly does . But it is mainly characterized by near-record-low unemployment , massive new gas and oil production , strong growth , and a vibrant stock market . Trump pushed , as he promised , his four signature agendas , designed to separate him from all 16 of the 2016 primary candidates \u2014 being tough on China , unfair trade , and open borders ; and having fewer optional overseas military interventions \u2014 often against congressional and court opposition .\nAll caused hysterias , but the public more or less supports calling Beijing to account , securing borders , insisting on reciprocal and symmetrical trade , and it opposes intervening again in the Middle East , given past displeasure with Afghanistan , Libya , Iraq , and Syria , and de facto U.S. independence from Middle East oil .\nThe Democratic field resembles that of 2003 as it was entering Bush \u2019 s reelection year of 2004 , when unhinged Howard Dean was the front-runner , and blow-dried phony John Edwards seemed the only alternative \u2014 until old warhorse John Kerry entered to reassure Democratic donors that they would have a choice between a quasi-socialist and a helium-filled suit . The tripartite choice now is between a 78-year old who is an avowed but increasingly frail socialist ; a 70-year-old who has in the past fabricated her identity and is running as a socialist in all but name ; and a 76-year-old white guy who has trouble stringing together simple sentences and thoughts , and who failed in two earlier presidential bids due to plagiarism , lies about his bio , and racially insensitive remarks .\nHow weird to watch a triad of private-jet-flying , SUV-driven , privileged multimillionaire old white people railing against multimillionaires , fossil fuels , and white privilege .\nThere are no moderate fringe candidates pulling any of them to the center , but rather incompetent , off-putting hard leftists such as the hyperactive Beto O \u2019 Rourke , the self-righteous Pete Buttigieg , the whiny Kamala Harris , the incoherent Cory Booker , and a host of other forgettables . If Warren or Sanders is nominated , neither will raise much money \u2014 given that Wall Street , Corporate America , and Silicon Valley do not equate their Democratic loyalties with a suicide pact .\nIf Biden survives , he will raise a great deal of cash , and his future depends on how well he remembers where he is , whom he is surrounded by , and what he is supposed to say .\nNo one knows what the state of the union will be in November 2020 . If unemployment stays near the near-record peacetime low of 3.5 percent , the economy still chugs along at 2 to 3 percent growth , and there is a decrease in illegal border crossings and staged caravan melodramas , Trump will be in a good position against any Democratic candidate to repeat his 2016 performance of winning the Electoral College while losing the popular vote . A Warren or Sanders McGovern- or Mondale-like candidacy would make his reelection much more likely .\nWhat sinks presidencies , either preventing reelection or de facto ending them in stasis and crises are unpopular wars ( Vietnam , Iraq ) , perceived recessions ( 1980 , 1992 ) , or major scandals ( Watergate ) . Trump may cause furor by pulling back tripwire troops in Syria , but the move will probably continue to poll at over 50 percent with the public . He is unlikely to insert forces in optional engagements . A tit-for-tat missile or bombing response to an Iranian or ISIS attack would likely win approval .\nImpeachments and scandals , as the case of Bill Clinton reminds us , are two different things .
