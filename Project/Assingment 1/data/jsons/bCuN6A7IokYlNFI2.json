    "content": "The Justice Department is planning to conduct a federal investigation into the chokehold death of an unarmed black man after a New York City grand jury declined to indict the white police officer who performed the move , Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday .\nThe probe will look for a potential civil rights violation in the death of Eric Garner . Garner , 43 , was confronted by police officers on July 17 on suspicion of selling loose cigarettes . A video shot by an onlooker shows a police officer getting Garner in what is alleged to be a chokehold and Garner repeatedly saying he could not breathe .\nHolder said this is one of `` several recent incidents that have tested the sense of trust that must exist between law enforcement and the communities they are charged to serve and protect . '' Both cases have put law-enforcement officers under a microscope on how they use excessive force to arrests minorities .\n`` This is not a New York issue or a Ferguson issue alone , '' Holder told reporters late Wednesday . `` Those who have protested peacefully across our great nation following the grand jury 's decision in Ferguson have made that clear . ''\nSeparately , New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he had spoken with Holder and Loretta Lynch , the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York who has been nominated as Holder 's successor , and was told that the federal investigation into the death will now move forward .\nThe investigation was announced Wednesday night , hours after the Staten Island grand jury \u2019 s decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo . The grand jury could have considered charges ranging from murder to reckless endangerment .\nThe Justice Department had been monitoring the outcome of the local investigation before announcing its own probe . That investigation will be similar to a separate federal one already underway into the Aug. 9 shooting death in Ferguson of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old . A county grand jury in that case decided last week to not indict the white officer , Darren Wilson .\nTo mount a federal prosecution in police misconduct cases , officials have to satisfy an extremely difficult legal standard \u2014 that the officer willfully violated a victim 's civil rights and used more force than the law allowed . Though the legal standard will be the same in both the Ferguson and New York cases , there are important differences between the two investigations , said William Yeomans , a former Justice Department civil rights official .\n`` One big difference , and one thing I think makes this an easier investigation , is the existence of videotape , '' Yeomans said . `` We did n't have that in Ferguson , and we would know much more about what happened in Ferguson if we had .
