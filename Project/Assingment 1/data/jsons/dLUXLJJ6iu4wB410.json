Jason Crow , D-Colo. , said during his remarks , the first among the Democrats who delivered arguments .\nCrow addressed an argument put forth by Trump legal team member Alan Dershowitz , who claimed that Trump was working in the national interest , and not his personal interest , by asking Ukraine to investigate possible corruption related to former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter . Dershowitz asserted that even if Trump was acting to aid his own re-election if he believes his re-election to be in the nation 's best interest , it would be proper .\nThis position was absurd , Crow insisted , telling the Senate `` we can not and should not leave our common sense at the door . '' He added that the logical conclusion of Dershowitz 's argument is that `` the president is the state . '' ( Dershowitz had already clarified his position in an op-ed for The Hill , stating that `` pundits and partisan politicians have been deliberately distorting '' his words . )\nAs for the president 's team on Monday , attorney Kenneth Starr argued the House 's impeachment power is not free of limitations .\n`` They \u2019 ve got the power , but that doesn \u2019 t mean that anything goes , '' he said .\n`` Did the House Judiciary Committee rush to judgment in fashioning the articles of impeachment ? Did it carefully gather the facts , assess the facts , before it concluded we need nothing more than the panel of very distinguished professors and the splendid presentations by both the majority counsel and the minority counsel ? '' Starr asked .\n`` What was being said in the sounds of silence was this : we don \u2019 t have time to follow the rules , '' he said , pointing specifically to House Democrats ' refusal to allow Republicans to call witnesses .\nStarr also accused the House Judiciary Committee of rushing to move forward with impeachment and contrasted Trump 's impeachment with that of President Bill Clinton and the effort to impeach President Richard Nixon , both of which enjoyed bipartisan support , unlike the Trump impeachment .\nThe final statements come after the GOP-led Senate voted 51-49 last week not to call any additional witnesses to provide testimony , despite House Democrats hoping to hear from individuals such as former national security adviser John Bolton , who said he would comply if he received a subpoena from the Senate .\nRepublicans cited the Democrat-controlled House \u2019 s failure to call Bolton and others , as well as their insistence that they already had enough evidence to support their case .\nMURKOWSKI APPEARS TO DING WARREN IN STATEMENT ANNOUNCING 'NO ' VOTE ON IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES\nHouse manager Rep. Val Demings , D-Fla. , took a different stance during her remarks , claiming that Trump 's efforts to use Rudy Giuliani to get Ukraine to investigate his political opponents and the withholding of military aid amounted to `` extortion , '' and that Trump was trying to `` cheat '' in the 2020 election .\nIn his statement , Alexander said that while Trump acted in a manner that was \u201c inappropriate , \u201d it should be up to American voters to decide his fate in November \u2019 s election .\n\u201c The Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year \u2019 s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate , \u201d he said .\nDuring closing arguments , Crow took issue with the notion that the impeachment effort was meant to either reverse the 2016 election or interfere with the 2020 race .\nHouse Manager Rep. Hakeem Jeffries , D-N.Y. , also accused Trump of cheating , and spoke in dire terms of the possibility of letting him get away with it .\n`` Make no mistake , these are perilous times if we determine that the remedy for a president who cheats in an election is to pronounce him vindicated and attack those who exposed his misconduct , '' Jeffries said .\nEarly in his remarks , Jeffires focused on the allegation the Trump obstructed Congress by instructing officials not to comply with House subpoenas . While Republicans claim that the charge is improper because the House never sought judicial enforcement of the subpoenas or a ruling that Trump 's claim of executive privilege was improper , Jeffries maintained that the House has the sole power over matters related to impeachment .\n`` To condone the president \u2019 s obstruction would strike a death blow to the impeachment clause of the constitution , \u201d he said .\nBut while Democrats claimed that an acquittal would place the president above the law , deputy counsel to the president Patrick Philbin noted that `` the House of Representatives is also not above the law . ''\nPhilbin described the beginnings of the impeachment inquiry , and how it strayed from established norms .\n`` In very significant and important respects they didn \u2019 t follow the law .
