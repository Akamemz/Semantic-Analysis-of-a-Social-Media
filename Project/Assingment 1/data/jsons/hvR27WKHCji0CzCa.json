For many that trust carries over to vaccines . Ms. Rehmeyer , whose memoir \u201c Into the Shadowlands \u201d chronicles her struggles with chronic fatigue syndrome , says she \u2019 s often hesitant to wade into the topic on public forums like social media because of how loaded it can be . But she also feels as if she occupies an unusual space in such a polarized realm .\n\u201c I value and respect people who don \u2019 t value and respect one another , \u201d she says . \u201c A lot of science writers don \u2019 t know anybody they respect who is hesitant about vaccines . ... Whether [ those who are skeptical of vaccines ] are right or not , this is an issue that deserves compassion and deserves to be taken seriously . It \u2019 s not the case that this is just a whole bunch of anti-science crazy people . \u201d\nThe United States is experiencing its worst measles year since 2000 , with more than 750 cases reported so far . The outbreak is due primarily to the fact that the disease has exploded globally , and international travelers have brought it back to the U.S . But it has spread in communities with low vaccination rates , including some in New York and Washington state .\nWith the increase in measles cases has come a renewed focus on those who delay or opt out of vaccinating , with angry rhetoric on both sides . Those who comply with the required vaccine schedule often feel that vaccine skeptics are needlessly endangering the broader community . Non-vaccinating parents , meanwhile , can feel attacked and misunderstood .\nThe reality , say experts , is more nuanced than the shrill extremes on social media might lead us to believe . Yes , vaccine hesitancy , as it \u2019 s often known , is a serious issue . The World Health Organization listed it as one of its 10 threats to global health in 2019 . But , in the U.S. at least , broad compliance rates are high enough that there \u2019 s no large concern in most communities . And reasons for not vaccinating \u2013 or for simply feeling unsure about it \u2013 can vary widely , and often hinge on a lack of trust . The solution , in that case , is rarely about shaming , or even stricter mandates , but working to understand why that distrust exists in the first place .\n\u201c We have to reframe this debate , \u201d says Bernice Hausman , a humanities professor at the Pennsylvania State College of Medicine and author of the new book \u201c Anti/Vax. \u201d \u201c Framing it in terms of misinformation and scientific illiteracy is not helpful at this point . \u201d\nUltimately , says Professor Hausman , \u201c vaccination controversy is not a scientific problem , it \u2019 s a social problem . ... We need people who understand how to understand culture , how to understand why people come to the beliefs they hold , and why it \u2019 s hard to change certain beliefs . \u201d\nThe science around vaccines is clear : They involve negligible risk and huge societal benefit , and in order to be most effective , they require the vast majority of a community to be vaccinated ( for a disease like measles , the rate is about 95 % ) . The most vulnerable members of a population are those with the most vested interest in their surrounding community getting vaccinated : those too young to be immunized or who have medical reasons to avoid vaccination .\nBut while it \u2019 s common to stereotype \u201c anti-vaxxers \u201d as selfish , science-illiterate , or believing in debunked studies like the one connecting vaccines with autism , many are , in fact , thoughtful , educated , or may have real reasons for their lack of trust . The portion of people truly unwilling to vaccinate , at all costs , is very small , say experts \u2013 perhaps 2 % of the population . A much larger portion of the population \u2013 40 % to 70 % , depending on the study \u2013 exhibits some degree of \u201c vaccine hesitancy , \u201d even though most fully comply with vaccine laws .\n\u201c There \u2019 s huge diversity in motivations , \u201d says Mark Navin , an applied ethics professor at Oakland University in Rochester , Michigan , who has extensively studied vaccine resistance . Several of the biggest outbreaks this year occurred in Orthodox Jewish communities . That \u2019 s not surprising , he notes , given that these are insular communities with fairly frequent travel to Israel , one of the countries currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak . But just as telling , he adds , is the strained history that some of these communities have had with public health departments .\nWhile there is every reason to trust government officials on vaccine safety , Professor Navin emphasizes , some of the underpinnings of broader distrust are legitimate : the opioid epidemic driven by big pharmaceutical companies ; profit motives in that industry ; poor information about things like water safety ; or even unethical programs that targeted some disadvantaged communities .\n\u201c The history of public health is full of abuses , \u201d says Professor Navin . \u201c Given this history , and given this context of reasonable distrust , it \u2019 s helpful to begin by realizing there \u2019 s a positive responsibility on the part of physicians and public health and government to build this trust . \u201d\nInstead of asking why people don \u2019 t vaccinate , he adds , it can be helpful to ask why so many people do . In general , the research shows that it \u2019 s because they trust their doctors , have no reason to worry , and have no history of bad treatment around vaccination .\n\u201c Public health is not about convincing stupid people what they \u2019 re supposed to do , but about developing relationships and trust , and that takes resources and sustained efforts , \u201d says Professor Navin .\nWhen the outbreak in Southeast Michigan occurred recently , he adds , health officials had an existing relationship with the rabbis , and within a period of a week got 2,000 members of the community to show up for MMR ( measles , mumps , and rubella ) shots .\n\u201c Public health workers will tell you the most important thing in an outbreak is having good relations with the community , \u201d says Professor Hausman of Penn State .\nWhile it \u2019 s getting increased attention now , the issue with vaccine hesitancy is hardly new .\n\u201c There has been vaccine resistance as long as there has been compulsory vaccination , \u201d says Elena Conis , the author of \u201c Vaccine Nation \u201d and a journalism professor at the University of California , Berkeley . And many of the reasons for the resistance have remained consistent , she says : concerns about risks , concerns about incursions on personal liberty , and religious objections . ( For example , some Christian Scientists choose not to vaccinate for religious reasons . )\nWhat \u2019 s somewhat new in the latest incarnation , Professor Conis says , is the degree to which some social movements have given people a vocabulary for voicing objections and the number of vaccines that are now compulsory .\n\u201c We \u2019 re asking more of our citizens with respect to vaccinations than we ever have before , \u201d she says .\nPeter Borten , a doctor of Chinese medicine and acupuncture in Boulder , Colorado , notes that the aggressive vaccine schedule is one of the concerns he hears from patients who are hesitant to vaccinate . Many tell him that they don \u2019 t trust the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to clearly report vaccine risks . They may know someone who has had a legitimate complication from a vaccine or may have concerns about Big Pharma and \u201c don \u2019 t trust that these companies care more about humans than profits , \u201d he says .\nHe also acknowledges that the health risks from the diseases we vaccinate against , while low for most people , are higher for some vulnerable populations , like babies and pregnant women \u2013 another complicating factor .\nDr. Borten and his wife have vaccinated their kids on a schedule that he feels minimizes the risk , but he says he still holds his breath when it \u2019 s time for his children to get another shot .\n\u201c The more I learn \u2013 and I actively try to stay well informed about it \u2013 the less opinionated I am , \u201d writes Dr. Borten in an email . \u201c In the end , the actual rate of vaccine complications is extremely low , and so is the risk of getting and being permanently injured by any of the diseases we have these vaccines against . This is important for people on both sides of the issue to remember . \u201d\nInternationally , where vaccine hesitancy is a major reason for some outbreaks of disease , there \u2019 s a concerted effort to start addressing the problem , as well as calls for self-reflection on the part of the medical establishment .\n\u201c An anti-vaxxer in California , USA , for example , is vastly different from someone potentially exposed to Ebola in rural DR Congo . Yet there are similarities in their mistrust .
