    "content": "After spending more than five years and billions of dollars trying to re-create the U.S. shale boom overseas , some of the world \u2019 s biggest oil companies are starting to give up amid a world-wide collapse in crude prices .\nChevron Corp. CVX -0.02 % , Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM -0.78 % and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have packed up nearly all of their hydraulic fracturing wildcatting in Europe , Russia and China . The reasons vary from sanctions in Russia , a ban in France , a moratorium in Germany and poor results in Poland to crude prices below what it can cost to produce a barrel of shale oil .\nChevron halted its last European fracking operations in February when it pulled out of Romania . Shell said it is cutting world-wide shale spending by 30 % in places including Turkey , Ukraine and Argentina . Exxon has pulled out of Poland and Hungary , and its German fracking operations are on hold .\nThe result : Outside the U.S. , where fracking has produced a historic glut of oil , only China , Argentina and Canada have commercial shale production , the U.S. Energy Information Administration says , though America holds less than 10 % of the world \u2019 s estimated shale reserves . Europe , including Russia , and China alone have nearly triple the reserves of the U.S. , according to the EIA .\n\u201c The pace of development outside North America is slower everywhere than people thought it would be , \u201d Simon Henry , Shell \u2019 s chief financial officer , said in a recent interview .\nA recovery in oil prices could change the equation , giving big companies more room to take risky bets on shale . And bright spots for shale prospectors outside North America still exist .\nRegions of Argentina and Algeria appear to be \u201c as good as the U.S. , \u201d says Faouzi Aloulou , an EIA project manager who analyzes shale prospects . Two French companies and a British firm are planning to drill in the U.K. , where there is a debate over the practice \u2019 s health and environmental effects . In Poland , small companies\u2014the kind that pioneered the U.S. shale boom\u2014are still drilling despite their big rivals \u2019 discouraging results .\n\u201c The publicity is bad , but the reality is it \u2019 s going to be down to the smaller companies to prove the play , as they did in the U.S. , \u201d says Ois\u00edn Fanning , the executive chairman of San Leon Energy PLC , a U.K.-listed explorer that announced a commercial gas discovery in Poland in February and expects its first sales in early 2016 .\nFracking works by using water , sand and chemicals to fracture underground rock and hold the cracks open , allowing oil and gas trapped in the rocks to flow . Unlike the long-term projects that the world \u2019 s biggest oil companies specialize in , shale wells tend to have short lives , and developing a shale field requires drilling many holes over a short period .\nThe technology worked well for small producers in North America , but oil giants like Exxon and Shell , with their thick layers of management and slow drilling-approval processes , largely missed out on the profits there .\nKnowing other countries had shale , the big companies last decade looked elsewhere to see if they could build a boom from scratch .
