In a convention carefully crafted to introduce Mitt Romney to America we saw an immediate contrast in style when Governor Christie took the stage declaring \u201c look at me I \u2019 m a New Jersey Republican \u201d . That kind of bravado is pure east coast and I \u2019 m not sure we all got the reference out here in the middle part of the country . Yeah , we all get that you \u2019 re from a \u201c blue state \u201d , but if it \u2019 s rare is it necessarily about you ?\nNow that he had my attention though , I listened as Governor Christie took his shot at convincing America that he was tough , the product of a tough mother from a tough State . If you \u2019 re tough you speak the truth . The themes or the speech were now laid out -- toughness and truth . Now if you \u2019 re a tough guy you should have a good \u201c scowl on \u201d -- check . Your should also talk in intimidating tones to show you can back it up -- check . And , you should be clear and unwavering that the truth you represent is the only truth -- check .\nAs an elected official I also know that you can \u2019 t more a city , state or country forward without compromise and bi-partisan leadership . Governor Christie knows that as well and cited accomplishments in New Jersey that were made in that way . He knows that one of his challenges of governing in a \u201c blue state \u201d is to work with leaders of the opposite party . So I was pleased to hear Governor Christie let his tough guard down during the speech and admit to conciliatory politics and shared accomplishments . We need more of that from both parties .\nA powerful speaker , Governor Christie can move people with his oratory style to embrace his themes and point of view , but his attitude and demeanor in this speech was too aggressive and overbearing . Ann Romney told us the most important thing she wanted to convey tonight was love -- love of country , love of family and her individual love of her husband . Chris Christie followed with the statement that as a nation \u201c I believe we have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved. \u201d No room for love in a tough guys world .\nThe truth about this speech in my opinion is that Governor Christie means well and is an effective executive for his state . His message to the country though about being tough and telling the truth misses the point that our problems are complex and the truth about them is more nuanced . They deserve our resolve to work together within the framework of our constitution and the government it outlined to find solutions through compromise and commitment . We can \u2019 t bully our way to solving our problems . We need to inspire the greatness of our citizens and challenge our leaders to produce results for our nation .",
