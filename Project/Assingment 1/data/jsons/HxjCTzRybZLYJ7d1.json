When Berry went into labor , Ariel Castro , now charged with kidnapping and rape , grabbed captive Michelle Knight and told her to deliver the baby .\nThe baby was born into a plastic tub or pool to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid .\nWhen the baby was born , it stopped breathing and everyone started screaming , the source said , citing the girl 's account . Castro allegedly said , `` if that baby dies , I 'm going to kill you . ''\n`` What 's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6-year-old , '' the source said .\nThe three women spent their days and nights captive at 2207 Seymour Avenue , a 1,400-square-foot home in one of Cleveland 's oldest neighborhoods . They went outside only twice in that span -- just `` briefly '' at that -- Cleveland public safety director Martin Flask said .\nMore often , the three would be in different rooms , though they interacted occasionally and came to `` rely on each other for survival , '' said a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation .\nOne thing they could count on was that their alleged captor would never let them out .\nCastro would often test Berry , Knight and Georgina `` Gina '' DeJesus , the young women he 'd allegedly abducted , by pretending to leave , said the law enforcement source . He 'd return suddenly : If there were indications any of the women had moved , they 'd be disciplined .\nYears went by . In that time , the women saw their parents on television at vigils held for them , according to the law enforcement source . They got emotional , knowing their loved ones were looking for them .\nAnd in time , Knight and DeJesus `` succumbed '' to `` their reality , '' the law enforcement source said .\nBut `` something must have clicked '' for Berry on Monday evening , said Cleveland 's deputy police chief Ed Tomba . She staged a daring escape , and with the help of Castro 's neighbors Charles Ramsey and Angel Cordero , freed herself , her 6-year-old daughter , Knight and DeJesus .\nJUST WATCHED See kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro Replay More Videos ...

Hearing her cries , Ramsey and Cordero kicked in a door to help her escape .\nAccording to Cordero , Berry 's 6-year-old daughter ran out of the house too , wearing only a diaper and a sullied shirt . Police are conducting a DNA test to determine the child 's paternity .\n`` Help me , I am Amanda Berry , '' Berry begged a 911 operator from Ramsey 's house . `` I 've been kidnapped , and I 've been missing for 10 years . And I 'm here , I 'm free now . ''\nCleveland police Chief Michael McGrath told NBC 's `` Today '' show that the women were bound and that there were `` chains and ropes in the home .
