    "content": "The Supreme Court on Monday struck down much of Arizona 's controversial immigration law , but it upheld for now a key provision that requires police officers to check the immigration status of those they suspect may be in the country illegally .\nThe provision on mandatory checks during routine stops will now kick back to a lower court for review and still could still be subject to challenge . The rest of the ruling , though , definitively strikes down three other provisions in the Arizona law .\nThose provisions had made it a crime for immigrants to seek employment without work permits and to not carry their immigration papers , and they had allowed police to arrest anyone they suspect committed a deportable offense . Without the latter provision , the requirement to conduct routine immigration checks has little enforcement power behind it .\nThe court was unanimous in allowing the immigration checks to go forward , but divided on the rest . The decision now throws into question how other states that had followed Arizona 's lead on immigration enforcement will proceed . In Washington , the Obama administration signaled a tough road ahead for those states by suspending a key enforcement program that allowed local officials to partner with federal agents in carrying out immigration law .\nThe court 's decision Monday prompted a range of reactions from officials in Washington and Arizona .\n`` This is a bit of a mixed bag , '' Rep. Jeff Flake , R-Ariz. , told Fox News .\nSome Democrats expressed concern about the remaining provision , while others declared outright victory . Sen. Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , called the ruling `` as strong a repudiation of the Arizona law as one could expect . ''\nOn the GOP side , a few lawmakers described the decision as disappointing , while keeping pressure on the Obama administration to fix the country 's immigration system .
