    "content": "With traditional pomp and ceremony , the Catholic Church celebrated the official start of the papacy of Pope Francis on Tuesday , with a giant open-air mass in St. Peter \u2019 s Square .\nPope Francis , who was elected by a secret conclave of cardinals gathered in the Vatican 's Sistine Chapel last week , was given a rapturous reception when he was driven around St. Peter \u2019 s Square in an open-topped popemobile at the start of the ceremony .\nUnder bright blue skies , Catholic faithful from around the world waved the flags of dozens of nations . The pope was accompanied by dozens of cardinals and archbishops wearing golden vestments that shone in the sunlight , as choirs sang Gregorian chants during the two-hour inauguration ceremony .\nAs tens of thousands of onlookers listened , many praised the dramatic change of style he has brought to the papacy , and waited for any hint of a major change for the Catholic Church in his first homily as pope . The new pope set out his vision for his papacy and the church as a whole by calling for greater compassion for the poor , the dispossessed , and the downtrodden .\n\u201c This was a general message , so he did n't get into specifics about how he might change the Church , '' says Robert Mickens , Vatican correspondent for The Tablet , a Catholic weekly .\n`` This is the big plan \u2013 mercy and compassion will be the keys to his pontificate . I think it 's too early to say whether there will be a change of direction , says Mr. Mickens . \u201c But his homily struck a more inclusive tone compared to Benedict XVI . He can use this as a launch pad to deal with other problems in the church . I suspect a lot of it was autobiographical \u2013 these are things he has learnt during his life about caring for the weak . He 's a Jesuit , a bit of a lone ranger . ''\nIn a strongly worded homily delivered from a stage in front of St. Peter \u2019 s , he urged the world to shun `` the omens of destruction and death . ''\nHe called on Christians \u201c to protect the whole of creation , to protect each person , especially the poorest , to protect ourselves : This is a service that the Bishop of Rome is called to carry out , yet one to which all of us are called . ''\nThe duty of caring for the weak and the poor fell not just on Christians but on all of humanity , he said .\n\u201c The vocation of being a 'protector , ' however , is not just something involving us Christians alone ; It also has a prior dimension which is simply human , involving everyone . It means respecting each of God \u2019 s creatures and respecting the environment in which we live . It means protecting people , showing loving concern for each and every person , especially children , the elderly , those in need , who are often the last we think about . ''\nHe appealed to world leaders to make the protection of the environment a much stronger priority .\n\u201c I would like to ask all those who have positions of responsibility in economic , political , and social life , and all men and women of goodwill : Let us be 'protectors ' of creation , protectors of God \u2019 s plan inscribed in nature , protectors of one another and of the environment . Let us not allow the omens of destruction and death to accompany the advance of this world , '' he said .\nHis message was very much in keeping with his decision , in the moments after his election in the Sistine Chapel last Wednesday , to take his name from St. Francis of Assisi , a symbol of humility and charity and a passionate lover of nature .\nThe mass was watched by some 100,000 people in St. Peter 's Square and attended by dignitaries , heads of state , and royalty from around the world . Vice President Joe Biden represented the US , saying that President Obama would have attended had he not had a prior commitment to go to Israel .\nQueen Elizabeth was represented by a minor royal , the Duke of Gloucester . The most controversial head of state to attend was Robert Mugabe , the president of Zimbabwe , who has been accused of decades of human rights abuses .\nThe ceremony started at the tomb of St. Peter , beneath the main altar of St. Peter \u2019 s Basilica .\nPope Francis was presented with a gold-plated silver ring , known as the Fisherman \u2019 s Ring , which depicts St. Peter holding a pair of keys in one hand and a fishing net in the other \u2013 reflecting Christ \u2019 s description of him as a fisher of men .\nHe also received the pallium , a special band of white wool , which is placed around the shoulders of the pope as a symbol of his universal jurisdiction over the Church .\nIn the few days since he was elected the first pope from outside Europe in nearly 1,300 years , Pope Francis has established an informal , spontaneous style that has delighted many Catholics .\nHe has pressed the flesh with jubilant crowds in Rome on several occasions , addresses the leaders of the Church as \u201c my brother cardinals \u201d rather than \u201c my lord cardinals , \u201d signaling a more informal approach , and ditched the papal limousine in favor of riding in an ordinary mini-bus to and from the Vatican on official visits .\nOn Tuesday , he ordered the Popemobile to stop in the middle of the huge crowd and climbed down to bless a severely disabled man , kissing him on the forehead . He kissed babies who were held up to him and shouted `` Ciao '' to well-wishers .\n`` We have seen that the pope loves a certain element of spontaneity , '' says Federico Lombardi , the Vatican spokesman , speaking to journalists on Monday . `` It may well be that he adds unscripted phrases and observations as he speaks .
