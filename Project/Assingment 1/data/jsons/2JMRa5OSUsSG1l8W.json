    "content": "President Donald Trump threatened to shut down the government during a heated argument with Democratic congressional leaders in the Oval Office on Tuesday in a remarkable display of partisan bickering just 10 days before a partial shutdown is set to take effect .\n\u201c I am proud to shut down the government for border security , \u201d Trump said bluntly . \u201c I will take the mantle . I will be the one to shut it down . I \u2019 m not going to blame you for it . The last time you shut it down , it didn \u2019 t work . I will take the mantle of shutting down . And I \u2019 m going to shut it down for border security . \u201d\nThe remark came during an extraordinary 15-minute on-camera argument that began with Trump insisting that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-NY ) should help him fund a border wall . Trump has asked for $ 5 billion in border-security funding , but Democrats have said $ 1.6 billion is their red line .\nAt first , both leaders sat silently listening to Trump read dubious figures and repeat falsehoods about how much of the wall has already been built . When Pelosi reminded the president that he does not have enough votes in the House to fund it , the president pivoted and began boasting about his party \u2019 s electoral gains in the Senate .\n\u201c When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana , he \u2019 s in real trouble , \u201d Schumer said with a laugh .\nAn exasperated Pelosi repeated to Trump that he does not have enough votes among House Republicans alone to fully fund a border wall , and Trump responded by saying he needs 60 votes in the Senate , where Republicans have just a 51-to-49 majority , to get anything to his desk .\n\u201c The fact is , you do not have the votes in the House , \u201d Pelosi said , to which Trump insisted : \u201c Nancy , I do . \u201d\nSchumer then confronted Trump directly over his exaggerations and mistruths about the border wall .\n\u201c We have a lot of disagreements here . The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built , \u201d a defiant Schumer said . \u201c You have called 20 times to shut down the government . You say , \u2018 I want to shut down the government. \u2019 We don \u2019 t . We want to come to an agreement . \u201d\nAt one point , Trump jabbed at Pelosi , saying , \u201c Nancy \u2019 s in a situation where it \u2019 s not easy for her to talk right now . \u201d\nPelosi fired back immediately , telling the president , \u201c Please don \u2019 t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory . \u201d\nAfter the meeting , Schumer vented about the president \u2019 s tone during the sit-down . \u201c This temper tantrum that he seems to throw will not get him his wall , \u201d he said .\nThe partisan jabbing , which came during a photo opportunity before Trump was set to negotiate with Pelosi and Schumer behind closed doors , represented a preview of what to expect with a divided government next year , when Democrats officially take control of the House of Representatives .\n\u201c Unfortunately , this has spiraled downward when we came at a place to say , how do we meet the needs of the American people , \u201d Pelosi said .\nDuring the tense exchanges , Vice President Mike Pence sat stoically next to Trump and remained silent .\nAfter the meeting , some Republicans began rallying behind the president . Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) , a Trump ally , tweeted , \u201c Great job sticking to your guns on border security , Mr. President !
