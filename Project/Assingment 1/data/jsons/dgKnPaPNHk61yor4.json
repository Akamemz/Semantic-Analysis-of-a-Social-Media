The checks will be directly deposited into accounts or mailed to households in the coming weeks , depending on how people filed their tax returns .\nAmong those receiving a check was Jacqueline Gonzalez , a 32-year-old single mother who was laid off from her job as a bartender and lives with her mother , a teacher , in Miami Lakes , Florida .
