Adam Schiff speaks during a media briefing after a House vote approving rules for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump , October 31 , 2019 . ( Joshua Roberts/Reuters )\nAdam Schiff \u2019 s impeachment inquiry is incoherent . Given the impossibility of a senatorial conviction , the only strategy is to taint the president with the brand of impeachment and weaken him in the 2020 election .\nYet Schiff seems to have no sense that the worm has already turned . Far from tormenting Trump and the Republicans by a long-drawn-out Schiff extravaganza , Trump \u2019 s supporters are beginning to feel that the longer the farce , the better the optics . Polls show that Trump is almost back to where he was in popularity when Schiff unleashed his late-September Ukrainian caper . And the point , after all , was again to drive down Trump \u2019 s popularity and render him politically inert .\nFrom the day Schiff reemerged after his licking his wounds in hibernation , following the Mueller implosion , his efforts have insidiously gone downhill . Once Trump released the transcript of his July 25th call with Ukrainian president Zelensky , the nation learned that the Schiff \u2019 s gold-standard whistleblower was no such thing . Instead , he seems a rank partisan and sloppy leaker whose machinations and background are already boomeranging back on those who put him up to this present circus .\nSchiff never expected that Trump would release a classified transcript of his own presidential call \u2014 Democrats expected secrecy and coverup , much as the deep-state intelligence-agency miscreants acted unethically and illegally on the presumption that Hillary Clinton would be easily elected and their dishonest efforts would be rewarded and kept quiet .\nOne of the strangest developments of the opening inquiry was Schiff \u2019 s own doubling-down admission that he didn \u2019 t know the name of the whistleblower . After previously lying that neither he nor his staff had contact with the whistleblower ( \u201c We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower \u201d ) \u2014 he now ups the ante , apparently assuming that neither his staff nor the whistleblower will testify under oath .\nSchiff \u2019 s astounding assertion that he doesn \u2019 t know the whistleblower \u2019 s name is as hard to believe as Robert Mueller \u2019 s own congressional testimony that he was not familiar with Fusion GPS \u2014 the font of the entire Steele dossier that itself fueled the collusion fantasy that led to Mueller \u2019 s own appointment .\nUnlike the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings , Schiff has no special prosecutor \u2019 s finding of felonious presidential behavior . Instead , he has a veritable exoneration from the failure of the ill-starred special counsel to find either collusion or actionable obstruction of such a non-crime .\nMueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and related matters in the 2016 election . Twenty-two months , over 20 lawyers and investigators and $ 35 million later , Mueller folded his tent without criminal referrals or findings of presidential crimes , and then he more or less embarrassed the entire investigation in an enfeebled , deer-in-the-headlights congressional testimony .\nAt this point , the country would not put up with yet another special prosecutor entrusted to investigate \u201c Ukrainian collusion. \u201d They would know the post-Mueller drill in advance : A Washington \u201c wise man \u201d icon would follow the Mueller script of finding no such crime , while ignoring quite considerable crimes , with the Bidens now playing the role of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s bought-and-paid-for Christopher Steele .\nMost of Schiff \u2019 s witnesses in this inquiry were incoherent in the same critical sense : They never cite knowledge of presidential crimes but feel that Trump is dangerous , given their own disagreements with his supposedly reckless policy . And their chagrin in the end boils down to their empty charges that Trump is appeasing Russia at the expense of the Kurds and Ukraine . Apparently their supposedly superior ancestries , pedigrees , and education should supersede the foreign-policy prerogatives of the president of the United States .\nYet our shocked State Department experts somehow can not explain why they were abjectly silent during the Obama administration when the \u201c reset \u201d proved to be virtual appeasement of Vladimir Putin ; when Obama on a hot mic both offered the Russians a disturbing quid pro quo and then followed through on it ; when Obama declined to send arms to Ukraine ; and when Vice President Joe Biden took over as point man for Ukrainian policy only to leverage U.S. aid in exchange for Ukraine \u2019 s ceasing investigations of corruption that eventually would have targeted his own morally compromised son .\nAnd why would these career experts be outraged by the Trump administration that at last fulfilled their wildest agendas : ending the reset , upping sanctions against Russians , killing hired Russian thugs in Syria , pulling out of the warped missile agreement with Russia , increasing American and NATO defense expenditures , pumping more oil to lower world prices to the detriment of Russia , and arming Ukraine ?\nWhat would have been the reaction in 2012 had an anonymous Bush holdover at the Obama National Security Council gone to the IG \u2014 but only after first consulting secretly with the staff of Devin Nunes \u2014 to claim third-hand knowledge of a confidential Obama phone call to Russia \u2019 s President Medvedev ? The Bush-era whistleblower , a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of John Bolton and Dick Cheney , would then have claimed that he was told by an anonymous NSC leaker that Obama in the call had confirmed his prior hot-mic , quid pro quo promise to drop missile defense in Eastern Europe if Putin would in return give \u201c space \u201d to Obama before the 2012 election \u2014 with \u201c space \u201d perhaps defined as the Russians keeping quiet and making Obama \u2019 s foreign policy seem successful in the run-up to Election Day . Would there have been impeachment proceedings against Obama ? Would Adam Schiff have pleaded to keep the \u201c whistleblower \u2019 s \u201d identity secret ?\nEach day closer to the November 2020 election is one day nearer to allowing the American people to vote on their first-team president . There is no Nixonian or Clintonian argument that without impeachment , a second-term president could not be brought to heel . Schiff has essentially decided to abort the early 2020 campaign and substitute in its place his star-chamber impeachment .\nDay-by-day Schiff \u2019 s ginned-up media hysteria has created a virtual news blackout of the Democratic presidential front-runners . We are well into the 2020 campaign and the public knows almost nothing about these would-be presidents other than that in toto they are a strange bunch . The media-starved peripheral candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker will go the way of the suffocated Beto O \u2019 Rourke until someone or something yanks Schiff offstage .\nEach day that is wasted is another day that the new House majority did not , as it promised , address substantive issues . Since January 2018 , it has not talked of infrastructure , recalibrated trade deals , budgetary compromises , drug prescription pricing , or anything else other than one iteration after another of attacking Trump . Certainly , if they really believed that Trump was an incompetent buffoon , the better strategy would have been to step aside , let him ruin the economy , and then run in 2020 against his incompetence .\nIronically , the longer Trump survives , the more likely he \u2019 ll grow stronger and dominate the news at the expense of the progressive front-runners . To get attention back from Schiff , the front-runners must become even shriller and crazier \u2014 from Bernie Sanders \u2019 s declaring an end to all deportations to Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s dreaming up an unhinged multi-trillion-dollar wealth tax to pay for \u201c Medicare for all. \u201d What will happen when these barnstorming senators are trapped in an impeachment farce in the Senate ?\nSchiff also knows that voters have an upcoming rendezvous with the reports of Michael Horowitz and John Durham .
