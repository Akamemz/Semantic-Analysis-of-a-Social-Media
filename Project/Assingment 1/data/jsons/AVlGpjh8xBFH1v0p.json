    "content": "With a cheery drawl and an expression somewhere between exhausted and dead-eyed , Lindsey Graham spent a Sunday morning in November rattling off the greatest hits of GOP impeachment conspiracy theories before most Americans had finished their second cups of coffee . \u201c When you find out who the whistleblower is , I \u2019 m confident you \u2019 re going to find out it \u2019 s somebody from the Deep State , \u201d the South Carolina senator insisted during Fox News \u2019 10 a.m. block . Graham , a former Trump foe who has become the president \u2019 s chief defender in the Senate , then shifted into attacking Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff , the House Intelligence chair and now lead impeachment manager . \u201c If you think Schiff is looking for the truth , \u201d Graham snarled , \u201c you shouldn \u2019 t be allowed to drive anywhere in America , because that \u2019 s a ridiculous concept . \u201d\nThe appearance capped off what could only be described as a banner week of bullshit from Graham\u2014though from his point of view , the Democrats were the ones spouting nonsense . \u201c I think this is a bunch of BS , \u201d Graham told reporters , saying he wouldn \u2019 t read witness testimonies released by Schiff \u2019 s committee . As for the House \u2019 s \u201c sham \u201d impeachment proceedings , which Graham would soon inherit : \u201c I \u2019 ve written the whole process off . \u201d\nA day later , Jaime Harrison , Graham \u2019 s likely Democratic opponent this fall , entered the tiny , cinder block\u2013walled dining hall at Clinton College , a small , Christian , historically black school in Rock Hill , South Carolina . Wearing gray dress pants and a black V-neck sweater , his head shaved bare , Harrison stood before a row of square laminate bistro tables , where two dozen students , mostly from the school \u2019 s student government , drum line , and cheer team , sat waiting to hear him speak .\nBut when the 44-year-old Harrison did , he made scant mention of his opponent . Instead , as the smell of greasy breakfast hung in the air , Harrison asked the students about their passions and majors , encouraging them to find mentors who could help yoke the two together into a career . Harrison didn \u2019 t say much about national politics , alighting on it for only a few minutes as he connected the dots between voting , policy in Washington , and the student loan burdens many in the room would soon carry .\n\u201c Part of my thing is taking advantage of the opportunity , \u201d Harrison tells me afterward in his baritone Southern lilt . \u201c It \u2019 s not every day [ that students meet ] a younger politician who understands the same trials and tribulations that these kids are going through . \u201d\nAt first blush , Harrison \u2019 s meet-them-where-they-are approach might look like a misstep when running against such a prominent\u2014and lately notorious\u2014DC figure . Over three terms in the Senate , Graham had cultivated a reputation as a staunch conservative who delivered bipartisan agreements on immigration and climate change\u2014part of his identity as self-described \u201c political wingman \u201d to Arizona Sen. John McCain . ( McCain had affectionately referred to his close ally as \u201c Little Jerk . \u201d )\nBut three years into the Trump presidency , Graham , who said during the 2016 election that he wished Republicans had kicked Trump out of the party , has become one of the president \u2019 s main sycophants . The reversal has earned him a particularly brutal impersonation from Saturday Night Live \u2019 s Kate McKinnon , whose sweaty Graham explains in a recent sketch that \u201c even my bodily fluids are trying to distance themselves from me . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s a method to Graham \u2019 s about-face . Surfing political trends is part of it : As the Republican base gravitated toward Trump , Graham followed suit . But maybe it \u2019 s more about Graham \u2019 s desire to remain close to power ; a Republican strategist recently likened him to a \u201c pilot fish \u201d in Rolling Stone\u2014 \u201c a smaller fish that hovers about a larger predator , like a shark , living off of its detritus. \u201d Put more generously : \u201c It \u2019 s better to be at the table than on the table , \u201d says Matt Moore , former chair of the South Carolina Republican Party .\nBut Graham is also contending with a South Carolina that \u2019 s tinging bluer . And Trump \u2019 s presidency has seen a spate of Democratic wins and near-misses in the unlikeliest corners of the South , gains that relied on a formula of increasingly blue cities , party-flipping suburbs , and turnout of black voters . Harrison , a longtime Democratic operative and current Democratic National Committee associate chair , advised Democrat Doug Jones \u2019 successful Senate campaign in Alabama . Now it \u2019 s Harrison \u2019 s turn to put his own strategies to the test .\n\u201c I think [ the Democratic spirit ] is alive and well all across the South . The real question is getting people to believe that it \u2019 s possible here , \u201d Harrison says . \u201c People have a little sliver of hope , and now it \u2019 s important for me to take that sliver and turn it into a roaring flame . \u201d\nSixteen-year-old Patricia Harrison gave birth to Jaime on February 5 , 1976 ; his father was never around much , and fully disappeared when Jaime was 10 . Raised mostly by his grandparents in their mobile home in Orangeburg , South Carolina , a majority-black city about 45 minutes outside of Columbia , Harrison spent part of his childhood on food stamps , and some of it homeless . \u201c My grandparents didn \u2019 t have much , but they raised me right , \u201d Harrison said in his video campaign announcement .\nTelevision delivered Harrison his model for an ideal life : The Cosby Show \u2019 s Huxtable family . He wanted what they had : \u201c A middle class life\u2014a nice house , a beautiful wife who \u2019 s a lawyer who spoke Spanish\u2014that \u2019 s what I wanted. \u201d None of his caretakers had finished high school . But \u201c when [ Denise ] went off to college , I wanted to go to college . \u201d\nThose fictional role models were bolstered by real mentors . There was Ms. Fersner , the guidance counselor who Harrison worked for as a personal assistant and who taught him about the fee waivers that would let him take the SAT for free . There was Ms. Harrold , the AP calculus teacher with whom Harrison , a self-described nerd , chose to spend most of his lunch periods . Harrold also advised the school \u2019 s chapter of the National Honor Society and encouraged Harrison to run for president of the group \u2019 s regional board .\nAt an Honor Society event , Harrison met his future political mentor , James Clyburn , who \u2019 d just been elected to the US House\u2014the first black South Carolinian elected to federal office in almost 100 years . \u201c I told him I wanted to work in his office one day , \u201d Harrison recalls . \u201c He kind of laughed and said , \u2018 Well , you \u2019 ll need to go to college . \u2019 \u201d\nHarrison ended up at Yale , and then as a law student at Georgetown in 2003 , he found his way back to Clyburn . In 2006 , when Clyburn became leader of the House Democratic Caucus , he made Harrison executive director\u2014the caucus \u2019 s youngest ever . And the next year , when Clyburn became the Democrats \u2019 whip , Harrison ran vote counting for the party .\nThe day after Harrison \u2019 s appearance at Clinton College , I drive him from Denmark Technical , another historically black college , to Charleston , while he runs through the personalities he contended with in Congress . \u201c We had Rahm [ Emanuel ] , we had Steny [ Hoyer ] , we had [ Nancy ] Pelosi , \u201d he says , \u201c and we had a large freshman class. \u201d There were the influential subgroups , like the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition , the Congressional Black Caucus , and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus . \u201c Any group could tank a bill , \u201d Harrison says . \u201c One thing I \u2019 m proud of : We never lost a party-line vote on the floor . It may not have been the bill everybody wanted , but it was the best we could do for a very diverse caucus . \u201d\nHarrison says his time whipping votes gave him an \u201c old , pragmatic \u201d way of looking at the political process . \u201c I \u2019 ve never seen a bill that started one way and looks exactly the same coming out , \u201d he says . \u201c It just doesn \u2019 t happen. \u201d He brings the same gimlet eye to the Democratic presidential primary . \u201c In the end , all of these proposals that candidates are talking about\u2014none will look the same way once it goes through the process , \u201d Harrison says . He \u2019 s equally wary of the efforts among progressives to replace incumbent Democrats with more liberal members . \u201c Why spend your resources fighting with someone who agrees with you 97 percent of the time and not use those resources to go after a Peter King in New York or a Jim Jordan in Ohio ? \u201d\nAfter five years in Clyburn \u2019 s office , Harrison left to join the Podesta Group , where his lobbying clients read like a progressive \u201c most wanted \u201d list : Walmart , the biotech giant Amgen , the pro-coal American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , General Dynamics , and Boeing .\nHis tenure there might not earn him accolades from the rising left , and when I mention this , his amiability wanes , and he takes a serious tone . \u201c There \u2019 s nobody who can out-progressive me in terms of understanding the hardships of poverty , \u201d Harrison says . \u201c I \u2019 ve known it , I \u2019 ve seen it , I \u2019 ve touched it , I \u2019 ve tasted it , I \u2019 ve eaten it my entire life . And when I go into communities , poor black folks look at me and say , \u2018 Jaime , I would be so blessed if I can raise my kids and they grow up to do the things you \u2019 ve been able to do. \u2019 \u201d Harrison won \u2019 t disclose how much he earned at the Podesta Group , but he used his salary to pay down $ 160,000 in student loan debt and take care of his mother \u2019 s bills .\n\u201c This purity test\u2014it \u2019 s a fictional , made-up thing , \u201d Harrison says . \u201c We get so caught up in the politicking , and we forget about the reality of life in these communities. \u201d He repeats an example he often gives on the stump : \u201c We talk about a $ 15 minimum wage , and that \u2019 s great . But I had a conversation once with my cousin , and he said to me , \u2018 Jaime , I hear Democrats talking about that , and yeah , I would love to make that . But how can a brother just get a job ? \u2019 \u201d\nHarrison \u2019 s campaign tries to directly address those issues , integrating community service with retail politics under its \u201c Harrison Helps \u201d initiative . The candidate , staff , and volunteers plan to travel around the state hosting events such as resume workshops and seminars for homebuyers . In August , Harrison \u2019 s team assembled 400 backpacks full of school supplies for students in his hometown of Orangeburg . The week before Christmas , volunteers served meals to families at the Ronald McDonald House in Charleston . Harrison \u2019 s grassroots campaign echoes the 1988 presidential primary race run by Jesse Jackson , who has voiced support for Harrison \u2019 s efforts .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nobody who can out-progressive me in terms of understanding the hardships of poverty , \u201d Harrison says .\n\u201c Jaime seems to be the first candidate who has found a way to merge the sort of corporate Democratic Party support and the grassroots support , \u201d says Moore , the former South Carolina Republican Party chair , who counts Harrison as a good friend .\nOn the trail , Harrison generally tries to avoid what he calls a \u201c DC-oriented frame \u201d of Democrat vs. Republican and instead talks about right vs. wrong . \u201c I always say , interests live in your head , your values live in your gut and your heart , \u201d he says .\nAccordingly , you won \u2019 t hear him talk much about Graham . \u201c We can use the fire of the anti-Lindsey [ sentiment ] , but you can only use that to an extent , \u201d Harrison tells me . \u201c I always believe Democrats win when we can be hopeful and aspirational , not just tearing somebody down. \u201d The most mention of Graham I heard was in front of a group of Charleston-area Democrats . They \u2019 re obsessed with Graham \u2019 s antics , Harrison says . ( He \u2019 s right : The mostly white audience erupted into laughter and applause when Harrison mentioned his campaign is selling novelty Lindsey Graham flip-flops . )\nThe campaign \u2019 s focus groups have found that white women in South Carolina are skeptical of Graham because of his \u201c continuous extreme flip-flopping on issues. \u201d They were especially turned off by his tepid defense of McCain after the president \u2019 s postmortem attacks . Harrison \u2019 s campaign announcement video , titled \u201c Character , \u201d contrasted clips of Graham calling Trump a \u201c race-baiting , xenophobic , religious bigot \u201d with Graham later declaring the opposite . \u201c Here \u2019 s a guy who will say anything to stay in office , \u201d Harrison says to the camera , accusing Graham of having \u201c traded his moral compass for petty political gain . \u201d\nIn the summer of 2017 , DNC Chair Tom Perez called Harrison for advice . Harrison , coming off four years as chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party , had lost his bid to lead the national party earlier that year . But Perez had given him a meaty consolation prize\u2014an associate chair position tasked with developing the party \u2019 s Southern strategy .\nHarrison \u2019 s first test would be helping Doug Jones , a former US attorney who had been at the helm of some of Alabama \u2019 s most important civil rights victories , and who was running in a special election to replace Sen. Jeff Sessions . Perez , who overlapped with Jones at the Justice Department , knew he had a good candidate in him , and , thanks to congressional Republicans \u2019 incessant attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act , also had a favorable political landscape . ( This was before the accusations of child molestation against Republican candidate Roy Moore . )\nJones has a contentious relationship with the Alabama Democratic Party and Joe Reed , a powerful black political leader who \u2019 d long been among the party \u2019 s key power brokers . He needed a strategy to turn out black voters ( above and beyond courting Reed ) , who account for more than a quarter of Alabama \u2019 s population but whose votes had been particularly depressed by voter-ID requirements and felon disenfranchisement .\nHarrison and a few DNC staffers went down to Alabama that July and presented Jones with a blueprint he \u2019 d tested during a House special election in South Carolina . \u201c I talked about the divisions within the African American community\u2014and not so much divisions , but the different groupings , the older African Americans , African American women , younger African Americans , and the things that motivate them , \u201d Harrison says .\n\u201c He emphasized how important it was to work alongside local folks who really understood that black voters aren \u2019 t a monolith , \u201d Doug Turner , a senior adviser for Jones \u2019 campaign , recalls . The advice proved crucial : Jones narrowly won , largely due to black voters , whose almost 30 percent turnout rate eclipsed previous Alabama Senate elections . \u201c The votes are here , \u201d Harrison says . \u201c The question is , can we change the mentality ? \u201d\nOther models from across the South also give Harrison confidence . Last November , Democrat Andy Beshear defeated Kentucky Gov . Matt Bevin , who \u2019 d hitched his wagon to Trump in a state the president had won by 30 points . \u201c Tonight \u2019 s big Democratic wins , \u201d Harrison said in a statement after Beshear \u2019 s victory , \u201c prove that a New South is truly rising . \u201d\nBut can Harrison replicate that magic back home ? In 2018 , attorney Joe Cunningham flipped a South Carolina congressional seat blue for the first time in nearly 40 years . A lot went into Cunningham \u2019 s victory\u2014\u00ada climate change platform informed by Charleston \u2019 s near-weekly tidal flooding ; his promise to deny Pelosi the House speakership ; a far-right GOP challenger sidelined by a car accident\u2014but especially recent transplants to Charleston from bluer states . More than 80 percent of the state \u2019 s population growth comes from people moving from out of state , according to Charleston \u2019 s Post and Courier . The population \u2019 s racial makeup has stayed stagnant , but its generational makeup has changed considerably : The senior population in South Carolina is among the fastest-growing in the nation .\n\u201c Can Jaime Harrison do statewide what Joe Cunningham was able to do in the 1st Congressional District ? They both have appeal in suburban areas and the benefit of going up against candidates who have steered hard to the right , \u201d says Gibbs Knotts , who teaches political science at the College of Charleston . \u201c I \u2019 m not one who thinks things are shifting way left , but there is a lot of opportunity with the changing demographics in the state . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s \u201c definitely a reconfiguration and scrambling of the winning coalition , \u201d says Joe Trippi , a longtime Democratic strategist who worked on Jones \u2019 campaign . Fiscally conservative voters , college Republicans , and Republican women are all more willing to give Democratic candidates a second look\u2014especially , Trippi says , a moderate like Harrison : \u201c The more that Lindsey Graham becomes part of the big fight of everyone going to their corners , those women and those younger Republicans are looking for someone to bridge the polarization . That \u2019 s where there \u2019 s an opening for someone like Jaime . \u201d\nDuring the last months of 2019 , Harrison \u2019 s campaign says it raised more than $ 3.5 million , a record quarter for any candidate in South Carolina history . In December , a poll showed Harrison only two points behind Graham . Still , Trump won the state by 14 points , and another state poll shows Trump trouncing any hypothetical Democratic opponent there in 2020 . Harrison may have ended the year with a massive fundraising haul , but his total raised during 2019 is still at least $ 5 million behind Graham \u2019 s . \u201c To characterize this as a long shot would be accurate , \u201d Knotts says .\nHarrison \u2019 s biggest hurdle is a lack of name recognition . His \u201c job is to make sure that he becomes a household name , \u201d says Clay Middleton , a fellow South Carolina DNC member and Clyburn alum , \u201c or at least a name that most people would recognize. \u201d To achieve that , Harrison plans to follow a prescription he got from former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams . \u201c Stacey \u2019 s advice to me was , \u2018 Jaime , you got ta go everywhere . You can \u2019 t give up on anybody , \u2019 \u201d Harrison tells me .\n\u201c You can win in the South , but in order to win , you have to invest , \u201d he adds . \u201c You have such large pockets of African American voters , and the big thing is you have to persuade them that an election is important enough for them to come out and vote . \u201d",

And when I go into communities, poor black folks look at me and say, \u2018Jaime, I would be so blessed if I can raise my kids and they grow up to do the things you\u2019ve been able to do.\u2019\u201d Harrison won\u2019t disclose how much he earned at the Podesta Group, but he used his salary to pay down $160,000 in student loan debt and take care of his mother\u2019s bills.\n\n\u201cThis purity test\u2014it\u2019s a fictional, made-up thing,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cWe get so caught up in the politicking, and we forget about the reality of life in these communities.\u201d He repeats an example he often gives on the stump: \u201cWe talk about a $15 minimum wage, and that\u2019s great. But I had a conversation once with my cousin, and he said to me, \u2018Jaime, I hear Democrats talking about that, and yeah, I would love to make that. But how can a brother just get a job?\u2019\u201d\n\nHarrison\u2019s campaign tries to directly address those issues, integrating community service with retail politics under its \u201cHarrison Helps\u201d initiative. The candidate, staff, and volunteers plan to travel around the state hosting events such as resume workshops and seminars for homebuyers. In August, Harrison\u2019s team assembled 400 backpacks full of school supplies for students in his hometown of Orangeburg. The week before Christmas, volunteers served meals to families at the Ronald McDonald House in Charleston. Harrison\u2019s grassroots campaign echoes the 1988 presidential primary race run by Jesse Jackson, who has voiced support for Harrison\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody who can out-progressive me in terms of understanding the hardships of poverty,\u201d Harrison says.\n\n\u201cJaime seems to be the first candidate who has found a way to merge the sort of corporate Democratic Party support and the grassroots support,\u201d says Moore, the former South Carolina Republican Party chair, who counts Harrison as a good friend.\n\nOn the trail, Harrison generally tries to avoid what he calls a \u201cDC-oriented frame\u201d of Democrat vs. Republican and instead talks about right vs. wrong. \u201cI always say, interests live in your head, your values live in your gut and your heart,\u201d he says.\n\nAccordingly, you won\u2019t hear him talk much about Graham. \u201cWe can use the fire of the anti-Lindsey [sentiment], but you can only use that to an extent,\u201d Harrison tells me. \u201cI always believe Democrats win when we can be hopeful and aspirational, not just tearing somebody down.\u201d The most mention of Graham I heard was in front of a group of Charleston-area Democrats. They\u2019re obsessed with Graham\u2019s antics, Harrison says. (He\u2019s right: The mostly white audience erupted into laughter and applause when Harrison mentioned his campaign is selling novelty Lindsey Graham flip-flops.)\n\nThe campaign\u2019s focus groups have found that white women in South Carolina are skeptical of Graham because of his \u201ccontinuous extreme flip-flopping on issues.\u201d They were especially turned off by his tepid defense of McCain after the president\u2019s postmortem attacks. Harrison\u2019s campaign announcement video, titled \u201cCharacter,\u201d contrasted clips of Graham calling Trump a \u201crace-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d with Graham later declaring the opposite. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy who will say anything to stay in office,\u201d Harrison says to the camera, accusing Graham of having \u201ctraded his moral compass for petty political gain.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2017, DNC Chair Tom Perez called Harrison for advice. Harrison, coming off four years as chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, had lost his bid to lead the national party earlier that year. But Perez had given him a meaty consolation prize\u2014an associate chair position tasked with developing the party\u2019s Southern strategy.\n\nHarrison\u2019s first test would be helping Doug Jones, a former US attorney who had been at the helm of some of Alabama\u2019s most important civil rights victories, and who was running in a special election to replace Sen. Jeff Sessions. Perez, who overlapped with Jones at the Justice Department, knew he had a good candidate in him, and, thanks to congressional Republicans\u2019 incessant attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also had a favorable political landscape. (This was before the accusations of child molestation against Republican candidate Roy Moore.)\n\nJones has a contentious relationship with the Alabama Democratic Party and Joe Reed, a powerful black political leader who\u2019d long been among the party\u2019s key power brokers. He needed a strategy to turn out black voters (above and beyond courting Reed), who account for more than a quarter of Alabama\u2019s population but whose votes had been particularly depressed by voter-ID requirements and felon disenfranchisement.\n\nHarrison and a few DNC staffers went down to Alabama that July and presented Jones with a blueprint he\u2019d tested during a House special election in South Carolina. \u201cI talked about the divisions within the African American community\u2014and not so much divisions, but the different groupings, the older African Americans, African American women, younger African Americans, and the things that motivate them,\u201d Harrison says.\n\n\u201cHe emphasized how important it was to work alongside local folks who really understood that black voters aren\u2019t a monolith,\u201d Doug Turner, a senior adviser for Jones\u2019 campaign, recalls. The advice proved crucial: Jones narrowly won, largely due to black voters, whose almost 30 percent turnout rate eclipsed previous Alabama Senate elections. \u201cThe votes are here,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cThe question is, can we change the mentality?\u201d\n\nOther models from across the South also give Harrison confidence. Last November, Democrat Andy Beshear defeated Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, who\u2019d hitched his wagon to Trump in a state the president had won by 30 points. \u201cTonight\u2019s big Democratic wins,\u201d Harrison said in a statement after Beshear\u2019s victory, \u201cprove that a New South is truly rising.\u201d\n\nBut can Harrison replicate that magic back home? In 2018, attorney Joe Cunningham flipped a South Carolina congressional seat blue for the first time in nearly 40 years. A lot went into Cunningham\u2019s victory\u2014\u00ada climate change platform informed by Charleston\u2019s near-weekly tidal flooding; his promise to deny Pelosi the House speakership; a far-right GOP challenger sidelined by a car accident\u2014but especially recent transplants to Charleston from bluer states. More than 80 percent of the state\u2019s population growth comes from people moving from out of state, according to Charleston\u2019s Post and Courier. The population\u2019s racial makeup has stayed stagnant, but its generational makeup has changed considerably: The senior population in South Carolina is among the fastest-growing in the nation.\n\n\u201cCan Jaime Harrison do statewide what Joe Cunningham was able to do in the 1st Congressional District? They both have appeal in suburban areas and the benefit of going up against candidates who have steered hard to the right,\u201d says Gibbs Knotts, who teaches political science at the College of Charleston. \u201cI\u2019m not one who thinks things are shifting way left, but there is a lot of opportunity with the changing demographics in the state.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s \u201cdefinitely a reconfiguration and scrambling of the winning coalition,\u201d says Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist who worked on Jones\u2019 campaign. Fiscally conservative voters, college Republicans, and Republican women are all more willing to give Democratic candidates a second look\u2014especially, Trippi says, a moderate like Harrison: \u201cThe more that Lindsey Graham becomes part of the big fight of everyone going to their corners, those women and those younger Republicans are looking for someone to bridge the polarization. That\u2019s where there\u2019s an opening for someone like Jaime.\u201d\n\nDuring the last months of 2019, Harrison\u2019s campaign says it raised more than $3.5 million, a record quarter for any candidate in South Carolina history. In December, a poll showed Harrison only two points behind Graham. Still, Trump won the state by 14 points, and another state poll shows Trump trouncing any hypothetical Democratic opponent there in 2020. Harrison may have ended the year with a massive fundraising haul, but his total raised during 2019 is still at least $5 million behind Graham\u2019s. \u201cTo characterize this as a long shot would be accurate,\u201d Knotts says.\n\nHarrison\u2019s biggest hurdle is a lack of name recognition. His \u201cjob is to make sure that he becomes a household name,\u201d says Clay Middleton, a fellow South Carolina DNC member and Clyburn alum, \u201cor at least a name that most people would recognize.\u201d To achieve that, Harrison plans to follow a prescription he got from former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. \u201cStacey\u2019s advice to me was, \u2018Jaime, you gotta go everywhere. You can\u2019t give up on anybody,\u2019\u201d Harrison tells me.\n\n\u201cYou can win in the South, but in order to win, you have to invest,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou have such large pockets of African American voters, and the big thing is you have to persuade them that an election is important enough for them to come out and vote.\u201d",
