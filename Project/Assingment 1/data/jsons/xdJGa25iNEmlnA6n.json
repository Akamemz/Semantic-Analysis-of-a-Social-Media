An \u2588\u2588\u2588 journalist said at least two government buildings were hit by the mortars in Sanliurfa province 's border town of Akcakale and at least two people were wounded . ( Ismail Coskun/HA via AP )\nAKCAKALE , Turkey ( AP ) \u2014 Turkey pressed its air and ground assault against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria on Thursday for a second day , pounding the region with airstrikes and an artillery bombardment that raised columns of black smoke in a border town and sent panicked civilians scrambling to get out .\nAmid the fierce fighting , residents fled with their belongings loaded into cars , pickup trucks and motorcycle rickshaws , while others escaped on foot . The U.N. refugee agency said tens of thousands were on the move , and aid agencies warned that nearly a half-million people near the border were at risk .\nIt was a wrenchingly familiar scene for many who had fled the militants of the Islamic State group only a few years ago .\nThere were casualties on both sides : Turkish officials in two border provinces said mortar fire from Syria killed at least six civilians , including a 9-month-old boy and three girls under 15 . On the Syrian side , seven civilians and eight Kurdish fighters have been killed since the operation began , according to activists in Syria .\nThe Turkish offensive was launched three days after U.S. President Donald Trump opened the way by pulling American troops from their positions near the border alongside their Kurdish allies .\nAt a time when Trump faces an impeachment inquiry , the move drew swift criticism from Republicans and Democrats in Congress , along with many national defense experts , who say it has endangered not only the Kurds and regional stability but U.S. credibility as well . The Syrian Kurdish militia was the only U.S. ally in the campaign that brought down the Islamic State group in Syria .\nTrump warned Turkey to act with moderation and safeguard civilians . But the opening barrage showed little sign of holding back : The Turkish Defense Military said its jets and artillery had struck 181 targets so far .\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the military intends to move 30 kilometers ( 19 miles ) into northern Syria and that its operation will last until all \u201c terrorists are neutralized . \u201d\nMore than a dozen columns of thick smoke rose in and around the Syrian town of Tel Abyad , one of the offensive \u2019 s first main targets . Turkish officials said the Kurdish militia has fired dozens of mortars into Turkish border towns , including Akcakale .\nAs the shelling intensified , cars packed with civilians crowded a bridge linking Syria and Iraq .\n\u201c When we came , there were about four lanes of cars on the road and a 1-kilometer-long queue of cars , \u201d said Murad Hassan , a Syrian Kurd from Qamishli .\nA Kurdish-led group and Syrian activists said that despite the bombardment , Turkish troops had not made much progress on several fronts . Their claims could not be independently verified .\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 109 \u201c terrorists \u201d were killed , a reference to the Syrian Kurdish fighters . He did not elaborate , and reports from the area did not indicate anything remotely close to such a large number of casualties .\nErdogan also warned the European Union not to call Ankara \u2019 s incursion into Syria an \u201c invasion. \u201d He threatened , as he has in the past , to \u201c open the gates \u201d and let Syrian refugees flood into Europe .\nMeanwhile , the Kurdish forces halted all operations against IS in order to focus on fighting Turkish troops , Kurdish and U.S. officials said . The Syrian Kurdish fighters , along with U.S. troops , have been involved in mopping-up operations against IS fighters in the desert after their territorial hold was toppled earlier this year .\nAnkara says the Kurdish militia is linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers \u2019 Party , or PKK , which has led an insurgency against Turkey for 35 years . The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people . The U.S. and other Western countries also deem the PKK a terrorist group .\nTurkey , a NATO member , considers its operations against the Kurdish militia in Syria a matter of survival , and it also insists it won \u2019 t tolerate the virtual self-rule that the Kurds have carved out in northern Syria along the border .\nThe Turkish assault aims to create a corridor of control along the length of the border \u2014 a so-called \u201c safe zone \u201d \u2014 clearing out the Kurdish fighters . Such a zone would end the Kurds \u2019 autonomy in the area and put much of their population under Turkish control . Ankara wants to settle 2 million Syrian refugees , mainly Arabs , in the zone .\nTurkey began its offensive , dubbed \u201c Operation Peace Spring , \u201d on Wednesday with airstrikes and artillery shelling , followed by ground troops later in the day .\nMustafa Bali , a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces , said their fighters repelled the Turkish ground attacks . \u201c No advance as of now , \u201d he tweeted Thursday .\nBut Maj. Youssef Hammoud , a spokesman for Turkish-backed opposition fighters in the operation , said they captured the village of Yabisa , near Tal Abyad , a spokesman for the fighters said .
