Every president since then has followed that lead .\nInstead of addressing the massive violations of the natural and constitutionally protected right to privacy , instead of acknowledging that but for the personal courage of Edward Snowden his administration would still be pulling the wool over our eyes , instead of reestablishing the serious constitutional and civil liberties bona fides he established for himself as a U.S. senator , the president defended his massive spying as a necessary tool in the fight to maintain national security and offered only a placebo to its critics .\nJust how massive is this scandal ? The Washington Post has reported that the NSA hacks into 500,000 American buddy lists and 600,000 American address books every day , and the Guardian of London reported last week that the NSA seizes 200,000,000 American text messages every day .\nThis is in addition to seizing the content of all cellphone- and landline-generated telephone conversations and copies of all emails sent or received in the United States . And all of that is in addition to seizing all bank records , utility bills and credit card bills of everyone in the United States .\nBy not addressing or refuting any of this , the president obviously plans to continue it .\nHe also plans to reject the most basic principles of American government .

And then in public deny and lie and change the subject .\nIn a thinly disguised effort to change the subject , Obama \u2019 s Friday speech focused on where the seized data is stored , rather than on whether the government in a free society is empowered to collect it .\nHe proposed that the data seized by the NSA be stored at non-government locations that he did not identify and kept there and be made available to the NSA after approval by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court .\nEven if a third party capable and willing to store this data could be found , the additional step to the FISA court is no additional constitutional protection whatsoever .\nEvery federal and state court in the United States follows the constitutional requirement that whenever any government is seeking a search warrant to conduct surveillance , the government must present particularized evidence identifying its target , and the evidence must constitute probable cause of criminal behavior on the part of that target ; every court , that is , except the FISA court . That court issues general warrants that do not name a target and are based on the NSA \u2019 s wishes , rather than evidence of probable cause .\nSo , that silent exhale of relief from the NSA last week was generated by the realization that this third-party storage proposal will not restrict the massive spying one iota .\nAdded to this placebo is the president \u2019 s proposal to employ a Defender of the Constitution ( what a great job title ! ) to appear before the FISA court , along with lawyers for the NSA , and argue against the NSA \u2019 s wishes .
