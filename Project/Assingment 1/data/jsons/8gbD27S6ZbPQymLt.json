    "content": "Front-running GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump does n't yet have a `` lock '' on the nomination , but time is running out for another candidate to defeat him , according to political strategist Karl Rove.In a commentary for The Wall Street Journal , the former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff during the George W. Bush administration argues the GOP nomination \u2014 `` as long as three or more candidates are splitting delegates '' in proportional contests \u2014 may stay `` uncertain '' until March 15.But he could also seal the deal then `` if a fragmented opposition gives him an absolute majority of delegates on that day , '' Rove writes.The delegate numbers will be crucial , Rove writes . `` Even a weak Trump plurality on March 15 would give him Florida 's 99 delegates and Ohio 's 66 delegates , '' he writes . `` Additionally , if a majority of Republicans oppose Mr. Trump that day , but are divided among several candidates , he could also take the lion 's share of Illinois 's 69 and Missouri 's 52 delegates . `` There 's `` still time for the non-Trump GOP majority to coalesce around a single candidate , '' Rove writes . `` But not much . `` `` Things can remain somewhat divided on March 1 as long as the majority is largely unified on March 8 and fully behind a single candidate on the Ides of March . If not , the hopes of the party 's non-Trump majority will suffer the same fate as Caesar . `` Rove calls Trump 's latest win in November `` very impressive , '' noting `` after four contests , only 133 of the convention 's 2,472 delegates have been selected , '' and the caucus victory in Nevada `` does not necessarily a consolidation make. '' '' Mr . Trump is supported by better than three of every 10 Republicans , but some 65 percent are n't in his camp , '' he writes . `` The 963 delegates \u2014 39 percent of the convention 's total \u2014 to be selected in 24 contests between March 1 and March 12 will all be awarded proportionally . This means he could win the headlines but capture a minority of the delegates \u2014 unless he unites the GOP . ''",
