    "content": "Last night in an interview with Fox News ' Greta Van Susteren , Texas Senator Ted Cruz slammed President Obama 's handling of ISIS and the beheadings of two American journalists as `` unserious . '' He also slammed Obama for operating on a `` photo-op '' foreign policy agenda not tied to protecting `` vital national security interests to the United States '' and said ISIS has declared war on the U.S .\n`` Unfortunately from the beginning of this we have seen President Obama being fundamentally unserious about this [ ISIS ] . He dismissed ISIS at the outset as the Junior Varsity , that turned out to be very wrong then last week he told us 'we have no strategy ' to the surprise of nobody , '' Cruz said . `` At this point we have seen ISIS declare war on the United States . They are crucifying Christians . They are beheading children . They have beheaded two American journalists and they have done so on the world stage pledging an intent to take jihad to America . ''\nPresident Obama is set to address the nation Wednesday night about what his administration is planning to do to combat ISIS . Cruz said in the same interview Obama must come to Congress to obtain approval for new military action , which would require him to lay out a coherent plan and strategy moving forward .\n`` The value of Obama coming to Congress is it forces the President to articulate clear military objective , '' Cruz said . `` If we do n't act now we will see another horrific act of terror on the homeland . ''\nCruz has introduced legislation that would ban Americans fighting with ISIS from reentering the United States .\n`` There are over 100 Americans right now who have gone and are fighting along side ISIS , '' Cruz said . `` The legislation I introduced today in the Senate amends existing law to provide that taking up arms and fighting along side ISIS constitutes a renunciation of United States citizenship so that we ca n't have people who have joined the terrorists using U.S. passports to come back to commit acts of here at home . It is my hope that we will see bipartisan cooperation passing this legislation . ''",
