''\nWhen asked about this censorship by Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) on April 10 , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified that his company \u201c and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley , which is an extremely left-leaning place , \u201d and added that he did not know whether content from liberal groups , such as Planned Parenthood and MoveOn.org , had ever been restricted on Facebook .\nThese multi-billion dollar online media companies , which reach more than 1.8 billion people worldwide , have declared war on the conservative movement , states the MRC report , and `` conservatives are losing -- badly . '' If `` the right does n't fight , '' states the report , `` it is doomed -- online and off . This is more than just a free speech battle . It is a struggle for the future of our nation and our world . ''\nIn the detailed , 50-page report , CENSORED ! How Online Media Companies Are Suppressing Conservative Speech , authors Ashley Rae Goldenberg and Dan Gainor examine how Facebook , Twitter , YouTube , and Google suppress conservative content online , provide numerous examples of the suppression ( and censorship ) , and then provide recommendations for the tech companies .\nTwitter `` leads in censorship , '' according to the report . It `` regularly suppresses conservative points-of-view . ''\nThe $ 21.60 billion company manages about 6,000 tweets every second from people all over the world , and it is the go-to site for journalists . Twitter 's CEO is Jack Dorsey . He is extremely left-wing politically and he recently promoted an article from Medium to his 4.2 million Twitter followers that said America is in a `` new civil war , '' liberal vs. conservative , and there is no compromise , only one side must win .\nThe CENSORED ! report documents how Twitter staffers admitted on hidden camera that they censor conservatives through `` shadow banning . '' With this technique , Twitter users `` think their content is getting seen widely , but it 's not , '' reads the report . `` The site also restricts pro-life ads from Live Action and even Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( R-Tenn. ) , but allows Planned Parenthood advertisements . ''\nTwitter hid some conservative-related hashtags during the 2016 election , such as # PodestaEmails and # DNCLeak , said the MRC . Twitter has also marked some tweets from the Drudge Report as `` sensitive . ''\nTwitter uses a `` Trust and Safety Council '' to provide policy input to the company .

''\nThe SPLC frequently targets conservative and Christian individuals or groups because they oppose , for instance , gay marriage or radical Islam .
