The groups are blaming the attack on government forces , she said .\n`` The reports have not been independently confirmed , '' Jean added , and President Bashar Assad 's regime says the claims are `` baseless . ''\nReuters began Wednesday leading its report this way : `` Syrian activists accused President Bashar al-Assad 's forces of launching a nerve gas attack that killed at least 213 people on Wednesday , in what would , if confirmed , be by far the worst reported use of poison gas in the two-year-old civil war . '' Shortly after 9 a.m .
