The purpose , aides tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 , is less about turning the clock back to August 1963 than to November 2012 .\nObama likely will tie King \u2019 s goals with Obama \u2019 s first-term achievements ( health care reform , infrastructure investment , the Lilly Ledbetter pay equity act ) with his second-term agenda ( hiking taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers , passing immigration reform , cutting the cost of college , funding some kind of infrastructure and jobs bill ) .\nKing \u2019 s speech and the march on Washington , Obama recently told The New York Times , \u201c is part of my generation \u2019 s formative memory \u2026 [ A ] fter the Trayvon Martin case , a lot of people have been thinking about race , but I always remind people \u2014 and , in fact , I have a copy of the original program in my office , framed \u2014 that that was a march for jobs and justice ; that there was a massive economic component to that .\n\u201c When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights , it wasn \u2019 t just folks who believed in racial equality ; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot , \u201d he said .\nObama has always been focused on broad economic equality as the best way to deal with lingering racial injustice .
