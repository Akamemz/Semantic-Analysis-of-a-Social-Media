Republicans have tried to patch together a policy to address these concerns , but the result is still a bill with weaker protections for people with preexisting medical conditions than those provided by Obamacare .\nThe MacArthur Amendment , the latest change to the health bill , would change the rules for these people in a few ways :\nStates could apply for a waiver to opt out of Obamacare 's rule that prohibits health insurers from charging sick people more than healthy people . So insurance for people with preexisting conditions might technically still be on the market , but premiums could be so high that many of those people could n't afford it . That 's the big problem for many moderates ( and therefore House leaders ) .\nRyan 's release says states would have to argue the change would , for example , lower premiums in order to get the waiver approved . The bill itself , though , makes approval effectively automatic unless the federal government stops it .\nStates would also be required to set up a high-risk pool , where sick people could buy coverage , in exchange for a waiver . But the historic problem for high-risk pools has been that they did n't have enough money to cover sick people , and Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation told me the AHCA has the same problem . The money included in the bill is also less than what conservatives have projected is necessary for high-risk pools to work .\nthat they did n't have enough money to cover sick people , and Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation told me the AHCA has the same problem .
