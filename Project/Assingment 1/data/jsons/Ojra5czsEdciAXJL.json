The new administration \u2019 s halo had already dulled some by that point , of course . Less than 24 hours after his swearing in , Trump had sent Spicer out to attack the media for its depiction of the inaugural crowd size\u2014a critique so blatantly false that it forced Kellyanne Conway to invent an entirely new vocabulary of deceit to defend him , dubbing Spicer 's words \u201c alternative facts. \u201d His frothing , rage-filled performance inspired an S.N.L . sketch worthy of a place in comedic history .\nBy Monday , Spicer had settled into a more defensive crouch . His suit was better this time around , too , thanks to a sartorial note from his boss . Once talk of the crowd size died down , Spicer was asked about Trump \u2019 s then- national security adviser Mike Flynn \u2019 s contact with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak . \u201c There \u2019 s been one call . I talked to General Flynn about this again last night . One call. \u201d That one call dealt with four subjects , he said : a plane crash , Christmas , a conference about ISIS , and setting up a call between Trump and Vladimir Putin .\nThere was a follow-up question regarding whether there had been any other conversations between Flynn and Russian officials . \u201c Not that I \u2019 m aware of . And when I say that , what I \u2019 m saying is during the transition , I asked General Flynn that\u2014whether or not there were any other conversations beyond the ambassador , and he said no , \u201d Spicer said .\nThree weeks later , it became clear that assertion was false . The Washington Post reported that Flynn had not only allegedly talked about U.S.-imposed sanctions about Russia , but that he had misled the White House regarding the nature of their conversation .
