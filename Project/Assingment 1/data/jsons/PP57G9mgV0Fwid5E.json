President Donald Trump is inventing specific pieces of legislation .\nTrump \u2019 s now rallying supporters by warning them that if Democrats take back the Senate , they \u2019 ll pass a bill written by Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-CA ) called the \u201c Open Borders Bill . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s what Trump told a rally audience in Topeka , Kansas , on Saturday :\nToday \u2019 s Democrats have embraced radical socialism and open borders . If you don \u2019 t have borders , you don \u2019 t have a country , folks , you don \u2019 t have a country . Every single Democrat in the US Senate has signed up for the Open Borders \u2014 and it \u2019 s a bill ! It \u2019 s called the Open Borders Bill ! What \u2019 s going on ? And it \u2019 s written by \u2014 guess who \u2014 Dianne Feinstein .\nHere is the part of Trump \u2019 s riff about Democrats that is correct : There is , in fact , a bill that Feinstein has written that every Democrat in the Senate has signed on to .\nIt is , of course , not called the Open Borders Bill , because it \u2019 s not actually about opening the borders at all . It \u2019 s called the Keep Families Together Act ; it was written in June , during the height of the family separation crisis at the US-Mexico border , to stop the administration \u2019 s \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy of criminally prosecuting parents who crossed into the US illegally and sending their children into the care of the Department of Health and Human Services .\nFeinstein \u2019 s bill \u2014 probably by mistake \u2014 would have prevented parents from being arrested for serious crimes by the FBI , not just from getting separated at the border . But the good-faith critiques of the bill snowballed into an assertion on the right that Democrats were going to open the borders \u2014 and , furthermore , that that was the point .\nHow the Keep Families Together Act became the Open Borders Bill\nOn June 7 , Feinstein introduced the Keep Families Together Act . Within days , it had been co-sponsored by every Democrat in the US Senate . The bill went nowhere \u2014 Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) made no effort to move it through the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 and it existed mostly as a foil for Republican proposals to end family separation by allowing the government to keep families in immigration detention indefinitely .\nThe point of Feinstein \u2019 s bill was to end \u201c zero tolerance \u201d by prohibiting agents from separating parents from children , except in cases of abuse or endangerment .\nAs written , though , it didn \u2019 t apply just to Border Patrol officers \u2019 apprehension of families or to the prosecution of parents for misdemeanor immigration violations . Under the bill , no agent of the Department of Homeland Security , the Department of Health and Human Services , or the Department of Justice would be able to separate a parent from children anywhere within 100 miles of a US border .\nIn other words , as Gabriel Malor pointed out in an article for the Federalist , \u201c The proposed law would apply with equal force to , say , FBI agents ( part of DOJ ) , Secret Service agents ( part of DHS ) , and Centers for Disease Control officers ( part of HHS ) in the exercise of their everyday duties . \u201d\nThat includes arresting people for serious crimes , since adults can \u2019 t be taken into criminal custody with their children . ( This was the whole reason \u201c zero tolerance \u201d led to family separation to begin with ) . And the 100-mile zone legally defined as the \u201c border \u201d encompasses nearly two-thirds of the US population .\nIt \u2019 s impossible to recognize an accurate critique \u2014 that Democrats had ( probably accidentally ) written a bill that would protect parents from federal arrest in much of the US \u2014 in Trump \u2019 s attacks on the \u201c Open Borders Bill. \u201d But there was a seed of truth inside a snowballing exaggeration about what the bill would do , and what Democrats \u2019 intention was in drafting it . Here \u2019 s a timeline of that evolution :\nJune 18 : Sen. Susan Collins ( R-ME ) , asked about Feinstein \u2019 s bill on \u201c Face the Nation , \u201d says that while she appreciates Feinstein \u2019 s compassion , \u201c Her legislation is not the answer . It is far too broad . It would essentially prevent arrest within 100 miles of the border , even if the person has committed a serious crime or is suspected of terrorist activity. \u201d Collins \u2019 s brief answer didn \u2019 t specify that it only applied to parents or that it prevented arrest only where arrest required family separation \u2014 in other words , that it didn \u2019 t stop immigration agents from apprehending families and detaining them briefly together .\nSen.
