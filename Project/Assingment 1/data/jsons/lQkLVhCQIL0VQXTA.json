He ended the quarter with almost $ 15.7 million in the bank.Trump 's campaign committee received more than $ 30 million in the first three months of 2019 , leaving him with a massive $ 40 million in funding more than a year and a half before Election Day.Incumbency is a potent fundraising tool for presidents , and Trump started to take in money for his reelection campaign earlier than his White House predecessors.But the first-quarter haul nevertheless signals Trump has the support of his base . Almost 99 percent of donations received were for $ 200 or less , his campaign said on Monday.Harris came in second place among Democrats in dollars raised , bringing in a solid $ 12 million.She also had a relatively low burn rate , spending about 36 percent of what she took in.Harris finished March with nearly $ 9 million in the bank , suggesting her fundraising ability will be enough to keep her campaign afloat well into the 2020 primary season , which begins in February.O \u2019 Rourke jumped into the presidential race late in the first quarter , giving his campaign little more than two weeks to wow political observers with a large fundraising tally . Ultimately , he pulled it off , posting a $ 9.4 million sum in just 18 days.What \u2019 s more , O \u2019 Rourke burned through only 27 percent of the cash he took in , putting him on par with Sanders and leaving his campaign with roughly $ 6.8 million in the bank.Warren has positioned herself as a leader among Democrats in campaign finance purity , swearing off not just corporate political action committee money but all PAC money , as well as high-dollar fundraisers.She raised about $ 6 million in the first quarter , despite her sweeping national profile and the fact that she had the full three months of the first quarter to fundraise , as opposed to others who jumped into the race mid-quarter.But more ominous than her fundraising total is her campaign \u2019 s spending . Of the roughly $ 6 million she brought in , she spent $ 5.2 million . That \u2019 s a burn rate of more than 80 percent \u2014 among the highest of any candidate in the race.Gillibrand brought in just under $ 3 million , the smallest first-quarter haul of any sitting senator in the 2020 presidential race.In a memo obtained by The New York Times this week , Gillibrand \u2019 s campaign suggested that one reason for the senator \u2019 s low fundraising total may be due to backlash over her calls in 2017 for former Sen. ( D-Minn. ) to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct.But there are other warning signs for Gillibrand : Her campaign burned through roughly 80 percent of the contributions it took in , giving her one of the highest spending rates of any 2020 hopeful.The former congressman from Maryland has been open about the fact that he intends to self-fund much of his 2020 presidential bid . His first-quarter fundraising report made that plan even clearer.Delaney , who announced his presidential bid in July 2017 , loaned his campaign $ 11.7 million in the first three months of 2019 . But he received less than $ 435,000 in outside contributions , the smallest amount of any candidate in the race.While Delaney \u2019 s vast personal wealth means he is unlikely to run out of campaign cash any time soon , the small total from donors is likely to be interpreted as a sign that Delaney isn \u2019 t gaining any momentum .",
