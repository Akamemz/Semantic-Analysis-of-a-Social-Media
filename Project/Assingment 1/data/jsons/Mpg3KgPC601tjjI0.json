    "content": "Thailand 's powerful army declared martial law Tuesday and deployed troops into the heart of Bangkok in a dramatic move it said was aimed at stabilizing the Southeast Asian country after six months of turbulent political unrest . The military insisted a coup d'etat was not underway .\nThe surprise , pre-dawn operation , which places the army in charge of public security nationwide , came amid deepening uncertainty over the nation 's fate and one day after the caretaker prime minister refused to step down in the face of long-running anti-government protests .\nAlthough soldiers entered multiple television stations to broadcast the army message , life in the vast skyscraper-strewn metropolis of 10 million people remained largely unaffected , with schools , businesses and tourist sites open and traffic flowing as usual .\nIn front of one of the country 's most luxurious shopping malls , bystanders gawked at soldiers in jeeps mounted with machine guns who briefly diverted traffic . The mood was n't tense ; passers-by stopped to take cell phone pictures of the soldiers .\nThailand , an economic hub for Southeast Asia , has been gripped by off-and-on political turmoil since 2006 , when former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was toppled by a military coup after being accused of corruption , abuse of power and disrespect for King Bhumibol Adulyadej . His overthrow triggered a power struggle that in broad terms pits Thaksin 's supporters among a rural majority against a conservative establishment in Bangkok .\nThe army , seen by many as sympathetic to anti-government protesters , has staged 11 coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 . But it made no moves Tuesday to dissolve the country 's constitution or its current , caretaker government .\nActing Prime Minister Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan -- who was not consulted beforehand on the army move -- called an emergency Cabinet meeting at an undisclosed location . In a brief statement , Niwattumrong said only that the government hopes the military action will `` bring peace back to the people of every group and every side . ''\nEducation Minister Chaturon Chaisang , however , said in a post on his Facebook page that martial law was not an answer and warned it could `` eventually spiral into a situation in which the military has no choice but to stage a coup . ''\nThailand 's problems are `` fundamentally political problems that must be solved through political processes under democracy ... not military or security measures , '' Chaturon said .\nThe military statement was issued Tuesday by army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-Ocha , who cited a 1914 law that gives the authority to intervene during crises . He said the military took action to avert street clashes between political rivals .\n`` The Royal Thai Army intends to bring back peace and order to the beloved country of every Thai as soon as possible , '' he said . We `` intend to see the situation resolved quickly . ''\nPrayuth met Tuesday afternoon with senior officials from government agencies , provincial governors and representatives from the country 's independent agencies -- but not the Cabinet .\nThe latest round of unrest started last November , when demonstrators took to the streets to try to oust then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra , Thaksin 's sister . She dissolved the lower house of parliament in December in a bid to ease the crisis , and later led a weakened , caretaker government .\nEarlier this month , the Constitutional Court ousted Yingluck and nine Cabinet ministers for abuse of power .

It raised the toll since November to 28 dead and drew a strong televised rebuke from the army chief .\n`` This week looked ominous , '' said Thitinan Pongsudhirak , director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Bangkok 's Chulalongkorn University . `` There was a strong likelihood of violence and turmoil . ''\n`` Martial law is intended to impose peace and order , but the key will be the army treatment of the two sides , '' Thitinan said . `` If the army is seen as favoring one side over the other , then we could see the situation spiral and deteriorate . If the army is seen as even-handed ... we could actually see the situation improving . ''\nThroughout the morning , the army issued multiple edicts .
