    "content": "Libyan officials were deeply concerned in 2011 , as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was trying to remove Moammar Gadhafi from power , that weapons were being funneled to NATO-backed rebels with ties to al Qaeda , fearing that well-armed insurgents could create a safe haven for terrorists , according to secret intelligence reports obtained by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe reports included a 16-page list of weapons that Libyans supposedly tracked to the rebels from Western sources or their allies in the region .

The latest documents and audio recordings are likely to give her Republican critics on Capitol Hill fresh ammunition to question whether she had an adequate plan and whether her efforts led to the tragedy in Benghazi a year later and the general lawlessness and chaos that have gripped Libya since .\nThe Times reported last week that U.S. intelligence did not support the story that Mrs. Clinton used to sell the war in Libya , mainly that there was an imminent danger of a genocide to be carried out by the Gadhafi regime . The intelligence community , in fact , had come to the opposite conclusion : that Gadhafi would not risk world outrage by killing civilians en masse even as he tried to crush the rebellion in his country .\nThe Times also reported that the Pentagon and a key Democrat so distrusted Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s decision-making on Libya that they opened their own secret diplomatic conversations with the Gadhafi regime , going around the State Department .\nIn one conversation recorded in summer 2011 between Libyan officials and an intelligence asset dispatched by the Pentagon as a back-door channel , the asset told Mr. Ismael , who served then as Gadhafi \u2019 s chief of staff , that U.S. officials were considering taking some of the Libyan dictator \u2019 s frozen money assets and sending it to the rebels .\n\u201c I \u2019 m in contact with some of the people over in Benghazi and they \u2019 ve told me point blank that their first use of this money is , is to buy military training , weapons and mercenaries , \u201d the Pentagon intelligence asset told Mr. Ismael on July 24 , 2011 .\nIn a separate conversation with Dennis J. Kucinich , an Ohio Democrat serving in the House , Gadhafi \u2019 s eldest son , Seif , told the congressman that Libyan intelligence had observed Qatar , a major U.S. ally in the region , facilitating weapons shipments . Qatar has steadfastly and repeatedly denied arming the rebels .\n\u201c The Qataris have spent more than $ 100 million on this , and they have an agreement with the rebels that the moment you rule Libya you pay us back , \u201d Seif Gadhafi told Mr. Kucinich in a conversation recorded in May 2011 .\n\u201c So , it \u2019 s your position that your government has been trying to defend itself against an insurrection brought about by jihadists who were joined by gangsters , terrorists and that there \u2019 s basically about 1,000 people who were joined by NATO ? \u201d Mr. Kucinich asked .\n\u201c You \u2019 re saying that this relates to internal matters , matters internal to the region relating of a power struggle in which they then turned their attention to Libya to try to engulf Libya in their own desire for increasing their power ? \u201d Mr. Kucinich asked .\n\u201c For the Qataris , they are doing this with every country , with every country , \u201d Mr. Gadhafi said . \u201c This is their plan , I mean in public .
