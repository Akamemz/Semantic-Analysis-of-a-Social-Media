Gone is the big crowd of 20 cheerful hopefuls who gathered on a glittering stage in Miami over two nights for the very first Democratic debate seven months ago , strutting their stuff and shaking hands before a mesmerized media .\nThe debate would be \u201c the largest gathering of liberals since Woodstock , \u201d predicted Ross Baker , a distinguished political science professor at Rutgers University \u2014 and he was right .\nBut time marches on , competition is keen . This time around , there \u2019 s a slim cast of just six hopefuls at the CNN-hosted event : Sens . Bernard Sanders , Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar ; former Vice President Joseph R.
