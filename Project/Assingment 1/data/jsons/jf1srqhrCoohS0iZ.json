    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : I \u2019 m Amy Goodman , with Nermeen Shaikh . We \u2019 re speaking with Glenn Greenwald for the hour .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : The White House remains in crisis mode following revelations that Donald Trump \u2019 s own son openly embraced an apparent effort by the Russian government to peddle information incriminating Hillary Clinton in an attempt to help Trump win the presidency . Emails show Trump Jr. was told Russia wanted to share incriminating information about Clinton as , quote , \u201c part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump. \u201d Trump Jr. replied , quote , \u201c if it \u2019 s what you say I love it especially later in the summer , \u201d end-quote . A week after receiving the email last June , Trump Jr. , along with Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort , met with someone described to them as a , quote , \u201c Russian government attorney. \u201d The meeting remained secret until Kushner mentioned it on a revised security clearance form .\nAMY GOODMAN : In a new interview with Reuters , President Trump defended his oldest son . He said , quote , \u201c I think many people would have held that meeting. \u201d When asked if he knew about the meeting , Trump told Reuters , \u201c No . That I didn \u2019 t know , until a couple of days ago , when I heard about this . \u201d\nStill with us , Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald , co-founder of The Intercept . Well , Glenn , as you look at this , as an American , but from your vantage point in Rio de Janeiro , your response to this latest development and the whole issue of Russiagate ?\nGLENN GREENWALD : So here \u2019 s what I don \u2019 t understand about this . Certainly , it \u2019 s an interesting email . I \u2019 m glad that it surfaced . It does lend some credence to the possibility that the Trump administration colluded with the Russians criminally , meaning with their hacking of the DNC and Podesta emails , if in fact the Russians did that as the intelligence agencies claim , although they \u2019 ve produced no evidence for it . It is possible that the Trump administration or Trump officials colluded with the Russians to commit that crime . It \u2019 s possible they didn \u2019 t . We still haven \u2019 t seen any evidence that they have . Remember , this is not evidence suggesting that Trump officials actually colluded with the Russians to commit a crime\u2014the hacking .\nNow , what the Democrats are saying is that the Trump administration and their defenders in the media at Fox News and the like are , quote-unquote , \u201c moving the goalposts \u201d by saying , \u201c Well , this only shows that Trump Jr. was willing to get information from the Russian government about Clinton , but it doesn \u2019 t show there was actual criminal collusion. \u201d To me , it seems as though the people who are moving the goalposts are the Democrats . The claim all along , the reason why there \u2019 s talk of impeachment , the reason why there is a special prosecutor , the reason why people want to see Trump and his associates criminally prosecuted , is because of the claim that they committed crimes by colluding with the Russians with regard to the hacking . That \u2019 s what Harry Reid has always said . That \u2019 s what John Podesta has always said . That has always been the Democratic claim . This newest evidence doesn \u2019 t in any way suggest that . What it suggests instead is that Donald Trump Jr. was told that the Russian government had incriminating evidence about Hillary Clinton and wanted to give it to him . And he said , \u201c Well , I \u2019 d love to get it . I \u2019 d love to have it. \u201d Now , I guess there \u2019 s some sense that it \u2019 s wrong for a political campaign to take dirt on your adversary from a foreign government . I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s illegal at all to do that , but there \u2019 s a claim that it \u2019 s somehow sort of immoral .\nAnd here \u2019 s what I don \u2019 t understand . The Steele dossier that everybody got excited about , that claimed that the Russians had incriminating videos of Trump in a Moscow hotel and other dirt on Trump , that came from somebody who was getting first paid by Republicans and then by Democrats , going to Moscow and getting dirt about Donald Trump from Kremlin-affiliated agents in Moscow . In other words , he went to Russia , talked to people affiliated with the Russian government and said , \u201c Give me dirt about Donald Trump , \u201d and then , presumably , got it and put it in the memo . Similarly , there \u2019 s an amazing Politico article from January of this year that describes how allies of the Clinton campaign , including somebody being paid by the DNC , met with officials of the Ukrainian government , which was desperate to help Hillary Clinton win and Donald Trump lose , and get information incriminating about Trump from Ukrainian officials . In other words , Ukraine was meddling in our election by giving Democrats incriminating information about Trump .\nNow , I , personally , although it \u2019 s dirty , think all of these events are sort of the way politics works . Of course if you \u2019 re in an important campaign and someone offers you incriminating information about your opponent , you \u2019 re going to want it no matter where it comes from , whether it \u2019 s Ukrainian officials , whether it \u2019 s anti-Trump people in Moscow or whether it \u2019 s pro-Trump people in Moscow . So , I want to hear the standard that we \u2019 re supposed to use to assess Trump Jr. 's actions . Is it that it 's wrong in all cases to get incriminating information about your opponent from a foreign government ? In which case , why is it OK for the Democrats to do it with Ukrainian officials or for their investigator to go to Moscow and get dirt on Trump ? Or is it some other standard that distinguishes what Trump Jr. did in this case versus what Democrats did with the Steele dossier and with Ukraine ? And I just don \u2019 t see this distinction . And so , for me , at least\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN : Some lawyers are saying it has to do with\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN : \u2014breaking campaign finance laws or campaign laws that have to do with getting something of value , not necessarily financial , from a foreign entity , a state or nonstate actor .\nGLENN GREENWALD : Right . And there \u2019 s , I think , a lot more lawyers and a lot more campaign finance lawyers who have said that just getting information about a candidate would not constitute something of value . But let \u2019 s assume that that \u2019 s true . Let \u2019 s take that theory as though it \u2019 s true . Why doesn \u2019 t it also apply then to the person working for Democrats who went to Moscow and got something of value , namely information about Trump , from Kremlin-connected people in Moscow , or Democrats , including someone working for the DNC , who got something of value from Ukrainian officials ? Why isn \u2019 t that the same thing ?\nAMY GOODMAN : Well , let me go to what independent journalist Marcy Wheeler of EmptyWheel.net said about the significance of this week \u2019 s news . I talked to her yesterday .\nMARCY WHEELER : The email adds a bunch of remarkable new details to what we know , most importantly , that the Trump campaign knew that Russia was trying to get Donald Trump elected probably before even the intelligence community . We had known that the CIA had gotten a tip from a foreign partner sometime in June that even today NSA still doesn \u2019 t think was that great a piece of intelligence . But , meanwhile , we learned that on\u2014you know , in early June , Don Jr. was getting this email saying , \u201c There is an effort on the part of Russia to get your father elected . And as part of that , we \u2019 re going to sent this lawyer to you with dirt on Hillary Clinton. \u201d And Don Jr. , having read that email , said , \u201c Great ! Bring it on ! Give me that information . \u201d\nAMY GOODMAN : So , that \u2019 s Marcy Wheeler . And , Glenn , she wrote , just as you \u2019 re describing , the same thing over the weekend , said , \u201c How does this differ , for example , a Democrat going to get information from the British spy Christopher Steele , who then got information from people in Russia ? \u201d But she said it all changed with seeing the actual emails .\nGLENN GREENWALD : Yeah , I mean , I agree with Marcy to a large extent , but not fully , because , you know , I think that\u2014first of all , you know , yesterday , Democrats attacked Bernie Sanders , because Bernie Sanders , when asked about the Donald Trump Jr. email , came out and said , \u201c There are obviously significant questions raised by this , but we shouldn \u2019 t rush to judgment . We should wait to see all the evidence. \u201d And part of my discomfort with this whole thing all along\u2014and as a lawyer , I know this really well\u2014is that when you get bits and pieces of information leaked through the media without the full context of what \u2019 s taking place , it \u2019 s very difficult to assess what it actually is . There \u2019 s an independent prosecutor , Robert Mueller , who everyone regards as independent and trustworthy , who has subpoena power , who is investigating this .\nSo , to me , what this email says is it \u2019 s from a British promoter who \u2019 s trying to lure Donald Trump Jr. into a meeting with someone who is his friend , saying , \u201c The Russians want your father to win , and they \u2019 re willing to give you information to help. \u201d I think it \u2019 s clear the Russian government wanted Donald Trump to win . I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s particularly surprising . Nor do I find it surprising that Donald Trump Jr. , when told that the Russian government wants to give him information that can help his father shed a bad light on Hillary Clinton , he was willing to do that . Why do we consider that surprising , let alone criminal ? Again , I do think it bolsters the Democrats \u2019 view that the Russians\u2014the theory that Russians wanted Trump to win and that the Trump campaign was willing to take help from the Russians . But that \u2019 s still\u2014there \u2019 s still a lot more steps that need to be completed before we get to any kind of evidence of an actual crime being committed . And that \u2019 s why I don \u2019 t think that this revelation , interesting though it may be , is as significant or a smoking gun when it comes to the impeachment or the prosecution case .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well , Glenn , even though the Trump campaign has always denied collusion with the Russians in the 2016 presidential election , in his interview with Reuters yesterday , Trump suggested that there had been interference in last year \u2019 s election , saying , quote , \u201c Something happened , and we have to find out what it is , because we can \u2019 t allow a thing like that to happen in our election process . So something happened , and we have to find out what it is. \u201d So , could you respond to that , Glenn , and tell us what you think it is that he \u2019 s alluding to ?\nGLENN GREENWALD : Well , I think there are two separate issues there that we shouldn \u2019 t conflate . One is the question of whether the Russians were behind the hacks . And when I say the Russians , I mean , was it just some group of Russians , Russian hackers or Russians acting in some rogue way , or was it actually\u2014were they actually Kremlin officials ordered by Putin ? We don \u2019 t know the answers to any of those questions , even though the intelligence agencies have said that it was Putin who ordered it . So that \u2019 s one question that I think , in that quote , Trump is talking about , which is , we have to get to the bottom of who actually hacked the DNC and John Podesta \u2019 s emails , and make the evidence public so that the public can see that these assertions that the intelligence community have been making actually have evidence behind them .\nThen there \u2019 s a second question , which is independent , which is : If it \u2019 s true that the Russian government hacked John Podesta and the DNC \u2019 s emails and distributed what they got to WikiLeaks , did the Trump campaign participate in that crime , either by working with the Russians before the hack or working with them after the hack on how to get the information distributed in a way that would most hurt the Democrats ? That , to me , is the core question that has been at the center of this controversy from the beginning . And we still don \u2019 t have evidence that the Trump administration participated in that part of the crime . Hopefully , we will learn , one way or the other , in a sober , rational , comprehensive way , not through bits and pieces being leaked by agenda-driven anonymous sources , but by an investigation laying forth the case in a way that we can all see the evidence .\nAMY GOODMAN : Glenn , we \u2019 re going to continue this discussion after break . Coming up , we \u2019 ll look at how The Intercept \u2019 s parent company , First Look Media , is helping support the legal defense for the alleged NSA whistleblower Reality Winner . Stay with us .",
