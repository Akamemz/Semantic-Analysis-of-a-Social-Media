    "content": "FBI Director James Comey testified Thursday that Hillary Clinton \u2019 s claims -- some made under oath -- about her use of a private email server were \u201c not true , \u201d fueling Republican questions about whether in doing so she committed a felony .\nIn a wide-ranging appearance before the House oversight committee , Comey also said Clinton \u2019 s email practices put America \u2019 s secrets at risk and her actions constituted the \u201c definition of carelessness . \u201d\nAt the same time , Comey staunchly defended the bureau \u2019 s decision not to pursue charges . He also said , \u201c We have no basis to conclude that [ Clinton ] lied to the FBI . \u201d\nYet he acknowledged that lying under oath is a felony , as some Republicans point to statements she made last October before the House Benghazi committee -- and plan to request an investigation . At that hearing , Clinton had claimed that nothing she sent or received was marked classified .\nComey was asked about such claims , which she also made publicly , in a pointed exchange with Rep. Trey Gowdy , R-S.C .\n\u201c That \u2019 s not true . \u2026 There was classified material emailed , \u201d Comey said .\nOn her claim that she used one device , Comey also said , \u201c She used multiple devices . \u201d\nAnd on her claim that she turned over all work-related emails , he said , \u201c No , we found work-related emails , thousands that were not returned . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s apparent that she lied to the American people , \u201d Rep. Mark Meadows , R-N.C. , later said of Clinton .\nDemocrats on the committee tried to make the case for Clinton that she may not have noticed or understood the classified markings in a few emails that bore them , bolstering any claim of plausible deniability . Comey indeed said there is a question over whether Clinton was \u201c sophisticated enough \u201d to know at the time what a particular classified marking signified .\nFox News was first to report on a 2012 email that carried a classified code known as a \u201c portion marking \u201d when it was sent to Clinton \u2019 s account .\nWhile the hearing was underway , Clinton herself was hunkered down at her Washington home \u2013 as her campaign responded regularly to hearing highlights . The campaign flagged that Comey acknowledged during the hearing that the portion markings themselves were not properly marked .\nBut Gowdy and House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz , R-Utah , whose committee hosted the tense hearing with Comey just two days after the investigation decision , both suggested a \u201c double standard \u201d was at play in the FBI decision .\n\u201c It seems to a lot of us that the average Joe \u2026 if they had done what you laid out in your statement , that they \u2019 d be in handcuffs , \u201d Chaffetz said . \u201c And I think there is a legitimate concern that there is a double-standard -- if your name isn \u2019 t Clinton or you \u2019 re not part of the powerful elite , that lady justice will act differently . \u201d\nChaffetz voiced concern that there \u201c does seem to be no consequence . \u201d\nYet Comey repeated his claim that \u201c no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case. \u201d He said while Clinton showed \u201c great carelessness , \u201d he did not see evidence she and those with whom she corresponded \u201c knew when they did it they were doing something that was against the law . \u201d\nHe said no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case based only on what is known as \u201c gross negligence. \u201d At the same time , he suggested that if Clinton had worked at the FBI , she could be subject to a range of disciplinary measures including suspension or termination .\nComey also denied a double standard was at play , saying no one at the DOJ would have brought such a case against \u201c John Doe or Hillary Clinton \u201d based on the facts .\nDemocratic committee members slammed the hearing and described the criticism of Comey as political .\n\u201c Amazingly , some Republicans who were praising you just days ago \u2026 instantly turned against you , \u201d Rep.
