    "content": "New Delhi , India - `` Why is everyone asking why so many women are out on the streets in protest ? Women have always been protesting all their lives . Did you just wake up ? '' asks 20-year-old Salma Khan , a postgraduate student at Jamia Millia Islamia University in the Indian capital . It is about 2pm on December 16 , and Salma is holding a heavy box with water bottles and pamphlets for protesters at a demonstration on the university campus .\nAs protests continue against India 's contentious anti-secular Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) that excludes Muslims and the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) , some of the key images galvanising demonstrators are that of young women on the front lines - dancing and singing defiantly , holding witty posters , protecting fellow male protesters from police brutality , handing out roses to the police and gathering in public places in large numbers across the country .\nProtesters like Salma , as with many other women students in India , contend not only with getting their voices heard , but also family opposition to their studies .\n`` My parents would have rather spent money on my wedding than on my higher education , '' says Salma who comes from Agra . Four years ago , she finally convinced her parents to allow her to sit the university admission test .\nRecently , they saw her in a protest picture . `` 'You did exactly what we were scared of . What about our honour now ? ' they told me , '' she says .\nAlthough the number of women in higher education in India has risen in the past few years to comprise 47.6 percent of the students currently enrolled , the societal expectation is for women to remain passive bystanders when it comes to political protest .\nSwati Sinha , 24 , a student from Lucknow who has attended every protest march in New Delhi since December 12 , the day after the citizenship law was passed , says : `` My parents want me to get married soon . First , this country needs to stay worth having a family . It is now or never . ''\nThe determination and defiance of young women like Salma and Swati have become more visible in recent years . The 2012 anti-rape movement in India galvanised mass support and stirred the consciousness of many teenage students at that time . Since then , women 's participation at demonstrations has grown with the help of women-led movements .\nSince India 's anti-rape movement grew , more women have started participating in public demonstrations . File : December 7 , 2019 [ Reuters ]\nMany women cite the Pinjra Tod ( Break the Cage ) campaign as what introduced them to organised protests . This Indian women 's collective of university students and alumni advocates for less regressive regulations at hostels and other college accommodation for female students . It counters the security narrative that these places use to restrict women from being in public spaces . Many Indian colleges impose arbitrary curfew timings as early as 5.30pm for women residents citing security reasons .\nThe campaign , which saw women take to the streets at night to protest , spread quickly across women 's colleges in India . Thousands of students protested against the time restrictions and demanded that `` safety '' and `` security '' should not be used to silence women 's right to mobility and freedom among others . Campaigns were successfully led at Jamia Millia Islamia University , Delhi University , Aligarh Muslim University , Punjab University , Banaras Hindu University , and many more .\n`` A lot of media is calling students 'first-time protesters ' . Were they blind to us protesting against curfew timings , sexual violence , # MeToo cases ? Do they only notice protests driven by men ? Women students are actually well trained in mobilising through practice , '' says Salma , who participated in a 2015 project denouncing rape culture by posting sanitary pads with protest messages around Jamia University .\nThe protest may have been led by men in many parts but how did they spread so quickly across the country ? Because women students have been quietly working round the clock from their homes in an organised manner . Swati , student\nA number of women are maintaining the hidden infrastructure of the continuing CAA protests across university campuses .\nApart from running errands like organising snacks , warm clothes , and mics for protesters and making posters , women students are compiling contact details of doctors , lawyers and police stations for emergency help .\n`` The protest may have been led by men in many parts but how did they spread so quickly across the country ? Because women students have been quietly working round the clock from their homes in an organised manner to circulate messages regarding protest venues and subsequent police action , '' says Swati .\nWhen a number of students were beaten up by the police on December 15 at Jamia University , students at the on-campus hostel for girls from the state of Jammu and Kashmir provided first aid to some 150 female and male students . In August this year , the disputed region was split into two union territories by the Indian government . The internet blackout and the communication blockade continue in Kashmir , now for more than 140 days . It is the longest ever internet shutdown imposed by a democracy .\nBushra Khanum , 21 , a second-year postgraduate student who lives at the hostel , says : `` We have grown up with police and army brutality all our lives . We know how to treat teat gas itches , skin burns and baton injuries . ''\nNajima Begum , a 24-year-old doctoral student at Jamia University who comes from Imphal , in the country 's northeast , joined the protests partly because of her own struggle to pursue an education .\nWhen she was 18 , her parents locked her inside her room for more than a week because she wanted to go to New Delhi . `` I refused to eat anything all those days , '' she says . Her parents were opposed to sending her 2,500 kilometres ( 1,553 miles ) away for her education .\n`` Mine is a conservative family . Most women are born to get married . They could see no reason to send me away only if they had to find me a groom eventually , '' she says .\nShe stuck to her demand . Ten days later , her parents gave in .\nNajima grew up in Manipur , a state which like Kashmir is under the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act that allows security forces to arrest people , search any premises , and fire upon anyone with complete legal impunity . Human rights violations including killings , disappearances and sexual violence by security forces have been reported in the state .\nWomen display placards during a protest in Kolkata on December 22 , 2019 [ Reuters ]\nBecause New Delhi was her escape from the violence she witnessed while growing up , Najima says she avoided `` political things '' at university .
