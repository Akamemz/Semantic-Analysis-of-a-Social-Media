    "content": "Last week , India 's ruling Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) faced a massive rebuff in the local legislative election in Delhi . The Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) , a relatively new and small political party , swept the polls , winning 62 seats and leaving only eight for the BJP in the 70-member Delhi assembly .\nDelhi does not have the status of a full state and the election for its assembly used to be rather low-key until 2015 when the BJP made it a high-pitched affair . That year , Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself led its campaign but , despite deploying his huge party machinery , he faced a humiliating defeat at the hands of the then-novice AAP , securing only 3 seats .\nThis year , the BJP 's campaign in Delhi was led by Amit Shah , India 's home minister considered to be Modi 's right-hand man and close confidant , but he too was unable to lead the party to victory .\nWhile some opposition-minded commentators welcomed the BJP 's defeat in Delhi as a crack in its monopoly of power , what happened in this election can not be celebrated .\nThe BJP 's electoral defeat is not really a sign of its political weakness or the decline of its political project . To the contrary , the Delhi election demonstrated that , in fact , the ruling party has been successful in pushing its political opponents to the right and forcing them to play by its rules . It is also continuing to shape the Indian electorate , carving out of it a Hindu constituency that fully embraces its Hindu nationalist agenda .\nAs in previous election campaigns , in Delhi , the BJP 's leadership focused its efforts on inciting anti-Muslim sentiment to rally the Hindu vote .

Not only did its leaders keep a physical distance from the sites of the protests , where its electorate was expressing its apprehensions about the policies and intentions of the ruling Hindu majoritarian party , they even refrained from making statements about it . They argued that the elections were about the state of Delhi and should be fought on issues of public amenities like water , electricity , health and education .\nThen when BJP functionaries accused the AAP of sponsoring demonstrations , the AAP 's leader , Arvind Kejriwal , felt compelled to respond . He accused the BJP of trying to make the vote about the protest and claimed that if he had power over the police force , he would have cleared `` the Shaheen Bagh area in two hours '' .\nPolitical commentators applauded the AAP for its smart move in not taking the ideological bait thrown by the BJP by sidestepping the contentious issue .

In fact, the party tried to turn the election into an anti-Muslim vote, using recent Muslim protests to scare its constituency.\n\nIn late January, Shah exhorted constituents to \"press the button [of the electronic voting machine] \u2026with such anger that the current reaches Shaheen Bagh\".\n\nShaheen Bagh is a Muslim-dominated neighbourhood of Delhi that has witnessed persistent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).\n\nThe CAA gives ethnic and religious groups, excluding Muslims, from the neighbouring countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh the right to apply for Indian citizenship and is considered by many as anti-Muslim.\n\nTaking advantage of the Muslim face of the anti-CAA protests, the BJP tried to create a Muslim scare in the minds of Hindus, claiming that the Shaheen Bagh protests were a threat to the integrity of India and that the protesters were traitors and agents of Pakistan.\n\nThe AAP maintained a studied silence about the protests throughout the campaign.
