According to Iranian media , the country 's Foreign Ministry is now claiming that the White House put out an invalid fact sheet about the agreement .\nA ministry spokeswoman called it a `` one-sided interpretation of the agreed text , '' and said parts of it `` contradict '' the actual plan , according to Fars News Agency .\nThe Foreign Ministry did not specify what language might have clashed with their interpretation of the agreement , but called the White House statement a `` modified version of the deal '' -- and released their own version of the plan .\nThat document , among other distinctions , recognizes Iran 's `` right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , '' something the White House statement does not mention .\nThat appears to be one lingering sticking point between the two countries . Immediately after the deal was announced , Iranian officials were claiming that the agreement both recognized their right to enrich uranium and took military force off the table .\nSpeaking on CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' on Sunday , Secretary of State John Kerry disputed both claims , calling them `` not accurate . ''\nA White House official said Wednesday that the United States does not recognize a `` right to enrich , '' but President Obama does think the Iranian people `` should have access to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes . ''\n`` However , the history of the Iranian nuclear program has raised serious and legitimate concerns in the international community as to whether Iran 's enrichment program -- which it pursued in secret -- is truly for peaceful purposes , '' the official said .\nThe official said the short-term deal will provide a window to see if Iran can pursue a restricted and monitored civilian nuclear program , but : `` The first step requires agreement on all aspects of the comprehensive solution . Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed . ''\nFurther , it remains unclear when the clock starts ticking on the deal . The arrangement is supposed to last for six months , giving the U.S. , Iran and five other world powers time to try and reach a longer-term accord .\nBut State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki , when asked Tuesday when that time period begins , could not say .\n`` That 's a good question , '' Psaki said .
