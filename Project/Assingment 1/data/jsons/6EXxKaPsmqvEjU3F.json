Circuit Court of Appeals , the liberal panel that covers the country \u2019 s West Coast and that has tested a number of legal theories on immigration law .\nIn this case , the 9th Circuit had ruled that under the law , if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement immediately arrested someone released from a federal , state or local prison , they could be held without bond in the immigration detention system . But if ICE didn \u2019 t immediately arrest them , the migrants must be given a chance to make bond .\nThe case turned on a phrase in the law that says the no-bail determination applies to someone picked up by ICE \u201c when the alien is released \u201d from prison or jail . The lower court ruled \u201c when \u201d must mean the day of release .\nBut Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. , writing the majority opinion , said that could create a new loophole for sanctuary cities , which often refuse to alert ICE officers when releasing people from their local prisons and jails .\n\u201c Under these circumstances , it is hard to believe that Congress made the secretary \u2019 s mandatory-detention authority vanish at the stroke of midnight after an alien \u2019 s release , \u201d he wrote .\nHe said it made more sense that \u201c when \u201d means at some point after the release , not at the exact moment of it .\nWhile many immigrants living in the U.S. illegally are released while they await their court proceedings and possible deportation , Congress has deemed some serious criminals to be such safety risks that they must be held by ICE while their cases proceed .\nThe American Civil Liberties Union , which had represented the migrants challenging their detention , criticized the court \u2019 s decision .\n\u201c For two terms in a row now , the Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes , allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing , simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge , \u201d said Cecillia Wang , the ACLU \u2019 s deputy director .\nThe court \u2019 s four Democratic-appointed justices dissented from Tuesday \u2019 s decision , saying if Congress had intended to require all serious criminal migrants to be denied bail , regardless of when they were arrested , it would have said that .\nThe case was limited to the reading of the law and what Congress intended , and did not broach bigger questions about the constitutionality of no-bail proceedings .
