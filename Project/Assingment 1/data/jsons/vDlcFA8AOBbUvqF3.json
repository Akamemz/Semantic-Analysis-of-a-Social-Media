What will happen here in Minnesota will be dictated by what happens in these early states . \u201d\nA solid performance in the 11 states voting on March 1 could have a catalytic effect on Sanders , fueling his momentum and fundraising after a rough patch . But an across-the-board drubbing next Tuesday \u2014 on the heels of his Nevada loss and an expected loss in South Carolina \u2014 could also bury the Vermont senator and generate a partywide chorus for him to get out of the race .\nEither way , the number \u2014 and the demographic makeup \u2014 of states where Sanders defeats Clinton and the number of delegates he picks up will go a long way toward shaping the post-Super Tuesday narrative .\nLike Clinton , Sanders begins with one lock-down state , according to party officials : Vermont .
