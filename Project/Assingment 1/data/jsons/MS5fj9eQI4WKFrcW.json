Instead , a transcript was never circulated at all , which the source said was highly unusual , particularly after a high-profile conversation .\nThe call \u2014 which the person said contained no especially sensitive national security secrets \u2014 came as the White House was confronting the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi , which US intelligence assessments said came at the hand of the Saudi government .\nWith Putin , access to the transcript of at least one of Trump 's conversations was also tightly restricted , according to a former Trump administration official .\nThe conversations between Trump and Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud and the crown prince , widely known as MBS , were kept very secret , several sources with knowledge of the calls told CNN .\nThere were no transcripts made of the phone conversations between Trump and the Saudi king or crown prince to prevent leaks , both a former White House official and a source familiar with the calls told CNN .
