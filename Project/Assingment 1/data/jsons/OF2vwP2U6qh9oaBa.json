    "content": "( CNN ) Donald Trump 's former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen testified in detail Wednesday about the President 's involvement in hush-money payments to women and his knowledge of longtime confidant Roger Stone 's efforts to contact WikiLeaks , while Trump 's Republican defenders aggressively worked to undermine Cohen 's credibility .\nCohen 's dramatic public testimony before the House Oversight Committee ping-ponged between Democrats who walked Cohen through the actions Trump took and Republicans who challenged Cohen over his financial crimes and past lies to Congress .\nCohen 's public testimony Wednesday was undoubtedly a spectacle , but its ultimate impact will depend upon whether Cohen 's allegations are viewed as credible .\nCohen 's hearing comes while the President has his own big moment : Cohen is testifying about what he says are Trump 's misdeeds while the President is in Vietnam meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .\nCohen also revealed that prosecutors in New York are investigating conversations between Trump and Cohen that occurred after Cohen 's office was searched by the FBI in April 2018 .\nIn his testimony , Cohen explained how Trump instructed him to pay $ 130,000 to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump , which Trump denies . Trump then reimbursed Cohen as President for the payments , Cohen said \u2014 and he provided a copy of the check to show it .\nCohen told the committee that there was `` no doubt in his mind '' that Trump knew he was paying Cohen for `` hush money payments . ''\nFurther , Cohen testified that Trump had called him in February 2018 to discuss messaging surrounding the payment , where Trump directed him to lie about the President 's knowledge of the payment .\nIn his opening statement , Cohen launched a broadside against Trump , accusing him of being `` a racist , '' `` a conman '' and `` a cheat . ''\nCohen also talked about how Trump discussed the Trump Tower Moscow project with him into the 2016 campaign \u2014 the topic that Cohen would ultimately lie to Congress about \u2014 and that Trump had knowledge of Stone 's efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks ahead of the release of hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign .\n`` The last time I appeared before Congress , I came to protect Mr. Trump . Today I am here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump , '' Cohen said .\nRepublicans pressed Cohen repeatedly on the crimes he pleaded guilty to , arguing he had no credibility having previously lied to Congress and that his own financial crimes \u2014 which he pleaded guilty to along with the campaign finance violations \u2014 had nothing to do with Trump .\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan , the top Republican on the Oversight Committee , accused Cohen of turning against Trump after he did not get a job at the White House .\n`` You wanted to work in the White House , you did n't get brought to the dance , '' Jordan said .\n`` I was extremely proud to be the personal attorney for the President of the United States of America . I did not want to go to the White House , '' Cohen responded .\nBut Republicans did n't buy Cohen 's answer , pointing to court filings from the Southern District of New York that stated Cohen `` privately told friends and colleagues , including in seized text messages , that he expected to be given a prominent role and title in the new administration .\nCohen insisted he did n't want a White House role , saying that prosecutors statement was `` not accurate . ''\nCohen , in fact , was angling for the White House chief of staff job , according to a person who talked to him about it , and at one point there was a movement to push him into the White House counsel 's office .\nThe President suggested it to former White House counsel Don McGahn , but he said Cohen did n't have the necessary experience and background to work there , and Trump dropped it after that .\nRep. Mark Meadows , a North Carolina Republican , accused Cohen of lying in the hearing itself , pointing to documents he had filed with the committee on whether he had any foreign contracts . Cohen said he would review the form and amend it if necessary .\nThe White House said ahead of the hearing it was `` laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word . '' Republicans hammered Cohen on the same theme , with one member calling Cohen `` a pathological liar . ''\nAnother Republican asked Cohen what he would call himself if he had called Trump a cheat .\nJordan and Cohen continued to battle throughout the hearing . After one exchange with another Republican , Jordan exclaimed : `` His remorse is nonexistent ! ''\n`` Shame on you , Mr. Jordan . That 's not what I said , '' Cohen shot back .\nWhen it was the Democrats ' turn to question Cohen , they gave him the chance to add new details about how he had prepared his previous congressional testimony , in which he lied , as well as the hush money payments and Trump 's conversations with Stone .\nCohen also disclosed new information when he said he could not discuss conversations with Trump that took place two months after the FBI raided his offices because they were still under investigation .\nThe Manhattan US Attorney 's Office , which prosecuted Cohen , is examining that conversation as well as other possible wrongdoing or illegal behavior by Trump , Cohen said .\nCohen took his preparations for his 2017 congressional testimony into the White House , telling one Democrat that changes were made to his testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project when it was reviewed by Trump 's lawyers .\n`` There were several changes that were made , including how we were going to handle that message , '' Cohen said . `` The message , of course , being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed , and remained alive .
