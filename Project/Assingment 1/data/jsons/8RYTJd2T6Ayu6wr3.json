    "content": "The FBI shocked the political world on Friday by announcing that newly discovered emails have caused the bureau to renew its inquiry into Hillary Clinton \u2019 s private email server .\nThe Clinton campaign has for months thought the worst of the email server controversy was over . In July , to their great relief , FBI Director James Comey said that Clinton would not face criminal charges for sending emails over a private server while secretary of state .\nBut whatever new emails authorities have found are apparently enough to trigger a second look at whether she broke the law . Comey \u2019 s letter to Congress on Friday doesn \u2019 t say much , but it does at least suggest that the FBI is still looking into whether Clinton violated federal law by sending classified email over her private server . ( Comey said the FBI had come across new emails in \u201c an unrelated case , \u201d and that the bureau will review them \u201c to determine whether they contain classified information , as well as to assess their importance to our investigation \u201d into Clinton . )\nThere \u2019 s a lot we don \u2019 t know yet . But , citing anonymous sources , multiple news outlets have reported that these emails are from \u201c a device \u201d belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner and were discovered via an unrelated investigation .\nOf course , the new line of investigation does not necessarily mean that Clinton broke the law . With less than two weeks until the election , Comey \u2019 s letter to Congress will lead to ferocious new partisan attacks over her private server . ( Donald Trump is already making them . ) We have no more proof that Clinton broke the law today than we did yesterday . All we know is that Comey has new records he thinks are worthy of further investigation .\nThat said , it \u2019 s important to be clear about just why Clinton \u2019 s email server is now one of the biggest stories of the 2016 presidential campaign . And to understand that , you have to understand why she was under investigation in the first place .\nOne of the big challenges in writing about the \u201c Hillary Clinton email controversy \u201d is that it \u2019 s one overly broad category that \u2019 s being used to capture several distinct accusations against the Democratic presidential nominee .\nThe shorthand \u201c Hillary \u2019 s emails , \u201d though somewhat irresistible , suggests a single controversy that is somehow both monolithic and strangely sprawling . The reality is that there are actually four ( or , if you include claims of a cover-up , five ; or , if you include Benghazi , six ) distinct controversies that involve both Clinton and email . Indeed , there are several separate groups of emails , and some of the accusations against Clinton are contradictory .\nTo understand what \u2019 s happening , it \u2019 s useful to split up these controversies rather than lump them together :\nOne controversy related to Clinton \u2019 s emails is that she exchanged classified information over a private server that was susceptible to hacking by foreign agents . This is an issue about cybersecurity \u2014 that Clinton didn \u2019 t do enough to safeguard government secrets . This is what the FBI \u2019 s investigation is about , and what appears to be behind Comey \u2019 s new investigation . The FBI has discovered a new set of emails \u2014 apparently emerging from its separate inquiry into Anthony Weiner \u2014 that is making it look again at this question of whether Clinton broke a law .\nAnother claim is that Clinton \u2019 s private server allowed her to avoid public records laws . This is a controversy related to the idea of transparency \u2014 that government officials have to keep records of their work , and that Clinton deliberately avoided doing so .\nSeparately , emails from Clinton \u2019 s aides have also fed into different controversies about the Clinton Foundation and the Benghazi compound attack . At heart , these stories are about donor access and foreign policy .\nMore recently , there \u2019 s also the internal Clinton campaign emails revealed by WikiLeaks . These , generally speaking , have nothing to do with any of the emails above .\nIt \u2019 s crucial to separate these investigations in your head to understand the significance of the FBI \u2019 s investigation . The FBI was mostly concerned \u2014 and , according to today \u2019 s announcement , remains concerned \u2014 that Clinton took risks by using a private server to expose state secrets that could be obtained by malicious foreign actors .\nIn July , the FBI said its investigation into Clinton looked at whether \u201c classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on ( her ) personal system , in violation of a federal statute making it a felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way , \u201d or if she broke a second law making it illegal to \u201c knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities. \u201d We have no idea if the new emails will provide evidence of that , but it appears to be what the FBI will be looking at .\nIt \u2019 s not in dispute that Clinton used a private email account and a `` homebrew '' private email server exclusively during her four years as secretary of state .\nIn doing so , she wound up exchanging emails containing classified information over communications systems that did not have the safeguards of the government . In all , Clinton sent or received more than 100 emails considered classified \u2014 seven of which were marked `` top secret '' \u2014 on the private server installed in her family \u2019 s home in Westchester , New York .\nThe FBI \u2019 s investigation , the records of which were released in September in a 58-page report , makes clear there \u2019 s no direct proof that `` hostile agents '' penetrated Clinton \u2019 s private server . And as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Dylan Matthews has noted , prosecutors would need evidence not just that Clinton sent classified information outside secure government networks but that she did so knowing that it was supposed to be classified . That \u2019 s the standard the FBI needs to prove Clinton broke the law .\nClinton has denied this , insisting that any classified material in the emails was classified after the fact or she did not realize it had been classified . And the FBI had cleared Clinton of the charge that she had knowingly sent classified information .\nBut even short of committing a crime , Comey has also made clear that Clinton \u2019 s private server made it more vulnerable to foreign hackers , that outside actors repeatedly tried to break into her email account , and that exchanging classified email over private servers at all was `` extremely careless . ''\nTrump has suggested that China and/or Russia have actually obtained Clinton \u2019 s emails . That is , characteristically , a dramatic overstatement of the facts . But the claim that Clinton \u2019 s decision to use a private server really did give foreign hackers a greater opportunity to find classified information is hard to dismiss out of hand . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Timothy Lee has written , hackers are really good at covering their tracks if they don \u2019 t want to be discovered . The New York Times interviewed several cybersecurity experts in July , and they all concluded that it was probable Clinton \u2019 s server was indeed hacked .\nThere have been three main defenses to this line of criticism .\nThe first is that much of the `` classified '' information exchanged almost certainly didn \u2019 t actually risk exposing national security secrets . That \u2019 s because the US government has a notoriously broad classification system that treats anodyne information ( or information that \u2019 s already public ) as secret .\n`` My standard joke is that the NSA is so crazy they classify their lunch menu , '' says James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . `` Was it a bad idea to set up a private server ? Probably . Did it hurt national security or cause any real damage ? We certainly can \u2019 t conclude that . ''\nThe second defense , noted to me in an email by Steven Aftergood of the Project on Government Secrecy , is that the State Department server may not really have been that much safer than the private servers . After all , State 's own servers were successfully breached in 2006 and then again in 2015 \u2014 so maybe Clinton 's emails were actually safer on the private server ?\nThe third defense is also persuasive : Private accounts are pretty routine for government officials . A 2009 email sent by then-Secretary of State Colin Powell , released Wednesday , suggests that Powell frequently used a private server to communicate with foreign governments . ( Powell \u2019 s private server wasn \u2019 t a `` homebrew , '' but it was still outside the government \u2019 s systems . )\nCritics have correctly said that Clinton \u2019 s use of her server appeared to go further than that of other government officials , but the Powell revelation makes this controversy look like a broader indictment of a broken email system \u2014 with Clinton being singled out unfairly as a particularly bad example .\nThose defenses may be persuasive on the merits . But they \u2019 re so complicated that they \u2019 ll probably be tough to make convincing with less than two weeks left in the campaign .",
