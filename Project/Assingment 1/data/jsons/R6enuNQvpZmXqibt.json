Though they \u2019 ve certainly been campaigning and organizing in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 Biden just came off an 8-day bus tour through Iowa \u2014 the former vice president \u2019 s campaign says faltering there wouldn \u2019 t be a death knell . Their paths hinge on strong showings in the more diverse early states of Nevada and South Carolina , and riding that energy into delegate-rich Super Tuesday on March 3 . Pointing to the Southern states of North Carolina , Florida , Georgia , and Virginia , Kavanaugh said , \u201c Places like that we think we could have a really profound advantage . \u201d\n\u201c We strongly believe \u2014 and have consistently said \u2014 that no single state is a must-win , \u201d he added . \u201c However , the Biden campaign has gone to lengths to build organizations in each of the first four states to ensure that we \u2019 re in a position to win . \u201d\nPolitical experts in the early states disagree , saying that taken together , Iowa and New Hampshire are indeed must-wins .\n\u201c No candidate in the modern primary cycle has won the nomination without coming in first or second in New Hampshire or Iowa , \u201d said University of New Hampshire pollster and political science professor Andy Smith . \u201c You \u2019 ve got to win in one of the early states because it \u2019 s all about momentum . \u201d\nWelcome to the competing theories of how to win in 2020 : the momentum primary vs. the delegates primary .\nThe traditional path to the Democratic nomination \u2014 and the one that most top-tier candidates are pursuing , to varying degrees \u2014 starts in Iowa and New Hampshire . The importance of these first two states is not the amount of delegates each contains ; it \u2019 s the Election Night headlines about who won , and who overperformed expectations .\nMomentum is the reason why candidates are disproportionately spending more time in Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada , and South Carolina than anywhere else in the country right now . The media narrative drives the early state primaries , and candidates who can win or change the narrative in these states are statistically much more likely to win the nomination .\nDespite the 2020 primary campaign nationalizing , and despite plenty of grumbling from some presidential candidates that Iowa and New Hampshire are too old and white to continue playing such a big role in the nominating process , the states have had stubborn staying power .\n\u201c Iowa is the first place you can win something , \u201d veteran Iowa pollster Ann Selzer said . \u201c What voters from other states take from Iowa is here \u2019 s somebody who \u2019 s been vetted , and here \u2019 s where that state weighs in . \u201d\nIowa in particular has been getting disproportionate attention from the top-tier Democratic candidate contingent of Biden , Sens . Elizabeth Warren ( MA ) and Bernie Sanders ( VT ) , and South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg . Sanders is spending most of his time campaigning in Iowa , where he \u2019 s focusing heavily on combating climate change . Warren has been crisscrossing the country , but has also been spending a ton of time in the early states .\nAnd Buttigieg , the candidate who is now leading the polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire but lagging in South Carolina , according to the most recent RealClearPolitics average , is depending on momentum to push him out of the gate , perhaps more than anyone else .\n\u201c For us it \u2019 s about harnessing the momentum and energy people feel around Pete and turning that into action , \u201d a Buttigieg campaign aide told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nCandidates who initially tried to bypass Iowa and New Hampshire in favor of more diverse southern and western states have floundered . Former candidate Sen. Kamala Harris ( D-CA ) first attempted to run her campaign through Nevada and South Carolina , before switching course and \u201c f * * king moving to Iowa , \u201d while cutting her New Hampshire operation drastically . ( That strategy ultimately didn \u2019 t work ) .\nThough Nevada and South Carolina don \u2019 t always take their cues from Iowa and New Hampshire , they are certainly watching the first two states to see what happens .\n\u201c My feeling is what happens in Iowa and New Hampshire is going to have a great impact on Nevada , \u201d said Jon Ralston , editor of the Nevada Independent and the dean of the state \u2019 s political press corps , adding that poor showings in the first two states could hurt Biden in Nevada . \u201c As important as I think we are , we are dependent on Iowa and New Hampshire . Because of the way the national media covers it , because momentum is important . \u201d\nEven though Biden still has a 20-point lead in South Carolina , where he \u2019 s a known and beloved entity among older black voters in particular , some in that state cautioned Biden \u2019 s support there could still be movable , especially if he slumps in the first two states .\n\u201c I think the Biden people are fooling themselves if they don \u2019 t believe they need to do well in Iowa and New Hampshire , \u201d state Sen. Marlon Kimpson ( D ) , who hasn \u2019 t yet endorsed a candidate , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c At the end of the day , it \u2019 s not going to be determinative of how we vote , but it will probably stymie the enthusiasm a bit for him to come limping out of New Hampshire and Iowa . It is an issue . \u201d\nThe early states cull the field to its most serious contenders . What comes after is the race to bag delegates , and while it may not be as headline-grabbing at every turn , it \u2019 s hugely consequential .\nIt takes 1,990 delegates to win the Democratic Party \u2019 s nomination for president , and about 40 percent of those delegates will be allotted on Super Tuesday . Not only is it about winning states , it \u2019 s also about winning district-level delegates . These are the voters and local activists who sign up through their state party to act as delegates .\nAlong with a group of party leaders and state and local elected officials known as PLEO delegates , they make up the majority of the total 5,098 delegate and alternate votes that are up for grabs . ( After the contentious 2016 nomination , the DNC changed its rules around automatic delegates or \u201c superdelegates \u201d this year . Superdelegates may now only vote on the first ballot to select a nominee at the Democratic National Convention if a campaign has secured a supermajority of pledged delegates . Otherwise , they weigh in in the unlikely event of a second round of voting . )\nDemocratic candidates are going to need at least a 15 percent threshold in states or individual districts in order to qualify for pledged delegates . Delegate math becomes crucial , and campaigns crunching the number will target certain districts with demographics that could be favorable for them .\nEven as they \u2019 ve been crisscrossing the first four states , multiple top-tier campaigns have also been mapping out their Super Tuesday strategies for months . The most delegate-rich state of California has been added to the March 3 roster , along with Texas , North Carolina , and Minnesota . The delegates primary kicks off in earnest on Super Tuesday , and that is where Biden \u2019 s team believes they have the real edge , because of the former vice president \u2019 s steady support among older black voters in southern states .\nNot only that , but there \u2019 s the fact that moderate House candidates swept Democrats to victory in the 2018 midterms , which the Biden campaign also sees as a potential opportunity .\n\u201c These states , it \u2019 s not just about the diversity , it \u2019 s also about the ideological makeup , \u201d said Kavanaugh . \u201c That \u2019 s why we feel we can play in all these districts , not just the diverse districts . \u201d\nA lot is riding on Super Tuesday \u2014 not just for Biden\nIf Biden pulls off losing Iowa and New Hampshire but winning Nevada and South Carolina , he and the rest of the field have just a few days before the primary takes a dramatic turn toward the \u201c tarmac campaign \u201d starting on March 3 .\nGiven the lack of a clear frontrunner , some Democrats say they \u2019 re envisioning a scenario where there could be three to four candidates still in the race by the time Super Tuesday rolls around .\nOnce February is over and the early state contests end , the style of campaigning shifts abruptly from intimate town halls to large scale rallies and television and digital ads plastered on screens . Rather than convincing a relatively small number of voters in the early states , the remaining candidates need to woo a huge number of voters in large and diverse states like California and Texas \u2014 among 14 others .\nSuddenly , delegate math is the name of the game . California alone is \u201c fucking huge , \u201d as one presidential campaign aide put it \u2014 a behemoth with over 500 delegates up for grabs .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a virtual national primary because there are so many states . The math itself changes , and every network has some sort of chart showing the projected delegate count , \u201d said longtime California Democratic consultant Bill Carrick .\nCampaigns have been preparing for this moment , some more than others . Buttigieg \u2019 s campaign has paid staff on the ground in California , but is so far relying on regional organizing staff and a volunteer base in most states after the first four . Both the Sanders and Warren campaigns have had organizers on the ground in key primary states for months , both in Super Tuesday states and the ones beyond . Warren \u2019 s campaign has been staffing up in 16 states , including California , Texas , Florida , Michigan , Arizona , Ohio , and others . Sanders has hired state directors in Colorado , Minnesota , Texas , and a field director in Oklahoma . The Sanders campaign has knocked over 7,000 doors in Oklahoma alone .\n\u201c We know our success on March 3 will be critical to Sen. Sanders winning the Democratic nomination , which is why over the past six months our campaign has taken concrete steps to build out an unrivaled operation across the Super Tuesday states , \u201d Sanders campaign spokesperson Joe Calvello told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nWhile the Golden State is usually seen as primarily a fundraising destination , both Sanders and Warren have made repeated trips there , drawing substantial crowds . Warren has a thin lead in that state , but Sanders has gained momentum in recent polls .\nSanders has been putting a huge emphasis on California , hiring over 80 staffers and opening five offices in the state , and heavily focusing on organizing communities of color . A new LA Times/UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found Sanders narrowly leading Warren in California , with Biden and South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg in third and fourth .\n\u201c He ran a real campaign here [ in 2016 ] , Carrick said . \u201c He believes strongly he can do well here . He \u2019 s going to be a player in these Orange County districts . \u201d\nThe fluidity of the top-tier can be seen in other Super Tuesday states as well , where polls show Biden currently leading in Texas and North Carolina , and Warren leading in her home state of Massachusetts ( many other Super Tuesday states haven \u2019 t been polled ) . Beyond that , Biden currently leads polls for four key March 17 primary states : Ohio , Florida , Arizona , and Illinois .\nStill , a lot could change between now and then , and candidates can \u2019 t get delegates without momentum . It \u2019 s a simple reason that , as Smith put it , \u201c winners win , and losers lose . \u201d",
