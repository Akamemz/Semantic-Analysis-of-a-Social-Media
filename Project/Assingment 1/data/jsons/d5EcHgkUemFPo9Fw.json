    "content": "Commentator : Do n't Stop Arguing , Complaining And Fighting For 'Identity Politics '\nIn a recent essay in the New York Times , Columbia professor and historian Mark Lilla issued a warning to liberals left stunned by President-elect Donald Trump 's victory : Knock it off with the `` identity politics '' or be doomed to repeat this failure .\n`` American liberalism , '' he wrote , `` has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial , gender , and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism 's message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing . ''\nThis admonition has been welcomed , and echoed , by pundits and public figures left and right .\n`` Make identity politics the main operational model in a country that is two-thirds white and 50 percent or so male , and what do you expect ? '' asked the National Review . Sen. Bernie Sanders warned that the Democratic Party 's future rests on whether it can `` go beyond identity politics '' and says he is `` deeply humiliated '' by the party 's failure to attract more people with his white , working-class background .\nNo one seems to have a satisfying definition of what `` identity politics '' means , exactly , but the message is clear : Liberals have been paying too much attention to race and gender and sexual orientation \u2014 or not enough attention to the right variants of those \u2014 and sensible Americans are rightly saying `` no thanks . ''\nThe critique is aimed at the astonishingly broad , often fractious , ever-shifting coalition of voices that has been pushing Americans to rethink essentially everything about the way we treat each other . That coalition has been at it in full force for the past few years , on every available platform , from street protests and campus walkouts to tweetstorms and first-person essays ; from investigative reports to Hollywood boycotts to a new crop of identity-focused podcasts helmed by prominent writers and thinkers of color .\nWhat Lilla and others keen on pulling the plug on conversations about multiculturalism and diversity do n't realize is that by doing so , they play right into the hands of the newly emboldened neo-Nazis who helped put Trump in office and are now delighting over several of his post-election staff and Cabinet picks . Shutting down these conversations \u2014 or redirecting them to the concerns of white , straight , mostly male Americans \u2014 is precisely what those groups want badly to see happen .\nRichard Spencer , the head of the white supremacist National Policy Institute , made it clear in a recent speech at the Ronald Reagan building in Washington , D.C. , that the so-called alt-right wo n't be satisfied by a ban on Muslims or the deportation of millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally . They want to go back to a time when no one questioned why all the Academy Award winners were white or wondered whether the black man shot by the police officer deserved it ; back to a time when even if someone questioned those things , who would listen ?\nListen to Spencer boasting to a crowd of about 200 people , most of them white men , some of whom responded with Nazi salutes :\n`` Within the very blood in our veins as children of the sun lies the potential for greatness . That is the great struggle we are called to . We are not meant to live in shame and weakness and disgrace . We were not meant to beg for moral validation from some of the most despicable creatures to ever populate the planet . We were meant to overcome . Overcome all of it . ''\nNeo-Nazis and white supremacists like the ones brazenly applauding that night ( `` Hail Trump ! Hail our people ! '' ) long to once again feel safe parading their supposed superiority around without anyone talking back loudly enough to matter . Others worry about being bumped from the head of the line , where , to their ears , terms like `` inclusion '' and `` anti-racism '' are code for `` white genocide .
