What other conclusion can one reach when 44 out of 47 Senate Democrats blocked the Senate from voting on a bill requiring that any baby who survives an abortion \u2014 in other words , a baby who was born \u2014 must be brought to a hospital for care and treated with \u201c the same degree of professional skill , care , and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age . \u201d\nWhoever intentionally performs or attempts to perform an overt act that kills a child born alive described under subsection ( a ) , shall be punished\u2026 for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being .\nGood grief , who could object to that ? At least six want-to-be presidents \u2014 Kamala Harris , Bernie Sanders , Kirsten Gillibrand , Amy Klobuchar , Cory Booker , and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 did . That \u2019 s stunning .\nWe have been here before . During the height of the eugenics movement in the 1920s and 30s , activists sought to \u201c improve \u201d the human herd by preventing the so-called \u201c unfit \u201d from being born \u2014 generally through involuntary sterilization of those considered eugenically incorrect . Appallingly , some 60,000 people were involuntarily sterilized under color of law in the United States during the first half of the 20th century .\nSome famous advocates wanted to go even further , advocating the killing of babies who did not pass eugenics muster . For example , in his splendid history of the eugenics movement , War Against the Weak , Edwin Black reports that birth control advocate and social Darwinist Margaret Sanger , proudly spouted \u201c the extreme eugenic view that human \u2018 weeds \u2019 should be \u2018 exterminated. \u2019 \u201d Bizarrely , so did Helen Keller \u2014 as if the fact that her disabilities weren \u2019 t congenital would have protected her once the slaughter of the \u201c defectives \u201d began .\nSystematic infanticide was never legalized in the United States . But in Germany , doctors killed tens of thousands of disabled babies between 1939-1945 . It is important to note that Hitler did not force medical personnel to kill disabled babies ( although doctors and midwives were required legally to report their births ) . Rather , doctors who committed infanticide did so willingly , believing that their killing was a \u201c healing treatment \u201d for the child , the family , and the Reich .\nAfter the war , infanticide was scorned universally as evil . But now , that moral consensus has frayed . Indeed , one could say that infanticide is making a comeback .\nOne need only look at the world \u2019 s foremost medical and bioethics journals to see the trendline . Princeton University \u2019 s bioethics professor Peter Singer became famous by claiming that newborn babies are killable because they have not yet developed the cognitive capacities to be considered a \u201c person. \u201d He wrote in Rethinking Life and Death , \u201c Since neither a newborn infant nor a fish is a person the wrongness of killing such beings is not as great as the wrongness of killing a person. \u201d In other words , to Singer , a newborn infant is the moral equivalent of a mackerel .\nIn a 2010 Harvard symposium on abortion and infanticide , Singer tied infanticide to the legality of abortion : \u201c The position that allows abortion also allows infanticide under some circumstances.\u2026 If we accept abortion , we do need to rethink some of those more fundamental attitudes about human life . \u201d\nIn another world and time , Singer \u2019 s advocacy would make him an intellectual outcast . Instead , far from being a fringe character , Singer is invited to present at seminars , symposia , and philosophy association conventions throughout the world . He is often quoted respectfully in the mainstream media , including frequently in New York Times , where he is also a recurring contributor .\nSinger is far from alone . A few years ago , the Journal of Medical Ethics published an advocacy article entitled , \u201c After-Birth Abortion : Why Should the Baby Live ? \u201d Consider the following quotes that the editors of one of the world \u2019 s most prestigious bioethics journals considered worthy of respectful dissemination :\n\u201c The moral status of an infant is equivalent to that of a fetus , that is , neither can be considered a \u2018 person \u2019 in a morally relevant sense . \u201d\n\u201c In spite of the oxymoron in the expression , we propose to call this practice \u2018 after-birth \u2019 abortion , \u2019 rather than \u2018 infanticide , \u2019 to emphasize that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus\u2026 rather than that of a child . \u201d\n\u201c We claim that killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all circumstances where abortion would be . \u201d\n\u201c Merely being human is not in itself a reason for ascribing someone a right to life . \u201d\nThe authors also claim that killing healthy and able-bodied babies should be allowable because , \u201c we also need to consider the interests of the mother who might suffer psychological distress from giving up her child for adoption. \u201d The mind boggles .\nAlas , infanticide has gone beyond mere advocacy in the modern world . For decades , China turned a blind eye to chronic female infanticide that resulted from its odious \u201c one child policy , \u201d recently abandoned because it led to a catastrophic demographic imbalance between males and females . India has also seen a problem with sex-selection \u201c after-birth abortions . \u201d\nThe Netherlands has embraced wartime Germany \u2019 s scorned policy of allowing babies born with terminal illnesses and serious disabilities to be subjected to homicide by doctors . And , it is done under color of law under a bureaucratic checklist known as \u201c The Groningen Protocol , \u201d which permits doctors to lethally inject infants under three scenarios :\nThe baby has no chance of survival ( a circumstance that is sometimes misdiagnosed ) ; The baby \u201c may survive after a period of intensive treatment but expectations for their future are very grim \u201d ; The baby does \u201c not depend on technology for physiologic stability \u201d but has \u201c suffering [ that ] is severe , sustained , and can not be alleviated . \u201d\nThus , Dutch doctors not only speed up dying babies \u2019 deaths , but also kill those with serious disabilities who do not need intensive care . Showing the dark currents that are flowing in favor of infanticide , the Groningen Protocol was published with all due respect in the New England Journal of Medicine .\nSome politicians and advocates are slightly less blatant , arguing in support of what could be called infanticide-by-neglect . The most well-known recent example was Virginia Governor Ralph Northam ( D-VA ) , who falsely ( according to a study published by the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute ) claimed that late-term abortions are restricted to \u201c cases where there may be severe deformities , there may be a fetus that \u2019 s non-viable. \u201d And if such babies are born alive , Northam was asked in a radio interview . He stated coldly :\nSo , in this particular example , if a mother is in labor , I can tell you exactly what would happen . The infant would be delivered . The infant would be kept comfortable . The infant would be resuscitated if that \u2019 s what the mother and the family desired , and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother .\nThink about this . The Governor of Virginia endorsed the moral equivalent of the Roman Empire \u2019 s ancient practice of exposing disabled infants on hills \u2014 except that instead of leaving the baby in the weeds to be consumed by animals , the child would be left to die unattended in a bassinette .
