    "content": "The story that George Zimmerman told about his fight with Trayvon Martin , the one that yesterday persuaded a jury to acquit him of second-degree murder and manslaughter , never had anything to do with the right to stand your ground when attacked in a public place . Knocked down and pinned to the ground by Martin , Zimmerman would not have had an opportunity to escape as Martin hit him and knocked his head against the concrete . The duty to retreat therefore was irrelevant . The initial decision not to arrest Zimmerman , former Sanford , Florida , Police Chief Bill Lee said last week ( as paraphrased by CNN ) , `` had nothing to do with Florida 's controversial 'Stand Your Ground ' law '' because `` from an investigative standpoint , it was purely a matter of self-defense . '' And as The New York Times explained last month , `` Florida 's Stand Your Ground law\u2026has not been invoked in this case . '' The only context in which `` stand your ground '' was mentioned during the trial was as part of the prosecution 's attempt to undermine Zimmerman 's credibility by arguing that he lied when he told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he had not heard of the law until after the shooting .
