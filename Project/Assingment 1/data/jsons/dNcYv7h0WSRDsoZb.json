Being a practical 16-year-old, I bought my mom a carton of cigarettes. (No minor tobacco-purchase laws had been enacted in my state yet.)\n\nYou don\u2019t have to point out how stupid this Mother\u2019s Day gift was. My sister did. She said:\n\nSmoking kills. We want our mother to STOP smoking. You\u2019re only hastening her death. Your gift is thoughtless, lazy, tasteless.\n\nI was sufficiently shamed.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nIt was Mother\u2019s Day morning, so I presented mom the carton of smokes. I took a deep breath and plowed through my reasoning. Yes, I had reasons. It went something like this:\n\nI noticed as I bought my own gum and Dr. Pepper with my hard-earned $3.35 minimum wage cash, that a carton of cigarettes was expensive. Outrageously expensive!\n\nAnd then light bulb moment.\n\nWhy don\u2019t I save you the trouble of having to buy pack after pack, and you can save your money and buy something you REALLY want with the money you save now that you have an entire carton of cigarettes? Exhale.\n\nMy mom, not exactly known for her sweet disposition, looked at me and then the carton of Tareyton smokes she held then back at me. Much to my smug sister\u2019s disappointment she said:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. They are expensive. Thank you for the gift, Sonja.\u201d\n\nIt's interesting, the memories that stick with you...\n\nI got to thinking how I've turned over this memory several times when my mother was alive and since her death (not from smoking.) And I wondered on this Mother\u2019s Day: What will my three daughters, ages 10-13, remember about me after I\u2019m gone?\n\nIt\u2019s such a bizarre story to remember, but I remember it clearly. My mother's puzzled face, the way the veins stood out in her hands as she clutched the carton and my own deep relief and gratitude.\n\nMy girls and I make dozens of memories every day. What will they remember?\n\nWill my 11-year-old daughter remember how last night she asked for help on her report on Afghanistan and I told her firmly, \u201cNo. It\u2019s important that you do your own work.\u201d\n\nAnd it is important. But really, I was just too tired to help.\n\nMy daughter saw right through that B.S. answer. Will she remember that?\n\nOr will she remember how this morning, I was late to work because I stopped everything to overturn laundry baskets, to move couch cushions and pull open every drawer in the house to find a needed costume piece for a play she was doing?\n\nHonestly, probably neither.\n\nWe as parents have no control over what memories our children will carry forward with them through life and after we're gone from this Earth.\n\nBut whether we\u2019re conscious of it or not, we are trying to forge some lasting impression. Will they remember us as fair or fierce? Ambitious or compassionate? As kind or kick-ass?\n\nWhy I think that memory stuck\n\nI think the reason the memory of the worst Mother\u2019s Day gift ever has stayed with me is because my mother SAW me in that moment. She saw past the absurdity of a gift purchased at a gas station, and saw me.\n\nA proud teenager presenting her mother with a practical gift bought through hard work by manning the fryer at Burger King that I hoped would save her oodles of money so she could buy something nice for herself.\n\nOur children see us.\n\nOur good. Our ugly. They will forget much of it. Remember some of it.\n\nWe can\u2019t control what they will remember.\n\nBut maybe there is one way we can influence a tiny sliver of the memories our children will carry about us parents. It comes at those hold-your-breath moments when they\u2019re looking at us, looking at them.\n\nFor example, when you buy your mom a carton of cigarettes on Mother\u2019s Day and you\u2019ve locked eyes.\n\nWe parents hold a lot of power in those moments. How we react is everything. Our children care what we think. About them. About their choices. (Especially the dumb ones.)
