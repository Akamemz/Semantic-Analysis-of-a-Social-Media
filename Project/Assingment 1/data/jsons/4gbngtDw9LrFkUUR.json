Thanks to a combination of state and federal aid , tuition is now free for 55 percent of in-state , full-time undergraduates at State University of New York ( SUNY ) and City University of New York ( CUNY ) campuses , says Daniel Fuller , Gov .

The promise in Kalamazoo , Michigan , has been around long enough to also show a boost in college completion .\nBut if policymakers don \u2019 t get the right formula for support , they may not generate the hoped-for gains .\nIn New York , advocates for more investment in higher education say too many people are left out of the Excelsior Scholarship , and that its requirement of full-time attendance and on-time graduation may result in the most disadvantaged students losing eligibility partway through school .\nNationwide , only about 6 out of 10 full-time students at public institutions complete a bachelor \u2019 s degree within six years , let alone four .\nSo if students heed the call to stretch themselves and dream beyond a high school diploma or associate degree , and then they trip over the strings attached , it can feel like the promise has fallen flat , too .\nShe \u2019 s the first in her family to earn an associate degree \u2013 from Queensborough Community College in New York \u2013 and it was virtually free . A special program there covered not only tuition , but also transportation and books , and helped her keep on track with strong advisement .\nAnn Hermes/Staff Yerania Aguilar , a junior at Queens College , part the City University of New York system , poses for a portrait on campus in May . She \u2019 s the first in her family to earn an associate \u2019 s degree , which was virtually free . Now , at a four-year college , a misunderstanding with her schedule and credits changed her Excelsior Scholarship eligibility .\nShe arrived in the U.S. from Mexico at age 3 , and still lives with her sister and their single mother in Queens . By some markers , she is living the American Dream .\n\u201c I was definitely thankful \u201d for free community college , \u201c which is maybe why it got to my head : If it could happen to me the first two years , it could happen to me the second two years . But no , it didn \u2019 t work like that , \u201d Ms. Aguilar says , sitting on a saggy couch in the basement of the student union at Queens College , where she \u2019 s pursuing a bachelor \u2019 s degree in exercise science .\nLast spring , at the end of her second semester here , she found out that dropping a class in her first semester had thrown her off track . She thought she had a green light for her schedule . By her count , she was still earning 31 credits for the year , she says , and Excelsior requires 30 . But then a college official told her she hadn \u2019 t earned enough credits related to her major .\n\u201c For that spring semester I had to pay back $ 639 , \u201d she says , the amount of her Excelsior Scholarship after other aid covered the rest . Tuition at CUNY four-year campuses , including Queens College and Mr. Ahmed \u2019 s CCNY , is $ 6,730 per year .\nHer questions to campus officials were never satisfactorily answered , she says , but she paid it and moved forward without the scholarship . She had also lost future eligibility by declaring a minor , which would make it impossible to finish her degree on time .\nShe chose psychology as her minor , to prepare for graduate school on her way to becoming a pediatric physical therapist . She knew that would be a good career when she assisted Sebastian , a child diagnosed with cerebral palsy , during an assignment at her community college .\n\u201c He said he couldn \u2019 t put on a sock , and then [ we found ] other ways for him to put on a sock without it being such a hassle . And at the end of the day he was able to put it on , and it just felt so heartwarming , \u201d she says .\nShe babysits and tutors , and her mother , who works in housekeeping , helps cover nearly $ 1,000 in expenses each semester . She knows that \u2019 s relatively cheap for college , but says that because of Excelsior , the cost was unexpected .\n\u201c When they first introduce you to the scholarship , it sounds very easy , ... but then the contract itself is very confusing , \u201d she says .\nKnowing what she knows now , Ms. Aguilar says , \u201c I would have taken a year off after community college to save up . \u201d\nMany students struggle to line up the right courses to graduate on time , especially when campus resources are stretched thin , so Excelsior \u2019 s 30-credits-per-year rule is \u201c placing the onus on the student for a problem that \u2019 s really systemic , \u201d says Emily Skydel , issue coordinator for higher education affordability at New York Public Interest Research Group ( NYPIRG ) , which has a chapter at Queens College .\nAnn Hermes/Staff Students walk in and out of the North Academic Center at the City College of New York in May . Tuition at CCNY is $ 6,730 per year .\nThe Monitor spoke with several CUNY Excelsior scholars who are taking extra-heavy course loads or considering summer classes to stay on track , but state scholarships can be used only in the spring and fall semesters , so they would have to pay out of pocket .\n\u201c Funding for CUNY and SUNY has essentially been flat \u201d after accounting for inflation in recent years , Ms. Skydel says . \u201c You can \u2019 t just waive the cost but not invest in the system . \u201d\nThe state \u2019 s Higher Education Services Corp. plans to track how many students lose eligibility for Excelsior , but doesn \u2019 t yet have a number , Mr. Fuller says . As for students being shut out of needed classes , he says , \u201c we have not had that problem reported to us from either SUNY or CUNY . ... They were very clear to us that ... kids will not be denied their scholarship because they can \u2019 t get into a class in their major , \u201d he says . Students can appeal through HESC .\nSeveral campus leaders say the 30-credit rule is a plus , bolstering a broader set of efforts to keep students on an efficient path toward graduation .\nAt CUNY \u2019 s 25 campuses , the share of full-time students earning 30 credits in their first year rose from 45 percent in 2013-14 to 55 percent in 2017-18 . The 3,300 Excelsior scholars appear to be contributing to the rise , says senior vice chancellor and chief financial officer Matthew Sapienza .\nBut the four-year timeline doesn \u2019 t take into account the relationship between the racial wealth gap and college completion , and can further disadvantage black and Hispanic students , says Alan Aja , associate professor in Puerto Rican and Latino studies at CUNY \u2019 s Brooklyn College .\nCollege progress is affected not just by income , but also by whether a family has a financial safety net to lean on during hard times , he says . Nationally , while 39 percent of white students complete public four-year schools within four years , only 19 percent of blacks and 26 percent of Hispanics do , the National Center on Education Statistics reports .\n\u201c Why not just have tuition free for all ? , \u201d which CUNY did for many decades before 1976 , Professor Aja says . The strings attached are like \u201c a form of workfare , and it \u2019 s something that we unfairly do to communities of color. \u201d That approach is like saying the person needs fixing in order to work harder , he says , but poor people are already working hard , and it \u2019 s the institutional inequality that needs fixing .\nHe \u2019 s also concerned about the fact that if students don \u2019 t work in the state after graduation for the same number of years that they receive the scholarship , it will convert into a no-interest loan that they have to pay back ( with exceptions , like military service ) .\nWhile the fine print of free tuition looks onerous to some advocates , to other observers , it \u2019 s simply a fiscal and political reality , at least for now .\n\u201c States are trying to figure out how to pay for these programs , so they \u2019 re adding cost-containment measures , \u201d says Jen Mishory , a senior fellow in the Washington , D.C. , office of The Century Foundation , which seeks to reduce inequality .\nAnn Hermes/Staff Information about scholarships on display in May at the North Academic Center at the City College of New York . The school is one of many in New York State whose students are using the Excelsior Scholarship . So far , 20,000 students have received Excelsior \u2013 with the state budgeting $ 92.4 million for the 2018-19 school year .\nThe Education Trust favors plans like Oklahoma \u2019 s and Indiana \u2019 s . They are limited to lower-income families , but instead of just covering tuition that \u2019 s not paid for by other aid , their scholarships can be layered on top of other funds to cover some additional expenses \u2013 such as books or room and board \u2013 that otherwise might prove a barrier .\nThat \u2019 s important because it directs more assistance to those who need it most , Ms. Jones says . \u201c Universal \u201d plans that include middle-class families are often touted as easier sells politically , but some state programs that target low-income students have survived and thrived , even as lawmakers cut other higher education spending , she notes .\nEven for students who get free tuition , room and board can add up to tens of thousands of dollars . That \u2019 s one reason some Democrats want to go beyond free tuition and offer ways for students to avoid debt , or even wipe out already accumulated debt \u2013 as presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts recently proposed .\nVoters are receptive to these ideas . When asked if they support raising taxes on the wealthiest to make public colleges tuition-free , 55 percent said yes ; 56 percent support wiping out up to $ 50,000 in student debt for those making under $ 100,000 , according to a May Politico/Morning Consult poll .\nExcelsior and other scholarships cover Brenden Bixby \u2019 s tuition , but he \u2019 s taking out loans for room and board at SUNY Cobleskill , which averages about $ 13,000 a year .\nRight out of high school , Mr. Bixby could have worked full time on the apple orchard that his father manages in Poughkeepsie , New York . \u201c I really wanted to get a degree just to have behind me , because nowadays you can \u2019 t get anything without a degree , \u201d he says .\nHe chose Cobleskill in rural central New York , about two hours from home , because it offers an environmental management major \u2013 and great spots to go fly fishing .\nHalfway through college , Mr. Bixby doesn \u2019 t know exactly how much he \u2019 s borrowed . \u201c I try not to think about it too much just because I don \u2019 t want it to bring me down , \u201d he says . \u201c I need to focus on getting good grades because I will come out with a better job , and that job will make it way easier to pay for over time . \u201d\nAt CCNY , Mr. Ahmed says he doesn \u2019 t take his freedom from financial concerns for granted . \u201c It \u2019 s a huge opportunity for kids like me , \u201d he says , \u201d because it gives us more time to actually do things that we love , \u201d which in his case is coding .\nHis older cousins had to juggle work and college to help get the extended family established in the U.S. Now he hopes his three younger siblings can take advantage of the easier path he \u2019 s found . But he also hopes the states and the federal government can do more to make college affordable . \u201c I feel like education shouldn \u2019 t have a huge price to it , where it \u2019 s like selling your life just to learn something , \u201d he says . \u201c Some people , they \u2019 re not able to make as much as others , but they still want to give their child the best education that they can receive . \u201d\nHe \u2019 s applied for a leadership and public service fellowship next year . He \u2019 s looking forward to the internships that will bring , and can someday envision turning his love for computer science into a project that will make a positive difference for many people . \u201c I always wanted to do something that will give back to the community , \u201d he says before heading up the wide slate-gray stairs and disappearing into the massive North Academic Center for a class on writing for engineers .\nDespite the challenges she \u2019 s faced , Ms. Aguilar , too , is determined to use her experience to help others . She counsels students at her former community college , telling them , \u201c This is where I went wrong ; this is where you could go right , \u201d she says .\nAll of them want to show their parents that the sacrifices to enable them to attend college will bear fruit .\n\u201c Sometimes it was so easy to say , \u2018 Never mind , I quit . ... It \u2019 s fine to just do a high school degree , \u2019 \u201d Ms. Aguilar says . But then she \u2019 d think about her mother \u2019 s hopes : \u201c She wants something more . \u201d",

The promise in Kalamazoo, Michigan, has been around long enough to also show a boost in college completion.\n\nBut if policymakers don\u2019t get the right formula for support, they may not generate the hoped-for gains.\n\nIn New York, advocates for more investment in higher education say too many people are left out of the Excelsior Scholarship, and that its requirement of full-time attendance and on-time graduation may result in the most disadvantaged students losing eligibility partway through school.\n\nNationwide, only about 6 out of 10 full-time students at public institutions complete a bachelor\u2019s degree within six years, let alone four.\n\nSo if students heed the call to stretch themselves and dream beyond a high school diploma or associate degree, and then they trip over the strings attached, it can feel like the promise has fallen flat, too.\n\nOne example: stymied by credits\n\nYerania Aguilar embodies both the promise and the pitfalls.\n\nShe\u2019s the first in her family to earn an associate degree \u2013 from Queensborough Community College in New York \u2013 and it was virtually free. A special program there covered not only tuition, but also transportation and books, and helped her keep on track with strong advisement.\n\nAnn Hermes/Staff Yerania Aguilar, a junior at Queens College, part the City University of New York system, poses for a portrait on campus in May. She\u2019s the first in her family to earn an associate\u2019s degree, which was virtually free. Now, at a four-year college, a misunderstanding with her schedule and credits changed her Excelsior Scholarship eligibility.\n\nShe arrived in the U.S. from Mexico at age 3, and still lives with her sister and their single mother in Queens. By some markers, she is living the American Dream.\n\n\u201cI was definitely thankful\u201d for free community college, \u201cwhich is maybe why it got to my head: If it could happen to me the first two years, it could happen to me the second two years. But no, it didn\u2019t work like that,\u201d Ms. Aguilar says, sitting on a saggy couch in the basement of the student union at Queens College, where she\u2019s pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree in exercise science.\n\nLast spring, at the end of her second semester here, she found out that dropping a class in her first semester had thrown her off track. She thought she had a green light for her schedule. By her count, she was still earning 31 credits for the year, she says, and Excelsior requires 30. But then a college official told her she hadn\u2019t earned enough credits related to her major.\n\n\u201cFor that spring semester I had to pay back $639,\u201d she says, the amount of her Excelsior Scholarship after other aid covered the rest. Tuition at CUNY four-year campuses, including Queens College and Mr. Ahmed\u2019s CCNY, is $6,730 per year.\n\nHer questions to campus officials were never satisfactorily answered, she says, but she paid it and moved forward without the scholarship. She had also lost future eligibility by declaring a minor, which would make it impossible to finish her degree on time.\n\nShe chose psychology as her minor, to prepare for graduate school on her way to becoming a pediatric physical therapist. She knew that would be a good career when she assisted Sebastian, a child diagnosed with cerebral palsy, during an assignment at her community college.\n\n\u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t put on a sock, and then [we found] other ways for him to put on a sock without it being such a hassle. And at the end of the day he was able to put it on, and it just felt so heartwarming,\u201d she says.\n\nShe babysits and tutors, and her mother, who works in housekeeping, helps cover nearly $1,000 in expenses each semester. She knows that\u2019s relatively cheap for college, but says that because of Excelsior, the cost was unexpected.\n\n\u201cWhen they first introduce you to the scholarship, it sounds very easy, ... but then the contract itself is very confusing,\u201d she says.\n\nKnowing what she knows now, Ms. Aguilar says, \u201cI would have taken a year off after community college to save up.\u201d\n\nA carrot or a stick?\n\nMany students struggle to line up the right courses to graduate on time, especially when campus resources are stretched thin, so Excelsior\u2019s 30-credits-per-year rule is \u201cplacing the onus on the student for a problem that\u2019s really systemic,\u201d says Emily Skydel, issue coordinator for higher education affordability at New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG), which has a chapter at Queens College.\n\nAnn Hermes/Staff Students walk in and out of the North Academic Center at the City College of New York in May. Tuition at CCNY is $6,730 per year.\n\nThe Monitor spoke with several CUNY Excelsior scholars who are taking extra-heavy course loads or considering summer classes to stay on track, but state scholarships can be used only in the spring and fall semesters, so they would have to pay out of pocket.\n\n\u201cFunding for CUNY and SUNY has essentially been flat\u201d after accounting for inflation in recent years, Ms. Skydel says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just waive the cost but not invest in the system.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s Higher Education Services Corp. plans to track how many students lose eligibility for Excelsior, but doesn\u2019t yet have a number, Mr. Fuller says. As for students being shut out of needed classes, he says, \u201cwe have not had that problem reported to us from either SUNY or CUNY. ... They were very clear to us that ... kids will not be denied their scholarship because they can\u2019t get into a class in their major,\u201d he says. Students can appeal through HESC.\n\nSeveral campus leaders say the 30-credit rule is a plus, bolstering a broader set of efforts to keep students on an efficient path toward graduation.\n\nAt CUNY\u2019s 25 campuses, the share of full-time students earning 30 credits in their first year rose from 45 percent in 2013-14 to 55 percent in 2017-18. The 3,300 Excelsior scholars appear to be contributing to the rise, says senior vice chancellor and chief financial officer Matthew Sapienza.\n\nBut the four-year timeline doesn\u2019t take into account the relationship between the racial wealth gap and college completion, and can further disadvantage black and Hispanic students, says Alan Aja, associate professor in Puerto Rican and Latino studies at CUNY\u2019s Brooklyn College.\n\nCollege progress is affected not just by income, but also by whether a family has a financial safety net to lean on during hard times, he says. Nationally, while 39 percent of white students complete public four-year schools within four years, only 19 percent of blacks and 26 percent of Hispanics do, the National Center on Education Statistics reports.\n\n\u201cWhy not just have tuition free for all?,\u201d which CUNY did for many decades before 1976, Professor Aja says. The strings attached are like \u201ca form of workfare, and it\u2019s something that we unfairly do to communities of color.\u201d That approach is like saying the person needs fixing in order to work harder, he says, but poor people are already working hard, and it\u2019s the institutional inequality that needs fixing.\n\nHe\u2019s also concerned about the fact that if students don\u2019t work in the state after graduation for the same number of years that they receive the scholarship, it will convert into a no-interest loan that they have to pay back (with exceptions, like military service).\n\nWhile the fine print of free tuition looks onerous to some advocates, to other observers, it\u2019s simply a fiscal and political reality, at least for now.\n\n\u201cStates are trying to figure out how to pay for these programs, so they\u2019re adding cost-containment measures,\u201d says Jen Mishory, a senior fellow in the Washington, D.C., office of The Century Foundation, which seeks to reduce inequality.\n\nAnn Hermes/Staff Information about scholarships on display in May at the North Academic Center at the City College of New York. The school is one of many in New York State whose students are using the Excelsior Scholarship. So far, 20,000 students have received Excelsior \u2013 with the state budgeting $92.4 million for the 2018-19 school year.\n\nThe Education Trust favors plans like Oklahoma\u2019s and Indiana\u2019s. They are limited to lower-income families, but instead of just covering tuition that\u2019s not paid for by other aid, their scholarships can be layered on top of other funds to cover some additional expenses \u2013 such as books or room and board \u2013 that otherwise might prove a barrier.\n\nThat\u2019s important because it directs more assistance to those who need it most, Ms. Jones says. \u201cUniversal\u201d plans that include middle-class families are often touted as easier sells politically, but some state programs that target low-income students have survived and thrived, even as lawmakers cut other higher education spending, she notes.\n\nFree vs. debt-free\n\nEven for students who get free tuition, room and board can add up to tens of thousands of dollars. That\u2019s one reason some Democrats want to go beyond free tuition and offer ways for students to avoid debt, or even wipe out already accumulated debt \u2013 as presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts recently proposed.\n\nVoters are receptive to these ideas. When asked if they support raising taxes on the wealthiest to make public colleges tuition-free, 55 percent said yes; 56 percent support wiping out up to $50,000 in student debt for those making under $100,000, according to a May Politico/Morning Consult poll.\n\nExcelsior and other scholarships cover Brenden Bixby\u2019s tuition, but he\u2019s taking out loans for room and board at SUNY Cobleskill, which averages about $13,000 a year.\n\nRight out of high school, Mr. Bixby could have worked full time on the apple orchard that his father manages in Poughkeepsie, New York. \u201cI really wanted to get a degree just to have behind me, because nowadays you can\u2019t get anything without a degree,\u201d he says.\n\nHe chose Cobleskill in rural central New York, about two hours from home, because it offers an environmental management major \u2013 and great spots to go fly fishing.\n\nHalfway through college, Mr. Bixby doesn\u2019t know exactly how much he\u2019s borrowed. \u201cI try not to think about it too much just because I don\u2019t want it to bring me down,\u201d he says. \u201cI need to focus on getting good grades because I will come out with a better job, and that job will make it way easier to pay for over time.\u201d\n\nAt CCNY, Mr. Ahmed says he doesn\u2019t take his freedom from financial concerns for granted. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity for kids like me,\u201d he says, \u201dbecause it gives us more time to actually do things that we love,\u201d which in his case is coding.\n\nHis older cousins had to juggle work and college to help get the extended family established in the U.S. Now he hopes his three younger siblings can take advantage of the easier path he\u2019s found. But he also hopes the states and the federal government can do more to make college affordable. \u201cI feel like education shouldn\u2019t have a huge price to it, where it\u2019s like selling your life just to learn something,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people, they\u2019re not able to make as much as others, but they still want to give their child the best education that they can receive.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s applied for a leadership and public service fellowship next year. He\u2019s looking forward to the internships that will bring, and can someday envision turning his love for computer science into a project that will make a positive difference for many people. \u201cI always wanted to do something that will give back to the community,\u201d he says before heading up the wide slate-gray stairs and disappearing into the massive North Academic Center for a class on writing for engineers.\n\nDespite the challenges she\u2019s faced, Ms. Aguilar, too, is determined to use her experience to help others. She counsels students at her former community college, telling them, \u201cThis is where I went wrong; this is where you could go right,\u201d she says.\n\nAll of them want to show their parents that the sacrifices to enable them to attend college will bear fruit.\n\n\u201cSometimes it was so easy to say, \u2018Never mind, I quit. ... It\u2019s fine to just do a high school degree,\u2019\u201d Ms. Aguilar says. But then she\u2019d think about her mother\u2019s hopes: \u201cShe wants something more.\u201d",
