But it was also instructive: This is what happens when our national polarization breeds both ignorance and intolerance, and when intolerance trumps even the rule of law.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s deal with the ignorance. It\u2019s plain from the tone and content of his questioning that Sanders has no idea of the basic beliefs of orthodox Protestant Christianity. It\u2019s also plain that he has no idea of the basic beliefs of the Islamic faith that he\u2019s defending.

(One wonders: Would he grill an Islamic nominee in a similar fashion?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders isn\u2019t just ignorant of the orthodoxy of Vought\u2019s argument, though. He\u2019s also ignorant of its religious, cultural, and political implications. He sees a statement that any person \u201cstands condemned\u201d perhaps as license to discriminate against or oppress unbelievers. But properly understood Evangelical Christian belief dictates that a person should love, respect, and, if necessary, even die for the lost, as Christ Himself did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders\u2019s ignorance then leads directly to intolerance. He personifies the arrogant contempt for Evangelicals that so often marks the secular American elite. They don\u2019t understand Protestant Christian theology. They read the worst stories of Christian behavior and presume that those stories fairly represent Evangelical beliefs. So they try to drive Evangelicals from the public square, and in so doing they become the intolerant scolds they imagine their foes to be. They hate Christianity, and use political power to try to suppress its influence. They presume that their Christian opponents would do the same. Thus, they spark the exact kind of religious conflict that the founders sought to avoid.\n\nOn this point, Article VI could not be more clear:\n\nThe Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActions matter. Each public servant, including Vought, is required to support the Constitution regardless of his faith. If he were to violate the constitutional rights of any citizen he could and should be held to account \u2014 even if he believed his action to be religiously justified or compelled. But no senator can simply presume that Vought won\u2019t comply with the Constitution because he believes only followers of Jesus Christ will receive salvation.\n\nOne final note: Sanders\u2019s actions also show the fragility of one of our core constitutional protections. There is no right or ability to sue Sanders into compliance. He can vote however he chooses, and there is no cause of action to compel him to cleanse his mind of unconstitutional motivations when he casts those ballots. Thus, one of our nation\u2019s most important traditions depends on Senators\u2019 simply doing the right thing. But when our politics gets this polarized, it\u2019s easy to justify ignoring the Constitution or rationalizing away its requirements for the sake of an alleged greater good. That\u2019s what Sanders did here, and given the ignorance and intolerance that dominates our national debate, we can expect him \u2014 or others who think like him \u2014 to do it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019s & Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Free College Ideas Hurt Young People\n\nBernie Sanders & Russell Vought\u2019s Exchange on Religion\n\nDemocrats\u2019 Bernie Sanders Obsession Lingers",
