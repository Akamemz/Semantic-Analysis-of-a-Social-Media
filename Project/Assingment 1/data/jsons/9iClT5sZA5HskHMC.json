But look beneath the surface , and the second is a deeper concern for a growing swath of Americans . Not knowing how much money is coming in every month , or even every week , can make it hard to cover everyday expenses and even harder to get a leg up on things like saving for retirement and paying for education .\nFor Kieran Ridge , who owns a business painting houses and commercial buildings in wealthy neighborhoods of Boston , income fluctuations are part of the job . Ridge Painting & Restoration has thrived since he started the business in 2009 , so much so that Mr. Ridge \u2019 s wife recently left a six-figure job in management at Restoration Hardware to stay home with the couple \u2019 s two small children .\nBut his work is highly seasonal , and dipping into the family \u2019 s savings during slow winter months to get by isn \u2019 t out of the ordinary . \u201c I earn three times as much during the busy season [ from about April to November ] as I do during the winter months , \u201d he says . \u201c Even then I have weeks where there are three checks coming in , and weeks where there are no checks at all . We just try to save when it \u2019 s busy and dip in when it \u2019 s slow . \u201d\nThose peaks and valleys , however , are no longer a problem solely for small-business owners , or even the very poor . Jonathan Morduch and Rachel Schneider discovered them , time and again , in the finances of families profiled for their book , \u201c The Financial Diaries : How Americans Cope in a World of Financial Uncertainty , \u201d released in April . Over the course of a year , Mr. Morduch , an economist at New York University , and Ms. Schneider , a financial services expert , headed up a team that tracked the cash flow of 235 low- and middle-income households .\nAnd even many of those with steady jobs , living in good neighborhoods , were on shaky ground . The typical family tracked during the project had more than five months during the year in which their income swung 25 percent higher , or lower , than the sum total of their income averaged out over 12 months . One couple in the book , Becky and Jeremy , make a solid middle-class income on the aggregate from Jeremy \u2019 s work repairing trucks on commission , but dip below the poverty line six months out of the year .\n\u201c The volatility was experienced not just at the bottom , \u201d says Morduch . \u201c It \u2019 s a bigger problem for the poor , but one we see well into the middle class . \u201d\nThe Financial Diaries project tells a broader story about the economy . It \u2019 s one of heightened insecurity , driven by a confluence of factors : a broad shift in the job market , higher living costs , and employees taking on more of the financial risks traditionally borne by their employers in the form of things like retirement savings contributions and a higher proportion of income coming from tips and commission . \u201c This is something you can \u2019 t see from the usual snapshot , \u201d Schenider adds .\nAdditionally , it bolsters the argument , made previously in investigative works like Barbara Ehrenreich \u2019 s \u201c Nickel and Dimed , \u201d as well as by the tailwinds that propelled Donald Trump to victory in the 2016 presidential election , that traditional metrics of success , satisfaction , and economic progress are increasingly disconnected from the day-to-day financial struggles and anxieties of most Americans .\nMost top-down economic data is \u201c looking over an interval of time that is long enough to mask the volatility , \u201d says Diane Lim , an economist with the Conference Board .\nFrom afar , the lot of the typical American worker looks relatively good these days . At 4.4 percent , the unemployment rate in April reached a 10-year low , the Labor Department reported Friday . The number of people filing for jobless benefits now stands at a 17-year low . Wages are rising slowly but surely .\nBut just beneath the surface , that picture gets muddier . A Gallup index of economic confidence among Americans is just barely positive , despite the low jobless rate . Unemployment and jobless claims numbers don \u2019 t capture the growing cohort of workers who are marginally attached to the workforce , or stringing together multiple streams of income . People who have done some freelance work in the past 12 months now make up approximately 35 percent of the US workforce , according to freelancing website Upwork and the Freelancers Union . A study by Harvard and Princeton economists found that the share of Americans in alternative work arrangements \u2013 from temp jobs to contract workers \u2013 rose from 10 percent in 2005 to nearly 16 percent in 2015 .\nAs a result , finding surer footing is a dominant , and growing , priority . In fact , when given the choice between moving up the income ladder or having more income stability in a 2015 Pew study , 92 percent of Americans picked stability \u2013 an increase of 7 percentage points since 2011 .\n`` It \u2019 s not just about having a job [ anymore ] , it \u2019 s about the quality of the job , \u201d Morduch says .\nThe decline of manufacturing and other union-protected jobs has given way to a rise in service sector work that is \u201c traditionally lower-wage , and where people are likely to be subject to schedule changes on a weekly or even daily basis , \u201d Schneider says . At the same time , she adds , \u201c the cost of living has been rising .
