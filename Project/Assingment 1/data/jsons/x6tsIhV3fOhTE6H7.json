But a DHS shutdown isn't likely to have much impact on the front lines of national security.\n\nWhy doesn't \"shutdown\" mean a complete shutdown of the department?\n\nIn a funding shutdown, certain types of federal employees are still required to report to work \u2014 the term the government uses is that they're \"exempt\" from the shutdown. One of the categories of \"exempt\" employees is anyone whose work is \"necessary for safety of human life or protection of property.\" That category covers a lot of DHS employees.\n\nOn February 27, hours before the shutdown was scheduled to take effect, DHS published its contingency plan for how it would work in practice. 87 percent of DHS employees would be considered \"exempt\" and required to work.

The National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents, said in a statement last week that \"The last time Congress withheld funding for DHS, some agents were unable to pay their mortgages, and many struggled to make ends meet.\"\n\nWhich parts of DHS really would stop working?\n\nThe hardest-hit parts of the department would be the central DHS bureaucracy: the Office of the Secretary would only get 14 percent of employees exempted; the Office of the Undersecretary for Management would have 12 percent of its employees coming into work; and the office of Analysis and Operations would be staffed at 48 percent.\n\nOther hard-hit agencies: the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (which runs trainings for state and local police as well as federal law enforcement agents); the Science and Technology Directorate; and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (a small office to begin with, numbering just over 100 people).\n\nWhat about [Border Patrol/FEMA/Secret Service/TSA/other front-line agency of your liking]?\n\nAt agencies that are on the front lines of homeland security, most employees count as \"necessary for safety of human life or protection of property.\" So over 90 percent of the Secret Service and the TSA, and nearly 90 percent of Customs and Border Protection, would still report to work in the event of a shutdown.
