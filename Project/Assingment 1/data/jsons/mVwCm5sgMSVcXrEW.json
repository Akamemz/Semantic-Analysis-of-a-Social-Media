    "content": "In a move sure to provoke congressional Republicans , President Obama appointed embattled U.N . Ambassador Susan E. Rice on Wednesday to serve as his national security adviser .\nTo replace Mrs. Rice as U.N. ambassador , Mr. Obama also nominated former aide Samantha Power , who once referred to Hillary Rodham Clinton as a \u201c monster \u201d during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and analogized U.S. foreign policy to that of Nazi Germany in calling for a \u201c mea culpa \u201d approach to foreign policy .\nMrs. Rice , criticized roundly for portraying the deadly terrorist attack in Benghazi , Libya , as a mob protest , is to replace National Security Adviser Thomas E. Donilon , who is retiring after more than four years in the job .\nDuring an event in the White House Rose Garden , the president called Mrs. Rice \u201c the consummate public servant , a patriot who puts her country first . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m absolutely thrilled that she \u2019 ll be back at my side and leading my national security team in my second term , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c Susan exemplifies the finest tradition of American diplomacy and leadership . \u201d\nWith Mr. Donilon , Mrs. Rice and Ms. Power at his side , the president proclaimed , \u201c They have made America safer . \u201d\nMrs. Rice told the president she was \u201c deeply grateful for your enduring confidence in me . \u201d\n\u201c I look forward to continuing to serve on your national security team to keep our nation strong and safe , \u201d she said .\nThe post of national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation , although it is certain to raise the ire of congressional Republicans , with whom the president has been engaged in a \u201c charm offensive . \u201d\nMrs. Rice became a target of Republicans in the wake of the September terrorist attacks on a diplomatic post that led to the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi , including the U.S. ambassador to Libya , J. Christopher Stevens . In the midst of Mr. Obama \u2019 s re-election campaign , Mrs. Rice went on a series of TV talk shows to describe the attacks as a spontaneous protest against an anti-Islam film produced in the U.S .\nSubsequent investigations have shown that the attack was a deliberate assault carried out by groups affiliated with al Qaeda . Administration emails obtained by congressional investigators show that the State Department and other administration officials were involved in scrubbing references to terrorism in the \u201c talking points \u201d that were used by Mrs. Rice and others in the days immediately after the assault .\nJames Carafano , a national-security analyst at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation , said the choice of Mrs. Rice is proof that Mr. Obama wants to continue his foreign-policy doctrine of \u201c soft power . \u201d\n\u201c You \u2019 re getting a personification of the Obama doctrine \u2014 we \u2019 re going to rely on \u2018 soft power , \u2019 we \u2019 re going to talk to our enemies , we \u2019 re going to outsource everything to the U.N. , \u201d Mr. Carafano said . \u201c This is just a reaffirmation of \u2018 we \u2019 re going to do more of that. \u2019 What \u2019 s disturbing about this most of all is much larger than Susan Rice \u2019 s person , because she \u2019 s just really emblematic of all that . \u201d\nMr. Obama last fall was considering Mrs. Rice as a possible replacement for former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , but Republicans such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina warned that they would block her appointment .\nThe Republicans \u2019 opposition drew an angry response from Mr. Obama after his re-election , when he came to Mrs. Rice \u2019 s defense .\n\u201c She made an appearance at the request of the White House in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her , \u201d Mr. Obama said at a news conference in November . \u201c If Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others want to go after somebody , they should go after me . But for them to go after the U.N. ambassador , who had nothing to do with Benghazi and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received , and to besmirch her reputation is outrageous . \u201d\nMr. McCain responded to the news of Mrs. Rice \u2019 s pending appointment on his Twitter account Wednesday .\n\u201c Obviously I disagree w/ POTUS appointment of Susan Rice as Nat \u2019 l Security Adviser , but I \u2019 ll make every effort to work w/ her on imp \u2019 t issues , \u201d he wrote .\nRep. Jason Chaffetz , Utah Republican and a harsh critic of the administration on the Benghazi attacks , wrote on Twitter : \u201c Judgement is key to national security matters .
