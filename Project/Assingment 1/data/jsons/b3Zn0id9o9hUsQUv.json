Tom Cotton ( R-Ark . ) , none of them said it would cause them to drop their support for bills to impose new sanctions on Iran or give Congress review power over a nuclear deal .\nThat presents another complication for the administration ahead of a rough deadline of March 24 to reach a nuclear agreement with the country .\n\u201c The letter \u2019 s incredibly unfortunate and inappropriate , \u201d said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota , a centrist Democrat who voted for the sanctions bill in committee and is a sponsor of the congressional approval legislation . \u201c That doesn \u2019 t diminish my support for the legislation that we introduced . \u201d\nThe president \u2019 s challenge in Congress on the issue isn \u2019 t limited to the 47 Republican senators who signed last week \u2019 s missive arguing that a nuclear agreement could be revoked by the next U.S. president . In a letter released Saturday , White House chief of staff Denis McDonough implored Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) not to push for a vote on his bill that would give Congress 60 days to reject or approve of any deal .\nMcDonough argued that Corker \u2019 s measure , which has nearly a dozen Democratic supporters , \u201c goes well beyond ensuring that Congress has a role to play in any deal with Iran. \u201d And he asked Corker , who \u2019 s sought to maintain a cordial relationship with the White House , to let the administration finish its negotiations with Iran , indicating it may take until the end of June . A framework is expected by the end of this month .\nCorker shrugged off the request in response . And in an interview late last week , he said he hasn \u2019 t lost the support of any Democrats despite the turbulent atmosphere surrounding Iran politics .\n\u201c Let a couple days go by . We think there \u2019 s going to be really ignited momentum , \u201d Corker , who did not sign the Cotton letter , said on Thursday . \u201c Nobody \u2019 s dropping out . We \u2019 ve had reaffirmed commitment \u201d from Democrats .\nIndeed , a day after the controversy over Cotton \u2019 s letter erupted , Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado co-sponsored Corker \u2019 s congressional review bill , the 11th Democrat to signal support .\nThough the White House has seized on the GOP \u2019 s \u201c open letter to the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran \u201d in an effort to shift the politics of the nuclear negotiations in its favor on Capitol Hill , there \u2019 s no evidence it \u2019 s working so far . Nearly all of the 54 Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats in the Senate remain at odds with the president on the issue .\nMeanwhile , the House will hold hearings this week to grill administration officials on Iran , a potentially troubling sign for the administration , considering the chamber passed a strict Iran sanctions bill in 2013 by a vote of 400-20 \u2014 far above the veto override threshold .\n\u201c The letter was simply unacceptable , and it brought hyperpartisanship to an issue that we need to maintain our bipartisanship in , \u201d said Sen. Gary Peters ( D-Mich. ) , a supporter of sanctions that would not take effect unless talks fall apart or Iran backs away from the terms of any deal . \u201c That doesn \u2019 t change my support for that bill . \u2026 I stay firm . \u201d\nA group of 10 Democrats wrote to President Barack Obama this month and vowed not to support the bill that would allow Congress to reject a nuclear deal until after March 24 . That followed a similar deadline set by 12 Democrats in a January message to Obama regarding the conditional sanctions bill . Aides in both parties put their vote counts for the bills in the mid-60s , but they \u2019 re confident that if either comes to the floor , additional Democrats will back them .\nThe administration now appears to be asking for even more time : McDonough said in his letter to Corker that if a framework is reached this month and a \u201c final deal by the end of June , we expect a robust debate in Congress. \u201d GOP leaders appear determined to move much sooner than that .\nFor a moment , Cotton \u2019 s letter appeared to shake the bipartisan foundation undergirding both of the Iran bills . Democrats warned of a backslide into partisanship on a foreign policy issue that \u2019 s united Congress for years . Capitol Hill has long pressed for additional economic penalties on Iran in hopes of forcing it to the negotiating table with global powers .\nBut Sen.
