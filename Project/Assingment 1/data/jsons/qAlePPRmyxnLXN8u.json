Mental health screenings before gun purchases .

The most passionate target shooters , hunters and self-defense enthusiasts I know all agree : There are often warning signs in the boys and young men who usually carry out these acts of mass violence , and broadly implemented tests could reduce the number of them who have access to guns , without affecting any of the hundreds of millions of safe , responsible gun owners in America .\nWhile law enforcement officials say that the guns used in Newtown had been bought legally by Adam Lanza 's mother , there are instances when rampage shooters have acquired guns illegally .
