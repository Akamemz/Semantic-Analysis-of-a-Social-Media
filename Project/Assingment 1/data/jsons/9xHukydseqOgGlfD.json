    "content": "Sean Hannity and Ted Cruz went at it in a testy interview on Tuesday when the Fox News host asked the Texas senator about his campaign \u2019 s delegate selection operation .\nHannity started out by telling his audience that Cruz hopes to get to a second ballot so supporters of other candidates could have the opportunity to switch their votes .\n\u201c So you \u2019 re in a process of talking to delegates , and it seems to be very extensive . Could you explain to people what \u2019 s going on ? \u201d\n\u201c Sean , with all respect , that \u2019 s not what people are concerned about , \u201d Cruz responded , noting that the American people care more about jobs , wages , and beating Hillary Clinton in the general election .\nHannity insisted it was a serious question , and that the \u201c millions of people \u201d he engages with through his Fox News show , on radio and social media want to know .\n\u201c I \u2019 m asking you more than a process question , it \u2019 s an integrity of the election question , and everybody is asking me this question , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Sean , the only people asking this question are the hardcore Donald Trump supporters , \u201d Cruz shot back .\n\u201c Why do you do this every single time \u201d Hannity began . \u201c You got ta stop ! Every time I have you on the air , and I ask a legitimate question , you try to throw this in my face . I \u2019 m getting sick of it . I \u2019 ve had you on more than any other candidate on radio and TV . So if I ask you , senator , a legitimate question to explain to the audience , why don \u2019 t you just answer it ? \u201d\n\u201c Sean , can I answer your question without being interrupted ? \u201d Cruz calmly responded , before giving the host the full rundown of what \u2019 s happened in the election so far .\n\u201c In the last three weeks there have been five elections in five states : Utah , North Dakota , Wisconsin , Colorado and Wyoming . We \u2019 ve won all five . Over 1.3 million people voted in those five states . We won all five . All of this noise and complaining and whining has come from the Trump campaign because they don \u2019 t like the fact that they \u2019 ve lost five elections in a row , that Republicans are uniting behind our campaign , \u201d he said . \u201c So they \u2019 re screaming on Drudge and it \u2019 s getting echoed , this notion of voterless elections . It is nonsense . They are making it up . \u201d\nCruz added that delegates are elected by the people , but Trump \u2019 s campaign doesn \u2019 t know how to organize . Cruz suggested the Republican presidential front-runner \u2019 s campaign passed out fliers asking supporters to vote for a list of delegates that included the Texas senator \u2019 s delegates and fired off an emergency email to Washington , D.C. , supporters that were intended for supporters in Washington state days ahead of the state convention . \u201c I can not help that the Donald Trump campaign is incapable of running a lemonade stand , \u201d Cruz said . \u201c My focus is on jobs , freedom and security , not this incessant whining from the other side . If you lose , don \u2019 t cry about it . Go back and learn how to win an election . \u201d\nThe fiery exchange continues , with Hannity wondering why Cruz seems to be getting so mad , and Cruz insisting he \u2019 s not , but wants to focus on the issues rather than \u201c nonsense \u201d from the Trump campaign .",
