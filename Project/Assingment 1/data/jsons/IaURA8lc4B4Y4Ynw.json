The conclusions : The partial shutdown is bound to last for at least another 10 days and the stakes are growing by the hour as Americans come to believe Obama is serious about not budging . Boehner and House Republicans are unified behind a pressure play : They keep passing bills to provide funding for popular programs and Democrats \u2019 sacred cows , particularly retroactive pay guarantees to government workers . If Obama remains aloof from the process , things are going to get very dicey on Wall Street and Main Street . To wit : Markets were already hitting the skids this morning .\n[ \u201c The president has taken many steps over the last several years to show his willingness to negotiate .

But that doesn \u2019 t mean he \u2019 s got nothing to bargain with . Boehner could allow a Democrat-led vote for an unconditional debt hike at the 11th hour and lift the limit for just a very short period . If Obama is looking for stability and a lasting bargain , he \u2019 ll have to deal . Boehner added \u201c the votes are not in the House to pass a clean debt limit . And the president is risking default by not having a conversation with us. \u201d And Boehner is right\u2026 so far .
