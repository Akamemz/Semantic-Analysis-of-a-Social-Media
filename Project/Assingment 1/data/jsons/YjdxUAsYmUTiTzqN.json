In the Midwest , a consortium of states is working together on purchasing supplies to avoid competition that drives up prices .\nIn the West , the governors of Oregon and California have swung into action , loaning ventilators to other states as their case loads recede . Gov . Gavin Newsom of California is also using his state \u2019 s purchasing power to acquire millions of pieces of protective equipment for his own state \u2019 s use and potentially for neighboring states .\nTo veterans of past public health emergencies , the scramble for supplies reflects a flat-footed U.S. response born of overconfidence after past epidemics , such as SARS , were thwarted with minimal American casualties .\nDelays in testing set back the U.S. response by weeks , and as the outbreak grew , the nation \u2019 s command-and-control systems were simply not up to the task , says Dr. Elias Zerhouni , former director of the National Institutes of Health under President George W. Bush .\n\u201c You win the war not by heroics , \u201d Dr. Zerhouni says . \u201c You win the war by good logistics . \u201d\nAnd it \u2019 s logistics that have proved painfully challenging to the U.S. \u2019 s multi-tiered , federal-state-local system of government , in which each piece plays a critical role . During disasters , states are supposed to take the lead and the federal government is meant to serve as a backup . But when the disaster is nationwide \u2013 in fact , global \u2013 the potential for the system being swamped was always high .\n\u201c A statewide or regional disaster is one thing , but an emergency that affects all 50 states is something else , \u201d says Joshua Sharfstein , a public health expert at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore . \u201c The federal government is supposed to provide the framework for the states to act in . On that , the government has in many ways largely abdicated . \u201d\nRich Pedroncelli/AP California Gov . Gavin Newsom announced his state saw its first daily decrease in intensive care hospitalizations during the coronavirus outbreak , at his daily briefing in Rancho Cordova , Calif. , Thursday , April 9 , 2020 . He went on to say the state 's hospitals have thousands of ventilators available should the number of patients suddenly surge again .\nEven in regional disasters , a strong federal response can prove essential , as it was in 2005 , when Hurricane Katrina slammed the Gulf Coast and state and local authorities proved unable to manage the disaster . Often , then , it \u2019 s the leaders involved who can make or break a situation .\nLooking at today \u2019 s pandemic , \u201c I don \u2019 t think any disarray , such as it is , is caused by federalism , \u201d says Ilya Shapiro , a constitutional scholar at the libertarian CATO Institute in Washington . The federal government \u2019 s job is to look out for the country as a whole , while the governors need the flexibility to do what \u2019 s right for their state , he notes . New York is not South Dakota .\nPart of the challenge today comes with the Trump administration \u2019 s multiple chains of command : President Trump puts himself out front daily in televised briefings , making himself the prime authority . He \u2019 s backed by a White House Coronavirus Task Force that has many coordinators , including Vice President Mike Pence , Dr. Deborah Birx , and various Cabinet members and other presidential advisers who handle different aspects of the response .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner also has a hand in the task force , and caused a flap recently when he scolded states for not building up their own stockpiles of supplies . The Strategic National Stockpile , he said , is \u201c supposed to be our stockpile \u2013 it \u2019 s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use. \u201d The Department of Health and Human Services soon changed its website to reflect his comments , adding more tension with states .\nWhen asked about logistics , the president used to point to the director of FEMA , Pete Gaynor . But more recently , it \u2019 s been Rear Adm. John Polowczyk , the supply chain task force lead at FEMA , and Adm. Brett Giroir , the coronavirus \u201c testing czar . \u201d\nEven amid a national crisis , Mr. Trump has continued his rampage against inspectors general , who are meant to be a semi-independent check on federal government activities . Last week , he fired the inspector general of the intelligence community , fallout from his agitation over impeachment . On Tuesday , he fired the inspector general meant to oversee the group charged with monitoring the coronavirus relief fund . The day before , at his briefing , he attacked the acting inspector general of HHS , who had released a report about hospitals facing severe shortages of equipment needed to fight the pandemic .\nVeterans of past disasters point to the need for an overarching \u201c czar \u201d \u2013 such as a high-ranking military figure \u2013 who has the president \u2019 s full confidence and superior organizational skill .\nAdm.

His motto : Every crisis is an exercise in applied civics .\n\u201c Both gave me wide rein to figure out what the problem was , make recommendations to them , speak frankly to the American people , and be held accountable and be removed if I wasn \u2019 t doing the job , \u201d Admiral Allen says .\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has pressed Mr. Trump to appoint a top military figure to run the pandemic response , but so far to no avail .\nAdmiral Allen responds carefully when asked if he \u2019 d be willing to come out of retirement to lead the U.S. response on COVID-19 .\n\u201c Some of the basic tenets that allowed me to be successful may or may not exist in this current administration , \u201d the admiral says , noting specifically the ability to speak freely and honestly with the American people .
