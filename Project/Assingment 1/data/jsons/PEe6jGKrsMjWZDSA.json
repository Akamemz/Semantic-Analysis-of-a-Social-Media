This verdict should not depress Republicans because it does not mean Mitt Romney won\u2019t again do a stellar job. What it means is that because of the first debate, the landscape has changed and there are factors in play this time that are largely beyond his control.\n\n\n\nExpectations have been reset, if not entirely reversed, because of Mr. Romney\u2019s first debate victory. The first time, Mr. Romney benefitted from unrealistically low expectations \u2013- a product of Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign strategy of personal diminution and the press\u2019s readiness to echo it. That advantage is gone.\n\n\n\nGone too are the equally unrealistically high expectations that previously prevailed for Mr. Obama. It is now all too clear that he is not the Democratic Demosthenes advertised. Of course, no one could have been, but Mr. Obama paid a price for it. This time he won\u2019t have to because expectations for his performance have been lowered. Most people expect another Romney win.\n\n\n\nExpectations are important, especially in the subjective world of politics. There are no objective standards when it comes to political debates \u2014 no rules or standards that produce a clear winner and loser out of each contest. The outcome is what we make of it, measured against the expectations we bring to them.\n\nMr. Romney\u2019s first debate triumph was built on the fact that he vastly exceeded, while Obama greatly fell below, the public\u2019s pre-debate expectations. The combined separation was unmistakably large and so the verdict on the debate was unquestionably clear. The outcome this time will be far murkier. Expectations are more realistic this time.\n\n\n\nIt will be very hard for Mr. Romney to improve from his first debate performance. He did all the right things then. While it is certainly possible that he could do them better, it won\u2019t be easy. One of the hardest things there is to do is exactly the same thing twice.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama will certainly improve his performance. As Vice President Joseph R. Biden showed in the vice presidential debate, whatever else the Democrats are determined to be going forward, they are not going to be disengaged or dispassionate again. Such an approach will at least appeal to Mr. Obama\u2019s base. While that may seem a small thing, it was something Mr. Obama failed to do the first time around.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic base will not let their guard down again. After the first debate, they, along with the media, let their disappointment rule them. They were shocked and unguarded enough to say so. They turned on Mr. Obama, his campaign, and even Jim Lehrer. Maybe they felt they had no choice, but this time they will feel they have no choice but to not do so. After the first debate fallout, they now know they are playing for keeps this time. Mr. Romney\u2019s first debate win has been a huge boost when he desperately needed it. Another Romney boost could prove electorally fatal to Democrats so close to the election.\n\n\n\nThis time the president\u2019s base will not allow themselves the luxury of venting their frustration with Mr. Obama\u2019s performance \u2013- regardless of what it turns out to be. By showing such restraint, they can at least assure that there will not be a clear-cut consensus as to who won this debate \u2013- the very consensus that has continued to propel Mr. Romney since that first debate.\n\n\n\nThe final reason that this debate is likely to be judged a tie on the day after is that Mr. Romney does not have to win.
