    "content": "( CNN ) Michael Cohen on Wednesday provided the House Intelligence Committee with new documents showing edits to the false written statement he delivered to Congress in 2017 about the Trump Organization 's pursuit of the Trump Tower Moscow project into the 2016 campaign season , according to multiple sources familiar with the matter .\nThe documents Cohen provided are intended to further explain his public testimony last week , in which Cohen said that President Donald Trump 's then-personal lawyer Jay Sekulow made changes to his statement to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees , and that it was reviewed ahead of time by lawyers like Abbe Lowell , an attorney for Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner , the President 's daughter and son-in-law who are both White House advisers .\nIt 's unclear what Cohen 's documents show was specifically changed in the statement . Cohen testified Wednesday behind closed doors at the House Intelligence Committee .\n`` There were changes made , additions -- Jay Sekulow , for one , '' Cohen said last week . `` There were several changes that were made including how we were going to handle that message , which was -- the message of course being -- the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive . ''\nSekulow pushed back on Cohen 's allegations in a statement last week , saying that the `` testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the President edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false . ''\nAs CNN previously reported , according to two of the sources familiar with the preparation , including one close to the Trump Organization and one close to the President 's legal team , the lawyers had no indication that any of the information in the testimony of Trump 's now-former longtime attorney and fixer was inaccurate .\nLanny Davis , Cohen 's attorney , told CNN that Cohen himself authored the false line in his 2017 testimony to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project timeline .\nCohen wrote the initial draft of the testimony himself and then his attorney Stephen Ryan edited it , sharing it with other attorneys who were part of the joint defense agreement , to review for accuracy and potential privilege issues and those attorneys provided some suggested changes , a source familiar with the drafting of Cohen 's testimony said . Cohen and his attorney approved all changes , according to the source .\nThe source said the claim that the Trump Tower Moscow deal was over in January was in the draft from Cohen 's initial writing and remained . That timeline was consistent with documents that had been seen by the attorneys .\nCohen pleaded guilty late last year to lying to Congress on three different issues , according to Justice Department court filings : the project 's timeline and his discussions about it with Trump , that Cohen never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project , and that Cohen did not recall any Russian government response .\nCohen also accused Trump in his public testimony of encouraging him to lie about the Trump Tower Moscow discussions , though he said Trump did not tell him to do so directly .\n`` He does n't tell you what he wants . What he does is again , 'Michael , there 's no Russia , there 's no collusion , there 's no involvement , there 's no interference . ' I know what he means because I 've been around him for so long , '' Cohen testified . `` That 's the message that he wanted to reinforce . ''\nCohen was supposed to report to prison Wednesday to begin serving a three-year sentence for tax crimes , tax evasion and lying to Congress . Instead , Trump 's former lawyer was on Capitol Hill talking about the crimes he is now accusing Trump of committing .\nCohen , who is now slated to begin his prison term on May 6 , was back on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a final eight-hour session \u2014 his fourth appearance in the last nine days \u2014 concluding his closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that began last week . He spent roughly 30 hours in total with three different congressional committees .\n`` It 's been a long day , it 's been a long couple of days but again I believe they are happy , '' Cohen said as he left the committee 's spaces . `` I have given them my assurance that any additional information that they need I 'm here to cooperate and will continue to cooperate . ''\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff would n't discuss Cohen 's testimony , but acknowledged the panel had received new documents and said they expected further cooperation from Cohen .\n`` Mr. Cohen cooperated fully with the Committee , answered every question we asked of him during both interview sessions , and provided important testimony and materials relevant to the core of our probe and that will allow us to advance our investigation substantially , '' Schiff said . `` We look forward to his continued cooperation with Congress and law enforcement . ''\nIn the first round of testimony last week , Cohen was asked about a range of topics , with lawmakers seeking additional details on the drafting of Cohen 's statement as well as any discussions about a possible pardon . The session also included some of the partisan fighting that plagued the committee during its Russia investigation in the last Congress , according to sources familiar with his testimony .\nRepublicans on the committee objected to what they felt were untoward Democratic tactics in the run-up to the interview , noting that Democratic committee staff met with Cohen several times before the hearing without telling the Republicans , according to the sources . They also asked Cohen about his comments in last week 's public hearing that he had discussed `` topics '' with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff before the hearing , the sources said .\nRep. Mike Turner , an Ohio Republican , sent Cohen 's attorney a letter on Thursday asking for details about his contact with Schiff and his committee staff , suggesting the staff may have `` coached '' Cohen .\nPatrick Boland , a spokesman for Schiff , said that the committee was running `` a professional investigation in search of the facts , and we welcome the opportunity to meet with potential witnesses in advance of any testimony to determine relevant topics to cover in order to make productive use of their time before the committee . ''\n`` Despite this professed outrage by Republicans , it 's completely appropriate to conduct proffer sessions and allow witnesses to review their prior testimony before the Committee interviews them \u2014 such sessions are a routine part of every serious investigation around the country , including congressional investigations , '' Boland said .\nConsultation with witnesses ahead of a hearing or interview is n't necessarily out of the ordinary .
