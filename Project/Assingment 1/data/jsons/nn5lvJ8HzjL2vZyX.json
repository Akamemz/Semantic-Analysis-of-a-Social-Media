    "content": "It was a pattern of behavior ; it included an alleged violent assault ; the women involved had far more credible evidence than many of the most notorious accusations that have come to light in the past five weeks . But Clinton was not left to the swift and pitiless justice that today \u2019 s accused men have experienced . Rather , he was rescued by a surprising force : machine feminism . The movement had by then ossified into a partisan operation , and it was willing\u2014eager\u2014to let this friend of the sisterhood enjoy a little droit de seigneur .\nThe notorious 1998 New York Times op-ed by Gloria Steinem must surely stand as one of the most regretted public actions of her life . It slut-shamed , victim-blamed , and age-shamed ; it urged compassion for and gratitude to the man the women accused . Moreover ( never write an op-ed in a hurry ; you \u2019 ll accidentally say what you really believe ) , it characterized contemporary feminism as a weaponized auxiliary of the Democratic Party .\nCalled \u201c Feminists and the Clinton Question , \u201d it was written in March of 1998 , when Paula Jones \u2019 s harassment claim was working its way through court . It was printed seven days after Kathleen Willey \u2019 s blockbuster 60 Minutes interview with Ed Bradley . If all the various allegations were true , wrote Steinem , Bill Clinton was \u201c a candidate for sex addiction therapy. \u201d To her mind , the most \u201c credible \u201d accusations were those of Willey , who she noted was \u201c old enough to be Monica Lewinsky \u2019 s mother. \u201d And then she wrote the fatal sentences that invalidated the new understanding of workplace sexual harassment as a moral and legal wrong : \u201c Even if the allegations are true , the President is not guilty of sexual harassment . He is accused of having made a gross , dumb , and reckless pass at a supporter during a low point in her life . She pushed him away , she said , and it never happened again . In other words , President Clinton took \u2018 no \u2019 for an answer . \u201d\nSteinem said the same was true of Paula Jones . These were not crimes ; they were \u201c passes. \u201d Steinem revealed herself as a combination John and Bobby Kennedy of the feminist movement : the fair-haired girl and the bare-knuckle fixer . The widespread liberal response to the sex-crime accusations against Bill Clinton found their natural consequence 20 years later in the behavior of Harvey Weinstein : Stay loudly and publicly and extravagantly on the side of signal leftist causes and you can do what you want in the privacy of your offices and hotel rooms . But the mood of the country has changed . We are in a time when old monuments are coming down and men are losing their careers over things they did to women a long time ago .\nWhen more than a dozen women stepped forward and accused Leon Wieseltier of a serial and decades-long pattern of workplace sexual harassment , he said , \u201c I will not waste this reckoning. \u201d It was textbook Wieseltier : the insincere promise and the perfectly chosen word . The Democratic Party needs to make its own reckoning of the way it protected Bill Clinton . The party needs to come to terms with the fact that it was so enraptured by their brilliant , Big Dog president and his stunning string of progressive accomplishments that it abandoned some of its central principles . The party was on the wrong side of history , and there are consequences for that . Yet expedience is not the only reason to make this public accounting . If it is possible for politics and moral behavior to coexist , then this grave wrong needs to be acknowledged . If Weinstein and Mark Halperin and Louis C.
