    "content": "When the NFL announced in May that it would require all players on the field to stand during the national anthem or potentially face team fines , the league sought to finally end backlash to the kneeling protests against racial injustice that dominated coverage for the past two seasons . Now the NFL will put the anthem rule on hold after a fresh round of criticism this week .\nThe controversy began Thursday when the Associated Press reported that the Miami Dolphins had created a team anthem policy to suspend or fine players for kneeling . According to the AP , a leaked copy of team discipline rules included a brief , one-sentence section on \u201c Proper Anthem Conduct. \u201d The document classifies the kneeling protests under a larger list of \u201c conduct detrimental to the club \u201d that could lead to suspension , a fine , or both . Other violations on the list include \u201c drug use or possession , gambling , breaking curfew and riding motorcycles as a driver or passenger . \u201d\nThe leaked document , part of routine paperwork that teams submit to the NFL prior to the start of preseason training camps , was the first time that a team had indicated how it would enact the league \u2019 s new national anthem policy . In May , all but two of the owners of the NFL \u2019 s 32 teams voted to require all players on the field to stand for the national anthem . Those who did not would have to remain in the locker room . Players on the field who kneeled would potentially face fines or suspension depending on their team \u2019 s rules .\nThe Dolphins \u2019 management said the leaked document was not a finalized copy of team rules , adding that \u201c all options are still open \u201d when it comes to its individual anthem policy . Nonetheless , the documents quickly revived a debate that has only become more contentious since the league announced the policy . By Thursday evening , NFL leadership and the NFL Players Association , which recently filed a grievance against the league for implementing the policy without player input , announced the policy would be postponed as the groups attempted to work out a compromise .\n\u201c Our shared focus will remain on finding a solution to the anthem issue through mutual , good faith commitments , outside of litigation , \u201d the groups noted in a joint statement Thursday evening .\nThe Dolphins \u2019 controversy is just the latest in a wave of backlash against the NFL \u2019 s anthem protest policy , which has attracted heavy criticism from players as well as President Donald Trump , whose frequent criticism of kneeling players almost certainly played a role the policy \u2019 s creation . And it suggests that as the season approaches , the NFL \u2019 s efforts to tamp down on the kneeling protests have only pushed the matter further into the spotlight .\nThe NFL was blindsided by backlash to the anthem policy . It shouldn \u2019 t have been .\nWhen the NFL announced its new anthem policy in May , the intention was to finally end controversy over the protests . \u201c It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic , \u201d NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell noted in a statement . \u201c This is not and was never the case . \u201d\nThe protests began two years earlier in the summer of 2016 when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the national anthem at several preseason games to protest America \u2019 s treatment of people of color . Kaepernick later switched his protest to kneeling , and a number of other players joined his protest during the 2016 season . One year later , the protests continued , although with less participation than before . Throughout both seasons , players noted that they were kneeling to protest a range of injustices against people of color , including systemic racism , police violence , and inequality .\nBut backlash to the protests mounted last September when Trump called kneeling players \u201c sons of bitches \u201d who should be fired . Trump has repeatedly framed the protests as being about patriotism rather than racial injustice , arguing that kneeling protesters did not respect America or the flag .\nAt first , the league reacted defiantly to Trump \u2019 s comments , with several owners briefly joining their players in the protest . But as the season closed , and a small number of players continued to protest , it was clear that the NFL was looking for ways to make the issue go away completely .\nThe anthem policy was promoted as the solution , requiring players on the field to stand during the anthem but allowing them to remain in the locker room if they wished . Instead , the supposed compromise only attracted more criticism , with players noting that the policy once again misconstrued the purpose of the protests by suggesting that the players \u2019 actions were in opposition to the anthem and the flag . Others criticized the NFL for making the decision without their input .\nWhile the NFL announced the policy and hoped to quickly move on , that was always unlikely to happen . On July 18 , Tennessee Titans player Jurrell Casey said that he planned to continue the protest in spite of potential fines , suggesting that the league would be forced to penalize players . And as other teams submitted their policies for the season , it was likely that more teams would catch heat for adding new rules about the anthem .\nBut even if those things hadn \u2019 t happened , the NFL anthem policy would have continued to be news . That \u2019 s because President Trump , whose criticism largely served as the main catalyst for the anthem policy , openly hates it .\nThe NFL anthem policy was intended to appease President Trump . That didn \u2019 t happen .\nDuring his time in office , President Trump has proved remarkably adept at taking racial issues and turning them into full-blown culture wars . The NFL protests were no exception , with the president regularly raising the issue to rile up his supporters .\nAnd while he briefly praised the anthem rule , telling Fox News in May that \u201c the NFL owners did the right thing , \u201d it wasn \u2019 t long before he had settled on a new line of attack against the NFL .\nIt began in June , when Trump reignited the issue by disinviting the Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles from the White House , claiming that the team \u201c disagreed with their president because he insists that they proudly stand for the national anthem. \u201d The Eagles never kneeled during the 2017 season . Trump would criticize the NFL again later that month , saying that he didn \u2019 t think players were protesting \u201c a real issue . \u201d\nIn the weeks since , Trump \u2014 who reportedly told Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones that attacking the protests was a \u201c winning \u201d issue \u2014 continues to criticize the new anthem policy at rallies .
