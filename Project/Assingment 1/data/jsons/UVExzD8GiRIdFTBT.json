That task force , the Protecting American Communities Task Force ( PACT ) , has been tasked not only to assess civil unrest but also to \u201c surge \u201d resources to protect against it .\nThe Portland arrest of Mark Pettibone , first reported by Oregon Public Broadcasting , followed several similar arrests involving officers from a Border Patrol Tactical Unit ( BORTAC ) \u2014CBP \u2019 s equivalent of a SWAT team\u2014as well as the US Marshals Special Operations Group . A CBP spokesman confirmed to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that CBP agents were responsible for the arrest , pointing to authorities under the Protecting American Communities Task Force .\n\u201c Violent anarchists have organized events in Portland over the last several weeks with willful intent to damage and destroy federal property , as well as injure federal officers and agents , \u201d said the CBP spokesman . \u201c These criminal actions will not be tolerated. \u201d Secret Police Trump Unleashes His Secret Police in Portland Jeet Heer\nThe talking points memo identifies a series of potential questions , including many of those being asked in response to the Portland arrests .

Even though he claims we should not be in pandemic lockdown , he refuses to lift the emergency declaration because this gives these agencies more authority . All of this is legal because of vague and broad authorities given to these agencies after 9/11 . \u201d\nCorrection : A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the deployment of a predator drone by Customs and Border Protection over the Minneapolis protests in May was the first time a CBP drone has been deployed in response to domestic protests . The CBP also deployed drones over protests at Standing Rock between 2016 and 2017 .",
