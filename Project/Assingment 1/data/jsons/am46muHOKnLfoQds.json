While he and Rivera were state legislators , they paid way too much for it in 2005 , only to see foreclosure proceedings embarrassingly initiated against them during Rubio \u2019 s 2010 Senate race . At another point , a tropical storm flooded the entire neighborhood so badly that neighbors used canoes to get around .\nNow , the three-bedroom property stands as a stubborn symbol of both a politically problematic friendship and lingering questions about Rubio \u2019 s personal finances , which dogged him on the campaign trail in 2010 and may do so again . The friendship has frayed in recent years , friends say , as the fortunes of Rubio , 43 , and Rivera , 49 , have diverged . Last week , they put the 1,228-square-foot house up for sale . The list price is $ 125,000 \u2014 $ 10,000 less than what the two men paid for it a decade ago .\nBut chances are the home won \u2019 t sell before April , when Rubio says he \u2019 ll decide whether to seek the presidency . Rubio \u2019 s critics are waiting to make hay of any revelations that may come of the federal investigation of Rivera and to point to their status as roommates during the years when Rivera allegedly engaged in illegal campaign activities .\n\u201c This will be an issue , \u201d declared Craig Smith , a top adviser for the Ready for Hillary super PAC , echoing the views of many supporters and detractors alike . \u201c When you run for president , voters and the press have an insatiable appetite for people \u2019 s histories , what they \u2019 ve done , who they are . \u2026 It raises questions about his judgment , about the kind of people he would bring with him into government , into a campaign . \u201d\nRubio declined to comment for this story or about his relationship with Rivera , with whom he bought the Tallahassee home for lodging when the two up-and-coming legislators served together in the Florida House . A Rubio spokesman and Rivera both denied that the sale of the house had any political motivations . The home \u2019 s tenant since 2010 recently moved out , and they \u2019 ve been trying to sell the house , unsuccessfully , for years .\nAsked about the status of Rubio \u2019 s relationship with Rivera , which dates to 1992 , when both men worked for the congressional campaign of Lincoln Diaz-Balart , spokesman Alex Burgos said in a written statement : \u201c David Rivera is an old friend of Senator Rubio \u2019 s . His hope is that Mr. Rivera can put his recent troubles behind him and go on with his life . \u201d\nBut interviews with more than a dozen friends and political insiders who have known the two for years suggest that the story is more complicated , and that Rubio is stuck between his sense of loyalty to his friend and his need to move on with his life and political career . Three people close to Rubio say he has referred to Rivera on multiple occasions as \u201c Nixonian . \u201d\nAnd yet others describe a brotherly closeness that became strained only as Rivera weathered state and federal investigations into his finances , a related state ethics case that recently resulted in a proposed $ 58,000 fine , and the more serious campaign-finance scandal that erupted in 2012 . At the time , Rubio and Rivera shared a rental home in Washington for the two years they both served in Congress .\n\u201c Marco wants little to do with David , and you can \u2019 t blame him \u2014 who would want that guy by their side as they \u2019 re running for president ? \u201d said Ana Alliegro , Rivera \u2019 s former girlfriend , who pleaded guilty last year to campaign-finance violations and making false statements in the most recent federal case involving Rivera . She recently gave grand-jury testimony against Rivera .\nThree people close to Marco Rubio say he has referred to David Rivera , right , on multiple occasions as \u201c Nixonian. \u201d | AP Photo\nAlliegro confirmed she told prosecutors that Rivera was the source of about $ 81,000 in unreported cash that was used to fund the 2012 campaign of a political unknown who was running in the Democratic primary against Joe Garcia , a formidable contender preparing to square off against the Republican Rivera in the general election . Garcia prevailed against the candidate to whom Rivera allegedly funneled the money , Justin Sternad , who later pleaded guilty to federal charges of breaking campaign finance laws and filing false campaign reports .\nThat November , Garcia beat Rivera . Days before the election , Rubio recorded a robocall touting Rivera . Rubio also , however , made similar calls for other Republican candidates .\nIn open court and at the urging of a judge , a federal prosecutor has twice labeled Rivera as an alleged criminal conspirator in the case . But Rivera doesn \u2019 t just deny wrongdoing \u2014 he claims he \u2019 s not the subject of a probe .\n\u201c As I \u2019 ve said repeatedly , no federal agency has ever said I am under investigation and no \u2018 former girlfriend \u2019 has ever testified against me . That would be impossible since I have never been a defendant to be testified against , \u201d Rivera said via email . \u201c Please send me this alleged \u2018 announcement \u2019 by the federal government that I \u2019 m under federal investigation and please identify the agency that announced it , \u201d he wrote . \u201c Neither exist . \u201d\nRivera also disputed the notion that his relationship with Rubio has changed . He said the two spoke \u201c recently \u201d by phone .\nIf the two still talk , it doesn \u2019 t surprise former state Rep. J.C. Planas , a Miami Republican who served with the two in the state House . Planas said Rubio was loyal to a fault and that it could prove costly in 2016 .\n\u201c David Rivera reminds me of the villain Iago in \u2018 Othello \u2019 \u2014 and Marco \u2019 s political career is Desdemona , \u201d Planas said . \u201c Marco has stood by David , and it \u2019 s just baffling to me . I \u2019 ve never understood their relationship . \u201d\nRubio owes a measure of his early success in politics to Rivera . Rivera advised and stumped for Rubio in his first campaign for the state House in 2000 . Once elected , Rubio repaid the favor and helped Rivera win a state House seat in 2002 . The following year , Rivera was instrumental in helping Rubio collect pledge cards from fellow Republicans to eventually become the first Cuban-American speaker of the Florida House . A relentless political operative , Rivera popped up in seemingly every corner of the state throughout the year to pressure , cajole and win over GOP House members to support Rubio for speaker .\nAs the two climbed the rungs of power together in the Florida House , they decided to buy the home at 1484 Bent Willow Drive in the Timber Lakes subdivision for $ 135,000 . The March 2 , 2005 , deed was executed about a week before the 60-day lawmaking session began that year . When Rubio was formally voted speaker , he was nominated by Rivera , who served as chairman of the Florida House Rules Committee during Rubio \u2019 s speakership in 2007 and 2008 . The post gave Rivera life-and-death power over much of the legislation in the House .\nAffable , intense and intelligent , Rivera was often a source of mystery to his colleagues in the part-time Florida Legislature . Year after year , his financial disclosure forms claimed income from the U.S. Agency for International Development . But years later , The Miami Herald reported that USAID had no record that he ever worked with the agency .\nAsked what the former lawmaker was up to these days , a close ally of both men summed up the prevailing sentiment about Rivera : \u201c I don \u2019 t know . And I don \u2019 t ask . I don \u2019 t want to know . \u201d\n\u201c I always thought he worked for the CIA , \u201d said Miami-Dade County Commissioner Esteban \u201c Steve \u201d Bovo , who served with Rivera and Rubio in the House and whose wife , Viviana , is a Rubio aide .\nIn Rivera \u2019 s ethics case , investigators with the Florida Commission on Ethics and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement testified before an administrative law judge at a hearing that records showed Rivera was essentially living off political committee funds and failing to disclose the money as income . Rivera also arranged a contract worth $ 1 million between a Miami dog track and a company owned by his mother to lead a 2008 election campaign to legalize slot machine gambling in Miami-Dade County . Rivera later acknowledged accepting at least $ 132,000 as part of the arrangement . But he didn \u2019 t list the money on his state financial disclosure forms .",
