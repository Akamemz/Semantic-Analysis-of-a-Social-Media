    "content": "Democrats say meaningful action in the wake of the school shootings in Connecticut must include a ban on military-style assault weapons and a look at how the nation deals with individuals suffering from serious mental illness .\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers and Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman said it was time to take a deeper look into the recent spate of mass shootings and what can be done to prevent them . Gun control was a hot topic in the early 1990s , when Congress enacted a 10-year ban on assault weapons . But since that ban expired in 2004 , few Americans have wanted stricter laws and politicians say they do n't want to become targets of a powerful gun-rights lobby .\nGun-rights advocates said that might all change after the latest shooting that killed 20 children aged 6 or 7 . Police say the gunman , Adam Lanza , was carrying an arsenal of ammunition and used a high-powered rifle similar to the military 's M-16 .\nOn Monday , Sen. Joe Manchin , a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association , said it was time to discuss gun policy and move toward action on gun regulation . The conservative West Virginia Democrat said Monday he agrees with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who has advocated banning the sale of assault weapons .\nManchin is the most prominent gun rights advocate to speak after the shooting , telling MSNBC that he is a `` proud outdoorsman and hunter , but this does n't make sense . ''\nAt a Sunday night service in Newtown , Conn. , the site of Friday 's massacre , President Barack Obama did not specifically address gun control . But he vowed , `` In the coming weeks I 'll use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens , from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this . ''\nHe added : `` Are we really prepared to say that we 're powerless in the face of such carnage , that the politics are too hard ? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom ? ''\nSen. Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , said the nation `` could be at a tipping point ... a tipping point where we might actually get something done '' on gun control . He and other Democrats , as well as Lieberman , said they want to ban the sale of new assault weapons and make it harder for mentally ill individuals to obtain weapons . Lieberman said a new commission should be created to look at gun laws and the mental health system , as well as violence in movies and video games .\n`` Assault weapons were developed for the U.S. military , not commercial gun manufacturers , '' Lieberman said before the Newtown vigil Sunday night .\n`` This is a moment to start a very serious national conversation about violence in our society , particularly about these acts of mass violence , '' said the Connecticut senator , who is retiring at the end of the year .\nSen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , said she will introduce legislation next year to ban new assault weapons , as well as big clips , drums and strips of more than 10 bullets .\n`` It can be done , '' Feinstein told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' of reinstating the ban despite deep opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association and similar groups .\nBloomberg said Obama could use executive powers to enforce existing gun laws , as well as throw his weight behind legislation like Feinstein 's .\n`` It 's time for the president , I think , to stand up and lead and tell this country what we should do \u2014 not go to Congress and say , 'What do you guys want to do ? ' '' Bloomberg said . ''\nGun-rights activists had remained largely quiet on the issue since Friday 's shooting , all but one declining to appear on the Sunday talk shows .\nDavid Gregory , the host of `` Meet the Press , '' said NBC invited all 31 `` pro-gun '' senators to appear on Sunday 's show , and all 31 declined . All eight Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee were unavailable or unwilling to appear on CBS ' `` Face the Nation , '' host Bob Schieffer said .\nRep. Louie Gohmert , R-Texas , was the sole representative of gun rights ' activists on the various Sunday talk shows . In an interview on `` Fox News Sunday , '' Gohmert defended the sale of assault weapons and said that the principal at Sandy Hook Elementary School , who authorities say died trying to overtake the shooter , should herself have been armed .\n`` I wish to God she had had an M-4 in her office , locked up so when she heard gunfire , she pulls it out and she did n't have to lunge heroically with nothing in her hands . But she takes him ( the shooter ) out , takes his head off before he can kill those precious kids , '' Gohmert said .\nGohmert also argued that violence is lower in cities with lax gun laws , and higher in cities with stricter laws .\n`` The facts are that every time guns have been allowed \u2014 conceal-carry ( gun laws ) have been allowed \u2014 the crime rate has gone down , '' Gohmert said .\nGun-control advocates say that is n't true . A study by the California-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence determined that 7 of the 10 states with the strongest gun laws \u2014 including Connecticut , Massachusetts and California \u2014 are also among the 10 states with the lowest gun death rates .\n`` If you look at the states with the strongest gun laws in the country , they have some of the lowest gun death rates , and some of the states with the weakest gun laws have some of the highest gun death rates , '' said Brian Malte of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence .",
