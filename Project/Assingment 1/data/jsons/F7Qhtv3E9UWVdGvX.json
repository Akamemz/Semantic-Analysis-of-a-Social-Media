If Latinos turn out to vote they could be key in November\nDonald Trump \u2019 s rise is spurring a backlash from Latino communities across America that has the potential to prove a formidable barrier to the billionaire \u2019 s success in the November presidential election .\nFrom Florida to Nevada , Arizona to Iowa , and countless other states beyond , there is evidence that the sleeping giant of the Latino vote is stirring . Trump \u2019 s favorability ratings with Hispanic voters are running at historic lows , while he faces an increasingly well-organized nationwide campaign to oppose him .\nA Guardian exploration of three key swing states and survey of national Hispanic outreach groups has found that the presumptive Republican nominee faces an uphill struggle to repair the damage caused by his threats to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and build a wall with Mexico .\nA poll of Hispanic Americans carried out by Latino Decisions and America \u2019 s Voice in April found some 87 % of Latinos felt unfavorably towards him . Significantly , almost half said they felt more enthusiastic about voting in the presidential election than they did four years ago , and 41 % of those said it was because they wanted to \u201c stop Trump \u201d .\nIn Florida , groups report that new Hispanic voter registrations are running at 1,000 a week . ( Some 2.6 million Hispanics are eligible to vote in Florida for this year \u2019 s general election , and about 800,000 of them have not yet registered . )\nThat unprecedented number corresponds \u2013 not coincidentally , Latino organizers believe \u2013 with polls that show almost nine in 10 Latino Floridians view Trump unfavorably .\nIn Iowa , the Latino community has been virtually silent until this year . In 2012 only 1,000 Latinos participated in the Iowa presidential caucuses ; this year the number soared to 13,000 \u2013 about 25 % of all registered Hispanic voters .\n\u201c Clearly they were worried about the rhetoric , specifically of Trump . We could not have mobilized the community anything like as effectively without him , \u201d said Joe Henry of the League of United Latin American Citizens .\nIn Nevada , a state where almost one in five of the 1.9 million eligible voters are Latino , an aggressive push to mobilize the community has started to bear fruit among some 362,000 Latinos who are still unregistered for the November ballot .\nEven in Arizona , which has voted Democratic only once in a presidential race in the past 60 years , Hispanic activists hope to bring the state into play by registering up to 75,000 first-time voters . They have already expanded by 125,000 since 2010 , to a total of 536,003 registered Hispanic voters ( 14.4 % of the overall voter pool ) .\n\u201c There is something new going on , something unique in the immigrant community , \u201d said Luis Guti\u00e9rrez , a US Congress representative for parts of Chicago . \u201c And it has something to do with the tenor and tone of the presidential race . \u201d\nTo what extent Hispanic Americans will be motivated to vote by Trump \u2019 s anti-immigrant remarks is one of the great unknowns of 2016 . The Latino population continues to grow at a faster pace than any other demographic , from 19.5 million eligible Latino voters in 2008 to 23.3 million in 2012 , with 27.3 million projected by November . That would amount to some 12 % of the nation \u2019 s electorate in 2016 .\nYet the proportion who actually cast their ballot has remained stubbornly low . In 2012 it was only 48 % , much lower than the figures for African Americans ( 66 % ) and whites ( 64 % ) .\n\u201c The Latino vote can not be taken for granted , even with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee , \u201d said Sylvia Manzano , a principal of the political consulting firm Latino Decisions . \u201c Telling Latino voters that Trump is hostile to you is one thing \u2013 getting them to the polling stations another . \u201d\nAgainst that backdrop of such unflexed political muscle , there are signs that 2016 may see a larger turnout . Mi Familia Vota , a not-for-profit group devoted to encouraging Hispanic participation , has reported a surge in interest in voter registration . In the first four months of this year it helped 18,450 Latinos to get on the voter rolls in six states \u2013 Arizona , California , Colorado , Florida , Nevada and Texas .\nThree of those states , Florida , Colorado and Nevada , are likely to be among the handful of battlegrounds where the outcome of the fight for the White House will be decided . Small but increasingly well-organized Latino populations in North Carolina and Virginia could also prove significant .\nOutreach groups have been busily encouraging the 8.8 million Hispanic immigrants who are legal US residents to take up citizenship as the first step towards voting . Nationally , average requests for citizenship reached 65,000 every month in the five months up to January , with half the applicants being Latino . That \u2019 s a modest 15 % increase on the same period in the previous year .\nNon-partisan groups working to increase Hispanic political participation hope to boost that number as the presidential election looms , largely on the back of Trump \u2019 s attacks . In a normal year , some 650,000 green card holders are granted citizenship ; this year the groups \u2019 goal is one million , although with the election now six months away it is not certain how many of those the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) would be able to process in time for them to secure a vote by November .\nRoc\u00edo S\u00e1enz of the Service Employees International Union , which is part of a coalition that has helped 12,781 Latinos apply for citizenship in more than 300 \u201c naturalization workshops \u201d around the country , detects a new intensity : \u201c There is a sense of urgency as a result of the hateful rhetoric about mass deportations , building walls , calling us criminals \u2013 this is personal for us . \u201d\nGuardian reporters in three key states sought to answer the increasingly critical question : is 2016 the year the sleeping giant of the Hispanic vote wakes up ?\nIt \u2019 s impossible to overstate the importance of Florida : it has ( officially at least ) sided with the winning presidential candidate in every election since 1996 . All of the contests have been close , with Obama taking the state in both his presidential runs by fewer than three percentage points .\nThat paper-thin margin is vastly overshadowed by the potential of the Floridian Hispanic population \u2013 24 % of the total today , up from 17 % in 2000 . At the same time , the political affiliation of Latinos in the state has been drifting steadily towards the Democratic party , largely as a result of the influx of left-leaning Puerto Ricans to central Florida .\nWhen you add in the Trump effect , the billionaire \u2019 s prospects appear particularly bleak in Florida where recent polls indicate that close to 90 % of Hispanic voters view him unfavorably .\nLatinos are registering to vote in \u201c unprecedented \u201d numbers to oppose him , advocacy groups say .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of Latinos who are very angry with Trump , \u201d said Vivian Rodriguez , president of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida . \u201c That \u2019 s created a wave of Latinos who want to get citizenship and get things going to vote in this election cycle . \u201d\nThe most recent figures from Florida \u2019 s division of elections showed that 1.8 million Hispanics registered to vote in February \u2019 s primaries , almost 150,000 more than the number who voted in the 2012 general election , when Obama carried the state with more than 60 % of the Hispanic vote .\nWith the number of Hispanics who registered for the Florida primary already so high , the figures suggest there may be an extraordinarily large turnout of Latinos for the general election in November . In 2012 , the increase in registered Hispanic voters after the primary was 110,000 . This year , the indications are it will be much greater .\nA record 2.6 million Hispanics are eligible to vote in Florida , an increase of half a million since 2012 boosted significantly by the mass influx of Puerto Rican US citizens , particularly around Kissimmee and Orlando , seeking to escape the worsening economic conditions in their homeland .\nThat leaves about 800,000 eligible Hispanic voters who have not yet registered and if the feedback being received by the many outreach groups in the state is accurate \u2013 the National Council of La Raza alone told \u2588\u2588\u2588 it was signing up new Hispanic voters at a rate of about 1,000 a week \u2013 not many of them are going to be supporting Donald Trump .\n\u201c Latinos are going to be voting in unprecedented numbers against the villains , the politicians who dehumanize immigrant families to score political points , \u201d said Maria Rodriguez , executive director of FLIC Votes ( Florida Immigrant Action Committee ) .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve already been seeing the trend of a new generation of younger Cuban Americans registering as Democrats . There \u2019 s going to be an exodus from the Republican party ; lots of Latino Republicans are going to switch to no party affiliation or the Democrats . \u201d\nOne of those is Luis-Carlos Fumero , a Miami-born Cuban who fits kitchens for his uncle \u2019 s condo renovation company and who fervently supported Mitt Romney \u2019 s unsuccessful 2012 campaign . This time he says he will not vote .\n\u201c I can not support this man , \u201d said Fumero , 25 , of Trump . \u201c This nonsense over the wall , not letting Muslims into America , what he says about Mexicans and about women , this man is loco . \u201d\nThe loss of support from Miami \u2019 s Cuban Americans could be a body blow to Trump \u2019 s hopes of carrying Florida in the general election . Historically a bulwark of Republican support , the influence of Florida \u2019 s Cuban voting bloc has already waned from 46 % of the state \u2019 s eligible Hispanic voters in 1990 to barely 30 % today , according to Pew research .\nNow there are clear signs that even that bloc might desert the Republican candidate , under the weight of Obama \u2019 s opening up of trade and travel with Cuba and with the rise of a younger generation of Cuban Americans who are less ideologically driven .\nIn February \u2019 s primary , the heavily Hispanic Miami-Dade was the only county in Florida that Trump lost , and although he led Hillary Clinton 41-29 among Miami \u2019 s Cuban Americans in a Bendixen and Amandi poll this month , his support level is still far below the 64 % Romney received from Cuban Americans statewide in 2012 .\nPerhaps more worryingly for Trump , Miami \u2019 s influential Republican Cuban American political leaders continue to speak out against him . House representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos Curbelo have said they can not vote for him , and Tom\u00e1s Regalado , the mayor of Miami and himself a Cuban exile , launched a searing attack on the presumptive nominee in the Miami Herald .\n\u201c He mistreats people , speaks derisively of people , \u201d Regalado said . \u201c A president \u2019 s biggest asset is the bully pulpit . This guy is capable of creating national and international chaos . \u201d\nKarina Ruiz de Diaz , president of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition , takes the long view . \u201c The Latino vote is still very young , \u201d she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We will reshape the state , it \u2019 s just going to take a little bit of time . \u201d\nArizona \u2019 s electorate is in the midst of rapid change . One in five eligible voters in the state are Hispanic , according to a recent analysis by the Pew Research Center . It estimates that 1.3 million Arizona Latinos will be eligible to vote in 2016 , up from 796,000 in 2008 .\nYoung Latinos make up a large share of the Hispanic electorate . Nearly twice as many Hispanic voters in Arizona are millennials , compared with their white counterparts , according to 2014 Pew data .\nArizona has historically been a conservative state . But the changing demographics and the prospective general election race between Trump and Clinton has activists and experts predicting that this will be the year Arizona Latinos realize their political force , and sweep Democrats in to power .\n\u201c It \u2019 s exciting for us in Arizona because we keep getting talked about as a purple state , as possibly a swing state , \u201d said Kate Gallego , the vice-mayor of Phoenix .\nThat would be astonishing . Since the second world war , Arizona has only once voted for the Democratic presidential candidate : Bill Clinton in 1996 . So could it happen ?\n\u201c Certainly John McCain thinks so , \u201d Gallego said , referring to comments recorded at a private fundraiser in which the long-serving Arizona senator said Trump could threaten his chances of being re-elected . \u201c If Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket , here in Arizona , with over 30 % of the vote being the Hispanic vote , no doubt that this may be the race of my life , \u201d McCain is reported to have said .\nYet even if record turnout were to turn the solidly red state blue , Arizona \u2019 s 11 electoral votes would probably be superfluous as the outcome is unlikely to shift the dynamics of the race .\nIf Trump is to be the motivation that finally unleashes the electoral power of Arizona \u2019 s Latinos , the achievement will not be his alone . He will also have to credit the assistance of two of his most ardent supporters : Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County , the self-styled \u201c toughest sheriff in America \u201d , and Jan Brewer , the former Arizona governor who signed into law one of the harshest state immigration measures in the country .\nIn 2010 , Arizona enacted Senate Bill 1070 , a draconian law aimed at driving out the state \u2019 s undocumented immigrants that pushed the state to the forefront of an acrimonious debate over border security and comprehensive immigration reform .\nYet instead of disappearing , the law drew many of the state \u2019 s undocumented immigrants out of the shadows . Latinos joined forces with business leaders , concerned about the economic impact of the law . Together , tens of thousands marched through the streets of downtown Phoenix in opposition .\n\u201c We have seen many Trumps in Arizona , \u201d said Ian Danley , a director with One Arizona , speaking after a meeting on voter suppression in Phoenix . \u201c We were birthed out of SB 1070 , which is a Trump-like policy . We weren \u2019 t prepared in 2010 . We \u2019 re prepared now . \u201d\nOne Arizona , a non-partisan network of Hispanic and immigrant groups working to increase Latino voter turnout in the state , has registered between 110,000 and 125,000 new voters since 2010 , and helped triple the number of Latinos enrolled in the state \u2019 s early voting system . Now the network has set itself the ambitious target of registering between 60,000 and 75,000 new voters by November .\nBecause volunteers are restricted from telling registrants who to vote for and the group doesn \u2019 t track registrants \u2019 party affiliation , it \u2019 s hard to assess \u201c the Trump effect \u201d . Anecdotally , several volunteers said it was not uncommon for registrants to ask which party Trump belonged to and then tick the opposite box .\n\u201c People are paying a lot of attention , \u201d said Raquel Ter\u00e1n , the state director for Mi Vota Familia , sipping vegan horchata at a coffee shop in downtown Phoenix .\nWhen Donald Trump came to Arizona in March , he held his rally in Fountain Hills , a predominantly white town in Maricopa County . He was joined by Brewer , the former governor , and introduced by Arpaio , the controversial sheriff who has cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in an ongoing racial profiling case that found his officers had targeted Latinos during raids and traffic stops .\n\u201c We had a little problem . Some demonstrators were trying to disrupt , \u201d Arpaio told the crowd , which began to boo and hiss . \u201c If they think they \u2019 re going to intimidate you and the next president of the United States , it \u2019 s not going to happen \u2013 not in this town ! \u201d\n\u201c I call that the hate and fear playbook , \u201d said Petra Falcon , a long-time Arizona activist and director of the rights group Promise Arizona . \u201c If you want to divide a country or a state , just take out that playbook and start talking about the harm immigrants do \u2013 they come here to take your jobs . They rob . He took that playbook from Arizona and is using it nationally . \u201d\nThe biggest challenge for Arizona \u2019 s Democrats remains voter turnout . There are approximately 170,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats in the state , according to the latest data from the secretary of state \u2019 s office .\nIn the primaries on 22 March , 55 % of Republicans cast ballots , compared with 49 % of Democrats . However , registered independents , who make up the largest share of Arizona voters but are not represented by a party , could not vote in either primary .\nAt an outlet mall in Tempe , Jos\u00e9 Barboza and Francis Sullivan of Promise Arizona took turns approaching shoppers and sales associates with their clipboards .\nJaritma Avilez told Barboza she was registered to vote and he moved on . But later Avilez admitted to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that even though she was registered , she didn \u2019 t plan on voting in November . \u201c I don \u2019 t feel like politics really affects my life , \u201d she shrugged .\n\u201c In November , the Latino community is going to come out in large numbers , \u201d Jocelyn Sida , a Nevada organizer for Mi Familia Vota , which works to increase Hispanic turnout , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c A lot of millennials like myself are getting involved in leadership roles to educate and engage the community , and it \u2019 s been very accepting . They \u2019 re not withdrawing , they \u2019 re not closing their doors to us . On the contrary they \u2019 re seeking us out to find ways to get involved . \u201d\nWith 17 % of Nevada \u2019 s electorate being Hispanic , the Latino vote certainly has the potential to deny Trump victory through strong turnout . In 2012 , 70 % of Nevada Latinos voted for Obama , helping him to win the state by a comfortable six-point margin .\n\u201c All the time Trump \u2019 s yelling about kicking people out the country . It \u2019 s horrible , \u201d said Rodulfo Martinez , 60 , a Las Vegas construction worker , expressing an anger felt by many . \u201c The way he insults us isn \u2019 t right . Many of the things he says about the [ border ] wall and why Latinos come here don \u2019 t make sense . \u201d\nA poll last month by Latino Decisions showed that immigration reform was the most pressing issue for Nevada Hispanics . The state has the country \u2019 s largest percentage of undocumented immigrants , many of whom count registered voters as friends and family .\n\u201c Est\u00e1 loco , \u201d said Vicky Legaspi , 36 , echoing Fumero in Miami . A restaurant owner on Las Vegas \u2019 s working-class east side , Legaspi nearly choked on a spoon of ice cream when asked if she would vote for the celebrity businessman . \u201c He just wants attention . He doesn \u2019 t care about this country . \u201d\nAna Hernandez , 34 , a housekeeper , said Trump was \u201c mean \u201d and \u201c has a bad heart \u201d and that she intended to vote for Clinton because \u201c first of all , she \u2019 s not a racist \u201d , setting a somewhat low bar .\nLatino participation in Nevada \u2019 s 2016 Democratic caucus showed a 5 % uptick over the 2008 contest , another encouraging sign for Clinton , who won the vote in both cycles . The primary season also saw Democrats build a 5 % lead in voter registration in Nevada , while an ongoing \u201c naturalization blitz \u201d organized by progressive groups has brought thousands of new minority voters into the fray .\nAt the start of this election season , Nevada had 362,000 potential new Latino voters , including 42,000 Hispanic youth who will come of voting age this cycle and 40,000 legal permanent residents eligible for citizenship , according to Mi Familia Vota .\n\u201c It \u2019 s amazing to hear from people who never had a reason to vote , or speaking of the citizenship workshops , people who have never had a reason to become citizens until now , \u201d said Laura Martin , associate director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada ( Plan ) , which promotes civic engagement . \u201c We focus on low-income communities of color , so we meet lots of people at the bus station , the welfare office , or outside the dollar store . They used to not care , but now they see Donald Trump and that \u2019 s scary to them . \u201d",

This time he says he will not vote.\n\n\u201cI cannot support this man,\u201d said Fumero, 25, of Trump. \u201cThis nonsense over the wall, not letting Muslims into America, what he says about Mexicans and about women, this man is loco.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Berta Sandes, 38, of Miami, an undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua, holds a sign which translates to \u2018Trump Equals Hate\u2019 at a protest in Doral, Florida.

Historically a bulwark of Republican support, the influence of Florida\u2019s Cuban voting bloc has already waned from 46% of the state\u2019s eligible Hispanic voters in 1990 to barely 30% today, according to Pew research.\n\nNow there are clear signs that even that bloc might desert the Republican candidate, under the weight of Obama\u2019s opening up of trade and travel with Cuba and with the rise of a younger generation of Cuban Americans who are less ideologically driven.\n\nIn February\u2019s primary, the heavily Hispanic Miami-Dade was the only county in Florida that Trump lost, and although he led Hillary Clinton 41-29 among Miami\u2019s Cuban Americans in a Bendixen and Amandi poll this month, his support level is still far below the 64% Romney received from Cuban Americans statewide in 2012.\n\nPerhaps more worryingly for Trump, Miami\u2019s influential Republican Cuban American political leaders continue to speak out against him. House representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos Curbelo have said they cannot vote for him, and Tom\u00e1s Regalado, the mayor of Miami and himself a Cuban exile, launched a searing attack on the presumptive nominee in the Miami Herald.\n\n\u201cHe mistreats people, speaks derisively of people,\u201d Regalado said. \u201cA president\u2019s biggest asset is the bully pulpit. This guy is capable of creating national and international chaos.\u201d\n\nArizona: \u2018We\u2019re prepared now\u2019\n\nKarina Ruiz de Diaz, president of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition, takes the long view. \u201cThe Latino vote is still very young,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWe will reshape the state, it\u2019s just going to take a little bit of time.\u201d\n\nArizona\u2019s electorate is in the midst of rapid change. One in five eligible voters in the state are Hispanic, according to a recent analysis by the Pew Research Center. It estimates that 1.3 million Arizona Latinos will be eligible to vote in 2016, up from 796,000 in 2008.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Karina Ruiz de Diaz, president of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition, at her office in Phoenix. Photograph: Lauren Gambino/The Guardian\n\nYoung Latinos make up a large share of the Hispanic electorate. Nearly twice as many Hispanic voters in Arizona are millennials, compared with their white counterparts, according to 2014 Pew data.\n\nArizona has historically been a conservative state. But the changing demographics and the prospective general election race between Trump and Clinton has activists and experts predicting that this will be the year Arizona Latinos realize their political force, and sweep Democrats in to power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting for us in Arizona because we keep getting talked about as a purple state, as possibly a swing state,\u201d said Kate Gallego, the vice-mayor of Phoenix.\n\nThat would be astonishing. Since the second world war, Arizona has only once voted for the Democratic presidential candidate: Bill Clinton in 1996. So could it happen?\n\n\u201cCertainly John McCain thinks so,\u201d Gallego said, referring to comments recorded at a private fundraiser in which the long-serving Arizona senator said Trump could threaten his chances of being re-elected. \u201cIf Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona, with over 30% of the vote being the Hispanic vote, no doubt that this may be the race of my life,\u201d McCain is reported to have said.\n\nYet even if record turnout were to turn the solidly red state blue, Arizona\u2019s 11 electoral votes would probably be superfluous as the outcome is unlikely to shift the dynamics of the race.\n\nIf Trump is to be the motivation that finally unleashes the electoral power of Arizona\u2019s Latinos, the achievement will not be his alone. He will also have to credit the assistance of two of his most ardent supporters: Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, the self-styled \u201ctoughest sheriff in America\u201d, and Jan Brewer, the former Arizona governor who signed into law one of the harshest state immigration measures in the country.\n\nIn 2010, Arizona enacted Senate Bill 1070, a draconian law aimed at driving out the state\u2019s undocumented immigrants that pushed the state to the forefront of an acrimonious debate over border security and comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nYet instead of disappearing, the law drew many of the state\u2019s undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. Latinos joined forces with business leaders, concerned about the economic impact of the law. Together, tens of thousands marched through the streets of downtown Phoenix in opposition.\n\n\u201cWe have seen many Trumps in Arizona,\u201d said Ian Danley, a director with One Arizona, speaking after a meeting on voter suppression in Phoenix. \u201cWe were birthed out of SB 1070, which is a Trump-like policy. We weren\u2019t prepared in 2010. We\u2019re prepared now.\u201d\n\nOne Arizona, a non-partisan network of Hispanic and immigrant groups working to increase Latino voter turnout in the state, has registered between 110,000 and 125,000 new voters since 2010, and helped triple the number of Latinos enrolled in the state\u2019s early voting system. Now the network has set itself the ambitious target of registering between 60,000 and 75,000 new voters by November.\n\nBecause volunteers are restricted from telling registrants who to vote for and the group doesn\u2019t track registrants\u2019 party affiliation, it\u2019s hard to assess \u201cthe Trump effect\u201d. Anecdotally, several volunteers said it was not uncommon for registrants to ask which party Trump belonged to and then tick the opposite box.\n\n\u201cPeople are paying a lot of attention,\u201d said Raquel Ter\u00e1n, the state director for Mi Vota Familia, sipping vegan horchata at a coffee shop in downtown Phoenix.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Promise Arizona office in downtown Phoenix is filled with posters and memorabilia from protests and rallies. Photograph: Lauren Gambino/The Guardian\n\nWhen Donald Trump came to Arizona in March, he held his rally in Fountain Hills, a predominantly white town in Maricopa County. He was joined by Brewer, the former governor, and introduced by Arpaio, the controversial sheriff who has cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in an ongoing racial profiling case that found his officers had targeted Latinos during raids and traffic stops.\n\n\u201cWe had a little problem. Some demonstrators were trying to disrupt,\u201d Arpaio told the crowd, which began to boo and hiss. \u201cIf they think they\u2019re going to intimidate you and the next president of the United States, it\u2019s not going to happen \u2013 not in this town!\u201d\n\n\u201cI call that the hate and fear playbook,\u201d said Petra Falcon, a long-time Arizona activist and director of the rights group Promise Arizona. \u201cIf you want to divide a country or a state, just take out that playbook and start talking about the harm immigrants do \u2013 they come here to take your jobs. They rob. He took that playbook from Arizona and is using it nationally.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge for Arizona\u2019s Democrats remains voter turnout. There are approximately 170,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats in the state, according to the latest data from the secretary of state\u2019s office.\n\nIn the primaries on 22 March, 55% of Republicans cast ballots, compared with 49% of Democrats. However, registered independents, who make up the largest share of Arizona voters but are not represented by a party, could not vote in either primary.\n\nAt an outlet mall in Tempe, Jos\u00e9 Barboza and Francis Sullivan of Promise Arizona took turns approaching shoppers and sales associates with their clipboards.\n\nJaritma Avilez told Barboza she was registered to vote and he moved on. But later Avilez admitted to the Guardian that even though she was registered, she didn\u2019t plan on voting in November. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like politics really affects my life,\u201d she shrugged.\n\nNevada: Trump has a \u2018bad heart\u2019\n\n\u201cIn November, the Latino community is going to come out in large numbers,\u201d Jocelyn Sida, a Nevada organizer for Mi Familia Vota, which works to increase Hispanic turnout, told the Guardian. \u201cA lot of millennials like myself are getting involved in leadership roles to educate and engage the community, and it\u2019s been very accepting. They\u2019re not withdrawing, they\u2019re not closing their doors to us. On the contrary they\u2019re seeking us out to find ways to get involved.\u201d\n\nWith 17% of Nevada\u2019s electorate being Hispanic, the Latino vote certainly has the potential to deny Trump victory through strong turnout. In 2012, 70% of Nevada Latinos voted for Obama, helping him to win the state by a comfortable six-point margin.\n\n\u201cAll the time Trump\u2019s yelling about kicking people out the country. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d said Rodulfo Martinez, 60, a Las Vegas construction worker, expressing an anger felt by many. \u201cThe way he insults us isn\u2019t right. Many of the things he says about the [border] wall and why Latinos come here don\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vicky Legaspi: \u2018 Est\u00e1 loco.\u2019 Photograph: Dan Hernandez\n\nA poll last month by Latino Decisions showed that immigration reform was the most pressing issue for Nevada Hispanics. The state has the country\u2019s largest percentage of undocumented immigrants, many of whom count registered voters as friends and family.\n\n\u201cEst\u00e1 loco,\u201d said Vicky Legaspi, 36, echoing Fumero in Miami. A restaurant owner on Las Vegas\u2019s working-class east side, Legaspi nearly choked on a spoon of ice cream when asked if she would vote for the celebrity businessman. \u201cHe just wants attention. He doesn\u2019t care about this country.\u201d\n\nAna Hernandez, 34, a housekeeper, said Trump was \u201cmean\u201d and \u201chas a bad heart\u201d and that she intended to vote for Clinton because \u201cfirst of all, she\u2019s not a racist\u201d, setting a somewhat low bar.\n\nLatino participation in Nevada\u2019s 2016 Democratic caucus showed a 5% uptick over the 2008 contest, another encouraging sign for Clinton, who won the vote in both cycles. The primary season also saw Democrats build a 5% lead in voter registration in Nevada, while an ongoing \u201cnaturalization blitz\u201d organized by progressive groups has brought thousands of new minority voters into the fray.\n\nAt the start of this election season, Nevada had 362,000 potential new Latino voters, including 42,000 Hispanic youth who will come of voting age this cycle and 40,000 legal permanent residents eligible for citizenship, according to Mi Familia Vota.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to hear from people who never had a reason to vote, or speaking of the citizenship workshops, people who have never had a reason to become citizens until now,\u201d said Laura Martin, associate director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada (Plan), which promotes civic engagement. \u201cWe focus on low-income communities of color, so we meet lots of people at the bus station, the welfare office, or outside the dollar store. They used to not care, but now they see Donald Trump and that\u2019s scary to them.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Mona Chalabi in New York",
