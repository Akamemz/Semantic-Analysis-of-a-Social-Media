Never mind that once in office he conducted a Russia policy far tougher than Obama \u2019 s .\nIt is the Democrats who routinely put the interests of foreigners before America . They open our borders to them , promise to pay for their health care , give them driver \u2019 s licenses , and demand amnesty for them . While lecturing Trump on \u201c letting foreigners interfere in our elections , \u201d they clamor for the voting rights of illegal immigrants . The word \u201c sovereignty \u201d never passed Democratic lips until Trump became president .\nMany of the same Democrats who pretend to fret over Russia demanded d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union . Bernie Sanders , who honeymooned in the Soviet Union , didn \u2019 t see it as a threat until it gave up communism .\nBut crying wolf about Trump and Russia didn \u2019 t work for the Democrats . They had pinned their hopes on the Mueller report , and it came up empty . Of course that didn \u2019 t stop them from pushing \u201c obstruction of justice \u201d charges against Trump . The American people quickly sized up those charges as bogus , since he hadn \u2019 t colluded with Russia and was simply fighting back against smears . For the Democrats , who never saw Trump as legitimate , every exercise of executive power by Trump constituted obstruction of justice . The media holds the same view , producing endless stories premised on the supposed outrageousness of Trump controlling his own branch of government .\nBut try as they might , Democrats and liberals couldn \u2019 t get the American people to care about their specious charges of obstruction of justice against Trump . So with the 2020 election bearing down upon them , they faked up outrage over Trump \u2019 s alleged mistreatment of Ukraine , all based upon an utterly bogus whistleblower complaint from an anti-Trump partisan .
