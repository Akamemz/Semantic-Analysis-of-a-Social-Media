''\nAnd an NBC News spokesman told CNN that Scarborough kept several executives apprised of the alleged threats `` contemporaneously . '' This may bolster Scarborough 's stunning claim .\nScarborough and Brzezinski are essentially alleging a form of blackmail .

Kushner , the official said , told Scarborough to call the president .
