They emerged to accuse the president of racism for highlighting black families whose teens were slain by MS-13 gang members .\n\u201c From his racist , demonizing comments on immigrants to the complete lack of any mention in relation to securing our democracy from the Russian government , the speech wasn \u2019 t new , it wasn \u2019 t good and it won \u2019 t change any fundamental dynamics of our nation moving forward , \u201d said Rep.
