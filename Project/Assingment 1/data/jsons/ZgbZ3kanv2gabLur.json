    "content": "President Trump says he made his point \u2014 the U.S. needs a border wall , and he will build it with or without Congress .\nRather than force another unpopular and economically harmful government shutdown , Mr. Trump sounds increasingly willing to accept the agreement in Congress that provides about $ 1.3 billion for border barriers . That \u2019 s less than one-fourth of the $ 5.7 billion that he demanded initially for a wall .\n\u201c I think a point was made with the last shutdown , \u201d the president said Wednesday . \u201c People realized how bad the border is , how unsafe the border is . \u201d\nLawmakers sorted out the details of the agreement and released details of the bill early Thursday morning . The House and Senate will be voting on the bill later in the day .\nThe nearly 1,800-page spending bill has money for 55 miles of new border \u201c fencing \u201d in Texas , and money to maintain a daily average of 45,274 detention beds under Immigrations and Customs Enforcement , the agency that now holds more than 49,000 immigrants who live in the U.S. illegally in custody . The bill also provides the authority to move cash around to go above that level , if the Homeland Secretary determines it \u2019 s needed .\nWhen that question and others were still unresolved late Wednesday , the conservative House Freedom Caucus called for a one-week extension of stopgap funding to keep the government open and give lawmakers more time to review the fine print of the border deal . Congress is facing a Friday deadline to approve spending bills to keep nine government agencies open .\nThe agreement would pay for 55 miles of border fencing or barriers , but not concrete walls , in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas . The president and his advisers are exploring other ways to shift money within departments to pay for more barriers , an option that is riling up congressional Democrats .\n\u201c He needs congressional permission to do it , \u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , who noted that Democrats now hold the House majority . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t have the authority to do it without House permission . \u201d\nBut Republicans say the law gives presidents some flexibility with so-called \u201c transfer authority \u201d to shift already-appropriated funds toward border security . Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri has cited as an example about $ 900 million for fighting drug trafficking that was appropriated to the Pentagon .\nMr. Trump is increasingly delivering the message that he \u2019 s already building the wall , regardless of Congress , saying he has \u201c options . \u201d\n\u201c When people see what we \u2019 re doing , I think they \u2019 ll be very surprised , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 re doing a lot of work .
