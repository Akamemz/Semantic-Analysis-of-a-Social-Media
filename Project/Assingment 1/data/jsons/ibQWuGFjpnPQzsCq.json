Of all the rival Republican candidates , there is one who gets under the former president \u2019 s skin , whom he views as perhaps Jeb Bush \u2019 s most serious rival for the party \u2019 s nomination .\nIt isn \u2019 t Donald Trump , whose withering insults have sought to make Jeb pay a political price for his brother \u2019 s presidency . It isn \u2019 t Marco Rubio , Jeb \u2019 s former understudy who now poses a serious threat to his establishment support .\n\u201c I just don \u2019 t like the guy , \u201d Bush said Sunday night , according to conversations with more than half a dozen donors who attended the event .\nOne donor in the room said the former president had been offering mostly anodyne accounts of how the Bush family network views the current campaign and charming off-the-cuff jokes , until he launched into Cruz .\n\u201c I was like , \u2018 Holy sh-t , did he just say that ? \u2019 \u201d the donor said . \u201c I remember looking around and seeing that other people were also looking around surprised . \u201d\n\u201c The tenor of what he said about the other candidates was really pretty pleasant , \u201d another donor said . \u201c Until he got to Cruz . \u201d\nBush took a harsh view of Cruz \u2019 s apparent alliance with Trump , who stood with the senator at a Capitol Hill rally last month in opposition to the Iran deal . While Trump , the current GOP poll leader , has attacked most of his competitors in the 2016 field , he has avoided criticizing Cruz .\nOne donor , paraphrasing the former president \u2019 s comment in response to a broad question about how he viewed the primary race and the other Republican candidates , said : \u201c He said he found it \u2018 opportunistic \u2019 that Cruz was sucking up to Trump and just expecting all of his support to come to him in the end , \u201d that donor added .\nGeorge W. Bush is well acquainted with his home-state senator , who served as a domestic policy adviser on his 2000 campaign before rising to national prominence by distancing himself from \u2014 and often going out of his way to antagonize \u2014 the GOP establishment . In his book published earlier this year , Cruz ripped Bush \u2019 s record , criticizing elements of his foreign policy and faulting the administration for enabling `` bigger government and excessive spending and new entitlements . ''\nWhile Jeb Bush \u2019 s campaign is spending far more time of late pushing out information that contrasts favorably with Rubio , his oldest brother seemed to see Cruz as the biggest threat in the end . According to several donors , the former president said not to doubt Cruz \u2019 s strength .\n\u201c He said he thought Cruz was going to be a pretty formidable candidate against Jeb , especially in Texas and across the South , \u201d a donor said .\nA spokesman for the former president pushed back at the takeaway that he views Cruz as his brother 's main obstacle in the 15-candidate primary field .\n`` The first words out of President Bush 's mouth last night were that Jeb is going to earn the nomination , win the election , and be a great president , '' said Freddy Ford , George W. Bush 's spokesman . `` He does not view Sen. Cruz as Gov . Bush 's most serious rival . ''\nCruz 's campaign , after initially declining to comment for this story , provided a statement from the senator Monday night .\n\u201c I have great respect for George W Bush , and was proud to work on his 2000 campaign and in his administration , '' Cruz said . `` It 's no surprise that President Bush is supporting his brother and attacking the candidates he believes pose a threat to his campaign . I have no intention of reciprocating . I met my wife Heidi working on his campaign , and so I will always be grateful to him . ''\nThe donors at the event were a mix of establishment stalwarts like former Gov . Bill Owens and business executive Larry Mizel as well as a number of young professionals , who were offered reduced $ 250 tickets at the last minute in an effort to fill the room , according to an email the organizer circulated among potential supporters and obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe former president was softer in critiquing Rubio , whom many view as the biggest threat for establishment support and , by extension , the nomination itself . After recognizing Rubio \u2019 s political and rhetorical skills , George W. Bush reprised the common criticism of the first-term senator \u2014 experience .
