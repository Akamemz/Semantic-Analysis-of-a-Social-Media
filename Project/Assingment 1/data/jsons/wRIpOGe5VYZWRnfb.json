    "title": "OPINION: Why Trump Is Wholly Unsuited to the North Korea Crisis",

    "content": "The problem is that Trump has none of these characteristics . He has shown himself to be prolifically dishonest . The president has lied to the public about matters great and small , from the petty ( the size of his inauguration crowd ) to the serious ( accusations of wiretapping , his own position on major matters ) to the absurd ( outright denying things he said publicly ) . As a result , Americans are in no position to trust the things he might tell them in a crisis , whether those remarks are delivered from behind the Resolute desk or via tweet .\nAs if that were not bad enough , foreign leaders can \u2019 t trust what he says either . An adversary has no idea whether to take threats from Trump seriously ( to say nothing of literally ) . He \u2019 s a man who made empty threats throughout his career , repeatedly suggesting he \u2019 d sue people who said and did things he didn \u2019 t like . In many cases , he did not follow through . If you \u2019 re North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , why should you believe that his threats of force are any more real ? Trump \u2019 s strategy with North Korea has been compared to Richard Nixon \u2019 s \u201c madman theory , \u201d in which the former president wanted enemies to believe he was capable of anything , because he was insane . An equally likely\u2014or even more likely\u2014outcome is that North Korea will conclude that Trump is capable of nothing , based on past results .\nThe dangers are higher because Trump \u2019 s counterpart is Kim , himself an untrustworthy and unpredictable interlocutor prone to empty threats . \u201c When two leaders each habitually bluster and exaggerate , there \u2019 s a higher likelihood of making a catastrophic mistake based on a bad guess , \u201d my colleague Kathy Gilsinan wrote in April .\nBut it \u2019 s a problem for allies , too , because the United States would want friends in a hot war or in a diplomatic crisis . They also have no reason to trust any assurances that the president makes .
