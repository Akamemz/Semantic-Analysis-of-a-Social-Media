    "content": "President Obama delivered his second to last State of the Union address with an epic combination of sweet-talking and trash-talking , cajoling and trolling . He brought us the story of Rebekah and Ben Erler , who got through some economic troubles with their family intact . \u201c It is amazing , \u201d Rebekah wrote the president , \u201c what you can bounce back from when you have to\u2026we are a strong , tight-knit family who has made it through some very , very hard times. \u201d You knew what was coming : Yes , Americans , we too are \u201c a strong , tight-knit family who has made it through some very , very hard times . \u201d\nOr more specifically , we \u2019 re a strong , tight-knit family whose Republican relatives have been wrong on Russia and Iraq , clueless about climate change and can \u2019 t even get right with the pope on Cuba . When he commented , `` I have no more campaigns to run , \u201d and Republicans applauded , Obama shot back : \u201c I know , because I \u2019 ve won both of them . \u201d\nMy personal favorite Obama taunt came during his call for a minimum wage hike . \u201c To everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage , I say this : If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $ 15,000 a year , go try it . If not , vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise . \u201d\nAnyone who tuned in expecting a conciliatory lame duck president was disappointed .\nSince almost all of the president \u2019 s SOTU proposals were available for mass consumption days before the address , the night \u2019 s big questions involved theater , much of which was provided by Obama himself . But it was fun to watch Republicans frown at so many ideas they once supported . While much of the media framed Obama \u2019 s plan as a radical break from his first six years , that \u2019 s silly . I \u2019 m happy with what the president outlined , but it \u2019 s essential to say that aside from his community college proposal , he \u2019 s using mostly old-fashioned GOP ideas , though they 're DOA in this Congress .\nHe \u2019 s working through the tax code -- providing expanded child tax credits , child care and higher education tax credits and second earner credits -- not providing new social programs . Remember , that was the GOP response to the Great Society : Government is too big ; why not let Americans keep more of their hard earned cash ? Clearly Obama agrees . The plan is pro-family , pro-child , pro-work -- and most of it only goes to the middle class , not the poor ( the new credits are n't refundable for low-income people who do n't pay taxes ) . Specifically , it borrows tax proposals from Republicans like former Rep. Dave Camp and Paul Ryan and Sen. Mike Lee . It brings capital gains taxes back to the level of the GOP \u2019 s favorite president , Ronald Reagan .\nYou \u2019 re not hearing much of that from the media . Bill O'Reilly trashed it as Obama \u2019 s \u201c Robin Hood \u201d plan , but you can find \u201c Robin Hood \u201d headlines on CNN , Politico and The Hill as well . Another popular comparison was with the French economist who \u2019 s done the most to chart rising inequality , Thomas Piketty . Matt O \u2019 Brien in the Washington Post called it Obama \u2019 s \u201c Piketty moment ; \u201d the New York Times found \u201c shades of Piketty \u201d in the plan ; the Atlantic said the president \u201c owes a tip of the cap \u201d to Piketty .\nA tip of the cap , maybe . But Piketty himself thinks the top marginal tax rate should be at least 80 percent . Obama doesn \u2019 t propose anything close to that . Nor does he suggest closing the carried interest loophole or imposing a Wall Street transaction tax , an idea backed by Rep. Chris Van Hollen and other House Democrats . The Bush tax cuts remain standing , for all but the top 2 percent . I don \u2019 t say any of this to criticize the president \u2019 s plans , but to chide the media for acting like they \u2019 re socialism .\nBut even if he doesn \u2019 t go as far as Piketty or most progressives want , there \u2019 s plenty in what Obama proposed that \u2019 s great , and targeted at reversing the massive accumulation of wealth for the top 1 percent ( and particularly , the top .01 percent ) . It will stop folks like Mitt Romney from using IRAs as tax shelters . It will keep the same folks from passing along their stock portfolio to their children without paying capital gains taxes .\nMaybe most important , he framed his proposals in keeping with the march of American progress that seemed to stop 40 years ago .\nAt every moment of economic change throughout our history , this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances , and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot . We set up worker protections , Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity . We gave our citizens schools and colleges , infrastructure and the internet \u2013 tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them .\nHe put his community college proposal in that context , and he was right to do so .\nThere were things to quibble with for progressives .
