Jeb Hensarling and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise are pictured How GOP 's play on spending could backfire\nWho loses more if Republicans bail out again on the annual appropriations bills : the White House or the GOP itself ?\nThe political right is up in arms over President Barack Obama \u2019 s planned announcement Thursday that he will use his executive authority to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation proceedings . And the argument goes that by pushing the pause button , Republicans in Congress can somehow punish the president because he believes most in an activist government .\nBut in truth , the landscape is very different from just a year ago , and the numbers show that Obama gets little new money in 2015 whatever the outcome , while the GOP may be cutting off its nose to spite its face .\nThe options include an outright shutdown or bare-bones continuing resolution \u2014 either short or long term . But all these alternatives fall short of an omnibus spending bill or even hybrid CR and would sacrifice important pieces of the Republican agenda .\nFor example , the GOP prides itself on caring about national defense , but a CR means Congress is walking away from updating the Pentagon \u2019 s $ 91 billion-plus procurement account . After enduring election-year attacks for being insensitive to women , Republicans would be turning their backs on $ 41 million in new money promised last spring to help state and local police investigate unsolved rape cases . And for all the talk of growing jobs with more foreign trade , money would be lost to make American ports more operational .\nLast June , the Republican-controlled House approved at least $ 1.1 billion to address the backlog in dredging waterways \u2014 a big issue for the lower Mississippi River and major ports in Southern red states . If Congress now goes with a CR , Obama loses nothing here . In fact , the president gets to spend what he thinks best \u2014 almost $ 200 million less than what Republicans want .\nBut perhaps the greatest irony lies with the United States Citizenship and Information Services , or USCIS , an agency within the Department of Homeland Security that would be charged with implementing any new executive order from Obama .\nThe USCIS estimated budget of $ 3.2 billion is funded from fees collected on processing applications . While Congress can impose limits on those expenditures , it is largely independent of the more general appropriations process . Thus , if Republicans were to shut down the government or revert to a stopgap CR , it would do little or nothing to impact the very same agency charged with implementing the president \u2019 s decision .\n\u201c From a state like Alaska , where we have more federal employees per capita than any state out there , more public lands than any other state , a CR is a lousy way to run a government , \u201d said Sen.

For anyone who looks , the numbers show a troubling pattern for the GOP .\nFrom weather satellites , to Western lands policies and Indian health services \u2014 even the 2020 census , Republican priorities are at stake . What were all those Benghazi hearings about if the GOP is going to walk away now from new funding for embassy security ?
