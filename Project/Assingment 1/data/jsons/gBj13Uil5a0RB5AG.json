Still , she kept the president at arm \u2019 s length by acknowledging \u201c very real economic challenges \u201d throughout his eight years in office .\n\u201c There is too much inequality , too little upward mobility . It is just too hard to get ahead today , \u201d she said . \u201c But there are common-sense things that your government could do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed . \u201d\nHer solutions also borrowed from Sen.
