''\nSupplied A nurse from Sacramento County wrapped in a blanket while being tested for the coronavirus in a tent outside Sutter Roseville Medical Center .\nNurses worried they were infected with COVID-19 told \u2588\u2588\u2588 they waited up to a week to get test results , despite displaying symptoms and being health care professionals on the front line . `` I 'm a registered nurse who knows how to navigate the system , and I 'm having trouble getting answers , '' a nurse from Sacramento told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` Members of the general public certainly must be faring much , much worse . '' The 41-year-old nurse said she had to beg local county officials in order to get tested for the coronavirus , despite working daily with seniors who are low-income , the most at-risk group for the virus . Even then , the testing required she wait nearly five hours in a cold tent in the parking lot of Sutter Roseville Medical Center , northeast of Sacramento , which she first spoke about with an ABC affiliate . She called the tent testing situation `` not even humane . '' Six days later , she still does not have the results . Another nurse , from the EvergreenHealth facility in Kirkland , Washington , the initial epicenter of the US outbreak , had to wait a week for results of her coronavirus test to come back , despite displaying respiratory symptoms and having cared directly for three patients who died of the disease . Both nurses have asked to remain anonymous because their employers do not allow them to speak publicly .\nThere \u2019 s a lot we still don \u2019 t know about the coronavirus outbreak .

And if you 're someone who is seeing the impact of this firsthand , we \u2019 d also love to hear from you ( you can reach out to us via one of our tip line channels ) .\nThe Kirkland nurse believed she 'd been exposed because initially her hospital only used droplet protection for nurses for the first few patients ( a basic mask , gloves , and gown ) before upgrading to airborne protections after positive COVID-19 results . `` I do have asthma , so if I die and they say I had underlying conditions , I 'm going to haunt the CDC , '' she said before receiving her results . Her negative result finally came back Tuesday , a week after she was tested . On the same day , new guidelines from the CDC confirmed hospitals only needed to use droplet protections . `` Would have been nice to know before I freaked out , '' the Kirkland nurse told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . According to an internal email , Evergreen initially insisted that any quarantined staff would only be paid if they used their sick leave , insisting staff `` may use their accrued Extended Illness Bank ( EIB ) or Sick Leave or choose to be unpaid while off work . '' However , Evergreen later changed its policy and put its quarantined nurses , including this intensive care nurse , on paid administrative leave .

The nurse in Sacramento is still awaiting her test results for the coronavirus , six days after being tested . On Feb. 24 , she said she experienced symptoms of what she thought was her annual seasonal allergies , and she continued to work , caring for senior citizens . `` Would n't it be such a tragedy if I was infecting others while doing my best to keep them healthy ? '' she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nBut by March 2 , her symptoms worsened . Her nose was running , she was feverish , and coughing . By then , cases of COVID-19 were already popping up in Sacramento County , including the first person in the US to test positive without having traveled to a known area of exposure or had contact with an ill person . She saw her primary care doctor and asked to test for the coronavirus , because of her work , but was told they did not have tests . The following day , she began a round of antibiotics for a sinus infection . Three days later , she 'd seen no improvement . She had a fever of nearly 103 degrees , her cough had worsened , and she struggled to stay awake for more than a few minutes . `` It was more sick than I have ever been as an adult , '' she said .\nOn Thursday , she called her doctor for a coronavirus test and was told she had to contact Placer County , which was responsible for testing . She left a voicemail with the county and contacted her insurance company , who told her to contact her primary care doctor . Finally she emailed the head of public health at Placer County : `` I fear I could be part of the covid-19 outbreak , '' she wrote , and explained her background , symptoms , and work .\nEventually , the county approved her for testing , and instructed her to go to Sutter Roseville Medical Center , which , the day before , on March 4 , had run a drill , filmed by local media , showing how the hospital was responding to the coronavirus outbreak and had an emergency tent set up in its parking lot ready for testing . `` There was a big thing on local TV about how prepared they were for this and they definitely were not , '' said the nurse . She said she and her teenage daughter , who 'd also started showing symptoms , were told to sit on a bench outside the tent , just near the entrance to the emergency department . After 15 minutes , the sick nurse was allowed into the tent . After 40 minutes , her daughter was too . She said the tent was dirty , cold , and not sealed .
