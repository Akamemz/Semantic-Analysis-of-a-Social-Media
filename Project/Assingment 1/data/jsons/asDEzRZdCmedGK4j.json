    "content": "Convention Speeches Soar , Raise A Question : Can Clinton Connect With Ordinary People ?\nThe third night of the 2016 Democratic convention scaled several major peaks : President Obama gave , perhaps , the best-written oration of his career . Vice President Joe Biden gave , perhaps , his last national convention address , and his prospective successor , Tim Kaine , gave his first .\nBut when it was all over , and Obama was joined on stage by the woman who wants to succeed him , you could feel the love welling up from the delegates and you could sense the doubt hanging over them \u2014 an invisible cloud casting a psychological shadow .\nYes , the crowd had been wowed by Michelle Obama and Elizabeth Warren and the `` Comeback Kid '' himself , Bill Clinton .\nBut would Hillary Clinton herself be able to seal the deal on the last night ?\nNever known as a big-venue speechmaker , Clinton will face a make-or-break moment with multiple pitfalls , varying objectives and a variety of critical audiences .\nFor starters , she needs to overcome her reputation for being overly intense and humorless in her public presentations .\nBeyond that , she needs to reassure those who doubt her integrity after many months of pounding from conservatives and media organizations on Benghazi and on her private email server .\nShe needs to reassure those who have been told that a woman ( or at least this particular woman ) is not equal to the task of national security in a time of foreign crisis and domestic threats .\nAnd she needs to convince members of her own party that she shares their sensibilities as expressed in the party platform , widely regarded as the `` most progressive in party history . ''\nAnd as she speaks , she will likely face a crossfire from the still-restive ranks of die-hard Bernie Sanders delegates .\nAlthough they have not been as constantly disruptive as they were on Monday afternoon , pockets of unity-resistant Sandersistas have distracted from the convention program here and there . They chanted `` stop '' when a former admiral spoke , and they kept up a steady stream of noise when Leon Panetta , former secretary of defense and CIA director , was on stage . At another point they chanted `` no more war '' until the rest of the convention drowned them out with `` USA . ''\nThis tended to undercut the message the convention organizers had tried to convey on Wednesday night \u2014 a message of Democrats being sure-handed and resolute on national security .\nPanetta , in particular , recast his remarks after hearing Republican nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday call for Russian hackers to look for old State Department emails Clinton was said to have deleted . Trump suggested this would be a field day for the media .\nPanetta wanted to point out this amounted to urging `` an adversary '' to go fishing in important pools of potentially classified information . ( Trump later backed off the call , saying he was just being sarcastic . )\nThe Sanders contingent includes many peace activists and people for whom Obama and Clinton and Panetta are guilty of continuing George W. Bush 's `` war on terror . '' The fact that they wound down the war in Iraq gradually and actually extended the war in Afghanistan makes them unacceptable .\nThese protesters are akin to the anti-war activists of the Vietnam era who cared more about defeating the hawks in the Democratic Party than about defeating the Republican Party , which ultimately proved at least equally hawkish , if not more so .\nThese holdouts remained unmoved by Clinton winning the roll call vote on Tuesday by nearly a thousand votes , or by her receiving Sanders ' endorsement . Instead , they see the entire system as rigged and regard the leaked batch of DNC emails as proof the entire process was corrupt , even the primaries and caucuses , which were actually run by the individual states or state parties .
