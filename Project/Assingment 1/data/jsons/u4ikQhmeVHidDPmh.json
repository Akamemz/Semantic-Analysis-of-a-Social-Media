    "content": "Assume the following : You are a licensed driver , age 17 . You live with your father . His driver 's license has been suspended . He hands you the keys to his car and asks you to run an errand . While driving to do that errand you are stopped by the police and subjected to roadside questioning . You have not broken a single law . The only \u2588\u2588\u2588 why the police stopped you is because they guessed that your father might be driving . Was the traffic stop lawful ? Or did it violate the Fourth Amendment 's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures ?\nThe above scenario is hypothetical but the questions it raises are genuine . In its October 2019 term , the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that asks whether the Fourth Amendment `` always permits a police officer to seize a motorist when the only thing the police officer knows is that the motorist is driving a vehicle registered to someone whose license has been revoked . ''\nThe case is Kansas v. Glover . In 2016 , a patrolling sheriff 's deputy ran the plates on a Chevrolet pickup truck and learned that the truck 's owner , Charles Glover , had a revoked driver 's license . The deputy had no idea if Glover was actually behind the wheel . But the deputy still pulled the truck over on the assumption that Glover was driving . He was . Now Glover wants the Supreme Court to rule the stop unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment .\n`` When a driver loses his license , he and his family must rely on other drivers ( a spouse , a driving-age child , a child-care provider , a neighbor ) to meet the family 's needs , '' Glover and his lawyers point out in their brief to the Supreme Court . `` Under Kansas 's proposed rule\u2026any of those other drivers can be pulled to the side of the road at any moment merely for driving a lawfully registered and insured car in a completely lawful manner . '' That rule , they argue , is an `` unjustified intrusion on personal privacy '' that violates the Fourth Amendment .\nKansas has a different take on what the Constitution allows . `` The Fourth Amendment permits brief investigative stops\u2014such as the traffic stop in this case , '' the state argues in its principal brief , `` when a law enforcement officer has a particularized and objective basis for suspecting '' illegal activity .
