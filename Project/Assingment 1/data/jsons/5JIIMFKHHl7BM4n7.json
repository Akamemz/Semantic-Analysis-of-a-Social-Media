He was absolutely correct .\nThe event was a CNN town hall in Los Angeles Thursday night , where nine Democratic candidates were interviewed about their stances on LGBT issues . Those who tuned in for the four-and-a-half-hour show were treated , with few exceptions , to each candidate answering variations of the same questions in the same ways . What will they do about any continued discrimination against LGBT ? They 'll fight against it and support the Equality Act . What will they do about improving access to HIV drugs and preventative medication ? They 'll go after those greedy pharmaceutical companies , and all the drugs will be covered under their health care plans . What will they do about hate crimes ? They 'll unleash the Department of Justice against them , and hate crimes will definitely be exempted from any push to make federal sentencing less punitive . What will they do about other countries who treat arrest or execute LGBT people ? They 'll withhold aid and possibly even trade . What will they do about people who invoke their religious beliefs to justify discriminating against LGBT people ? They wo n't let them , and they 'll strip churches and nonprofits of their tax-exempt status if they try . What will they do about conversion therapy ? Ban it . What will they do about bullying in schools and teen suicide ? Get rid of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos .
