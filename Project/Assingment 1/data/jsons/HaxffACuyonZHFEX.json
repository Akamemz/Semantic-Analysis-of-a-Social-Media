We know voter suppression when we see it , '' Warnock told a press conference in Georgia 's Capitol building .\nThe charge , harkening back to a dark period in the South 's history , was aimed squarely at Georgia 's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp . Kemp 's office is investigating whether the group Warnock is associated with -- the New Georgia Project -- has committed fraud in its drive to register more than 100,000 minority voters before the Oct. 6 deadline .\n`` There 's somebody clearly doing something wrong , '' Kemp told Fox News . `` And we want to figure out who that is , and try to make sure that we stop that . And bring charges against those people . ''\nAt an emergency hearing of the state Election Board this week , Kemp 's investigator Chris Harvey laid out the elements of the case . Harvey said he had confirmed 28 cases of fraud in 14 counties -- 25 fraudulent voter registration applications and three fraudulent canvassing sheets . Some had forged signatures ; others , false information . Another 26 cases were labeled suspicious .\nFalsifying a voter registration form is a felony in the state of Georgia .\n`` Any time that you 're talking about forgery and fraud in Georgia law , it 's certainly very serious , '' Kemp told Fox News .\nThe issue is a particular hot button this year because of the narrow margins in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss , R-Ga . Polls show Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn narrowly trailing Republican David Perdue . Nunn 's campaign believes if it makes significant inroads into signing up some of the 800,000 unregistered minority voters in Georgia , she could take the seat .\nThe New Georgia Project was founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Rep. Stacey Abrams . She is a member of Nunn 's so-called `` kitchen cabinet , '' advising the candidate . Abrams told Fox News she maintains a clear wall of separation between her work with the Nunn campaign and what she insists is a `` nonpartisan '' effort to get more minorities out to the polls in November .\nKemp has slapped the New Georgia Project with a subpoena , demanding any and all documents and communications related to the voter registration drive by next Friday . The NGP fired back on Wednesday proclaiming its innocence and says it is strictly following the law .
