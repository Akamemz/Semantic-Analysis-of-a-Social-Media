POLITICO poll: Economic malaise\n\nIf the nation\u2019s economy is on the mend, the voters of 2014 aren\u2019t feeling it.\n\nDespite continued signs of a halting but persistent national comeback, midterm voters remain frustrated and unhappy with the state of the economy, according to the latest POLITICO poll of likely voters in 2014 battleground states. Many appear to blame President Barack Obama: 57 percent of these voters disapprove of his economic leadership.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBy every measure in the survey, a gloomy mood still pervades the electorate when it comes to kitchen-table issues: Just 23 percent say their personal financial situation has improved over the past year, versus 30 percent who say it has gotten worse.\n\nDemocrats had initially envisioned 2014 as a year when their candidates could hail the fruits of an economic turnaround. For a time, a handful of impressive monthly employment reports bolstered their hopes.\n\n( The latest POLITICO polling data)\n\nBut while the economy has improved, it has not yet taken flight: Unemployment remains above 6 percent, and in August the country gained just 142,000 jobs. Candidates around the country have tempered their claims of economic improvement, including Republican governors who also initially aimed to run on their records of job creation.\n\nStrong majorities now say that they lack the savings to grapple with an unforeseen job loss (61 percent) and that the cost of basic household items like gas and groceries has strained their finances (62 percent.)\n\nNeither party has established a clear advantage in the midterm economic debate: In the states and congressional districts most likely to decide control of Congress, voters were evenly split over which party they trust more to handle the economy, with 36 percent choosing Democrats and an equal proportion choosing Republicans.\n\nTwenty-eight percent were unsure, indicating the issue remains an important jump ball in the current election and beyond.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Hillary Clinton tops Iowa poll ahead of fry)\n\nNicole Chapman of Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, said she hasn\u2019t yet decided which party she\u2019ll vote for but that the economy and taxes are her overarching concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting worse across the board. Only the people that have the silver spoons are the ones it\u2019s going well for,\u201d said Chapman, a 38-year-old child care provider. She doesn\u2019t pin responsibility on Obama, who she said is doing \u201cthe best that he can possibly do, with Congress not wanting to work with him.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Dale Nelson, 52, said the economy and the nation\u2019s unsecured border loom large in his political thinking. \u201cThe economy\u2019s really slow compared to what it could be,\u201d said Nelson, who works at a bank. \u201cI blame the policies of the president and the Democratic Party right now.\u201d\n\nThe poll, designed by SocialSphere Inc. and conducted by the research firm GfK, tested 917 likely voters in competitive U.S. House and Senate races.
