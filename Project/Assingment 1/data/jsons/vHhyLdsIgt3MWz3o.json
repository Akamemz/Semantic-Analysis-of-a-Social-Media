Both feature projections based on the relaxation of mitigation that Trump has championed by urging state governments to take steps to reopen businesses , even as none of them has met the White House coronavirus task force \u2019 s gating criteria for doing so .\nFor instance , as the New York Times reports , the IHME \u2019 s new model , which estimates that the coronavirus will claim nearly 135,000 lives in the US by early August , states that its upward revision is based on \u201c rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11 , indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus. \u201d ( The FEMA document shows that the daily US death toll will reach 3,000 by June 1 , a near doubling of the roughly 1,500 lives being claimed per day by the coronavirus right now . )\nTrump \u2019 s comments indicate that he thinks workers being diligent about washing their hands and trying to keep distance from other people will be sufficient to slow the spread of the virus , but experts say that \u2019 s not the case . Stay-at-home orders and the shutdown of most businesses haven \u2019 t so far been sufficient to bend the trajectory of new cases down , they \u2019 ve merely gotten the country to a relative plateau in new cases and deaths . This suggests the number of new cases and deaths will likely get worse as things reopen .\nIt is for these reasons that public health experts think it \u2019 s premature to relax stay-at-home orders . But later during his comments outside the White House on Tuesday , Trump indicated he thinks there \u2019 s no choice but to try to get the economy going again .\nAsked by a reporter if he \u2019 s concerned that deaths are projected to increase because states are relaxing social distancing guidelines too early , Trump responded that he isn \u2019 t because \u201c the fact that we \u2019 re letting people go and go to their jobs \u2014 they have to do it . \u201d\n\u201c You know , if they held people any longer with the shutdowns , you \u2019 re going to lose people that way too , and you already have , I \u2019 m sure , \u201d Trump said . \u201c But between drug abuse , and , I mean , they say suicide \u2014 a lot of different things .
