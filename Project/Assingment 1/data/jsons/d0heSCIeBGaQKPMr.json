It means that if a candidate does not get 10 percent of the vote, he gets no delegates. (And this is a hard threshold \u2014 no rounding.)\n\nWhat's more, not only do those underperforming candidates get no delegates, but whatever delegates they could have gotten based on their vote share go to the winner of the primary (!).\n\nAnd, right now, the favorite is Trump.\n\nTrump, after all, has been leading in the polls in New Hampshire by double digits for six straight months.\n\nMeanwhile, the so-called \"establishment\" candidates \u2014 the kind of mainstream Republicans that usually prevail in New Hampshire \u2014 are split. And after Saturday night's debate, with Marco Rubio's lackluster performance, that establishment vote could be fractured even further.\n\nThere are 20 delegates at stake in New Hampshire on primary night.
