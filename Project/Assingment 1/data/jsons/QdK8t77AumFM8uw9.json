Three national polls out today show a close race , though the tea leaves may hold some positive signs for Mitt Romney . Let 's run through the results : Rasmussen 's daily tracker has tightened to 49/47 for Romney . Obama has been bouncing between 46 and 47 for days on end , while his challenger has crept just above 50 percent on several occasions . Today Romney dips into the high 40s , while Obama remains static . As for the organization 's `` swing state '' tracker , Romney 's lead is holding steady :\nIn the 11 swing states , Mitt Romney earns 50 % of the vote to Obama \u2019 s 46 % . Two percent ( 2 % ) like another candidate in the race , and another two percent ( 2 % ) are undecided . Romney has now led for 12 straight days with margins of four to six points most of that time .\nWaPo/ABC News ' latest survey shows Romney leading the president by the slimmest of margins , 49/48 . The better news for Romney is that the poll 's internals suggest a more robust lead than a mere point . For starters , the sample is an indefensible D+7 -- with Republicans turning out at a significantly lower rate than 2008 . Ed Morrissey runs the math :\nIf Romney wins independents by 15 , and the gender gap by 2 , how can he only be leading by one overall ? Simple \u2014 the Post/ABC sample has a declining number of Republicans in its sample . Today \u2019 s rolling three-day average has a D/R/I of 35/28/34 , which would put Republicans at seven points below their 2010 turnout and five points below their 2008 turnout . Two days ago , the sample was D+4 at 34/30 , but now it \u2019 s D+7 . The toplines are simply not credible in relation to the internals . If Romney is winning independents outside the margin of error and has neutralized the gender gap , Obama can \u2019 t possibly be within one point overall .\nThe Politico/GWU Battleground poll has Obama inching back ahead by one point ( 49/48 ) -- but again , the internals tell a slightly different story . Romney leads by double-digits among independents ( 50/40 ) , which improves upon Obama 's eight-point win with indies in 2008 , en route to a seven-point national victory . There 's also the enthusiasm gap , which favors the GOP ticket by a considerable margin :\n... the GOP nominee maintains a potentially pivotal advantage in intensity among his supporters . Sixty percent of those who support Obama say they are \u201c extremely likely \u201d to vote , compared to 73 percent who back Romney . Among this group , Romney leads Obama by 9 points , 53 to 44 percent . By any measure , the race is neck-and-neck : 43 percent say they will \u201c definitely \u201d vote Romney , compared to 42 percent who say the same of the president .\nRomney has a 13-point intensity advantage , yet both he and Obama have strikingly low totals among `` definite '' supporters . Forty-two percent is a weak level of hard support for an incumbent president , but Romney does n't do much better . Obama benefits from a D+4 that under-samples Republicans ( though not as badly as WaPo/ABC News ' partisan split ) But here 's where things get really interesting . The bipartisan GWU/Battleground poll has also released a `` vote election model , '' which takes demographics , voter intensity and other data into account . When they run these numbers , Romney emerges with a five-point national lead :\nThe bipartisan Battleground Poll , in its \u201c vote election model , \u201d is projecting that Mitt Romney will defeat President Obama 52 percent to 47 percent . The poll also found that Romney has an even greater advantage among middle class voters , 52 percent to 45 percent . The poll \u2019 s election model takes into account variables including voter intensity , age , and education , and voters who are certain in their vote . The race \u201c remains very close in the surface , \u201d Goeas said , \u201c but the political environment and the composition of the likely electorate favor Governor Romney . \u201d\nI would love to get a peek under the hood of the Battleground poll 's methodology . They show a one-point lead for Obama `` in the surface , '' but project a relatively comfortable Romney win . Hence my `` excruciating and contradictory '' description above . If you 're trying to make heads or tails of the turnout models , I 'd strongly encourage you to read this from NRO 's `` numbers cruncher '' Josh Jordan . In short , both Gallup and Rasmussen have shown Republicans pulling even with Democrats in terms of partisan identification among the 2012 electorate at large . This is a major shift from 2008 , when Democrats held a substantial lead in the party ID sweepstakes :\nIn the current tracking poll , Gallup finds that the 10-point advantage for Democrats has now turned into a 1-point Republican advantage . The current party breakdown is now 35 percent Democrats , 36 percent Republicans , and 29 percent independents . And just in like 2008 , that 1-point advantage increases when independents are asked which party they typically lean to , with 49 percent identifying as Republicans and 46 percent as Democrats . That number backs up the trends in other polling showing Romney leading among independents by large margins ... While Team Obama loudly declares that Gallup has to be an outlier , there is one other poll that has been tracking party affiliation every day as well : Rasmussen . Just like Gallup , Rasmussen runs a daily tracking poll with about 1,500 respondents included in the partisan-affiliation breakdown . In 2008 , Rasmussen found Democrats with a 7.1 percentage point advantage in turnout , which was a perfect prediction of the Democratic-turnout margin on Election Day . In September of 2012 , Rasmussen has Republicans now edging Democrats by 2.6 points , with a split of 34 percent Democrats , 37 percent Republicans , and 29 percent independents .\nPerhaps this phenomenon , coupled with their own data on independents , has prompted the Battleground pollsters to project a Romney win one week from tomorrow .\nUPDATE - Gallup 's daily tracker shows a five-point Romney lead , 51-46 .",
