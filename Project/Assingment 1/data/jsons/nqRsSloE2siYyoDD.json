While she hasn \u2019 t achieved everything she set out to do \u2013 far from it \u2013 allies and rivals agree that Ocasio-Cortez has upended Democratic politics , pushing the party inexorably to the left . And all before her 30th birthday , which she celebrated in October .\nWhen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez met Greta Thunberg : 'Hope is contagious ' Read more\n\u201c Her presence in Congress has been seismic , \u201d said Alexandra Rojas , the executive director of Justice Democrats , a progressive political organization that recruited Ocasio-Cortez to run for office . \u201c She has changed the whole ecosystem and expanded the idea of what \u2019 s possible in the minds of voters . That kind of change is on a scale that \u2019 s almost immeasurable . \u201d\nFew knew her name before the evening of 26 June 2018 , when she stunned the political establishment \u2013 and herself \u2013 by soundly defeating Joe Crowley , a 10-term incumbent and the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House . Now she \u2019 s known universally by her initials : AOC .\nIn the year since her arrival on Capitol Hill , Ocasio-Cortez has convinced every major 2020 presidential candidate to support her Green New Deal , galvanized opposition to a deal with Amazon in New York and turned a tedious congressional hearing on money in politics into must-see TV . Last cycle , she raised more money than any other House Democrat , including Pelosi . And across the country , waves of Democratic insurgents are challenging long-serving incumbents in what has been called the \u201c AOC effect \u201d .\n\u201c She \u2019 s gotten a lot done by challenging the status quo \u2013 by taking on politics as usual in Washington , \u201d said Caroline Fredrickson , the president emerita of the American Constitution Society and author of the upcoming book The AOC Way .\nFredrickson says Ocasio-Cortez has defied long-standing expectations about how young women , and especially women of color , behave in the corridors of power . At the same time she \u2019 s surprised critics who once dismissed her as merely a \u201c bright and shiny new object \u201d .\n\u201c A lot of people expected a show pony . But it turns out she \u2019 s a workhorse , \u201d Fredrickson said , pointing to her skillful questioning of witnesses during congressional hearings .\nOcasio-Cortez doesn \u2019 t mind being underestimated . ( \u201c That \u2019 s how I won my primary , \u201d she quipped on CNN . )\nBut she said her refusal to accept corporate Pac donations means that unlike many of her colleagues she spends no time on the phone asking donors for money \u2013 freeing up her schedule to pore over briefing books , study policy proposals and , on occasion , canvas her followers for questions to ask witnesses at hearings .\nBut the congresswoman has said the heavy workload and constant scrutiny can take a toll .\n\u201c Like many other women + working people , I occasionally suffer from impostor syndrome : those small moments , especially on hard days , where you wonder if the haters are right . But then they do things like this to clear it right up , \u201d she wrote on Twitter , mocking a Republican senator for his bizarre riposte to her climate plan .\nHer playful repartee on social media , mixing the personal with the political , has helped her build a loyal following far beyond her New York district , which includes parts of the Bronx and Queens .\nOcasio-Cortez has emerged as a symbol of a Democratic party that is younger , more diverse and increasingly wary of the excesses of capitalism . She believes voters are tired of pragmatism and consensus-building . Her campaign resonated , she argues , because of her uncompromising clarity of vision . It \u2019 s a contested theory of change that she shares with the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , whom she endorsed in October .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re a one-term Congress member , so what ? \u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in a video produced by Justice Democrats earlier this year . \u201c You can make 10 years \u2019 worth of change in one term if you \u2019 re not afraid . \u201d\nShe stridently , and often wittily , counters internet trolls . She made huge waves on a visit to the migrant detention facilities at the US-Mexico border in July 2019 , and helped expose appalling conditions for adults , children and even babies there .\nA political and cultural icon on the progressive left , she has also transfixed the right : Fox News covers her religiously while Trump and Republicans have eagerly promoted her as the face of the Democratic party . Trump has labeled her a \u201c communist \u201d and a \u201c nightmare for America \u201d . He has also said that she and three other liberal congresswomen of color who form a group that Ocasio-Cortez named \u201c the Squad \u201d \u2013 Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts , Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2013 should \u201c go back \u201d to their countries . Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx , not far from the Trump family home in Queens .\nOcasio-Cortez was raised in a working-class family : her father owned a small business as an architect and her mother , who was born in Puerto Rico , cleaned houses . She studied international relations and economics at Boston University .\nWhen she was a sophomore in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis , her father died of lung cancer and plunged the family into economic hardship . She has said that this ordeal helped shape her views on healthcare and economic reform .\n\u201c When you \u2019 re from a working-class background it often feels like you \u2019 re just one disaster away from everything falling apart , \u201d she said in an emotional Instagram story titled You can do it pinned to the top of her feed . \u201c And that \u2019 s kind of what happened when my dad died . \u201d\nHer lightning-strike rise from bartender to Democratic dragonslayer to member of Congress \u2013 all in the span of little more than a year \u2013 has not been an entirely smooth transition .\nIn February , her office botched the rollout of the Green New Deal by distributing an incorrect fact sheet about the proposal that lead to widespread confusion over key details of the plan and lent itself to parody by Republicans . In New York she faced criticism for being slow to open a district office ( she now has two ) . And she stirred fierce backlash when she described migrant detention camps at the border as \u201c concentration camps \u201d \u2013 a term she has stood by .\n\u201c Nobody expects to go from not having health insurance to being on the front page of every major newspaper , literally overnight , \u201d Rojas said .\nMany Democrats have griped privately about her outsized celebrity and combative politics , which they fear imperils vulnerable House members running for re-election in conservative districts where her brand is toxic . In the early days of her tenure , she alienated others in the party by aligning with a movement that runs primary challenges against moderate and right-leaning Democrats .
