The two sides are not expected to talk directly to each other.\n\nEgyptian and Palestinian negotiators had arrived over the weekend.\n\nKey to any talks, Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said, is that Hamas must disarm.\n\nHamas leaders say that they want to negotiate an end to the Israeli blockade of Gaza, or at least a body other than the Israelis controlling the borders.\n\nHaniyeh, the senior Hamas leader, said his televised statement that Hamas members will work with the Palestinian delegation to end the blockade.\n\nIsrael: 'The onus is on Hamas'\n\nIsrael repeatedly accepted an Egyptian cease-fire proposal during the conflict, which Hamas rejected. Temporary humanitarian cease-fires repeatedly crumbled, with each side blaming the other.\n\n\"The onus is on Hamas,\" Regev told CNN of the 72-hour truce.\n\n\"We are entering this with our eyes open,\" he said. \"We have been burnt more than once.\"\n\nThe sentiment was similar from Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan, who told CNN that as long as Israel honors the agreement, so will the Palestinians.\n\n\"We hope they can take it and be committed to a cease-fire,\" he said.\n\nWhile Egypt has not released details of the truce, Regev suggested it was the same agreement that Israel has accepted all along.\n\nThe United States urged both sides to honor the cease-fire agreement.\n\n\"The United States has been steadfast in our insistence on an end to rocket and tunnel attacks against Israel and an end to the suffering of the people of Gaza,\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \"urges the parties to commence, as soon as possible, talks in Cairo on a durable ceasefire and the underlying issues,\" his office said in a statement.\n\nBritish minister resigns over Gaza\n\nIn the latest example of the ripples the conflict has sent around the globe, a British government minister said she was resigning over her country's policy on Gaza.\n\n\"With deep regret I have this morning written to the Prime Minister & tendered my resignation. I can no longer support Govt policy on Gaza,\" Sayeeda Warsi, senior minister of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, wrote on Twitter.\n\nWarsi, a member of the House of Lords and the first Muslim in a British Cabinet, posted a photo of her resignation letter on Twitter.",
