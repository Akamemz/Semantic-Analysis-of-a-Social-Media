The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that the Justice Department's civil rights investigation of Cleveland's police department found that it engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of unreasonable and unnecessary use of force.\n\nComing on the heels of the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot and killed by a Cleveland police officer, many have wondered if this conclusion and damning report proves anything about Rice's death.\n\nNot directly.\n\nBut this report doesn't exactly help the public's perception of the Cleveland police, either.\n\nTo many, the involvement of the federal government in investigating the killings of Rice, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner are a welcome event. After all, federal law enforcement does not have the intimate working relationship that local state investigators likely have with the police force -- a relationship that could compromise an internal investigation.\n\nThe federal government is designed as a limited government. There is supposed to be no general federal \"police power\" -- that is, no right of the federal government to regulate for the health, safety, or general welfare of the citizenry. The reality is, legislation and court decisions over the past century have gradually expanded the federal government's control and review of local activities.\n\nIn these cases, authority to review the practices of law enforcement agencies potentially violating federal rights comes from the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.\n\nAnd the DOJ is increasingly vigilant in enforcing these laws. In just the last five years, the Civil Rights Division initiated more than 20 investigations of police departments, which it claims is more than twice as many investigations than were opened in the previous five fiscal years. It would seem that the modern DOJ has made civil rights a priority.\n\n(The Cleveland police said in a statement they've begun remedial measures and \"much more work is needed.\")\n\nThe Cleveland report itself is almost chilling in its detailed narration of specific instances of excessive police force. But that's not all: The reported procedures, policies, and tactics are also equally as concerning. Among the findings:\n\n1. 'Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice ... '\n\nWould you be surprised to learn that the DOJ previously investigated the CDP in 2002 and found similar deficiencies? How about the fact that in 2004, the Justice Department and CDP entered into an agreement to correct these problems, including revising its use of force policy and establishing new procedures for -- you guessed it -- reviewing officer-involved shootings.\n\nHowever, that prior agreement was not enforced by a court and had no independent monitor.

It's the little things ...\n\nThis is a minor detail, but a potentially divisive one. The DOJ observed a sign hanging in a district station identifying it as a \"forward operating base,\" which is a military term for an outpost in a war zone. People sympathetic to law enforcement might say \"no big deal -- that's part of police culture.\" To other members of the community and to the Justice Department, this is disturbing evidence of police culture: that CDP is more of an occupying army than a community partner.\n\n4. What documents?\n\nWere this not such a serious matter, the DOJ would LOL at CDP's document retention and production. The Cleveland department failed to produce deadly force investigations that occurred after April of 2013. CDP failed for some time to produce certain 2012 use of less lethal force reports.
