That \u2019 s consistent with the polling averages at Huffington Post , which have Clinton up 42.7 to 40.8 percent , and at RealClearPolitics , which has Clinton leading Trump 44 to 42.5 % percent .\nOf course , as I \u2019 ve noted before , head-to-head polling is still not very predictive at this point in the race , and really won \u2019 t be until after the nominating conventions . This is particularly true with Mrs. Clinton still in a fight for the Democratic nomination , while Trump is moving ahead to unify Republicans behind him . It is also the case that fully 15 percent of respondents chose not to back either candidate .\nNonetheless , it is interesting to look at the internals of recent polls to get a sense of what is driving the results .\nPerhaps the most surprising result in the Quinnipiac polls is that when asked who they found more trustworthy and honest , Clinton or Mr. Trump , 44 percent of respondents chose Trump , compared with 39 percent who selected Clinton . Obviously some of the responses are conditioned by the respondent \u2019 s partisan affiliation \u2013 Democrats rate Clinton higher , while Republicans view Trump as more trustworthy . But among independents , Trump led by 15 percentage points , 44 to 29 percent .\nHow can this be ? Isn \u2019 t Trump the candidate that Politifact fact-checked and rated close to 80 percent of the statements of his that they checked as false , mostly false or meriting a Pants on Fire ? Given his documented record of making false statements , how could survey respondents rate him more trustworthy than Clinton ?\nThis result isn \u2019 t unique to Quinnipiac , mind you . In the latest ABC/Washington Post poll , Trump also \u201c led \u201d Clinton 42 to 41 percent among registered voters on the honesty/trustworthiness question .\nOne explanation is that because Clinton hasn \u2019 t been able to secure her party \u2019 s nomination , some Democrats and likely Bernie Sanders supporters are more willing to say that Trump is more trustworthy as a form of protesting Clinton \u2019 s candidacy rather than as a statement in favor of Trump \u2019 s honesty . As evidence , note that more than twice as many Democrats \u2013 10 percent \u2013 said Trump was more trustworthy than did Republicans \u2013 5 percent \u2013 about Clinton .\nA second possible explanation is that Trump draws disproportionately from less educated supporters who may be less able to judge the veracity of Trump \u2019 s statements \u2013 or less willing to care whether what he says is true or not .\nNote that in the Quinnipiac survey , those without a college education are more likely to rate Trump as the more honest of the two than are the college educated .\nHowever , I think a third factor is at play here . For many Trump supporters , his trustworthiness and honesty is not measured by how factually correct his statements are . Instead , it is better gauged by his willingness to speak candidly about issues , even if he does so in ways that are not viewed as politically correct , and which may create a media backlash .\nAgain and again I heard his followers at his rallies say that they appreciated his willingness to talk about issues that other candidates shied away from , regardless of the potential consequences .
