He also headed the FBI team that investigated the email scandal surrounding Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton .\nRather than getting a platform to speak to the nation in a daylong TV performance , Strzok should be summarily dismissed from the FBI , thoroughly investigated and prosecuted if the evidence shows he has broken the law .\nMueller removed Strzok from the Russia investigation last year after learning of numerous rabidly anti-Trump and pro-Clinton text messages that Strzok traded with his then-lover Lisa Page , who was an FBI lawyer at the time .\nThe texts made it crystal clear that Strzok and Page despised Donald Trump and wanted Hillary Clinton to defeat him in the 2016 presidential election .\nIn one text exchange , Page wrote to Strzok about Trump : \u201c He \u2019 s not ever going to become president , right ? Right ? ! \u201d Strzok replied : \u201c No . No he won \u2019 t . We \u2019 ll stop it . \u201d\nStrzok also said in a text that there was an unspecified \u201c insurance policy \u201d that would keep Trump out of the White House .\nStrzok admitted at Thursday \u2019 s hearing that he \u201c detested \u201d Trump . However , he insisted vehemently and repeatedly that his personal political views had absolutely no impact on his conduct at the FBI in the investigations involving either the Trump campaign or Clinton . He said he had taken no improper action regarding either probe .\nThese claims are unbelievable and contradicted by the facts regarding Strzok \u2019 s conduct .\nAs an FBI agent for 24 years and former chief of all FBI criminal investigations , I was disgusted by the way Strzok tried to cloak himself in the FBI and characterize attacks against him as attacks against the FBI as an institution .\nStrzok did his best to fuse himself to the good and dedicated men and women of the finest law enforcement agency in the world , but the truth is that his shabby conduct has done more to damage the FBI than any one person in its storied history .\nScores of current and retired FBI employees who gave their all to the organization have expressed to me that they deeply resent being unfairly forced to deal with the consequences of Strzok \u2019 s bad behavior .\nFor all the drama , fire and fury , the House hearing shed no new light on Strzok \u2019 s conduct at the FBI . It did , however , demonstrate the general uselessness of Congressional hearings .\nRather than uncover facts for their constituents , the hearing resembled a cross between \u201c The People \u2019 s Court , \u201d \u201c The Jerry Springer Show , \u201d and the trash talk between competitors at \u201c WrestleMania . \u201d\nThe sad truth is that in the Republicans \u2019 zeal to administer a public flogging of Strzok \u2013 and by extension the FBI \u2013 the GOP House members walked right into a trap .\nThe hearing never had a chance of uncovering the truth . This is so because Strzok enjoyed the advantage of being able to shower the committees with self-serving protestations while hiding behind the restrictions on his testimony imposed by the FBI attorney hovering behind him .\nStrzok understood this and exploited his opportunity to the hilt while snuggling up to the anti-Trump Democrats embracing him .\nThe savvy Strzok cleverly outmaneuvered the Republicans on the committees . That \u2019 s surprising , given the extensive experience of Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy , R-S.C. , as a former federal prosecutor .
