History will crown it the year of the debates .\nAnd it is not just that the three presidential debates shook up the race and put Republican Mitt Romney back in the game .\nThe history making element of the 2012 debates is that this year they became an interactive social media event attracting massive audiences . They rivaled the Super Bowl and Wrestlemania in audience size and lust for combat because Americans for the first time had the communal experience of scoring each debate in real time .\nOn Twitter and blogs the debates were scored minute by minute by grandma , the kids and everyone else in the living room . And stars from Hollywood to media personalities , and politicians joined in the fun with the folks at home . The whole nation competed for the best one-liners , the perfect put-down or come back as the debate was taking place .\nTrying to appear presidential , above the cage-match mentality with a sober , thoughtful , reserved approach does not work when the social media world wants zingers that mock your opponent . President Obama lost the first debate for failing to satisfy the big crowd by refusing to draw blood . Mitt Romney similarly lost the last debate for failing to take the fight to the president on foreign affairs .\nThe second debate , with the candidates looking on the verge of a fist-fight , interrupting each other and calling out false claims was the first true debate by the new rules for this era .\nDuring these debates , Twitter gave us much more than \u201c Hashtags \u201d for Big Bird , Binders and Bayonets .
