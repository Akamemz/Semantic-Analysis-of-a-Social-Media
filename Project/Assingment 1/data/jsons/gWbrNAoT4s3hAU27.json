    "content": "Former FBI Director James Comey , who was fired by President Donald J. Trump , will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning\u2013and Washington , D.C. , elites are gathered at their favorite watering holes throughout the city to watch the giant nothing-burger testimony .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 will be covering the political class celebration from here , with this livewire including updates on Comey \u2019 s testimony and the reaction of the crowd of Washington elites .\nUnion Pub , a landmark Washington , D.C. , bar across the street from the Heritage Foundation on Capitol Hill , is offering all patrons who come here to watch the testimony free drinks whenever President Trump Tweets about the Comey hearing throughout its duration until 4 p.m .\nUPDATE 12:54 P.M. President Trump did not Tweet throughout the entire event , but Union Pub is still giving out a few round of America-themed Budweisers to everyone here ! The specialty Budweiser cans , which servers are passing out now , have the special \u201c America \u201d name in place of \u201c Budweiser \u201d on the label and a camouflage design instead of the traditional red cans .\nCheers ! Comey reveals he 's a leaker and New York Times pushes FAKE NEWS ! @ BreitbartNews # comey pic.twitter.com/cmJ8DST0QP \u2014 Penny Starr ( @ PennyStarrDC ) June 8 , 2017\nThat \u2019 s all folks , we \u2019 ll leave it there for today . COVFEFE to everyone and thanks for tuning in !\nUPDATE 12:50 P.M. As the public part of the hearing adjourned , and Comey has completely vindicated Trump ahead of a later closed session hearing where he and senators are likely to discuss classified information he could not bring up during the televised hearing , the whole thing turned out exactly like \u2588\u2588\u2588 Network told you it would : A giant nothing-burger . Except for the fact that Comey admitted he is a leaker , has a network through which he has leaked information designed to harm President Trump . Oh , and that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other Obama administration officials may have engaged in serious misconduct worthy of further investigation\u2013which Comey testified about today .\nMeanwhile , White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2013from the podium at the press briefing\u2013has told reporters that President Trump is not , despite what the leaker James Comey says , a liar .\n. @ SHSanders45 : `` No , I can definitively say the president is not a liar . It 's frankly insulting that that question would be asked . '' \u2014 Zeke Miller ( @ ZekeJMiller ) June 8 , 2017\nAnd , of course , nevertheless President Trump persisted . He \u2019 s right back out there fighting for American workers while Democrats waste their time on evidence-less nonsense .\nTrump takes the stage at Faith and Freedom conference \u201c It \u2019 s wonderful to be here with all of my friends \u201d pic.twitter.com/xi7Gbo4x3G \u2014 Charlie Spiering ( @ charliespiering ) June 8 , 2017\n\u201c You fought for me , now I will fight for you \u201d Trump tells Faith and Freedom audience \u2014 Charlie Spiering ( @ charliespiering ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 12:40 P.M. Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) , a grumpy old anti-Trump Republican , made no sense during his questioning of Comey . Breitbart \u2019 s own Curt Schilling , the host of Whatever It Takes , questions whether everyone else had trouble following along with McCain \u2019 s nonsensical line of questioning :\nAm I the only one not able to follow along with senator McCain 's line of questioning ? ? ? ? \u2014 Curt Schilling ( @ gehrig38 ) June 8 , 2017\nEven the New York Times \u2019 people questions whether McCain is losing his mind :\nMcCain seems to be confusing the Clinton email case with the Russia investigation . \u2014 Peter Baker ( @ peterbakernyt ) June 8 , 2017\nTrump , who has not Tweeted during the hearing at all , apparently made the decision to avoid Tweeting last night . Politico \u2019 s Tara Palmeri has the scoop of why the President would not Tweet today , infuriating all the Union Pub bar-goers who did not get any free drinks since President Trump did not Tweet .\nTrump decided the night before # comeyhearings that he would not live-tweet his rebuttal https : //t.co/P0SouqYAja \u2014 Tara Palmeri ( @ tarapalmeri ) June 8 , 2017\n\u201c Why would I ? \u201d Trump apparently told White House aides about live-Tweeting Comey \u2019 s appearance before Congress , according to a \u201c senior White House official \u201d who spoke with Politico \u2019 s Palmeri . Read the whole thing , including the details on how the president \u2019 s mood is \u201c light \u201d during the Comey testimony .\nUPDATE 12:37 P.M. Their hopes and dreams dashed by Comey completely vindicating Trump in this open hearing , and instead implicating ex-Obama administration officials like Loretta Lynch\u2013and implicating himself as an anti-Trump leaker with a network through which he has leaked damaging information against the president\u2013the left and media are pinning everything on a last ditch line of questioning from Sen. Kamala Harris ( D-CA ) .\nThis line of questioning from @ SenKamalaHarris regarding the Attorney General is extraordinarily important \u2013 not to be overlooked \u2014 Matt House ( @ mattwhouse ) June 8 , 2017\nHere \u2019 s video of her comparing Trump to an armed robber though , so take whatever she says with a grain of salt :\nBut MSNBC leftist media star Andrea Mitchell loves Kamala Harris , heavily highlighting the rookie Democrat Senator \u2019 s questions :\n. @ KamalaHarris asks series of q 's about possible secret contacts between Trump camp and Russia # Comey declines to answer in open hearing \u2014 Andrea Mitchell ( @ mitchellreports ) June 8 , 2017\nMeanwhile , anti-Trump Never Trumper Max Boot is in an alternate reality , saying Comey was fantastic as a witness .\nBottom line for # ComeyDay : Comey a highly credible witness . Trump is n't . Comey makes damning accusations . Trump denials unconvincing . \u2014 Max Boot ( @ MaxBoot ) June 8 , 2017\nFlashback , though , to when Comey was fired and Boot with some bold predictions back on May 9 :\nCongress needs to ask Comey to testify & he needs to tell all he knows about Kremlingate . If he does Trump may regret firing him . \u2014 Max Boot ( @ MaxBoot ) May 10 , 2017\nDon \u2019 t tell Max Boot about the black helicopters coming for him . Seriously . \u201c KREMLINGATE \u201d ? What is wrong with these people ? Anyway , another wonderfully fantastic flashback of this Never Trumper from when Comey was fired in May :\nPrediction : If Democrats take control of Congress in 2018 , the firing of Comey will form one of the articles of impeachment . \u2014 Max Boot ( @ MaxBoot ) May 10 , 2017\nUPDATE 12:24 P.M. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz is calling for the Senate to officially subpoena the documents James Comey ordered leaked through his network of leakers .\nSenators should ask Comey the name of the Columbia professor and then subpoena the memos from him . \u2014 Alan Dershowitz ( @ AlanDersh ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 12:21 P.M. Loretta Lynch is in serious trouble right now . Looks like the Democrats \u2019 efforts may have backfired .\nLoretta Lynch is having a surprisingly bad day in the Comey testimony \u2014 Chris Cillizza ( @ CillizzaCNN ) June 8 , 2017\nIf it was n't for Trump becoming president , the corruption with Obama 's Department of Justice would be a major story . https : //t.co/Pc3ZTYTtaN \u2014 Josh Kraushaar ( @ HotlineJosh ) June 8 , 2017\nComey also just testified that he did not believe that Lynch could \u201c credibly deny \u201d the Hillary Clinton email scandal investigation , and that she had a serious conflict of interest . He also testified in exchange with Sen. John Cornyn ( R-TX ) , the Senate Majority Whip , that it is possible a special prosecutor was needed for the email scandal . He said he considered calling for appointing a special counsel in the scandal , but decided against it .\nUPDATE 12:08 P.M. Oh my . Now confirmed leaker James Comey \u2019 s leak network has been outed , or at least part of it has :\nOnly in Washington : Someone nursing a pint of beer shouts out to a crowded bar : `` Daniel Richman of Columbia '' https : //t.co/hNXVbfBe8r \u2014 Alexander Panetta ( @ Alex_Panetta ) June 8 , 2017\nSo the collusion involves former FBI director , mainstream media , and the left-wing academy to bring down the elected president # ComeyHearing https : //t.co/sVWKpajWw9 \u2014 Joel B. Pollak ( @ joelpollak ) June 8 , 2017\nAnd now Comey \u2019 s anti-Trump leak network is confirming to the media that Comey is a leaker :\nColumbia Law Prof Daniel Richman confirms to @ ZCohenCNN that he is the friend that provided excerpts of the Comey memo to reporters . \u2014 Ryan Nobles ( @ ryanobles ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 12:05 P.M . There are now serious questions being raised as to whether Loretta Lynch , the former Attorney General from the Obama administration , will be subpoenaed to testify after this hearing where Comey has implicated her .\nLegit question : is Loretta Lynch going to be subpoenaed as a result of this testimony ? \u2014 Mike Shields ( @ mshields007 ) June 8 , 2017\nMeanwhile , Comey \u2019 s admission he is a leaker serious hurts him . Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School makes the case Comey may be in serious trouble :\nComey admits that he leaked the internal memo through a Columbia law professor in order to force Special Counsel . Yet , that raises questions \u2014 Jonathan Turley ( @ JonathanTurley ) June 8 , 2017\nComey is doing well but leaking info runs against Comey 's image , particularly in light of the leak controversy hoiunding the Administration \u2014 Jonathan Turley ( @ JonathanTurley ) June 8 , 2017\nThe memos could be viewed as gov't material and potential evidence . Leaking to a friend for disclosure can raise serious questions . \u2014 Jonathan Turley ( @ JonathanTurley ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 12:02 P.M. Donald Trump , Jr. , highlights an excellent question from Sen. Roy Blunt ( R-MO ) to Comey . Comey did not have a great answer .\nSen Blunt : If you told Sessions you did n't want to be alone with Trump again , why did you continue to take his calls ? \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. ( @ DonaldJTrumpJr ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 12:01 P.M. From our RNC friends , here \u2019 s video of Sen. Rubio crushing another leftist media narrative during his questioning of Comey .\nBasically , Comey was so concerned about President Trump \u2019 s conversations with him that he alerted exactly nobody who could do anything about it . In other words , this whole thing is a giant nothing-burger . Except for Comey implicating himself as a leaker .\nUPDATE 11:58 A.M. Comey is in big trouble after this hearing . He admitted he \u2019 s a leaker , and has an actual network through which he leaks information to the press . In addition , he withheld from leaking information that would have vindicated President Trump weeks ago . White House social media director Dan Scavino captures it clearly and concisely on Twitter :\nBecause if it was leaked that @ realDonaldTrump was personally not under investigation- it would have crushed the entire narrative . pic.twitter.com/drFcCxin5M \u2014 Dan Scavino Jr. ( @ DanScavino ) June 8 , 2017\nPresident Trump still has yet to Tweet , so no free drinks yet here at Union Pub . Looks like the owners here made a smart decision since this place is standing room only right now .\nUPDATE 11:54 A.M. Oh , man , this keeps getting better and better . Comey just shredded the Democrats AND now the fake news media .\nOh Boy . Comey says there have been many many stories based on classified information about Russia that are just `` dead wrong '' \u2014 Maeve Reston ( @ MaeveReston ) June 8 , 2017\nI wonder if any of the media outlets that have printed repeated stories on these matters will check their reporting again or correct it if they \u2019 re wrong . Not holding my breath .\nUPDATE 11:50 A.M. Comey has emerged throughout this hearing before the American people looking very much like a drama queen . One of the more memorable lines is when he says when Trump called him to ask him if he was free for dinner , he had to break a date with his wife .\nComey says Trump called him at his desk . `` Free for dinner tonight ? ''\n`` I said yessir\u2026I had to call my wife and break a date with her . '' \u2014 Jennifer Jacobs ( @ JenniferJJacobs ) June 8 , 2017\nCOMEY JUST QUOTES HENRY 11 on what he thought Trump meant : 'Will no one rid me of this toublesome priest '' \u2014 Trip Gabriel ( @ tripgabriel ) June 8 , 2017\nMeanwhile , even CNN \u2019 s Jim Acosta\u2013a vehemently anti-Trump media figure in the heart of the opposition party \u2019 s mothership CNN\u2013is joining in on the anti-Comey fun .\nGiving info to media `` like feeding seagulls at the beach ? '' Fact check : True . \u2014 Jim Acosta ( @ Acosta ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 11:48 A.M . The leaky Capitol Hill GOP swamp aides are attacking Trump , despite the fact Comey has vindicated the president and implicated himself in potentially illegal leaks .\nSenate R aide : Holding nose and defending Trump is taking a lot out of these GOP senators \u2014 and they will demand some kind of repayment\u2026 \u2014 Glenn Thrush ( @ GlennThrush ) June 8 , 2017\nThe fact that Swamp Creatures on the \u201c Republican \u201d side on Capitol Hill are throwing shade on their own president , and party , as the GOP and Trump likely emerge from today \u2019 s masquerade mostly out of the woods is simply incredible but unsurprising . Swamp Things are going to Swamp .\nUPDATE 11:45 A.M. Comey \u2019 s open admission he orchestrated a potentially illegal leak puts him in serious potential trouble , the New York Times people note . That \u2019 s the story folks . He vindicated Trump , and implicated himself . Wow , what a day .\nCan \u2019 t remember the last time someone in DC openly acknowledged orchestrating a leak \u2014 and without any senator having even asked . \u2014 Peter Baker ( @ peterbakernyt ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 11:39 A.M. CNN \u2019 s Dan Merica says that President Trump \u2019 s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz will make a statement at the end of Comey \u2019 s public testimony .\nMarc Kasowitz , Trump 's lawyer outside the White House , will make a statement at the end of James Comey 's Senate testimony \u2014 Dan Merica ( @ merica ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 11:35 A.M. As Comey continues vindicating Trump and throwing Democrats like Lynch , Obama , and Clinton under the bus\u2013presumably accidentally\u2013the Washington , D.C. , daydrinking party scene is in full swing :\n`` Comey is my homey .

While obstruction is now off the table for Trump , as Breitbart \u2019 s Joel Pollak detailed , Breitbart \u2019 s John Hayward notes that obstruction is back on the table for several leading officials from now former President Barack Obama \u2019 s administration . Hayward says Congress needs to investigate Loretta Lynch , the former Attorney General , as well as Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2013the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee\u2013for obstruction of justice .\nBig takeaway from the Comey hearing : urgent need to investigate Loretta Lynch , Barack Obama , and Hillary Clinton for obstruction \u2014 John Hayward ( @ Doc_0 ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 11:29 A.M. Our very own Joel Pollak is out with another bombshell piece detailing how this hearing has shattered the media \u2019 s and the Democrats \u2019 efforts to taint President Trump with \u201c obstruction of justice . \u201d\n\u201c Democrats have hinged their hopes for impeachment \u2014 and reversing the 2016 elections \u2014 on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice . That case has now been smashed beyond repair , \u201d Pollak writes , pointing to a Comey exchange with Sen. Jim Risch ( R-ID ) .\nUPDATE 11:26 A.M. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox , who has trolled Trump as much as he possibly can over the campaign and since , is joining with Union Pub patrons\u2013who get free drinks if President Trump Tweets about the Comey hearing\u2013in raising concerns with the lack of Tweets today from President Trump .\n. @ realDonaldTrump 's silence on # ComeyDay concerns me . What 's going on , Don ? I hope you do n't hurt your fingers ranting against Comey later . \u2014 Vicente Fox Quesada ( @ VicenteFoxQue ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 11:25 A.M . Entirely unsurprising , but leading Never Trumper Ana Navarro bashes the president\u2013again\u2013and praises Comey .\nLot of time left , but so far , Comey is coming across as the consummate professional . A man who loves his country , colleagues & agency . \u2014 Ana Navarro ( @ ananavarro ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 11:24 A.M . Since Comey has blown up the entire media narrative , essentially , Ric Grenell\u2013a leading conservative pro-Trump advocate\u2013notes that the media is only using \u201c facts \u201d that fit their worldview .\nBreaking : DC reporters are NOT tweeting the line where Comey destroys their anonymous sourced narratives . \u2014 Richard Grenell ( @ RichardGrenell ) June 8 , 2017\nKayleigh McEnany , one of the only pro-Trump voices on the opposition party network CNN , Tweets another homerun :\nOf all the leaks , the one thing that never leaked was that the President was NOT under investigation . -Rubio Very suspicious ! # ComeyDay \u2014 Kayleigh McEnany ( @ kayleighmcenany ) June 8 , 2017\nOBVIOUSLY Trump 's request re : Flynn was to \u201c let go \u201d of Trump 's firing of him .

And he called the special counsel \u201c wasteful. \u201d If Robert Mueller , the special counsel , comes up with nothing as every one of his contemporaries has before him , it will be the biggest waste of taxpayer dollars\u2013and of Americans \u2019 time\u2013in a long time .\nListen to the audio here , or at the link to the story from our own Dan Riehl :\nUPDATE 11:16 A.M. James Comey finally confirms before a congressional committee in a public setting\u2013on video\u2013that President Donald Trump is not under FBI investigation .\nJames Comey confirms President Trump was not under investigation while he was FBI director https : //t.co/ZqRwwAcU1i https : //t.co/3lU7Yysw1B \u2014 CNN Breaking News ( @ cnnbrk ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 11:15 A.M. During Comey \u2019 s back and forth with Sen. Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) , the former 2016 Trump GOP primary rival astutely noted that basically the only thing that did not leak to the press is the one fact that would have helped Trump\u2013that Trump himself was not under investigation . That is despite the fact that Congressional leaders were briefed on that point .\nRubio Comey back forth indicates Gang of 8 was briefed that Trump was not personally under investigation . \u2014 Laura Rozen ( @ lrozen ) June 8 , 2017\nUPDATE 11:11 A.M.

Breitbart \u2019 s Joel Pollak has an excellent piece up already on how Comey \u2019 s opening statement to the Committee this morning is all about him .\n\u201c Former FBI director James Comey opened his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by complaining about \u2018 shifting explanations \u2019 for why he had been fired , and by attacking the Trump administration , \u201d Pollak writes . \u201c Comey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly , but then found that the administration \u2019 s statements about the matter \u2018 confused me and increasingly concerned me. \u2019 He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job , and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay . \u201d\nAlso , it \u2019 s worth noting that even the Wall Street Journal\u2013not some rightwing blog by any stretch\u2013even says that Comey \u2019 s written opening statement proves that President Trump should have fired him . Which is exactly what President Trump did . Read the Journal \u2019 s editorial board piece here .\nUPDATE 11 : 00 A.M . The GOP war room is up and running . Our friends over at the Republican National Committee are cutting videos that shows Comey \u2019 s testimony actually fully vindicates President Trump , despite whatever the opposition party media and congressional Democrats say :\nPolitico has an RNC talking points document circulated this morning . Read the whole thing here .\nPolitico also has a story on how the RNC is taking the lead on pushing back on the highly discredited Comey \u2019 s testimony .\n\u201c The RNC \u2019 s role is to support and defend the president and this White House and this week is no different , \u201d Ryan Mahoney , the RNC communications director , told Politico . \u201c And we prepare for everything , and we \u2019 re prepared for the hearing this week . \u201d\nUPDATE 10:59 A.M .

Feinstein tells Comey he \u2019 s \u201c big \u201d and \u201c strong , \u201d then asks him if he was overwhelmed by the Oval Office and wonders why he did not tell the president he was wrong when he brought this subject up with him . He questions whether he would have handled himself the same way if given a second chance .\n\u201c I hope there are tapes , \u201d Comey also said of his meetings with Trump , noting he has seen the president \u2019 s Tweet about the possibility of tapes .\nUPDATE 10:55 A.M. Comey , under questioning from Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-CA ) , says his relationship with Trump got off to a rocky start . He also embarrasses her when she asks him if the reason he was fired had anything to do with the Russia investigation , and he said \u201c yes , because the President said so. \u201d Here in Union Pub , the over-capacity crowd broke out into laughter .\nUPDATE 10:53 A.M. Comey just killed the case against Trump over \u201c obstruction of justice \u201d that the media is building , as fast as they began building it . He said Trump saying he hopes Comey lets the investigation of Flynn go was not an order to drop the investigation .\nUPDATE 10:51 A.M . The media is highlighting two separate things early on in the Comey bonanza : The fired former FBI director \u2019 s use of the word \u201c lie \u201d twice , and him being concerned about meetings with President Trump .

Since Comey has nothing , and the whole case is falling apart , Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2019 s ex-spokesman Brian Fallon is sadly offering up that special counsel Robert Mueller is now investigating Trump .\nWH plan of declaring victory because Trump was not being investigated in January is now moot . Comey made clear Mueller is investing him now \u2014 Brian Fallon ( @ brianefallon ) June 8 , 2017\nBut , sadly , if they have no evidence Trump colluded with the Russians\u2013probably because it is likely no evidence even exists\u2013then the special prosecutor will find the same thing that Comey found : NOTHING .

Comey failing again so far , just like he did when he was working on the Hillary Clinton email scandal last year .\nSo far the Comey testimony is all about him & all about political retribution against the president for firing him .

Audible gasps of disappointment were heard throughout Union Pub as Comey said he will not re-read his opening statement published online last night , a statement that completely vindicated President Trump .\nComey , however , admits that the President can fire him whenever he wants . He also says that he heard Donald Trump thought he was doing a \u201c great job . \u201d\nBut here in Union Pub , cheers erupted as a champagne bottle was popped open for more Washington , D.C. , mimosas .\nUPDATE 10:17 A.M.

    "content_original": "COVFEFE from Union Pub on Capitol Hill!\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by President Donald J. Trump, will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning\u2013and Washington, D.C., elites are gathered at their favorite watering holes throughout the city to watch the giant nothing-burger testimony.\n\nBreitbart News will be covering the political class celebration from here, with this livewire including updates on Comey\u2019s testimony and the reaction of the crowd of Washington elites.\n\nUnion Pub, a landmark Washington, D.C., bar across the street from the Heritage Foundation on Capitol Hill, is offering all patrons who come here to watch the testimony free drinks whenever President Trump Tweets about the Comey hearing throughout its duration until 4 p.m.\n\nUPDATE 12:54 P.M. President Trump did not Tweet throughout the entire event, but Union Pub is still giving out a few round of America-themed Budweisers to everyone here! The specialty Budweiser cans, which servers are passing out now, have the special \u201cAmerica\u201d name in place of \u201cBudweiser\u201d on the label and a camouflage design instead of the traditional red cans.\n\nHere\u2019s a photo from Breitbart\u2019s Kristina Wong:\n\nAnd another from Breitbart News\u2019 Penny Starr:\n\nCheers! Comey reveals he's a leaker and New York Times pushes FAKE NEWS! @BreitbartNews #comey pic.twitter.com/cmJ8DST0QP \u2014 Penny Starr (@PennyStarrDC) June 8, 2017\n\nThat\u2019s all folks, we\u2019ll leave it there for today. COVFEFE to everyone and thanks for tuning in!\n\nUPDATE 12:50 P.M. As the public part of the hearing adjourned, and Comey has completely vindicated Trump ahead of a later closed session hearing where he and senators are likely to discuss classified information he could not bring up during the televised hearing, the whole thing turned out exactly like Breitbart News Network told you it would: A giant nothing-burger. Except for the fact that Comey admitted he is a leaker, has a network through which he has leaked information designed to harm President Trump. Oh, and that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other Obama administration officials may have engaged in serious misconduct worthy of further investigation\u2013which Comey testified about today.\n\nMeanwhile, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2013from the podium at the press briefing\u2013has told reporters that President Trump is not, despite what the leaker James Comey says, a liar.\n\n.@SHSanders45: \"No, I can definitively say the president is not a liar. It's frankly insulting that that question would be asked.\" \u2014 Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) June 8, 2017\n\nAnd, of course, nevertheless President Trump persisted. He\u2019s right back out there fighting for American workers while Democrats waste their time on evidence-less nonsense.\n\nTrump takes the stage at Faith and Freedom conference \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be here with all of my friends\u201d pic.twitter.com/xi7Gbo4x3G \u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) June 8, 2017\n\n\u201cYou fought for me, now I will fight for you\u201d Trump tells Faith and Freedom audience \u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 12:40 P.M. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), a grumpy old anti-Trump Republican, made no sense during his questioning of Comey. Breitbart\u2019s own Curt Schilling, the host of Whatever It Takes, questions whether everyone else had trouble following along with McCain\u2019s nonsensical line of questioning:\n\nAm I the only one not able to follow along with senator McCain's line of questioning???? \u2014 Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) June 8, 2017\n\nEven the New York Times\u2019 people questions whether McCain is losing his mind:\n\nMcCain seems to be confusing the Clinton email case with the Russia investigation. \u2014 Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017\n\nTrump, who has not Tweeted during the hearing at all, apparently made the decision to avoid Tweeting last night. Politico\u2019s Tara Palmeri has the scoop of why the President would not Tweet today, infuriating all the Union Pub bar-goers who did not get any free drinks since President Trump did not Tweet.\n\nTrump decided the night before #comeyhearings that he would not live-tweet his rebuttal https://t.co/P0SouqYAja \u2014 Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) June 8, 2017\n\n\u201cWhy would I?\u201d Trump apparently told White House aides about live-Tweeting Comey\u2019s appearance before Congress, according to a \u201csenior White House official\u201d who spoke with Politico\u2019s Palmeri. Read the whole thing, including the details on how the president\u2019s mood is \u201clight\u201d during the Comey testimony.\n\nUPDATE 12:37 P.M. Their hopes and dreams dashed by Comey completely vindicating Trump in this open hearing, and instead implicating ex-Obama administration officials like Loretta Lynch\u2013and implicating himself as an anti-Trump leaker with a network through which he has leaked damaging information against the president\u2013the left and media are pinning everything on a last ditch line of questioning from Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).\n\nThis line of questioning from @SenKamalaHarris regarding the Attorney General is extraordinarily important \u2013 not to be overlooked \u2014 Matt House (@mattwhouse) June 8, 2017\n\nHere\u2019s video of her comparing Trump to an armed robber though, so take whatever she says with a grain of salt:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MikeCiandella/status/872848958451838977\n\nBut MSNBC leftist media star Andrea Mitchell loves Kamala Harris, heavily highlighting the rookie Democrat Senator\u2019s questions:\n\n.@KamalaHarris asks series of q's about possible secret contacts between Trump camp and Russia #Comey declines to answer in open hearing \u2014 Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) June 8, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, anti-Trump Never Trumper Max Boot is in an alternate reality, saying Comey was fantastic as a witness.\n\nBottom line for #ComeyDay: Comey a highly credible witness. Trump isn't. Comey makes damning accusations. Trump denials unconvincing. \u2014 Max Boot (@MaxBoot) June 8, 2017\n\nFlashback, though, to when Comey was fired and Boot with some bold predictions back on May 9:\n\nCongress needs to ask Comey to testify & he needs to tell all he knows about Kremlingate. If he does Trump may regret firing him. \u2014 Max Boot (@MaxBoot) May 10, 2017\n\nDon\u2019t tell Max Boot about the black helicopters coming for him. Seriously. \u201cKREMLINGATE\u201d? What is wrong with these people? Anyway, another wonderfully fantastic flashback of this Never Trumper from when Comey was fired in May:\n\nPrediction: If Democrats take control of Congress in 2018, the firing of Comey will form one of the articles of impeachment. \u2014 Max Boot (@MaxBoot) May 10, 2017\n\nUPDATE 12:24 P.M. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz is calling for the Senate to officially subpoena the documents James Comey ordered leaked through his network of leakers.\n\nSenators should ask Comey the name of the Columbia professor and then subpoena the memos from him. \u2014 Alan Dershowitz (@AlanDersh) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 12:21 P.M. Loretta Lynch is in serious trouble right now. Looks like the Democrats\u2019 efforts may have backfired.\n\nLoretta Lynch is having a surprisingly bad day in the Comey testimony \u2014 Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) June 8, 2017\n\nIf it wasn't for Trump becoming president, the corruption with Obama's Department of Justice would be a major story. https://t.co/Pc3ZTYTtaN \u2014 Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) June 8, 2017\n\nComey also just testified that he did not believe that Lynch could \u201ccredibly deny\u201d the Hillary Clinton email scandal investigation, and that she had a serious conflict of interest. He also testified in exchange with Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), the Senate Majority Whip, that it is possible a special prosecutor was needed for the email scandal. He said he considered calling for appointing a special counsel in the scandal, but decided against it.\n\nUPDATE 12:08 P.M. Oh my. Now confirmed leaker James Comey\u2019s leak network has been outed, or at least part of it has:\n\nOnly in Washington: Someone nursing a pint of beer shouts out to a crowded bar: \"Daniel Richman of Columbia\" https://t.co/hNXVbfBe8r \u2014 Alexander Panetta (@Alex_Panetta) June 8, 2017\n\nSo the collusion involves former FBI director, mainstream media, and the left-wing academy to bring down the elected president #ComeyHearing https://t.co/sVWKpajWw9 \u2014 Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) June 8, 2017\n\nAnd now Comey\u2019s anti-Trump leak network is confirming to the media that Comey is a leaker:\n\nColumbia Law Prof Daniel Richman confirms to @ZCohenCNN that he is the friend that provided excerpts of the Comey memo to reporters. \u2014 Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 12:05 P.M. There are now serious questions being raised as to whether Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General from the Obama administration, will be subpoenaed to testify after this hearing where Comey has implicated her.\n\nLegit question: is Loretta Lynch going to be subpoenaed as a result of this testimony? \u2014 Mike Shields (@mshields007) June 8, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, Comey\u2019s admission he is a leaker serious hurts him. Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School makes the case Comey may be in serious trouble:\n\nComey admits that he leaked the internal memo through a Columbia law professor in order to force Special Counsel. Yet, that raises questions \u2014 Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017\n\nComey is doing well but leaking info runs against Comey's image, particularly in light of the leak controversy hoiunding the Administration \u2014 Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017\n\nThe memos could be viewed as gov't material and potential evidence . Leaking to a friend for disclosure can raise serious questions. \u2014 Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 12:02 P.M. Donald Trump, Jr., highlights an excellent question from Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) to Comey. Comey did not have a great answer.\n\nSen Blunt: If you told Sessions you didn't want to be alone with Trump again, why did you continue to take his calls? \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 12:01 P.M. From our RNC friends, here\u2019s video of Sen. Rubio crushing another leftist media narrative during his questioning of Comey.\n\nBasically, Comey was so concerned about President Trump\u2019s conversations with him that he alerted exactly nobody who could do anything about it. In other words, this whole thing is a giant nothing-burger. Except for Comey implicating himself as a leaker.\n\nUPDATE 11:58 A.M. Comey is in big trouble after this hearing. He admitted he\u2019s a leaker, and has an actual network through which he leaks information to the press. In addition, he withheld from leaking information that would have vindicated President Trump weeks ago. White House social media director Dan Scavino captures it clearly and concisely on Twitter:\n\nBecause if it was leaked that @realDonaldTrump was personally not under investigation- it would have crushed the entire narrative. pic.twitter.com/drFcCxin5M \u2014 Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) June 8, 2017\n\nPresident Trump still has yet to Tweet, so no free drinks yet here at Union Pub. Looks like the owners here made a smart decision since this place is standing room only right now.\n\nUPDATE 11:54 A.M. Oh, man, this keeps getting better and better. Comey just shredded the Democrats AND now the fake news media.\n\nOh Boy. Comey says there have been many many stories based on classified information about Russia that are just \"dead wrong\" \u2014 Maeve Reston (@MaeveReston) June 8, 2017\n\nI wonder if any of the media outlets that have printed repeated stories on these matters will check their reporting again or correct it if they\u2019re wrong. Not holding my breath.\n\nUPDATE 11:50 A.M. Comey has emerged throughout this hearing before the American people looking very much like a drama queen. One of the more memorable lines is when he says when Trump called him to ask him if he was free for dinner, he had to break a date with his wife.\n\nComey says Trump called him at his desk. \"Free for dinner tonight?\"\n\n\"I said yessir\u2026I had to call my wife and break a date with her.\" \u2014 Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) June 8, 2017\n\nThat\u2019s not the only drama-filled Comey testimony:\n\nCOMEY JUST QUOTES HENRY 11 on what he thought Trump meant: 'Will no one rid me of this toublesome priest\" \u2014 Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) June 8, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, even CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta\u2013a vehemently anti-Trump media figure in the heart of the opposition party\u2019s mothership CNN\u2013is joining in on the anti-Comey fun.\n\nGiving info to media \"like feeding seagulls at the beach?\" Fact check: True. \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 11:48 A.M. The leaky Capitol Hill GOP swamp aides are attacking Trump, despite the fact Comey has vindicated the president and implicated himself in potentially illegal leaks.\n\nSenate R aide: Holding nose and defending Trump is taking a lot out of these GOP senators \u2014 and they will demand some kind of repayment\u2026 \u2014 Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) June 8, 2017\n\nThe fact that Swamp Creatures on the \u201cRepublican\u201d side on Capitol Hill are throwing shade on their own president, and party, as the GOP and Trump likely emerge from today\u2019s masquerade mostly out of the woods is simply incredible but unsurprising. Swamp Things are going to Swamp.\n\nUPDATE 11:45 A.M. Comey\u2019s open admission he orchestrated a potentially illegal leak puts him in serious potential trouble, the New York Times people note. That\u2019s the story folks. He vindicated Trump, and implicated himself. Wow, what a day.\n\nCan\u2019t remember the last time someone in DC openly acknowledged orchestrating a leak \u2014 and without any senator having even asked. \u2014 Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 11:39 A.M. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica says that President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz will make a statement at the end of Comey\u2019s public testimony.\n\nMarc Kasowitz, Trump's lawyer outside the White House, will make a statement at the end of James Comey's Senate testimony \u2014 Dan Merica (@merica) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 11:35 A.M.

While obstruction is now off the table for Trump, as Breitbart\u2019s Joel Pollak detailed, Breitbart\u2019s John Hayward notes that obstruction is back on the table for several leading officials from now former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. Hayward says Congress needs to investigate Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General, as well as Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2013the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee\u2013for obstruction of justice.\n\nBig takeaway from the Comey hearing: urgent need to investigate Loretta Lynch, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton for obstruction \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 11:29 A.M. Our very own Joel Pollak is out with another bombshell piece detailing how this hearing has shattered the media\u2019s and the Democrats\u2019 efforts to taint President Trump with \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats have hinged their hopes for impeachment \u2014 and reversing the 2016 elections \u2014 on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice. That case has now been smashed beyond repair,\u201d Pollak writes, pointing to a Comey exchange with Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID).\n\nRead his whole story here.\n\nUPDATE 11:26 A.M. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who has trolled Trump as much as he possibly can over the campaign and since, is joining with Union Pub patrons\u2013who get free drinks if President Trump Tweets about the Comey hearing\u2013in raising concerns with the lack of Tweets today from President Trump.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump's silence on #ComeyDay concerns me. What's going on, Don? I hope you don't hurt your fingers ranting against Comey later. \u2014 Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 11:25 A.M. Entirely unsurprising, but leading Never Trumper Ana Navarro bashes the president\u2013again\u2013and praises Comey.\n\nLot of time left, but so far, Comey is coming across as the consummate professional. A man who loves his country, colleagues & agency. \u2014 Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 11:24 A.M. Since Comey has blown up the entire media narrative, essentially, Ric Grenell\u2013a leading conservative pro-Trump advocate\u2013notes that the media is only using \u201cfacts\u201d that fit their worldview.\n\nBreaking: DC reporters are NOT tweeting the line where Comey destroys their anonymous sourced narratives. \u2014 Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) June 8, 2017\n\nKayleigh McEnany, one of the only pro-Trump voices on the opposition party network CNN, Tweets another homerun:\n\nOf all the leaks, the one thing that never leaked was that the President was NOT under investigation. -Rubio Very suspicious! #ComeyDay \u2014 Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) June 8, 2017\n\nAnd Ann Coulter for the win:\n\nOBVIOUSLY Trump's request re: Flynn was to \u201clet go\u201d of Trump's firing of him. MSM was falsely claiming reason 4 firing was contacts w Russia \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 11:21 A.M. from this morning\u2019s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXMTom Fitton of Judicial Watch, , says there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by President Trump or his team. And he called the special counsel \u201cwasteful.\u201d If Robert Mueller, the special counsel, comes up with nothing as every one of his contemporaries has before him, it will be the biggest waste of taxpayer dollars\u2013and of Americans\u2019 time\u2013in a long time.\n\nListen to the audio here, or at the link to the story from our own Dan Riehl:\n\nUPDATE 11:16 A.M. James Comey finally confirms before a congressional committee in a public setting\u2013on video\u2013that President Donald Trump is not under FBI investigation.\n\nJames Comey confirms President Trump was not under investigation while he was FBI director https://t.co/ZqRwwAcU1i https://t.co/3lU7Yysw1B \u2014 CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 11:15 A.M. During Comey\u2019s back and forth with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), the former 2016 Trump GOP primary rival astutely noted that basically the only thing that did not leak to the press is the one fact that would have helped Trump\u2013that Trump himself was not under investigation. That is despite the fact that Congressional leaders were briefed on that point.\n\nRubio Comey back forth indicates Gang of 8 was briefed that Trump was not personally under investigation. \u2014 Laura Rozen (@lrozen) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 11:11 A.M. Donald Trump, Jr., joins the fray on Twitter, defending his father\u2013the president\u2013from Comey\u2019s ambiguous claims.\n\n1/3 Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well. I hear \"I hope nothing happens but you have to do your job\" \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017\n\n2/3 very far from any kind of coercion or influence and certainly not obstruction! \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017\n\nTrump, Jr., says there is no way Comey would have misunderstood the president.\n\n3/3 Knowing my father for 39 years when he \"orders or tells\" you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017\n\nHe also notes that Comey has testified that he could be \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\nComey \"I could be wrong\" \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017\n\nDonald Trump, Jr.\u2019s Tweets come as many here at Union Pub\u2013who will get free drinks if the president himself Tweets about Comey\u2013are disappointed that President Trump himself is not Tweeting. This is probably the first time ever that people in Washington, D.C.\u2013the Swamp\u2013are upset that President Donald Trump is NOT Tweeting.\n\nUPDATE 11:10 A.M. Video of Comey wishing there are tapes of his conversations with Trump:\n\nComey: \"I've seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes.\" (via @MSNBC) pic.twitter.com/uSCsAqTHAK \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 11:07 A.M. Breitbart\u2019s Joel Pollak has an excellent piece up already on how Comey\u2019s opening statement to the Committee this morning is all about him.\n\n\u201cFormer FBI director James Comey opened his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by complaining about \u2018shifting explanations\u2019 for why he had been fired, and by attacking the Trump administration,\u201d Pollak writes. \u201cComey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly, but then found that the administration\u2019s statements about the matter \u2018confused me and increasingly concerned me.\u2019 He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job, and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay.\u201d\n\nRead the whole thing.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s worth noting that even the Wall Street Journal\u2013not some rightwing blog by any stretch\u2013even says that Comey\u2019s written opening statement proves that President Trump should have fired him. Which is exactly what President Trump did. Read the Journal\u2019s editorial board piece here.\n\nUPDATE 11: 00 A.M. The GOP war room is up and running. Our friends over at the Republican National Committee are cutting videos that shows Comey\u2019s testimony actually fully vindicates President Trump, despite whatever the opposition party media and congressional Democrats say:\n\nPolitico has an RNC talking points document circulated this morning. Read the whole thing here.\n\nPolitico also has a story on how the RNC is taking the lead on pushing back on the highly discredited Comey\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cThe RNC\u2019s role is to support and defend the president and this White House and this week is no different,\u201d Ryan Mahoney, the RNC communications director, told Politico. \u201cAnd we prepare for everything, and we\u2019re prepared for the hearing this week.\u201d\n\nRead the whole piece here.\n\nUPDATE 10:59 A.M. Despite the fact there have been a number of inaccurate pieces throughout the establishment media, the establishment media is celebrating itself.\n\nMost interesting part of Comey memo: How damn good the reporting has been. On. The. Nose. \u2014 Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) June 8, 2017\n\nAlso, fun: Sen. Feinstein wearing a seersucker:\n\nUPDATE 10:57 A.M. Feinstein tells Comey he\u2019s \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cstrong,\u201d then asks him if he was overwhelmed by the Oval Office and wonders why he did not tell the president he was wrong when he brought this subject up with him. He questions whether he would have handled himself the same way if given a second chance.\n\n\u201cI hope there are tapes,\u201d Comey also said of his meetings with Trump, noting he has seen the president\u2019s Tweet about the possibility of tapes.\n\nUPDATE 10:55 A.M. Comey, under questioning from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), says his relationship with Trump got off to a rocky start. He also embarrasses her when she asks him if the reason he was fired had anything to do with the Russia investigation, and he said \u201cyes, because the President said so.\u201d Here in Union Pub, the over-capacity crowd broke out into laughter.\n\nUPDATE 10:53 A.M. Comey just killed the case against Trump over \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d that the media is building, as fast as they began building it. He said Trump saying he hopes Comey lets the investigation of Flynn go was not an order to drop the investigation.\n\nUPDATE 10:51 A.M. The media is highlighting two separate things early on in the Comey bonanza: The fired former FBI director\u2019s use of the word \u201clie\u201d twice, and him being concerned about meetings with President Trump. Establishment media going to do their thing.\n\nComey has now used \"lie\" twice.\n\n1. Referring to WH defaming him and the FBI: \"those were lies\":\n\n2. His concern POTUS might \"lie\" about mtg \u2014 Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) June 8, 2017\n\n\"I was honestly concerned [Pres. Trump] might lie about the nature of our meeting.\" \u2013 James Comey on why he kept records of his meetings pic.twitter.com/ErJrULEjYZ \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) June 8, 2017\n\nFlag: Comey doesn't want to opine on Trump trying to obstruct, but says \"That's a conclusion I'm sure the special counsel will work toward.\" pic.twitter.com/0WVe6dTN8t \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 8, 2017\n\nAn extraordinary thing for an ex-FBI director to say about the President of the United States https://t.co/enD0NBCpSn \u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 10:48 A.M. Since Comey has nothing, and the whole case is falling apart, Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s ex-spokesman Brian Fallon is sadly offering up that special counsel Robert Mueller is now investigating Trump.\n\nWH plan of declaring victory because Trump was not being investigated in January is now moot. Comey made clear Mueller is investing him now \u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 8, 2017\n\nBut, sadly, if they have no evidence Trump colluded with the Russians\u2013probably because it is likely no evidence even exists\u2013then the special prosecutor will find the same thing that Comey found: NOTHING. But, nevertheless Hillary Clinton\u2019s acolytes persisted:\n\nComey said he expects Mueller to assess, as part of his investigation, whether Trump obstructed justice. That would mean he's a subject now. \u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 10:40 A.M. Comey testified that he was \u201cconfused\u201d about being fired by President Trump. And he said Trump spread \u201clies\u201d about the FBI.\n\nComey describes being \u201cconfused\u201d by firing, \u201clies\u201d about FBI being in disarray pic.twitter.com/EEDkxhKwvN \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 10:38 A.M. Since Comey believes that no votes were altered in the 2016 presidential election\u2013he testified he is \u201cconfident\u201d none were\u2013then what is the point of this hearing?\n\n#Comey says that he is \"confident\" that no votes in 2016 were altered #ComeyHearing \u2014 Brooke Singman (@brookefoxnews) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 10:32 A.M. Despite the fact that Comey has nothing, but instead actually ended up in his written opening statement vindicating President Trump, the media elites in Washington are celebrating Comey\u2019s \u201cpoker face\u201d\u2013as if it means something substantive.\n\nJames Comey's poker face is savage. #ComeyTestimony \u2014 Michelle Ruiz (@michelleruiz) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 10:30 A.M. As Comey comes under questions from Burr, our very own Joel Pollak notes that Comey\u2019s altered opening statement was a deeply personal statement furthering the giant nothingburger he put out last night through the committee. Comey failing again so far, just like he did when he was working on the Hillary Clinton email scandal last year.\n\nSo far the Comey testimony is all about him & all about political retribution against the president for firing him. Disgraceful performance \u2014 Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 10:26 A.M. Washington, D.C., elites are having a ball for themselves.\n\nOur intern Alex Clark with these photos:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alexcla59967291/status/872815560442228737\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AlexCla59967291/status/872820653140975616\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AlexCla59967291/status/872821025003778048\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AlexCla59967291/status/872821340662886400\n\nBut Union Pub is hardly the only place off the hook with the parties:\n\nWe moved to another bar in DC. It is packed to capacity for Comey. People are WHISPERING to order their drinks so they can hear the TV. pic.twitter.com/xoFUcEHgun \u2014 Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) June 8, 2017\n\nThere are many more. We\u2019ll get updates up soon.\n\nUPDATE 10:20 A.M. Audible gasps of disappointment were heard throughout Union Pub as Comey said he will not re-read his opening statement published online last night, a statement that completely vindicated President Trump.\n\nComey, however, admits that the President can fire him whenever he wants. He also says that he heard Donald Trump thought he was doing a \u201cgreat job.\u201d\n\nBut here in Union Pub, cheers erupted as a champagne bottle was popped open for more Washington, D.C., mimosas.\n\nUPDATE 10:17 A.M. As Warner wraps his righteous opening statement, in which he stated \u201cthis is not a witch hunt\u201d and \u201cthis is not fake news,\u201d the STANDING ROOM ONLY crowd at Union Pub laughs as Comey is forced by the chairman to stand and be sworn in under oath for his testimony.\n\nUPDATE 10:15 A.M. This real life parody is getting more and more out of control. Fired ex-U.S. Attorney from the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara is joining Comey in the hearing room.\n\nYes, that is Preet Bharara sitting behind James Comey. Banquo's ghost. \u2014 Charles P. Pierce (@CharlesPPierce) June 8, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, our COVFEFE LIVEWIRE has earned the attention of New York Times media correspondent Michael Grynbaum.\n\nBreitbart\u2019s @mboyle1 is at Union Pub in DC to cover \u201cthe reaction of the crowd of Washington elites\u201d https://t.co/RcRAohgI6N \u2014 Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 10:12 A.M. Mark Warner, the leading Democrat on the Senate committee, opens up with his opening statement saying that this hearing has drawn focus from a lot of Washington, D.C., and that ordinary Americans really don\u2019t care and aren\u2019t paying attention. Maybe Congress could focus on real policy issues when this charade is over, but that would probably be asking too much of our elected representatives.\n\nUPDATE 10:11 A.M. Fox News is reporting that President Trump is expected to issue a statement disputing parts of Comey\u2019s testimony.\n\nUPDATE 10:10 A.M. Burr to Comey: \u201cThe American people need to hear your side of the story.\u201d\n\nUPDATE 10:04 A.M. As Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, opens the hearing, a hush comes over the crowd inside Union Pub. COVFEFE everyone! Here we go.\n\nUPDATE 10:03 A.M. James Comey has walked into the room where is going to testify in the Senate Intelligence Committee. Folks at Union Pub don\u2019t really seem to care much as they are engaged in deep conversation, very loudly, so loud one cannot hear the television.\n\nUPDATE 10:02 A.M. Comey\u2019s written testimony published last night basically proved he had nothing on Trump, and this whole case is going nowhere. Even anti-Trump Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) admits that, saying none of this makes any sense on TV this morning.\n\n\"Nobody in their right mind who believed they had a case, would take their star witness & allow them to go before the nation\" \u2014 Sen. Graham pic.twitter.com/Si1UAziuZm \u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE 10:00 A.M. Union Pub is up and running as the Comey hearing is about to begin.\n\nAll the TV\u2019s in the bar are carrying Fox News live.\n\nIf you're wondering, #ComeyHearing will be in Senate Hart Office Building tomorrow, only 1000 feet from @UnionPub. Guaranteed DC celebs \u2014 Barred in DC (@barredindc) June 8, 2017\n\nThe place is packed.\n\nYes, our White House correspondent Charlie Spiering is correct! Breitbart News will be running this COMEY CRAZY COVFEFE LIVEWIRE live throughout the hearing and festivities all day from Union Pub! Our Pentagon Correspondent Kristina Wong is here with us, as well as our intern Alex Clark. More Breitbart staff are expected to join throughout the day!\n\n*Confirmed* Matt Boyle will be watching the Comey hearing live at Union Pub \u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) June 8, 2017\n\nBreitbart Live From Union Pubhttps://t.co/zrcTQsYnGp \u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) June 8, 2017\n\nUPDATE: 9:52 A.M. Owen, a federal government employee who did not want us to publish his last name but is here partying as Comey is set to testify, said about the crowd size here \u201cit\u2019s about what you\u2019d expect\u2013people here [in Washington] are easily more engaged than everyone else in the country. It\u2019s a symbol of a healthy, vibrant democracy.\u201d Bloody Mary\u2019s and Mimosos and beers by the pint are being poured by the hundreds already and Comey has not yet taken the stand.\n\nUPDATE 9:50 A.M. Breitbart\u2019s summer intern Alex Clark joins us here and spoke with Union Pub\u2019s general manager Ashley Saunders who told us \u201cI\u2019m way too busy\u2013I\u2019m swamped\u201d when he asked if she could do a brief interview before the hearing begins. Union Pub is packed to the brim with Washingtonians celebrating Comey\u2019s testimony.",
