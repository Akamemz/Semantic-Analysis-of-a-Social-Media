    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify Tuesday before the same Senate committee that heard from former FBI Director James Comey last week , keeping national attention on a Russia investigation that White House officials have been trying to push to the background .\nMr . Sessions earlier this year was forced to recuse himself from the Justice Department \u2019 s investigation of Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election after he belatedly disclosed two meetings with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Mr. Comey , during his testimony last week , raised the possibility of other concerns about Mr. Sessions \u2019 s dealings with Russia during the campaign , saying Federal Bureau of Investigation leadership before the recusal was \u201c aware of facts that I can \u2019 t discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic . \u201d\nIn a weekend letter , Mr . Sessions canceled previously planned public testimony before House and Senate appropriations panels . He said that the testimony by Mr. Comey , whom Mr. Trump fired in early May , made it \u201c important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum , \u201d which he said was the Senate Intelligence Committee .\nIt is unclear whether the intelligence committee hearing will be held in public .\nThe Comey appearance dominated a week in which the administration said it had hoped to highlight its stated goal to improve the nation \u2019 s infrastructure . This week , President Donald Trump will make expansion of apprenticeship programs the center of his labor policy , aimed at filling a record level of open jobs and drawing back Americans who have left the workforce .\nThe president \u2019 s schedule includes a visit to Wisconsin on Tuesday , where he will stop by a technical college\u2014the same day Mr . Sessions is on Capitol Hill .\nBut Mr. Trump is helping to keep the Russia probe front and center . Last Friday , he blasted Mr. Comey in a joint news conference with the Romanian president .\nIn a tweet Sunday morning , Mr. Trump called Mr. Comey \u201c cowardly \u201d for asking a friend to tell reporters about conversations he had with the president . During those conversations , Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump had talked about the investigation of former national security adviser Mike Flynn \u2019 s ties to Russia and had said , \u201c I hope you can let this go. \u201d The president denies having done that .\n\u201c I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible , \u201d Mr. Trump said Sunday morning . \u201c Totally illegal ? Very \u2018 cowardly ! \u2019 \u201d\nMany legal experts say there was nothing illegal about Mr. Comey \u2019 s actions , given that the material wasn \u2019 t classified and that he was no longer a government employee . Mr. Comey testified last week that he asked his friend to share the content of the conversations so it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel , which it did , when former FBI Director Robert Mueller was named to the post .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s tweets are drawing rebukes even from people in his own party .\n\u201c I think the worst problem this president has in this instance is the president himself , \u201d former Rep. Mike Rogers ( R. , Mich. ) said Sunday on CNN . \u201c If he would stop talking about the small-ball individual tweets , attacking Director Comey personally , I think we could get beyond this . \u201d\nSen. Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , speaking on CBS , said Mr. Trump was obstructing his own agenda . Addressing Mr. Trump directly , Mr. Graham said : \u201c You may be the first president in history to go down because you can \u2019 t stop inappropriately talking about an investigation that if you just were quiet , would clear you . \u201d\nBut part of the Trump legal strategy is to call into question Mr. Comey \u2019 s credibility . Jay Sekulow , a member of Mr. Trump \u2019 s legal team , pointed to statements regarding the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s use of a private email server while secretary of state .\n\u201c James Comey \u2019 s credibility has been brought into question on multiple occasions during the Clinton investigation , and here ultimately the special counsel has to weigh that as he does his investigation , \u201d Mr. Sekulow said Sunday on ABC . Mr. Comey has defended his handling of the Clinton email probe .\nBeyond his contacts with Russian officials , Mr . Sessions also may face questions about why he didn \u2019 t do more to shield Mr. Comey , who worked for him , from Mr. Trump \u2019 s private outreach .\nMr. Comey told the Senate panel that the president had Mr . Sessions and others leave the room so he could talk to Mr. Comey alone , and that is when Mr. Trump allegedly pressured him on the Flynn investigation .\nMr. Comey also said he later appealed to Mr . Sessions to ensure that he would not again be left alone with Mr. Trump , but that Mr . Sessions didn \u2019 t respond . A Justice Department spokesman rejected that characterization and said Mr . Sessions told Mr. Comey the agency needed to be careful about \u201c following appropriate policies \u201d regarding such contacts .\nMr . Sessions was a vocal advocate for Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign , and his staffers and former aides have taken jobs in the White House and across the administration . Still , Mr. Trump was upset after Mr . Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe , one White House official said . The president , who has denied any involvement with Russia election hacking , viewed Mr. Sessions \u2019 s decision as a sign of weakness , the official said .\nMr . Sessions is also expected to face Senate questioning about why he was involved in firing Mr. Comey given that he had recused himself from questions related to Russia . As FBI director , Mr. Comey was overseeing that investigation .\nIn an interview with NBC News last month , Mr. Trump said he was thinking about \u201c this Russia thing \u201d when he decided to fire Mr. Comey , but the White House initially cited a recommendation for termination by Mr . Sessions and a deputy attorney general based on Mr. Comey \u2019 s broader job performance .\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D. , N.Y. ) said Sunday that this is one of several questions Mr . Sessions should be asked to answer and said it should be done in a public session .\n\u201c The president said Comey was fired because of Russia . How does that fit in with his recusal ? It doesn \u2019 t seem to stand up well to me , \u201d Mr. Schumer said on CBS .\nThe attorney general also drew some criticism from Democrats for the en masse firings of U.S. attorneys , including Preet Bharara in Manhattan , earlier this year . Mr. Bharara said Sunday on ABC that Mr. Trump called him three times following his election and fired him less than a day after he refused to return the third call from the newly elected president .\n\u201c It appeared to be that he was trying to cultivate some kind of relationship , \u201d Mr. Bharara said in the TV interview .\n\u2014Michael C.
