    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) The Supreme Court appeared closely divided along ideological lines during oral arguments Monday in a case that could determine President Barack Obama 's legacy on immigration .\nConservative justices questioned Obama 's authority to use executive actions to shield some 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation . Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito seemed particularly concerned with language in the administration 's guidance that said the program 's recipients would be `` lawfully present , '' which they suggested would contradict immigration law .\n`` How is it possible to lawfully work in the United States without lawfully being in the United States ? '' Alito asked .\nRoberts added : `` I mean , they 're lawfully present , and yet , they 're present in violation of the law ? ''\nLiberals on the bench seemed sympathetic to the administration 's arguments . Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted at one point that there are 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the country and Congress has provided funds for removing about 4 million . `` So inevitably , priorities have to be set , '' she said .\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor said there are not enough resources to deport everyone . `` They are here whether we want them or not , '' she said .\nObama announced the moves to great fanfare in late 2014 , as a response to congressional inaction on immigration reform . But a federal court blocked them after Texas and 25 other states sued .\nBusloads of immigrants ' rights activists -- some of them undocumented -- appeared on the court 's plaza to support the policies . The moves are meant to shield them from deportation and allow them work permits .\nNancy Garcia , a U.S. citizen from Milwaukee , who was protesting with the Wisconsin group Voces de la Frontera ( Voices from the Border ) , said she became active on the issue after Wisconsin lawmakers tried to crack down on undocumented immigrants .\n`` We 're not drug lords . We 're not rapists . We 're good people , '' Garcia said .\nTea Party Patriots member Gregg Cummings said he arrived at 6 a.m. to find a spot in front of the court to protest the executive actions . Cummings , from Lamoni , Iowa , said he is concerned about the prospect of Obama 's Supreme Court nominee , Judge Merrick Garland , changing the ideological balance of the court .\n`` Our number one purpose of being here is supporting the senators better standing strong on no votes on the new Supreme Court justice , '' he said .\nCritics of Obama 's moves say they are part of a pattern of the White House looking to go around the Republican Congress .\n`` Basically the President has stepped in and taken over what normally would be associated with Congress , '' Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in an interview . `` Congress makes the laws . ''\nRoberts also seemed concerned with the scope of the government 's argument defending Obama 's moves . `` Under your argument , could the President grant deferred removal to every unlawful -- unlawfully present alien in the United States right now ? '' he asked Solicitor General Donald Verrilli .\nAt one point , Justice Anthony Kennedy suggested that the president might have strayed into Congress ' territory . `` It 's as if -- that the President is setting the policy and Congress is executing it , '' he said . `` That 's just upside down . ''\nThe GOP Congress was involved at oral arguments as well . The House of Representatives , in an unusual move , intervened in the case against the administration , and had 15 minutes before the eight justices .\nThat only eight justices are hearing the case -- due to the death in February of Justice Antonin Scalia -- could impact the final result . A split court between the four Democratic-appointed justices and four GOP-appointed justices would mean the programs remain blocked and the case is sent back to the district court in Texas that blocked them in the first place .\nFor the administration , a key argument before the court is to say that the states do not have the legal right to bring the case in the first place . If it can convince a majority of justices on that issue , the court may not even get to the merits of the immigration debate .\nAll eyes were on Roberts , who has in past cases sometimes limited who can bring challenges to court . On Monday , he asked some critical questions of the government 's position , but it was unclear how interested he might be in dismissing the case on standing .\n`` The question is : Does Texas have the right to bring this case ? '' said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin . `` Texas says if you give legal status to these people , then we 'll have to give them drivers licenses . The federal government says there 's nothing in this law about drivers licenses . This law is directed entirely at the immigrants themselves , it does not impose any obligations on the states . So the states should not have the right to challenge it . That 's the standing argument . I think the Obama administration thinks they have a better chance at winning over one of the conservatives on standing than they do on the merits of the case . ''\nElizabeth Wydra , President of the Constitutional Accountability Center , who filed a brief in support of the government says she would n't write off the chief justice on the merits of the case or on the issue of standing .\n`` On the merits , Chief Justice Roberts ' concerns seemed to be alleviated when the Solicitor General clarified that undocumented immigrants\u2014given relief under the programs -- are simply afforded deferred action but none the less are subject to removal proceedings at any time the executive changes its enforcement priorities , '' she said .\nShould it win on that count , the injunction would be lifted , and the programs would be able to go into effect during the final months of the Obama presidency .\nHowever , because the actions can be changed or reversed by the next President , immigrants would have to decide whether to come forward for the remaining months of the Obama administration or risk doing so with the possibility of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz in the White House .\n`` There 's no question that the ultimate fate of the deferred action policy hangs in the balance of the upcoming election , '' said Stephen I.
