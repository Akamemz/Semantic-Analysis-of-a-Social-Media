    "content": "( CNN ) The battle over same-sex marriage may have drawn to a dramatic close Friday at the Supreme Court . But as several justices noted in forceful dissents , the war between religious and LGBT rights is far from over .\nIn a landmark opinion , a divided Supreme Court ruled that states can not ban same-sex marriage , establishing a new civil right and handing gay and lesbian advocates a long-sought victory .\nPresident Barack Obama , speaking after the highly anticipated ruling , urged those celebrating to keep in mind that many Americans oppose same-sex marriage `` based on sincere and deeply held beliefs . '' Those beliefs , he suggested , should remain a protected part of the country 's `` deep commitment to religious freedom . ''\nStill , fierce battles over religious and LGBT rights , like the one fought this spring in Indiana , seem likely to intensify across the country after Obergefell v. Hodges .\nWhile polls show that a majority of religious Americans now support same-sex marriage , many prominent groups -- such as the Catholic Church , the Southern Baptist Convention and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- do not . Leaders from those groups pledged on Friday to seek legal means to shield their beliefs from state interference .\nIn his sweeping decision , Justice Anthony Kennedy , who wrote for the majority , briefly mentioned faith groups ' right to object to same-sex marriage .\n`` The First Amendment ensures that religions , those who adhere to religious doctrines and others have protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths , '' Kennedy said .\n`` It must be emphasized that religions , and those who adhere to religious doctrines , may continue to advocate with utmost , sincere conviction that , by divine precepts , same-sex marriage should not be condoned . ''\nBut more conservative justices and a number of religious groups chided Kennedy for failing to mention the First Amendment 's `` free exercise '' clause .\nReligious rights ( and rites ) are n't limited to preaching and teaching , they argued . They also entail individuals ' and organizations ' `` free exercise '' of faith , a wide swath of activities that run from sacred ceremonies to performing charitable works and running businesses according to religious principles .\n`` Religious liberty is about freedom of action in matters of religion generally , '' Justice Clarence Thomas said in his dissent , `` and the scope of that liberty is directly correlated to the civil restraints placed upon religious practice . ''\nHe dismissed the majority 's nod toward religious liberty as a `` weak gesture , '' arguing that the ruling could have `` ruinous consequences . ''\n`` In our society , marriage is not simply a governmental institution ; it is a religious institution as well , '' Thomas said . `` Today 's decision might change the former , but it can not change the latter . ''\nFriday 's decision makes it `` all but inevitable , '' the conservative justice said , that competing definitions of marriage will come into conflict . Thomas suggested that pastors and churches will be confronted with demands to participate in and endorse same-sex marriages .\nThere is historical precedent for such demands , Thomas said , citing Virginia laws that once imposed criminal penalties on pastors who presided over mixed-race marriages .\nChief Justice John Roberts said `` hard questions '' will arise when people of faith exercise their religious liberty in ways that conflict with the new right to same-sex marriage .\nWhat happens , the chief justice asked , when a religious college provides student housing only to heterosexual couples ? Or a faith-based adoption agency refuses to place children with same-sex spouses ? Would both lose their tax exemptions ?\n`` There is little doubt that these and similar questions will soon be before this Court , '' Roberts continued . `` Unfortunately , people of faith can take no comfort in the treatment they receive from the majority today . ''\nJustice Antonin Scalia , in his signature scathing style , took the argument even further , accusing his colleagues of playing God .\nThe conservative justice said that Friday 's ruling on same-sex marriage `` is not of special importance to me . ''\n`` It is of overwhelming importance , however , who it is that rules me , '' Scalia said . `` Today 's decree says that my Ruler , and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast , is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court . ''\nArchbishop William Lori of Baltimore , the U.S. Catholic bishops ' point-man on religious rights , said Friday 's ruling will affect `` thousands '' of state and local statutes across the country . The archbishop said he could foresee `` a lot of legal controversies in terms of the way we organize and run our ministries . ''\nMost troubling for the Catholic Church , Lori said in a conference call with the media , is that while ruling recognizes religious groups ' right to free speech , it does n't acknowledge `` the right to follow our teachings when we are intersecting with the broader society . ''\nEvangelicals , too , who make up about 25 % of the country 's population , pledged to fight the legal implications of Friday 's ruling .\n`` In the coming years , evangelical institutions could be pressed to sacrifice their sacred beliefs about marriage and sexuality in order to accommodate whatever demands the culture and law require , '' dozens of prominent evangelicals said in a joint statement .\n`` We will not allow the government to coerce or infringe upon the rights of institutions to live by the sacred belief that only men and women can enter into marriage . ''\nOne of the statement 's signees , Russell Moore , president of the Southern Baptist Convention 's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission , called `` religious liberty '' the `` next front in the skirmish in American life . ''\nThe skirmish will likely endure for years , Moore said at a press conference on Friday , with casualties on both sides .\n`` One of the most tragic results we could possibly see is an unrelenting cultural war from progressives toward those who dissent because of deeply held religious convictions .
