But David Kendall, an attorney for Clinton, said the 900 pages of emails previously provided to the panel cover its request.\n\nKendall also informed the committee that Clinton\u2019s emails from her time at the State Department have been permanently erased.\n\nGowdy said that Clinton\u2019s response to the subpoena means he and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) will now contemplate new legal actions against Clinton.\n\n\u201cAfter seeking and receiving a two week extension from the Committee, Secretary Clinton failed to provide a single new document to the subpoena issued by the Committee and refused to provide her private server to the Inspector General for the State Department or any other independent arbiter for analysis,\u201d Gowdy said.\n\nClinton previously said she decided to delete the emails after her lawyers reviewed the server for work-related correspondence. She said the deletion of private emails occurred \u201cat the end\u201d of that review.\n\nIn a letter provided to the committee, Kendall said Clinton would not be turning over the server to a third-party for review and that the emails no longer exist on the private server located in her New York home.\n\n\u201cThere is no basis to support the proposed third-party review of the server that hosted the hdr22@clintonemail.com account,\u201d Kendall wrote. \u201cTo avoid prolonging a discussion that would be academic, I have confirmed with the secretary\u2019s IT support that no emails\u2026..for the time period January 21, 2009 through February 1, 2013 reside on the server or on any back-up systems associated with the server.\u201d\n\nThe broad subpoena from Gowdy included any emails relating to Libya, weapons located in the country, the Benghazi attacks and administration statements following the attacks on the compound.\n\nShortly after the New York Times reported on Clinton\u2019s private email use, she requested that the State Department make public all documents from her time at the agency. The State Department has said it\u2019s working though these documents \u2013 which include 55,000 pages \u2013 for review.\n\nThe agency has also said it will focus on vetting the 300 pages the Benghazi Committee has already received. Kendall said the State Department is \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to respond to requests for additional documents, a sign from Clinton\u2019s camp that they believe she has fully responded to any standing legal requests.\n\nKendall added, \u201cThus, there are no hdr22@clintonemail.com e-mails from Secretary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized.\u201d\n\nThe letter added that requests from a second email, hrod17@clintonemail.com, are not germane as that address was \u201cnot an address that existed during Secretary Clinton\u2019s tenure.\u201d\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi panel, said Clinton\u2019s response \u201cconfirms\u201d that the former secretary of state has provided all documents related to the Benghazi attacks to the committee.\n\n\u201cThis confirms what we all knew\u2014that Secretary Clinton already produced her official records to the State Department, that she did not keep her personal emails, and that the Select Committee has already obtained her emails relating to the attacks in Benghazi,\u201d said Cummings (D-Md.). \u201cIt is time for the Committee to stop this political charade and instead make these documents public and schedule Secretary Clinton\u2019s public testimony now.\u201d\n\nThe move all but ensures congressional Republicans\u2019 focus on Clinton will intensify.
