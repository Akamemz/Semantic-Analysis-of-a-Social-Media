    "content": "Bill Clinton tried to fix America 's health care problems and was shot down by Congress . Barack Obama got his solution enacted only to find most people did n't like it . Republicans who voted repeatedly to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something far better have found it fiendishly hard to agree on how .\nIt could be that our health care problems do n't get solved because of partisanship , incompetence , corruption or dishonesty among our elected officials . Or it could be because those problems are not soluble .\nOh , some of them can be solved , for sure . But not all at once , and not within the constraints of our political environment . We have trouble accepting that . So we muddle along with a system that is riddled with flaws and causes a lot of dissatisfaction .\nThe changing perceptions of the Affordable Care Act are a marvel to behold . It was so controversial that it barely got through Congress in 2010 . Long before it was fully implemented , it was unpopular , and it mostly remained so .\nRepublicans ran against it with great success in the congressional elections in 2010 and 2014 , and Donald Trump won last year after calling it a `` disaster '' that he would repeal and replace with something `` much better and much less expensive . '' As one of Ernest Hemingway 's characters said , `` Is n't it pretty to think so ? ''\nBut something shocking happened on the path to the repeal of Obamacare : It began to look better . In the latest poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation , 49 percent of Americans said they liked it , the highest figure since 2010 , and just 44 percent did n't , down from 53 percent in 2014 .\nWhat accounts for the shift in sentiment ? One factor is that when it comes to their health care , Americans nurse a deep distrust of change . They may not be satisfied with what they have , but they assume anything different will be worse .\nAnother is that a lot of them really did n't know what the ACA did but disliked it because they associated it with a president they opposed .
