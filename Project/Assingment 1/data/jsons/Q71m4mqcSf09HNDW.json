    "content": "There is a big buzz at the Loudermilk Conference Center in downtown Atlanta as a gathering called Paradigm Shift 2.0 : Black Women Confronting HIV , Health and Social Justice gets underway . Three hundred registered participants have journeyed from across the country to discuss the many challenges and possibilities facing black women and girls . The second day \u2019 s morning keynote was delivered by radical activist and professor Angela Davis . The hype has been building exponentially for lunchtime guest speaker Stacey Abrams .\nWhen she is finally introduced the women shout and leap to their feet . Young women stand on chairs , camera phones flash . Abrams , who appears both amused and slightly disturbed by the fuss over her , takes control of the chaotic scene . I \u2019 ve witnessed this level of affection for very few political leaders in the Democratic circles I \u2019 ve been in since the 1980s . They have the last names Clinton ( both Hillary and Bill ) , Sanders , Warren , Jackson and Obama ( both Michelle and Barack ) .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to make sure there is peace in this room , \u201d Abrams says . \u201c Y \u2019 all are about to annoy each other with these cameras , so I \u2019 m going to stand up and I \u2019 m going to stand in front of each group of you . Take pictures so you can put your camera down . \u201d\nPandemonium ensues as she walks to the far left of the stage , like a runway supermodel , stops on a dime , poses , tilts her head slightly and smiles . Camera flashes explode . She next pivots and walks slowly to the center of the stage , freezes there and repeats the pose . Again , the flashes explode . Abrams is summoning her inner actress , and she is both enjoying the moment and getting through it to get to the conversation . She then pivots and walks to the far right of the stage , same . You wonder whether she has done this before , because it is not necessarily what one would expect from a 46-year-old politician who was nearly elected the first black female governor in U.S. history . She lost by fewer than 2 percentage points in the 2018 Georgia race riddled with allegations of voter suppression . Before that , she was a state legislator who had served as a leader in the Georgia General Assembly for a decade . Now her name is on political pundits \u2019 shortlists of potential running mates for Joe Biden . She also happens to have predicted that she \u2019 ll be elected president by 2040 .\nJust as quickly Abrams leaves the runway and returns to politics . Taking her seat with the moderator , she dives into why she is here and why she believes the leadership of women matters . \u201c We live in a time where we have purported leaders who claim to speak for us but do not know us , and in that ignorance , they make decisions that are designed not for our success but for our demise , \u201d she says . \u201c So my deep suspicion is that some people are lying when they say they care about us . \u201d\nThe balloon of silence in the meeting room is punctured , time and again , by \u201c Amen \u201d and \u201c Preach \u201d and \u201c You go , girl . \u201d\n\u201c When I ran for governor , I did not run simply for me . We went around this state to all 159 counties , and everywhere we went we talked about the power of people to make a choice , \u201d Abrams tells the crowd . \u201c On November 6th , when malfeasance and incompetence and my opponent who was a cartoon villain stole the voices of Georgians when he purged 1.4 million voters and oversaw the shutdown of 214 precincts that left 50,000 to 60,000 people without the ability to vote , when Georgia had the longest lines in the nation and the highest rejection rates of absentee ballots and provisional ballots , \u201d Abrams continues , \u201c It was not just about me . He was doing that to Georgians . \u201d\nAbrams pauses for a moment , allowing her words to simmer . The audience cheers as she smiles broadly .\n\u201c And the thing is , if I had fought back and said , \u2018 I am going to contest this election and make myself governor , \u2019 then everyone who loved me and stood with me would have thought , \u2018 Well , this is about her fight. \u2019 My responsibility was instead to focus on the right to vote and not my right to be governor . I had no right to be governor , but I have an obligation to do the work that I said I would do if I were governor . \u201d\nVoting rights . Responsibility . Possibilities . These are the ideas and values that come up often with Stacey Abrams and her team . I heard them over and over again during the weeks I followed her around earlier this year , in Miami , in New York , in Atlanta , and listened to her give interviews and hold public conversations . She has opened up a nationwide dialogue about voting rights but has also been accused by political pundits of too aggressively pushing herself as Biden \u2019 s VP choice . What Abrams seems to know is that she must be persuasive and make her own case for her fitness for higher office \u2014 and history would suggest that she \u2019 s right to do so . Commentators have wondered whether Abrams , who has not yet won a statewide election , would be ready to serve as vice president .\nWhether or not she \u2019 s chosen as Biden \u2019 s running mate , she has moved into a unique space in American politics . DuBose Porter , former chair of the Georgia Democratic Party , told me she is \u201c brilliant , \u201d praise that comes in spite of what some view as a relatively thin political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 . But we live in an era in which an extensive political background hardly matters anymore \u2014 Donald Trump had never been elected to office before his 2016 win . Like former South Bend , Ind. , mayor Pete Buttigieg , whose long-shot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination made him a household name , Abrams doesn \u2019 t have the baggage of years of votes on Capitol Hill ; she doesn \u2019 t have a fraught record on criminal justice that comes with having served as an attorney general , nor does she face the accusation of being out of touch because she has spent years in Washington .\nAt this conference it \u2019 s easy to be reminded that black women have long been the most loyal supporters of the Democratic Party . They carried Doug Jones to his senatorial victory in Alabama in 2018 and were key to kick-starting Biden \u2019 s presidential campaign when it was thought to be dead , helping to lift him to victory in South Carolina \u2019 s Democratic primary . So perhaps it was only a matter of time before a black woman , especially a black woman from the American South , would rise up as a national leader and a power broker for democracy in a way we have not often seen , aside from Fannie Lou Hamer \u2019 s brief but landmark speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention and Shirley Chisholm \u2019 s historic \u201c unbought and unbossed \u201d run for president in 1972 .\nAbrams \u2019 s roots and family history have echoes of the civil rights movement , and her Southern heritage is key to her appeal . It helps explain why she has soared to prominence while serving as a standard-bearer for a new kind of multicultural and multigenerational agenda . In the last presidential campaign cycle , the racial breakdown of Democrats outside of the South was roughly 60 percent white , 17 percent African American and 23 percent Latino , according to a 2016 Blair Center Poll . In the states that form the South , those numbers were 38 percent white , 37 percent African American and 25 percent Latino . In her runs for the Georgia legislature and governor , Abrams built a coalition that excited this new Georgia . She believes she can do the same on the national stage .\nAbrams \u2019 s special adviser , Chelsey Hall , tells me that in the 2018 gubernatorial race the campaign had to contend with doubters and \u201c convince her own people that she was viable and electable for that position . Even the people that had been supporting since she became Democratic minority leader [ of the General Assembly ] or her first race . There were so many times where we would have emotional moments during call time because people that she trusted , that had been supporting her since 2006 , 2011 were saying , \u2018 But you are a black woman . How is this possible ? \u2019 \u201d\nAbrams is the first black woman in U.S. history to have won the gubernatorial nomination of either major party . She garnered more votes than any Democrat who has run statewide in Georgia . She lost by just over 50,000 votes to Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp .\nKemp was not only her opponent , but his office oversaw everything to do with voting , including how the voter registration rolls were purged . It would be like Tom Brady not only being the quarterback of his team , but the referee and the scorekeeper as well . Kemp \u2019 s office cut nearly 700,000 names from the rolls in the two years leading to the election , and more than 200 polling places were closed , primarily in poor and minority neighborhoods .\nAbrams chose not to concede to Kemp , because she believes voters were disenfranchised . She has said she went through all the stages of grief for 10 days and then got back to work . She has spent the time since leveraging the power she gained and deciding how she wants to use it .\nA mural in Atlanta in April . Abrams moved to the city with her family when she was a teenager in 1989 . ( Elijah Nouvelage for The \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nStacey Abrams lives in a simple blue townhouse in a diverse middle-class neighborhood on the east side of Atlanta . Her modestly furnished home is filled with a wide range of books , including the four she \u2019 s currently absorbing : \u201c The City We Became \u201d by N.K . Jemisin , \u201c Huey Long \u201d by T. Harry Williams , \u201c A Problem From Hell \u201d by Samantha Power and \u201c A Place for Us \u201d by Fatima Farheen Mirza . There is art , some centered on black America , but also pieces from her travels internationally that are Australian aboriginal , South Korean , French , Chinese . Framed photographs of family and friends are spread throughout as well .\nThis home is a major expansion of the Gulfport , Miss. , house she grew up in , where her family of eight had to convert the dining room to a bedroom for her two brothers , Richard and Walter . It feels like a sanctuary to protect Abrams from the many demands on her time . Abrams , who is single with no children , arrived in Atlanta as a 15-year-old in 1989 when her parents decided to attend Methodist divinity school . Aside from stints for graduate school at the University of Texas ( master \u2019 s in public affairs ) and Yale Law School in Connecticut , Atlanta is where she has mostly lived since departing Mississippi . I ask Abrams about her life in Mississippi .\n\u201c I only remember living on South Street in Gulfport , Mississippi , \u201d she says . \u201c 2020 South Street was a red-brick house with azalea bushes that ran along the front . There was an oak tree in the front yard , and it had such big limbs and so many leaves that grass couldn \u2019 t grow underneath it . But you could climb that tree , and you could see everything . \u201d\nAbrams \u2019 s parents picked that street so that she and her siblings could attend one of the better schools in the area . It was one of many lessons she learned growing up about the division of resources along racial lines and navigating those divisions . \u201c It was less a black community than we lived on a \u2018 black street. \u2019 There were these two streets that were adjacent to the middle-class , predominantly white part of town to get zoned into the middle-class school . ... We lived on the two streets that were all black until the Brooks family came . ... All the streets got nicer names as you went further in , so those were predominantly white . My parents understood that education was the essential ingredient to success for both of them . My mom is the only one of her siblings to finish high school . My dad is the first man in his family to go to college . \u201d\nAbrams excelled in academics and was always in advanced studies , which meant she was routinely the only black student in her classes . Because one of the two TV channels that the family received was PBS , Abrams watched that network religiously , read the dictionary and devoured the books and encyclopedias her parents managed to buy for their children .\n\u201c I think my mom is the reason I started reading the encyclopedia and the dictionary , because I would ask questions and she was like , \u2018 Go look it up. \u2019 \u201d she says . \u201c Finally I figured if I wanted to know everything , I just needed to read everything . \u201d\nAbrams \u2019 s roots and family history have echoes of the civil rights movement , and her Southern heritage is key to her appeal .\nAbrams also tells me that she and her sisters like to say their dad \u2014 a track star in college who once had pro football tryouts with the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys \u2014 is the first feminist they ever met . \u201c He will tell you before anyone else will that he thinks my mom is the smartest person he knows . ... It is a true belief that there is no division of capacity that comes along with gender . He raised us with that understanding , and we never questioned it . \u201d\nHer interests were vast : physics , chemistry , history , psychology , mythologies , biographies , poetry . During our conversation Abrams recalls speeches , debates and poetry that she studied in her youth , and recites from memory the opening stanza of Paul Laurence Dunbar \u2019 s poem \u201c We Wear the Mask . \u201d\n\u201c When I was in 10th grade I was having a conversation with a friend , and I said , \u2018 I hate country music. \u2019 And she said , \u2018 Why ? \u2019 And I didn \u2019 t have an answer . So I made myself listen to every radio station on the radio for two weeks each . But then when I engaged people ... I could use that complexity of my musical likes to talk . And the same thing was true from what I read . My mom and dad basically let me read ; if I could reach it , I could read it . \u201d\nWhen the family moved to Atlanta , Abrams ended up at a performing arts high school , where she became her class \u2019 s valedictorian . College was next . \u201c I applied to Spelman , Swarthmore , Vassar , Sarah Lawrence . I was leaving the South , \u201d she says , recalling that the South was all she knew , and she wanted a different experience . \u201c I only applied to Spelman because my mother tricked me into it . \u201d\nAt Spelman College , a historically black women \u2019 s college in Atlanta , she had double majors in physics and philosophy , with a minor in theater . It was the first time she would be steeped so broadly in black life and culture outside of her family home . Johnnetta Cole , who later led the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art and was the school \u2019 s president at the time , became Abrams \u2019 s mentor . Cole encouraged young Abrams \u2014 who was perpetually raising her voice \u2014 to get involved , attend meetings and bring about change . Abrams did that and then some , on and off campus . When the Rodney King verdict came down in Los Angeles in April 1992 , acquitting the four police officers who brutally beat the motorist , Atlanta and many other U.S. cities exploded into protest and violent rebellion . A couple of months later , Abrams was in the back of a protest , watching , when some young black folks burned the Georgia state flag because it contained the Confederate symbol ( she did not personally hold the flag as it burned , but she organized the protest and obtained the permit ) , a fact that her opponents raised during her run for governor . Soon after that incident , Spelman hosted a town hall with Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson in which Abrams dissed the work of the first African American elected to lead a major Southern city .\n\u201c I berated him for not doing enough for young people , \u201d Abrams recalls . \u201c I was very irate and then ... I gave them my number , and I gave my parents \u2019 number . \u2018 [ Here \u2019 s ] where I \u2019 m going to be , if you have any questions. \u2019 \u201d Jackson was very offended and questioned what Abrams knew . It was a bold move for a young woman to challenge a trailblazing black man who was seen as an important leader throughout the South . She told him that she attended city council meetings and zoning meetings and that she knew he wasn \u2019 t doing enough . The town hall aired on local television . Despite the confrontation , when Jackson created an Office of Youth Services the next year , 1993 , she was the only undergrad college student hired . It was her first taste of life in politics .\nAfter Spelman and graduate and law school , Abrams became a tax lawyer because working in the mayor \u2019 s office showed her that if she wanted to be a public servant , she needed to learn how the entire system worked . At age 29 Abrams was appointed deputy city attorney by Mayor Shirley Franklin , another history-making Southern black politician . Franklin was the first woman to hold the post and the first black woman to be elected mayor of a major Southern city . Abrams ran for and was elected as a state representative in 2006 ; she rose quickly in the Georgia legislature and became Democratic Party minority leader in 2011 .\nShe calls herself a \u201c pragmatist , \u201d which is a necessary asset for a Democrat in a state long controlled by Republicans . She also embraces the label \u201c progressive \u201d ; in the race for governor she campaigned on expanding Medicaid . Ideologically , she falls somewhere between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden : As her state \u2019 s Democratic leader , she worked on behalf of low-income and middle-class residents , defeating sales taxes ; she championed reproductive rights , supported military families and protected public education and Medicaid from budget cuts ; and as a mentor she launched a program to train young people in Democratic Party politics . In my reporting I have heard grumblings that some black Democrats in Georgia did not feel Abrams was always with them in political fights , but there \u2019 s wide agreement that she is focused on taking action and getting results . To do that , Minority Leader Abrams crossed the aisle often to work with Republicans . One of her admirers is Nathan Deal , the former two-term Republican governor of Georgia .\n\u201c I thought that my working relationship with her , and she with my staff , was very good , \u201d Deal says in a phone interview about their partnership to save Georgia \u2019 s HOPE Scholarship for low-income residents . \u201c We were in the midst of the continuing Great Recession at that period of time , and we had to make some very difficult choices about programs in our state . We did not always agree on all the issues that we were confronted with , but on that one , which was a significant one , I thought she demonstrated the kind of leadership that you hope people would do regardless of party labels . \u201d\nThey made cuts to the program , which upset some liberals , but preserved the scholarship . When asked if Abrams could bring that same tact to national politics , Deal says : \u201c I would think she probably could . Now that \u2019 s not something that every Republican will say . \u201d\nAbrams is the author of eight romance novels under a pseudonym , started two small businesses , is a New York Times best-selling author under her own name and is a superfan of \u201c Star Trek \u201d and Southern hip-hop , including one of her favorite rappers , Ludacris . She is scholarly , but she can also wax poetic on football . She is a policy wonk , but she can effortlessly pivot to sending goofy memes to the children of good buddies . She is a pop culture junkie who also is very literate on the sway and potential of technology . She is secure in her identity as a black woman but also sees herself as appealing broadly to people of all colors and identities . ( Exit polls in the Georgia governor \u2019 s race proved her right about that . ) She is effusive about the accomplishments of her sisters and brothers but also talks openly about her brother Walter \u2019 s long-term battles with mental health and drug addiction . Politics is a profession that attracts fakers , but it seems to me that Abrams is , for lack of a better phrase , mad real .\nIn 2018 and immediately after her defeat in 2019 , Abrams helped to create three organizations : Fair Fight Action , which advocates against voter suppression ( and has a lawsuit in the discovery phase against Brad Raffensperger , in his official capacity as Georgia secretary of state and as chair of the State Election Board ) ; the Southern Economic Advancement Project ( SEAP ) , which aims for equality of opportunity ; and Fair Count , which seeks to get communities of color , rural populations and other marginalized groups counted in the 2020 Census . At the Fair Fight office in Atlanta , I meet Abrams \u2019 s parents in a small conference room . Before the fan frenzy around her , before the passionate support of such A-listers as Will Ferrell , Oprah Winfrey and Mike Bloomberg , before she found herself the subject of countless media profiles , and before she became an in-demand expert on political talk shows as well as a guest on \u201c The View , \u201d she was their daughter .\nDemanding a fair fight is something Stacey Abrams \u2019 s mother and father have been doing pretty much most of their lives , beginning in Hattiesburg , Miss . Both came from generations of churchgoers , cooks , domestic workers and laborers . They met during the height of the civil rights movement and wound up working together at Hattiesburg \u2019 s racially segregated swimming pool as lifeguards who became teenage sweethearts .\nSays Carolyn Abrams , 71 , \u201c I just always believed I can do anything anybody else could do , that there was no limit . And we taught our children the same thing . \u201d\n\u201c My mom raised me , and we were really , really poor , \u201d says Robert Abrams , also 71 , \u201c but in our family , anything you do , you do it to benefit others . \u201d\nSome black Democrats in Georgia may grumble that Abrams was not always with them in political fights , but there \u2019 s wide agreement that she is focused on results .\nThese are the people who shaped Stacey Abrams \u2019 s notions of power and her Southern black political identity . Robert Abrams is a tall and nimble man . Carolyn Abrams , his wife and partner of 51 years , is short in stature , walks with the help of a cane and speaks in the perfect diction of an English teacher , or a great debater .\nRobert , like other youth of his era in the Deep South , became heavily involved in the civil rights movement , inspired by the founding of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in 1964 and other developments happening in the state . Robert never affiliated himself with any organization but was simply a civil rights \u201c soldier , \u201d as many youths were then , and was arrested more times than he can recall . He was , he says , also physically assaulted because he challenged local white authority .\nBy the time he and Carolyn were both students at historically black Tougaloo College near Jackson , Miss. , they had decided to get married ; they honeymooned at a local Holiday Inn . A year later , the first of six children came : Andrea in 1970 , Stacey in 1973 , Leslie in 1974 , Richard in 1977 , Walter in 1979 and Jeanine in 1982 . Stacey and Leslie were born in Madison , Wis. , because Robert and the family resided there for a couple of years so that Carolyn could get , with the help of a fellowship , a master \u2019 s degree in library science from the University of Wisconsin .\nAfter Carolyn Abrams secured her degree the family returned to Mississippi , this time to Gulfport , a bustling shipping city along the Gulf of Mexico . Carolyn settled into life as a librarian , and because of his dyslexia and difficulties reading , Robert worked at a shipyard . Stacey \u2019 s mother would come to refer to the family as \u201c the genteel poor \u201d because of their unusual blend of books everywhere and \u201c urban camping \u201d whenever the lights were cut off from a lack of money . They lived by candles or flashlights when that happened . ( In my time with Abrams , I noticed that in speeches and interviews she uses the words \u201c poor \u201d and \u201c poverty \u201d in a way most politicians do not , bringing to mind the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. \u2019 s Poor People \u2019 s Campaign . But these issues are familiar to her and very personal . )\nCarolyn and Robert Abrams would go on , in the years to come , to get master \u2019 s degrees in divinity from Atlanta \u2019 s Candler School of Theology and raise their six children to be , among other things , two PhDs , a social worker , a federal judge and a popular politician .\n\u201c It was always just a part of what you do , '' Stacey says . \u201c Your job is to serve . \u201d\nAbrams in Atlanta on election night in 2018 . She lost the gubernatorial race by fewer than 2 percentage points . Supporters on election night . ( Photos by Melina Mara/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nLEFT : Abrams in Atlanta on election night in 2018 . She lost the gubernatorial race by fewer than 2 percentage points . RIGHT : Supporters on election night . ( Photos by Melina Mara/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nMy name is Stacey Abrams , and I am not the governor of Georgia . I \u2019 m not going to be the senator , ever , but what I am is a proud Southerner , I \u2019 m a proud Democrat and I believe that we will win . ... \u201d\nThat is how she reintroduces herself at a town hall meeting in Miami in early February hosted by the Florida Democratic Party . This was before Biden overcame early primary defeats to become the Democratic nominee for president but after Abrams had declined Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2019 s requests for her to run for the U.S. Senate because she \u2019 d rather be in the executive branch ; and this was before the human and economic devastations of the coronavirus pandemic .\nOn this muggy , 80-degree day Abrams paced in front of an interracial crowd in an auditorium at Miami Dade College North Campus , using a story about her grandmother Wilter Abrams , who was affectionately called \u201c Bill , \u201d to drive home the importance of voting : \u201c My grandmother explained to me that the first time she was truly eligible to vote was after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , but \u2014 as with most federal decisions \u2014 it didn \u2019 t really get to Mississippi until \u2019 68 . So , the first time she was eligible to vote in an election was in the presidential election in 1968 , and she remembered that day . My grandfather and his brother were at the house . They had gotten off work , and they were ready to take her to go and vote . ...\n\u201c My grandmother said she didn \u2019 t move . She was sitting back there on that bed and she was frozen . ... , \u201d Abrams says , letting the story spool out . \u201c My grandfather became less and less generous with his platitudes and more impatient with her not showing up , and he finally marched back there to get her , and he was like , \u2018 What \u2019 s wrong ? We \u2019 ve got to go and vote ! \u2019 And she said , \u2018 I don \u2019 t want to go. \u2019 My grandfather was like , \u2018 What do you mean you don \u2019 t want to go ? \u2019 She said , \u2018 I don \u2019 t want to face the dogs and the billy clubs . I don \u2019 t want to face the problems. \u2019 And he said , \u2018 But we \u2019 ve got the right to vote . We \u2019 ve got the Voting Rights Acts . We can vote ! \u2019 And she said , \u2018 I \u2019 m afraid . I don \u2019 t want to do this. \u2019 And my grandfather looked at her and she said she had never seen my grandfather look so disappointed . He said , \u2018 Your children fought for this . ... \u2019 \u201d\nAbrams \u2019 s grandmother summoned the courage to vote that day , and she voted in every election after that until she died . Hearing this , the crowd roars and Abrams rocks back on her heels . She \u2019 s wearing her now-familiar look of twisted natural hair , short dangling earrings , a solid colored jacket and dark blouse and slacks . She speaks without notes , merging front-porch storytelling with a nerdish marshaling of facts and history .\nMoments before the town hall , Abrams sat with six students from different Florida colleges to talk about the role of young people in American politics , in protecting the right to vote and building political coalitions \u2014 especially in the South . The basic civil right of voting has become a signature issue for Abrams because of her experiences with the 2018 governor \u2019 s race , because Georgia \u2019 s racial demographics and voting patterns are shifting quickly , and because of her own family history .\n\u201c I started my voting rights activism at Spelman College . I started a voter-registration drive even before I was old enough to vote , \u201d she tells the students . \u201c I was probably the only person who turned 18 in college and got excited to go register and nothing else . But for me , the issue of voter registration is the beginning of the conversation because it is a conversation about power . \u201d\n\u201c Power \u201d is a word Abrams uses often in private conversations and in public statements . It \u2019 s what she wrote about in her political memoir , \u201c Lead From the Outside : How to Build Your Future and Make Real Change \u201d : \u201c [ T ] he questions for those in search of power abound : Who has it ? How do we get and wield it ? What do we do when we have less than the other guy ? What do we do when we lose it ? ... [ T ] he bald conversation of gaining power \u2014 especially for those who rarely hold it \u2014 is unusual . \u201d\nAbrams tells the Florida college students that her political opponents \u201c know how narrow the elections are . Every moment of suppression makes it easier to keep power . \u201d\nAbrams is not at any of the three offices I visit as I meet and talk with staffers . Each is in a different location : Fair Count in a bland , nondescript house converted to office space next to a gas station ; SEAP in a white building that could easily be a school ; and Fair Fight in a brownish office building . All are funded by private donations , both large- and small-dollar . Fair Fight Action is a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) and lead plaintiff in the aforementioned lawsuit , and does advocacy work . Fair Fight PAC , with more than 120,000 individual donors and about $ 24 million in fundraising , works on voter protection with state Democratic parties . Fair Count has raised about $ 7 million , and SEAP has raised about $ 1 million . I am told it would be impossible to delineate funds raised by Abrams and funds raised by staff because it \u2019 s a team effort . Fair Fight Action and its PAC combined have 30 staff members , along with teams at state parties across the country . Fair Count has 26 and SEAP four .\nOn each visit with these organizations I see that women are in leadership positions , the staffs are a rainbow coalition of identities , and droves of young people , 20-somethings and 30-somethings , power each group .\nFair Fight Action \u2019 s chief executive is Lauren Groh-Wargo . Before Abrams began entertaining conversations about the vice presidency , she and Groh-Wargo \u2014 a political operative who launched the New Georgia Project in 2014 as a nonpartisan effort to register voters , and who started her career by organizing against slumlords in Brooklyn \u2014 would strategize on how to transform their state . They would also discuss why Abrams should run for governor in 2018 , with Groh-Wargo as her campaign manager .\nTheir partnership reflects the bridge-building necessary in the modern Democratic Party \u2014 and is a vision , perhaps , of the party \u2019 s future leaders : Abrams is Southern , black , straight ; Groh-Wargo is Midwestern , white , gay . They share core values : Both support abortion rights , the rights of immigrants , marriage equality , economic justice and environmental protections .\nGroh-Wargo says that Abrams also represents a kind of politics that shows \u201c it is possible , and the best option , for Democrats to really aggressively be building this multiracial , multiethnic coalition . We should be leading with that rather than leading with this idea that we have to start with the \u2018 swing voter \u2019 concept . We lead with diverse communities of color and really let that drive strategy . What we have learned in Georgia is that no one thought a black woman would be competitive . We have learned that when you do that work and are also reaching out to white voters of all kinds , you do build a coalition . \u201d\nThis is why , in spite of not being the governor of Georgia , Abrams has become a player in the Democratic Party \u2014 in her state and in the country , including her well-reviewed prime-time 2019 response to President Trump \u2019 s State of the Union address .\nIn a phone conversation after our in-person interview , Abrams made a point to address the lingering questions raised by pundits about her readiness for national office . \u201c I would say that anyone who believes that they know everything on Day One is likely incorrect , \u201d she tells me . \u201c Part of any job is being capable of learning all of the facets but coming with enough knowledge and enough curiosity and enough capacity to adapt quickly either to the challenges you face or to the realities you confront. \u201d To that point , Abrams adds that she is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and has spent the past quarter-century \u201c self-educating \u201d on global affairs with fellowships and other fact-finding missions , including trips to Europe , Asia and the Middle East .\nAbrams has made it no secret that she is open to a place next to Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket . But the question remains : Would a Biden-Abrams ticket work ?\nIn that phone conversation , as she was sheltering in place , Abrams was thinking about why the nation was ill prepared to address the pandemic and how to be better prepared for the next . \u201c What we \u2019 ve watched for the last 40 years has been a concentrated assault on public administration and on the public infrastructure that so many Americans take for granted , \u201d she says . \u201c And I think because we have not faced an internalized crisis in this country in quite a while , we have forgotten why we built what we have and that ... in times of national emergency we should have an infrastructure that can quickly be scaled up to meet the needs of the moment . \u201d\nBe it foreign affairs or other topics , Abrams is not a traditional politician , just like Robert Kennedy , who served as attorney general and a U.S. senator , was not your typical politician . Both stepped into massive spotlights in spite of their shyness , both took on the mantle of activist , and both wanted to bring all kinds of people together .\nMaybe the signs and troubles of our times are why Abrams has made it no secret that she is very open to a place next to Biden on the Democratic ticket . But the question remains : Would a Biden-Abrams ticket work ? Word among the political chattering class is that he is looking for a running mate who could step into the Oval Office after one term , and not every pundit is convinced that Abrams has the credentials . Biden is 77 , and Democrats want to be sure they have his successor waiting in the wings . Abrams tells me that she has spoken regularly with the former vice president over the past year , since they first met to talk about his campaign in March 2019 , though Abrams won \u2019 t divulge the nature of those conversations .\nWhen I press Abrams about the 1990s sexual assault allegation from Biden \u2019 s former staffer , Tara Reade , and how that might affect him or his running mate , Abrams stands firm : \u201c If I am chosen to be his running mate , I will proudly promote his record and his plans to help the women of America , \u201d she tells me , noting Biden \u2019 s leadership of the Violence Against Women Act , his support for equal pay for equal work and helping to pass the Affordable Care Act .\nEven if she \u2019 s not chosen , it seems that her place in the vice presidential conversation only strengthens her political future . If , for example , she was to challenge Kemp to a rematch in 2022 or run for president in 2024 , she \u2019 d only have more power .\nBefore hanging up , we return to that subject , and Abrams again stresses her vision of political power for all people .\n\u201c Leadership , \u201d she says , \u201c is about answering that question : How can I help ? \u201d\nKevin Powell is a writer , public speaker and author of several books , including his autobiography , \u201c The Education of Kevin Powell. \u201d He is also a civil and human rights activist , and ran for Congress as a Democrat in 2008 and 2010 in New York .\nAbrams portraits : Styling by Cheri Scurry-Burns .

    "content_original": "There is a big buzz at the Loudermilk Conference Center in downtown Atlanta as a gathering called Paradigm Shift 2.0: Black Women Confronting HIV, Health and Social Justice gets underway. Three hundred registered participants have journeyed from across the country to discuss the many challenges and possibilities facing black women and girls. The second day\u2019s morning keynote was delivered by radical activist and professor Angela Davis. The hype has been building exponentially for lunchtime guest speaker Stacey Abrams.\n\nWhen she is finally introduced the women shout and leap to their feet. Young women stand on chairs, camera phones flash. Abrams, who appears both amused and slightly disturbed by the fuss over her, takes control of the chaotic scene. I\u2019ve witnessed this level of affection for very few political leaders in the Democratic circles I\u2019ve been in since the 1980s. They have the last names Clinton (both Hillary and Bill), Sanders, Warren, Jackson and Obama (both Michelle and Barack).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make sure there is peace in this room,\u201d Abrams says. \u201cY\u2019all are about to annoy each other with these cameras, so I\u2019m going to stand up and I\u2019m going to stand in front of each group of you. Take pictures so you can put your camera down.\u201d\n\n(Dana Scruggs for The Washington Post)\n\nPandemonium ensues as she walks to the far left of the stage, like a runway supermodel, stops on a dime, poses, tilts her head slightly and smiles. Camera flashes explode. She next pivots and walks slowly to the center of the stage, freezes there and repeats the pose. Again, the flashes explode. Abrams is summoning her inner actress, and she is both enjoying the moment and getting through it to get to the conversation. She then pivots and walks to the far right of the stage, same. You wonder whether she has done this before, because it is not necessarily what one would expect from a 46-year-old politician who was nearly elected the first black female governor in U.S. history. She lost by fewer than 2 percentage points in the 2018 Georgia race riddled with allegations of voter suppression. Before that, she was a state legislator who had served as a leader in the Georgia General Assembly for a decade. Now her name is on political pundits\u2019 shortlists of potential running mates for Joe Biden. She also happens to have predicted that she\u2019ll be elected president by 2040.\n\nJust as quickly Abrams leaves the runway and returns to politics. Taking her seat with the moderator, she dives into why she is here and why she believes the leadership of women matters. \u201cWe live in a time where we have purported leaders who claim to speak for us but do not know us, and in that ignorance, they make decisions that are designed not for our success but for our demise,\u201d she says. \u201cSo my deep suspicion is that some people are lying when they say they care about us.\u201d\n\nThe balloon of silence in the meeting room is punctured, time and again, by \u201cAmen\u201d and \u201cPreach\u201d and \u201cYou go, girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I ran for governor, I did not run simply for me. We went around this state to all 159 counties, and everywhere we went we talked about the power of people to make a choice,\u201d Abrams tells the crowd. \u201cOn November 6th, when malfeasance and incompetence and my opponent who was a cartoon villain stole the voices of Georgians when he purged 1.4 million voters and oversaw the shutdown of 214 precincts that left 50,000 to 60,000 people without the ability to vote, when Georgia had the longest lines in the nation and the highest rejection rates of absentee ballots and provisional ballots,\u201d Abrams continues, \u201cIt was not just about me. He was doing that to Georgians.\u201d\n\nAbrams pauses for a moment, allowing her words to simmer. The audience cheers as she smiles broadly.\n\n\u201cAnd the thing is, if I had fought back and said, \u2018I am going to contest this election and make myself governor,\u2019 then everyone who loved me and stood with me would have thought, \u2018Well, this is about her fight.\u2019 My responsibility was instead to focus on the right to vote and not my right to be governor. I had no right to be governor, but I have an obligation to do the work that I said I would do if I were governor.\u201d\n\nVoting rights. Responsibility. Possibilities. These are the ideas and values that come up often with Stacey Abrams and her team. I heard them over and over again during the weeks I followed her around earlier this year, in Miami, in New York, in Atlanta, and listened to her give interviews and hold public conversations. She has opened up a nationwide dialogue about voting rights but has also been accused by political pundits of too aggressively pushing herself as Biden\u2019s VP choice. What Abrams seems to know is that she must be persuasive and make her own case for her fitness for higher office \u2014 and history would suggest that she\u2019s right to do so. Commentators have wondered whether Abrams, who has not yet won a statewide election, would be ready to serve as vice president.\n\nWhether or not she\u2019s chosen as Biden\u2019s running mate, she has moved into a unique space in American politics. DuBose Porter, former chair of the Georgia Democratic Party, told me she is \u201cbrilliant,\u201d praise that comes in spite of what some view as a relatively thin political r\u00e9sum\u00e9. But we live in an era in which an extensive political background hardly matters anymore \u2014 Donald Trump had never been elected to office before his 2016 win. Like former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose long-shot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination made him a household name, Abrams doesn\u2019t have the baggage of years of votes on Capitol Hill; she doesn\u2019t have a fraught record on criminal justice that comes with having served as an attorney general, nor does she face the accusation of being out of touch because she has spent years in Washington.\n\nAt this conference it\u2019s easy to be reminded that black women have long been the most loyal supporters of the Democratic Party. They carried Doug Jones to his senatorial victory in Alabama in 2018 and were key to kick-starting Biden\u2019s presidential campaign when it was thought to be dead, helping to lift him to victory in South Carolina\u2019s Democratic primary. So perhaps it was only a matter of time before a black woman, especially a black woman from the American South, would rise up as a national leader and a power broker for democracy in a way we have not often seen, aside from Fannie Lou Hamer\u2019s brief but landmark speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention and Shirley Chisholm\u2019s historic \u201cunbought and unbossed\u201d run for president in 1972.\n\nAbrams\u2019s roots and family history have echoes of the civil rights movement, and her Southern heritage is key to her appeal. It helps explain why she has soared to prominence while serving as a standard-bearer for a new kind of multicultural and multigenerational agenda. In the last presidential campaign cycle, the racial breakdown of Democrats outside of the South was roughly 60 percent white, 17 percent African American and 23 percent Latino, according to a 2016 Blair Center Poll. In the states that form the South, those numbers were 38 percent white, 37 percent African American and 25 percent Latino. In her runs for the Georgia legislature and governor, Abrams built a coalition that excited this new Georgia. She believes she can do the same on the national stage.\n\nAbrams\u2019s special adviser, Chelsey Hall, tells me that in the 2018 gubernatorial race the campaign had to contend with doubters and \u201cconvince her own people that she was viable and electable for that position. Even the people that had been supporting since she became Democratic minority leader [of the General Assembly] or her first race. There were so many times where we would have emotional moments during call time because people that she trusted, that had been supporting her since 2006, 2011 were saying, \u2018But you are a black woman. How is this possible?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAbrams is the first black woman in U.S. history to have won the gubernatorial nomination of either major party. She garnered more votes than any Democrat who has run statewide in Georgia. She lost by just over 50,000 votes to Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp.\n\nKemp was not only her opponent, but his office oversaw everything to do with voting, including how the voter registration rolls were purged. It would be like Tom Brady not only being the quarterback of his team, but the referee and the scorekeeper as well. Kemp\u2019s office cut nearly 700,000 names from the rolls in the two years leading to the election, and more than 200 polling places were closed, primarily in poor and minority neighborhoods.\n\nAbrams chose not to concede to Kemp, because she believes voters were disenfranchised. She has said she went through all the stages of grief for 10 days and then got back to work. She has spent the time since leveraging the power she gained and deciding how she wants to use it.\n\nA mural in Atlanta in April. Abrams moved to the city with her family when she was a teenager in 1989. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nStacey Abrams lives in a simple blue townhouse in a diverse middle-class neighborhood on the east side of Atlanta. Her modestly furnished home is filled with a wide range of books, including the four she\u2019s currently absorbing: \u201cThe City We Became\u201d by N.K. Jemisin, \u201cHuey Long\u201d by T. Harry Williams, \u201cA Problem From Hell\u201d by Samantha Power and \u201cA Place for Us\u201d by Fatima Farheen Mirza. There is art, some centered on black America, but also pieces from her travels internationally that are Australian aboriginal, South Korean, French, Chinese. Framed photographs of family and friends are spread throughout as well.\n\nThis home is a major expansion of the Gulfport, Miss., house she grew up in, where her family of eight had to convert the dining room to a bedroom for her two brothers, Richard and Walter. It feels like a sanctuary to protect Abrams from the many demands on her time. Abrams, who is single with no children, arrived in Atlanta as a 15-year-old in 1989 when her parents decided to attend Methodist divinity school. Aside from stints for graduate school at the University of Texas (master\u2019s in public affairs) and Yale Law School in Connecticut, Atlanta is where she has mostly lived since departing Mississippi. I ask Abrams about her life in Mississippi.\n\n\u201cI only remember living on South Street in Gulfport, Mississippi,\u201d she says. \u201c2020 South Street was a red-brick house with azalea bushes that ran along the front. There was an oak tree in the front yard, and it had such big limbs and so many leaves that grass couldn\u2019t grow underneath it. But you could climb that tree, and you could see everything.\u201d\n\nAbrams\u2019s parents picked that street so that she and her siblings could attend one of the better schools in the area. It was one of many lessons she learned growing up about the division of resources along racial lines and navigating those divisions. \u201cIt was less a black community than we lived on a \u2018black street.\u2019 There were these two streets that were adjacent to the middle-class, predominantly white part of town to get zoned into the middle-class school. ... We lived on the two streets that were all black until the Brooks family came. ... All the streets got nicer names as you went further in, so those were predominantly white. My parents understood that education was the essential ingredient to success for both of them. My mom is the only one of her siblings to finish high school. My dad is the first man in his family to go to college.\u201d\n\nAbrams excelled in academics and was always in advanced studies, which meant she was routinely the only black student in her classes. Because one of the two TV channels that the family received was PBS, Abrams watched that network religiously, read the dictionary and devoured the books and encyclopedias her parents managed to buy for their children.\n\n\u201cI think my mom is the reason I started reading the encyclopedia and the dictionary, because I would ask questions and she was like, \u2018Go look it up.\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cFinally I figured if I wanted to know everything, I just needed to read everything.\u201d\n\nAbrams\u2019s roots and family history have echoes of the civil rights movement, and her Southern heritage is key to her appeal.\n\nAbrams also tells me that she and her sisters like to say their dad \u2014 a track star in college who once had pro football tryouts with the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys \u2014 is the first feminist they ever met. \u201cHe will tell you before anyone else will that he thinks my mom is the smartest person he knows. ... It is a true belief that there is no division of capacity that comes along with gender. He raised us with that understanding, and we never questioned it.\u201d\n\nHer interests were vast: physics, chemistry, history, psychology, mythologies, biographies, poetry. During our conversation Abrams recalls speeches, debates and poetry that she studied in her youth, and recites from memory the opening stanza of Paul Laurence Dunbar\u2019s poem \u201cWe Wear the Mask.\u201d\n\nWe wear the mask that grins and lies,\n\nIt hides our cheeks and shades our eyes, \u2014\n\nThis debt we pay to human guile;\n\nWith torn and bleeding hearts we smile,\n\nAnd mouth with myriad subtleties.\n\nAbrams draws no boundaries around most music genres, either.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in 10th grade I was having a conversation with a friend, and I said, \u2018I hate country music.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Why?\u2019 And I didn\u2019t have an answer. So I made myself listen to every radio station on the radio for two weeks each. But then when I engaged people ... I could use that complexity of my musical likes to talk. And the same thing was true from what I read. My mom and dad basically let me read; if I could reach it, I could read it.\u201d\n\nWhen the family moved to Atlanta, Abrams ended up at a performing arts high school, where she became her class\u2019s valedictorian. College was next. \u201cI applied to Spelman, Swarthmore, Vassar, Sarah Lawrence. I was leaving the South,\u201d she says, recalling that the South was all she knew, and she wanted a different experience. \u201cI only applied to Spelman because my mother tricked me into it.\u201d\n\nAt Spelman College, a historically black women\u2019s college in Atlanta, she had double majors in physics and philosophy, with a minor in theater. It was the first time she would be steeped so broadly in black life and culture outside of her family home. Johnnetta Cole, who later led the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art and was the school\u2019s president at the time, became Abrams\u2019s mentor. Cole encouraged young Abrams \u2014 who was perpetually raising her voice \u2014 to get involved, attend meetings and bring about change. Abrams did that and then some, on and off campus. When the Rodney King verdict came down in Los Angeles in April 1992, acquitting the four police officers who brutally beat the motorist, Atlanta and many other U.S. cities exploded into protest and violent rebellion. A couple of months later, Abrams was in the back of a protest, watching, when some young black folks burned the Georgia state flag because it contained the Confederate symbol (she did not personally hold the flag as it burned, but she organized the protest and obtained the permit), a fact that her opponents raised during her run for governor. Soon after that incident, Spelman hosted a town hall with Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson in which Abrams dissed the work of the first African American elected to lead a major Southern city.\n\n\u201cI berated him for not doing enough for young people,\u201d Abrams recalls. \u201cI was very irate and then ... I gave them my number, and I gave my parents\u2019 number. \u2018[Here\u2019s] where I\u2019m going to be, if you have any questions.\u2019 \u201d Jackson was very offended and questioned what Abrams knew. It was a bold move for a young woman to challenge a trailblazing black man who was seen as an important leader throughout the South. She told him that she attended city council meetings and zoning meetings and that she knew he wasn\u2019t doing enough. The town hall aired on local television. Despite the confrontation, when Jackson created an Office of Youth Services the next year, 1993, she was the only undergrad college student hired. It was her first taste of life in politics.\n\nAfter Spelman and graduate and law school, Abrams became a tax lawyer because working in the mayor\u2019s office showed her that if she wanted to be a public servant, she needed to learn how the entire system worked. At age 29 Abrams was appointed deputy city attorney by Mayor Shirley Franklin, another history-making Southern black politician. Franklin was the first woman to hold the post and the first black woman to be elected mayor of a major Southern city. Abrams ran for and was elected as a state representative in 2006; she rose quickly in the Georgia legislature and became Democratic Party minority leader in 2011.\n\nShe calls herself a \u201cpragmatist,\u201d which is a necessary asset for a Democrat in a state long controlled by Republicans. She also embraces the label \u201cprogressive\u201d; in the race for governor she campaigned on expanding Medicaid. Ideologically, she falls somewhere between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden: As her state\u2019s Democratic leader, she worked on behalf of low-income and middle-class residents, defeating sales taxes; she championed reproductive rights, supported military families and protected public education and Medicaid from budget cuts; and as a mentor she launched a program to train young people in Democratic Party politics. In my reporting I have heard grumblings that some black Democrats in Georgia did not feel Abrams was always with them in political fights, but there\u2019s wide agreement that she is focused on taking action and getting results. To do that, Minority Leader Abrams crossed the aisle often to work with Republicans. One of her admirers is Nathan Deal, the former two-term Republican governor of Georgia.\n\n\u201cI thought that my working relationship with her, and she with my staff, was very good,\u201d Deal says in a phone interview about their partnership to save Georgia\u2019s HOPE Scholarship for low-income residents. \u201cWe were in the midst of the continuing Great Recession at that period of time, and we had to make some very difficult choices about programs in our state. We did not always agree on all the issues that we were confronted with, but on that one, which was a significant one, I thought she demonstrated the kind of leadership that you hope people would do regardless of party labels.\u201d\n\nThey made cuts to the program, which upset some liberals, but preserved the scholarship. When asked if Abrams could bring that same tact to national politics, Deal says: \u201cI would think she probably could. Now that\u2019s not something that every Republican will say.\u201d\n\n(Dana Scruggs for The Washington Post)\n\nAbrams is the author of eight romance novels under a pseudonym, started two small businesses, is a New York Times best-selling author under her own name and is a superfan of \u201cStar Trek\u201d and Southern hip-hop, including one of her favorite rappers, Ludacris. She is scholarly, but she can also wax poetic on football. She is a policy wonk, but she can effortlessly pivot to sending goofy memes to the children of good buddies. She is a pop culture junkie who also is very literate on the sway and potential of technology. She is secure in her identity as a black woman but also sees herself as appealing broadly to people of all colors and identities. (Exit polls in the Georgia governor\u2019s race proved her right about that.) She is effusive about the accomplishments of her sisters and brothers but also talks openly about her brother Walter\u2019s long-term battles with mental health and drug addiction. Politics is a profession that attracts fakers, but it seems to me that Abrams is, for lack of a better phrase, mad real.\n\nIn 2018 and immediately after her defeat in 2019, Abrams helped to create three organizations: Fair Fight Action, which advocates against voter suppression (and has a lawsuit in the discovery phase against Brad Raffensperger, in his official capacity as Georgia secretary of state and as chair of the State Election Board); the Southern Economic Advancement Project (SEAP), which aims for equality of opportunity; and Fair Count, which seeks to get communities of color, rural populations and other marginalized groups counted in the 2020 Census. At the Fair Fight office in Atlanta, I meet Abrams\u2019s parents in a small conference room. Before the fan frenzy around her, before the passionate support of such A-listers as Will Ferrell, Oprah Winfrey and Mike Bloomberg, before she found herself the subject of countless media profiles, and before she became an in-demand expert on political talk shows as well as a guest on \u201cThe View,\u201d she was their daughter.\n\nDemanding a fair fight is something Stacey Abrams\u2019s mother and father have been doing pretty much most of their lives, beginning in Hattiesburg, Miss. Both came from generations of churchgoers, cooks, domestic workers and laborers. They met during the height of the civil rights movement and wound up working together at Hattiesburg\u2019s racially segregated swimming pool as lifeguards who became teenage sweethearts.\n\nSays Carolyn Abrams, 71, \u201cI just always believed I can do anything anybody else could do, that there was no limit. And we taught our children the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mom raised me, and we were really, really poor,\u201d says Robert Abrams, also 71, \u201cbut in our family, anything you do, you do it to benefit others.\u201d\n\nSome black Democrats in Georgia may grumble that Abrams was not always with them in political fights, but there\u2019s wide agreement that she is focused on results.\n\nThese are the people who shaped Stacey Abrams\u2019s notions of power and her Southern black political identity. Robert Abrams is a tall and nimble man. Carolyn Abrams, his wife and partner of 51 years, is short in stature, walks with the help of a cane and speaks in the perfect diction of an English teacher, or a great debater.\n\nRobert, like other youth of his era in the Deep South, became heavily involved in the civil rights movement, inspired by the founding of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in 1964 and other developments happening in the state. Robert never affiliated himself with any organization but was simply a civil rights \u201csoldier,\u201d as many youths were then, and was arrested more times than he can recall. He was, he says, also physically assaulted because he challenged local white authority.\n\nBy the time he and Carolyn were both students at historically black Tougaloo College near Jackson, Miss., they had decided to get married; they honeymooned at a local Holiday Inn. A year later, the first of six children came: Andrea in 1970, Stacey in 1973, Leslie in 1974, Richard in 1977, Walter in 1979 and Jeanine in 1982. Stacey and Leslie were born in Madison, Wis., because Robert and the family resided there for a couple of years so that Carolyn could get, with the help of a fellowship, a master\u2019s degree in library science from the University of Wisconsin.\n\nAfter Carolyn Abrams secured her degree the family returned to Mississippi, this time to Gulfport, a bustling shipping city along the Gulf of Mexico. Carolyn settled into life as a librarian, and because of his dyslexia and difficulties reading, Robert worked at a shipyard. Stacey\u2019s mother would come to refer to the family as \u201cthe genteel poor\u201d because of their unusual blend of books everywhere and \u201curban camping\u201d whenever the lights were cut off from a lack of money. They lived by candles or flashlights when that happened. (In my time with Abrams, I noticed that in speeches and interviews she uses the words \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cpoverty\u201d in a way most politicians do not, bringing to mind the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign. But these issues are familiar to her and very personal.)\n\nCarolyn and Robert Abrams would go on, in the years to come, to get master\u2019s degrees in divinity from Atlanta\u2019s Candler School of Theology and raise their six children to be, among other things, two PhDs, a social worker, a federal judge and a popular politician.\n\n\u201cIt was always just a part of what you do,\" Stacey says. \u201cYour job is to serve.\u201d\n\nAbrams in Atlanta on election night in 2018.

I\u2019m not going to be the senator, ever, but what I am is a proud Southerner, I\u2019m a proud Democrat and I believe that we will win. ...\u201d\n\nThat is how she reintroduces herself at a town hall meeting in Miami in early February hosted by the Florida Democratic Party. This was before Biden overcame early primary defeats to become the Democratic nominee for president but after Abrams had declined Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s requests for her to run for the U.S. Senate because she\u2019d rather be in the executive branch; and this was before the human and economic devastations of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn this muggy, 80-degree day Abrams paced in front of an interracial crowd in an auditorium at Miami Dade College North Campus, using a story about her grandmother Wilter Abrams, who was affectionately called \u201cBill,\u201d to drive home the importance of voting: \u201cMy grandmother explained to me that the first time she was truly eligible to vote was after the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but \u2014 as with most federal decisions \u2014 it didn\u2019t really get to Mississippi until \u201968. So, the first time she was eligible to vote in an election was in the presidential election in 1968, and she remembered that day. My grandfather and his brother were at the house. They had gotten off work, and they were ready to take her to go and vote. ...\n\n\u201cMy grandmother said she didn\u2019t move. She was sitting back there on that bed and she was frozen. ...,\u201d Abrams says, letting the story spool out. \u201cMy grandfather became less and less generous with his platitudes and more impatient with her not showing up, and he finally marched back there to get her, and he was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong? We\u2019ve got to go and vote!\u2019 And she said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go.\u2019 My grandfather was like, \u2018What do you mean you don\u2019t want to go?\u2019 She said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to face the dogs and the billy clubs. I don\u2019t want to face the problems.\u2019 And he said, \u2018But we\u2019ve got the right to vote. We\u2019ve got the Voting Rights Acts. We can vote!\u2019 And she said, \u2018I\u2019m afraid. I don\u2019t want to do this.\u2019 And my grandfather looked at her and she said she had never seen my grandfather look so disappointed. He said, \u2018Your children fought for this. ...\u2019 \u201d\n\nAbrams\u2019s grandmother summoned the courage to vote that day, and she voted in every election after that until she died. Hearing this, the crowd roars and Abrams rocks back on her heels. She\u2019s wearing her now-familiar look of twisted natural hair, short dangling earrings, a solid colored jacket and dark blouse and slacks. She speaks without notes, merging front-porch storytelling with a nerdish marshaling of facts and history.\n\nMoments before the town hall, Abrams sat with six students from different Florida colleges to talk about the role of young people in American politics, in protecting the right to vote and building political coalitions \u2014 especially in the South. The basic civil right of voting has become a signature issue for Abrams because of her experiences with the 2018 governor\u2019s race, because Georgia\u2019s racial demographics and voting patterns are shifting quickly, and because of her own family history.\n\n\u201cI started my voting rights activism at Spelman College. I started a voter-registration drive even before I was old enough to vote,\u201d she tells the students. \u201cI was probably the only person who turned 18 in college and got excited to go register and nothing else. But for me, the issue of voter registration is the beginning of the conversation because it is a conversation about power.\u201d\n\n\u201cPower\u201d is a word Abrams uses often in private conversations and in public statements. It\u2019s what she wrote about in her political memoir, \u201cLead From the Outside: How to Build Your Future and Make Real Change\u201d: \u201c[T]he questions for those in search of power abound: Who has it? How do we get and wield it? What do we do when we have less than the other guy? What do we do when we lose it? ... [T]he bald conversation of gaining power \u2014 especially for those who rarely hold it \u2014 is unusual.\u201d\n\nAbrams tells the Florida college students that her political opponents \u201cknow how narrow the elections are. Every moment of suppression makes it easier to keep power.\u201d\n\nAbrams is not at any of the three offices I visit as I meet and talk with staffers. Each is in a different location: Fair Count in a bland, nondescript house converted to office space next to a gas station; SEAP in a white building that could easily be a school; and Fair Fight in a brownish office building. All are funded by private donations, both large- and small-dollar. Fair Fight Action is a 501(c)(4) and lead plaintiff in the aforementioned lawsuit, and does advocacy work. Fair Fight PAC, with more than 120,000 individual donors and about $24 million in fundraising, works on voter protection with state Democratic parties. Fair Count has raised about $7 million, and SEAP has raised about $1 million. I am told it would be impossible to delineate funds raised by Abrams and funds raised by staff because it\u2019s a team effort. Fair Fight Action and its PAC combined have 30 staff members, along with teams at state parties across the country. Fair Count has 26 and SEAP four.\n\nOn each visit with these organizations I see that women are in leadership positions, the staffs are a rainbow coalition of identities, and droves of young people, 20-somethings and 30-somethings, power each group.\n\nFair Fight Action\u2019s chief executive is Lauren Groh-Wargo. Before Abrams began entertaining conversations about the vice presidency, she and Groh-Wargo \u2014 a political operative who launched the New Georgia Project in 2014 as a nonpartisan effort to register voters, and who started her career by organizing against slumlords in Brooklyn \u2014 would strategize on how to transform their state. They would also discuss why Abrams should run for governor in 2018, with Groh-Wargo as her campaign manager.\n\nTheir partnership reflects the bridge-building necessary in the modern Democratic Party \u2014 and is a vision, perhaps, of the party\u2019s future leaders: Abrams is Southern, black, straight; Groh-Wargo is Midwestern, white, gay. They share core values: Both support abortion rights, the rights of immigrants, marriage equality, economic justice and environmental protections.\n\nGroh-Wargo says that Abrams also represents a kind of politics that shows \u201cit is possible, and the best option, for Democrats to really aggressively be building this multiracial, multiethnic coalition. We should be leading with that rather than leading with this idea that we have to start with the \u2018swing voter\u2019 concept. We lead with diverse communities of color and really let that drive strategy. What we have learned in Georgia is that no one thought a black woman would be competitive. We have learned that when you do that work and are also reaching out to white voters of all kinds, you do build a coalition.\u201d\n\nThis is why, in spite of not being the governor of Georgia, Abrams has become a player in the Democratic Party \u2014 in her state and in the country, including her well-reviewed prime-time 2019 response to President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nIn a phone conversation after our in-person interview, Abrams made a point to address the lingering questions raised by pundits about her readiness for national office. \u201cI would say that anyone who believes that they know everything on Day One is likely incorrect,\u201d she tells me. \u201cPart of any job is being capable of learning all of the facets but coming with enough knowledge and enough curiosity and enough capacity to adapt quickly either to the challenges you face or to the realities you confront.\u201d To that point, Abrams adds that she is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and has spent the past quarter-century \u201cself-educating\u201d on global affairs with fellowships and other fact-finding missions, including trips to Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nAbrams has made it no secret that she is open to a place next to Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket. But the question remains: Would a Biden-Abrams ticket work?\n\nIn that phone conversation, as she was sheltering in place, Abrams was thinking about why the nation was ill prepared to address the pandemic and how to be better prepared for the next. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve watched for the last 40 years has been a concentrated assault on public administration and on the public infrastructure that so many Americans take for granted,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think because we have not faced an internalized crisis in this country in quite a while, we have forgotten why we built what we have and that ... in times of national emergency we should have an infrastructure that can quickly be scaled up to meet the needs of the moment.\u201d\n\nBe it foreign affairs or other topics, Abrams is not a traditional politician, just like Robert Kennedy, who served as attorney general and a U.S. senator, was not your typical politician. Both stepped into massive spotlights in spite of their shyness, both took on the mantle of activist, and both wanted to bring all kinds of people together.\n\nMaybe the signs and troubles of our times are why Abrams has made it no secret that she is very open to a place next to Biden on the Democratic ticket. But the question remains: Would a Biden-Abrams ticket work? Word among the political chattering class is that he is looking for a running mate who could step into the Oval Office after one term, and not every pundit is convinced that Abrams has the credentials. Biden is 77, and Democrats want to be sure they have his successor waiting in the wings. Abrams tells me that she has spoken regularly with the former vice president over the past year, since they first met to talk about his campaign in March 2019, though Abrams won\u2019t divulge the nature of those conversations.\n\nWhen I press Abrams about the 1990s sexual assault allegation from Biden\u2019s former staffer, Tara Reade, and how that might affect him or his running mate, Abrams stands firm: \u201cIf I am chosen to be his running mate, I will proudly promote his record and his plans to help the women of America,\u201d she tells me, noting Biden\u2019s leadership of the Violence Against Women Act, his support for equal pay for equal work and helping to pass the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEven if she\u2019s not chosen, it seems that her place in the vice presidential conversation only strengthens her political future. If, for example, she was to challenge Kemp to a rematch in 2022 or run for president in 2024, she\u2019d only have more power.\n\nBefore hanging up, we return to that subject, and Abrams again stresses her vision of political power for all people.\n\n\u201cLeadership,\u201d she says, \u201cis about answering that question: How can I help?\u201d\n\n(Dana Scruggs for The Washington Post)\n\nKevin Powell is a writer, public speaker and author of several books, including his autobiography, \u201cThe Education of Kevin Powell.\u201d He is also a civil and human rights activist, and ran for Congress as a Democrat in 2008 and 2010 in New York.\n\nAbrams portraits: Styling by Cheri Scurry-Burns.
