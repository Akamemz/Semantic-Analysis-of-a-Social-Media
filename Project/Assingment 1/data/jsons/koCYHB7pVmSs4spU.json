( Joshua Roberts/Reuters )\nRegardless of the fate of Brett Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination , the Senate should censure the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee , Dianne Feinstein . Her deception and maneuvering , condemned across the political spectrum , seriously interfered with the Senate \u2019 s performance of its constitutional duty to review judicial nominations , and unquestionably has brought the Senate into \u201c dishonor and disrepute , \u201d the standard that governs these matters . As a matter of institutional integrity , the Senate can not let this wrong go unaddressed .\nArticle I , Section 5 of the Constitution provides that each House of the Congress may \u201c punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour. \u201d Nine times in American history the Senate has used that power to censure one of its members . Feinstein has richly earned the right to join this inglorious company .\nThe senior senator from California not only disgraced herself personally in the underhanded and disingenuous way she dealt with the sex-assault charge against Judge Kavanaugh , but she also misused her position on the Judiciary Committee and broke faith with her fellow committee members . She was further , to quote the San Francisco Chronicle , no less , \u201c unfair \u201d to Judge Kavanaugh \u2014 manipulating the public disclosure of the charge so as to maximize the adverse publicity Judge Kavanaugh received and minimize the judge \u2019 s opportunity to defend himself . Censure is appropriate in this case for the Senate to defend its procedures and institutional reputation .\nBy her own account , Feinstein was aware of the charge shortly after President Trump nominated Kavanaugh , nearly two months before her committee opened its hearings . She came into possession of the letter making the charge by virtue of her position on the Judiciary Committee . We don \u2019 t know what contact she had thereafter with the accuser or the accuser \u2019 s Democrat-activist Washington lawyer \u2014 but we do know that Feinstein kept the information from her Senate colleagues , ensuring it was untested and unmentioned in the committee \u2019 s hearings . This , even though the hearings were accompanied by loud complaints from Democrats that the administration \u2019 s document production was insufficient . Indeed , as this is being written , while yet another Judiciary Committee hearing has been scheduled , she still has not released the unredacted text of the letter that made the charge .\nHer conduct has been condemned all across the political spectrum . Her hometown newspaper , the left-leaning Chronicle , editorialized that she chose \u201c the worst possible course \u201d in dealing with the charge . The Chronicle specifically noted that her treatment of the more than three-decade-old assault charge was \u201c unfair to Feinstein \u2019 s colleagues \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201d Across the political aisle , her conduct was called \u201c totally dishonest and dirty \u201d in the pages of the Washington Examiner ; the Wall Street Journal , more restrained , described her conduct as \u201c highly irregular . \u201d\nIn substance , she \u201c deliberately misled and deceived \u201d her fellow senators , with the \u201c effect of impeding discovery of evidence \u201d relevant to the performance of their constitutional duties . No one should know better than Feinstein herself that such deceptive and obstructive conduct , widely regarded as \u201c unacceptable , \u201d \u201c fully deserves censure , \u201d so that \u201c future generations of Americans . . . know that such behavior is not only unacceptable but also bears grave consequences , \u201d bringing \u201c shame and dishonor \u201d to the person guilty of it and to the office that person holds , who has \u201c violated the trust of the American people. \u201d These quoted words all come from the resolution of censure Feinstein herself introduced concerning President Bill Clinton \u2019 s behavior in connection with his sex scandal . She can hardly be heard to complain if she is held to the same standard .\nComparison with other past censure cases only makes Feinstein \u2019 s situation look worse . The last three senators censured , Thomas Dodd , Herman Talmadge , and Dave Durenberger , were all condemned for financial hanky-panky : converting campaign contributions to personal use and the like . They were all found to have brought the Senate into \u201c dishonor and disrepute \u201d even though nothing they had done implicated the Senate \u2019 s performance of its constitutional duties . Feinstein , in sharpest contrast , sought to keep her committee from timely and properly investigating an apparently serious charge of misconduct , and is still doing so , even in the face of criticism from all ( or most ) quarters .\nAs the second-richest member of the Senate , with a net worth of $ 94 million , Feinstein is presumably above the temptations to which Dodd , Talmadge , and Durenberger succumbed . She does , however , face a difficult reelection campaign , with a serious enthusiasm gap on her left , the California Democratic party having refused to endorse her bid for a sixth term in office . Her conduct in arranging matters to make her appear the champion of an allegedly abused constituent , and perhaps positioning herself as the woman who sank the Kavanaugh nomination , can only help on that flank . Is a nakedly political motive for senatorial misbehavior any less reprehensible than a financial one ?\nHow does she stack up against the most famously censured senator , Joe McCarthy ? While what people remember is McCarthy \u2019 s trafficking in smears and innuendoes \u2014 immortalized in Joseph Welch \u2019 s \u201c have you no sense of decency \u201d reproach \u2014 McCarthy was actually condemned for \u201c non-cooperation with and abuse of \u201d one Senate subcommittee and abuse of another . The words of McCarthy \u2019 s condemnation \u2014 that his conduct \u201c tended . . . to obstruct the constitutional processes of the Senate , and to impair its dignity \u201d \u2014 fit Feinstein \u2019 s conduct as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee like a glove .\nAnd if trafficking in smears and innuendoes is relevant , consider what Feinstein did : Not only did she fail in her committee duties , but she did everything she could to make the charge public in a way that made the target \u2019 s defense difficult or impossible .

Left hanging in the glare of a still-untested sexual-assault charge \u2014 which today has the same resonance that a charge of Communist sympathies had in McCarthy \u2019 s day \u2014 are Judge Kavanaugh , his wife , and his two daughters .
