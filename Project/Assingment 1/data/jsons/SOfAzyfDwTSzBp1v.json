Hillary Clinton!\n\nWe reporters focus on bad news, but at year\u2019s end, let\u2019s remember what went right. 2015 was a better time to be alive than most any prior point in history.\n\nThe rich got richer. Some people think that\u2019s a problem, but why? Do rich people sit on their piles of money and cackle about how rich they are? Do they build giant houses that damage the environment? Well, they sometimes do.\n\nBut mostly they invest, hoping to get richer still. Those investments create jobs and better products and make most everyone else richer. Even if the rich leave money in banks, banks lend it to people who put it to productive use.\n\nSure, income inequality has grown -- but so what? The rich don\u2019t get richer at the expense of the poor. Poor people\u2019s income grew 48 percent over the past 35 years. Bernie Sanders says that \u201cthe middle class is disappearing!\u201d But that\u2019s mainly because many middle-class people moved into the upper class. Middle class incomes grew 40 percent over the past 30 years.\n\nThis year we heard more horror stories about bad schools and students who don\u2019t learn. But take heart: Seven more states passed education choice legislation.\n\nThat means more students can opt out of bad schools and pick better ones, and over the long haul competing schools will have to get better at what they do. That will lead to a brighter future for all students -- and for society, which will benefit from their improved skills.\n\nIn 2015, two more states and Washington, D.C., legalized marijuana.

As I mentioned, terrorism is up. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are on track to lead America into bankruptcy.

As Marian Tupy of HumanProgress.org puts it, \u201cAway from the front pages of our newspapers and television, billions of people go about their lives unmolested, enjoying incremental improvements that make each year better than the last.\u201d\n\nSo enjoy it.
