Here's everything you need to know:\n\nWhat is 'chain migration'?\n\nThe term itself remains a point of heated contention.

In 2016, 805,000 of the 1.1 million people who legally entered the U.S. came in via a family member \u2014 with Mexico, the Philippines, and China leading the list of feeder countries.
