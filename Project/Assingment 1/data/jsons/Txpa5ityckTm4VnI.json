    "content": "President Trump held a contentious press conference in which he answered critics who said he waited too long to condemn the white nationalists who staged a protest in Charlottesville , Va. , on Aug. 12 that turned violent . Here we put into context some of the statements that the president made in his defense :\n\u2022 Trump said that when he first spoke about Charlottesville on Aug. 12 \u2014 blaming \u201c many sides \u201d for the violence \u2014 he didn \u2019 t have the facts , saying \u201c a lot of the event didn \u2019 t even happen yet , as we were speaking. \u201d The president spoke at 3:30 p.m. , nearly two hours after a speeding car plowed into counterprotesters .\n\u2022 The president also said \u201c before I make a statement , I like to know the facts. \u201d Trump hasn \u2019 t always waited for \u201c the facts \u201d after a tragedy . For example , he speculated that \u201c yet another terrorist attack \u201d was to blame for an EgyptAir plane that disappeared May 19 , 2016 . The cause is still unknown .\n\u2022 The president also said he did not know when he spoke on Aug. 12 that former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke was at the rally . We don \u2019 t know what the president knew . But we can say that about two hours before the president spoke , CNN aired an interview with Duke at the rally praising Trump , and Duke tweeted about Trump .\nTrump answered questions about the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville for the first time at a press conference on Aug. 15 .\nAt the event , the president discussed his first response to the Charlottesville violence on Aug. 12 . The president held a bill-signing ceremony at about 3:30 p.m. on Aug. 12 \u2014 about four hours after the Virginia governor declared a state of emergency and about two hours after a speeding car plowed into counterprotesters . That attack killed one person and injured many others .\nIn his Aug. 12 remarks , the president blamed \u201c many sides \u201d for the violence in Charlottesville . \u201c We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred , bigotry and violence on many sides , on many sides , \u201d Trump said at the time . It wasn \u2019 t until two days later that he condemned \u201c the KKK , neo-Nazis , white supremacists , and other hate groups . \u201d\nAsked why he waited \u201c so long \u201d to publicly denounce white nationalists for the violence , Trump said that he was waiting for more information , claiming \u201c a lot of the event didn \u2019 t even happen yet , as we were speaking . \u201d\nTrump , Aug. 15 : `` Here \u2019 s the thing . When I make a statement , I like to be correct . I want the facts . This event just happened . In fact , a lot of the event didn \u2019 t even happen yet , as we were speaking . This event just happened . ''\nTrump went on to say that when he spoke about Charlottesville at the bill signing he didn \u2019 t even know that Duke , the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard , was at the rally . \u201c I didn \u2019 t know David Duke was there , \u201d he said . \u201c I wanted to see the facts . \u201d\nWe don \u2019 t know what the president knew at the time of his remarks , but we present here a timeline of events .

But videos of the car attack were widely reported before Trump spoke , and witnesses described it as \u201c absolutely intentional , \u201d as Fox News reported .\nAs for Duke , CNN aired an interview with the former Klan leader at about two hours before Trump spoke . In the interview , Duke called the rally a \u201c turning point , \u201d saying those at the rally were going to \u201c fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. \u201d Duke had also tweeted about the rally \u2014 including a pair of tweets criticizing Trump at about an hour-and-a-half before Trump \u2019 s remarks .\nJason Kessler , a Charlottesville resident , organized the rally . Kessler is the founder of Unity & Security For America , a group described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as \u201c a nativist , white nationalist group. \u201d Richard Spencer , a leading white nationalist , was scheduled to speak at the rally .\n7:39 a.m. \u2013 David Duke , the former Klan leader , tweets , \u201c Today will be a historic day , remembered as the moment everything changed . # Charlottesville # UniteTheRight \u201d\n8:30 a.m. \u2013 Demonstrators begin to gather .

There is no place for this kind of violence in America . Lets come together as one ! \u201d\n1:31 p.m. \u2013 CNN airs an interview with Duke at the rally , which he said represents a \u201c turning point. \u201d The former Klan grand wizard said , \u201c We \u2019 re going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump . That \u2019 s what we believed in . That \u2019 s why we voted for Donald Trump , because he said we \u2019 re going to take our country back .

The Fox News reporter says that witnesses described the attack as \u201c absolutely intentional . \u201d\n3:30 p.m. \u2013 CNN reports it had \u201c now confirmed from Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer that one person has died , in fact , today during the violent events in the city . \u201d\n3:33 p.m. \u2013 Trump speaks about Charlottesville at a bill-signing ceremony . He blames \u201c many sides \u201d for the violence .\n4:18 p.m. \u2013 Fox News tweets that the driver was in custody for \u201c intentional collaborated car attack in # charlottesville . \u201d\n5 p.m. \u2013 Shortly after 5 p.m. , a Virginia State Police helicopter monitoring the rally crashes and two state troopers are killed .\nWe would also note that Trump hasn \u2019 t always waited for \u201c the facts \u201d before weighing in on a tragedy .\nFor example , Trump wasted little time in speculating that terrorism was to blame for the disappearance of an EgyptAir plane carrying 66 people over the Mediterranean in the early morning hours of May 19 , 2016 . \u201c Looks like yet another terrorist attack , \u201d Trump tweeted less than 12 hours after the plane went missing .\nThe cause of the crash still remains unknown . In May , French investigators contradicted earlier reports that traces of explosives were found on the bodies of victims . And in June , it was reported that French authorities were looking into the possibility that the crash may have been caused by an overheated mobile device in the cockpit .\nThe day after the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando on June , 12 , 2016 , Trump made a series of inaccurate statements related to the incident .\nIn an interview on CNN , Trump said \u201c many people \u201d thought the Orlando shooter , Omar Mateen , \u201c was a whack job , \u201d but they didn \u2019 t report him . In fact , Mateen \u2019 s co-workers in 2013 reported that he boasted of having terrorist ties , and the FBI investigated and interviewed him .\nIn the same interview , Trump specifically singled out Muslims for failing to cooperate with law enforcement . He said , \u201c For some reason , the Muslim community does not report people like this. \u201d That was wrong , too .\nMohammed A. Malik , who had known Mateen since 2006 , wrote in The Washington Post on June 20 , 2016 , that he contacted the FBI in 2014 after he learned that Mateen had been watching videotapes of \u201c Anwar al-Awlaki , the charismatic Yemen-based imam who helped radicalize several Muslims. \u201d Malik said he wrote his op-ed to refute Trump \u2019 s claim that \u201c the Muslim community does not report people like this. \u201d Malik writes , \u201c I \u2019 m just tired of negative rhetoric and ignorant comments about my faith . \u201d\nA day after the Orlando shooting , Trump also repeated the baseless claim that \u201c many people , \u201d including neighbors of the earlier San Bernardino shooters , saw \u201c bombs all over the floor \u201d of the apartment , but did not report it to authorities because of concerns about racial profiling . There is still no evidence of that .\nMore : Trump : 'Alt left ' protesters just as violent as white supremacists",
