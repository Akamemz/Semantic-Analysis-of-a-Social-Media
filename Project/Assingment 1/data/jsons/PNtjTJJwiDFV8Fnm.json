    "content": "Hillary Clinton clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday night , becoming the first woman in American history to top the ticket of a major political party and putting immediate pressure on primary rival Bernie Sanders to step aside \u2013 though the Vermont senator vowed to keep fighting for \u201c every delegate . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 projected Tuesday that Clinton will win an outright majority of pledged delegates , while reaching the 2,383 necessary to clinch the nomination with help from free-agent \u201c superdelegates . \u201d\nAs Clinton now launches a general election battle against presumptive rival Donald Trump , Sanders remained defiant at an early Wednesday morning rally in Los Angeles , where he awaited results of the California primary , which \u2588\u2588\u2588 has yet to call . The results of the California vote could weigh heavily on Sanders ' decision whether to go forward .\nMeanwhile , \u2588\u2588\u2588 confirmed early Wednesday that Sanders was planning to lay off more than half his campaign staff .\nFar from bowing out , however , he vowed to campaign through the final primary next Tuesday in Washington , D.C. , and then \u201c take our fight for social , economic , racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , \u201d the site of the convention .\nThe crowd erupted in cheers as Sanders announced he \u2019 d keep going , a decision he kept close to the vest right up until his remarks .\nSanders closed by declaring : \u201c Thank you all , the struggle continues . \u201d\nIn a potential move toward reconciliation , however , the White House revealed that President Obama called both Clinton and Sanders Tuesday night \u2013 and plans to meet with Sanders at the White House on Thursday , to discuss `` how to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic voters . ''\nClinton earlier claimed victory over Sanders \u2013 after attaining the delegates needed to claim the nomination outright with a New Jersey primary win \u2013 during a lofty speech to supporters in Brooklyn .\nMarking the historic moment , Clinton said : \u201c This campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings , no limits on any of us . \u201d\nShe also congratulated Sanders , calling his campaign and the debate he brought about income inequality good for the party \u2013 while also saying this is a moment to \u201c come together . \u201d\nEight years to the day after she conceded to rival Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary , the former first lady and secretary of state became the presumptive 2016 nominee with the help of delegates in New Jersey . She won the state 's primary , and with it enough delegates to easily surpass the 2,383 needed to clinch the nomination . She also is projected to win New Mexico and South Dakota .\nSanders ' vow to stay in the race was based on his belief that his campaign could sway enough of Clinton 's superdelegates to force a contested convention . Superdelegates are free to support any candidate and do not technically vote for a nominee until the Democratic National Convention next month . Pledged delegates , however , are bound to support the candidate who won the primary or caucus .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 projects that with the delegates Clinton is winning in California , she will have won a majority of all pledged delegates at the Democratic convention -- making it more difficult for Sanders to argue she \u2019 s winning only because of support from superdelegates .\nSanders did notch projected wins Tuesday in North Dakota \u2019 s Democratic caucuses and the Montana primary . A total of six states were voting Tuesday .\nOn the GOP side , Donald Trump -- the only major Republican left in the race \u2013 was projected to win the primaries in California , Montana , New Jersey , South Dakota and New Mexico . Trump also surpassed a new milestone in the primary contest Tuesday night , winning enough bound delegates alone to clinch the GOP nomination .\nMarking his victories during remarks at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor , N.Y. , Trump said : \u201c Tonight , we close one chapter in history and we begin another . \u201d\nPreviewing the general election battle , he slammed the Clintons , alleging they \u201c turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. \u201d He also appealed to Sanders supporters , saying , \u201c We welcome you with open arms . \u201d\nClinton , in her victory speech , also took shots at Trump , claiming he would \u201c take America backwards . \u201d\n\u201c The stakes in this election are high , and the choice is clear . Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president , \u201d she said .\nThe contests Tuesday largely conclude one of the most unpredictable and rowdy primary seasons in modern history \u2013 one that saw a brash billionaire clear through a formidable field of 16 rivals to defy the pundits and claim the GOP nomination , and the front-runner on the Democratic side locked in a fight to the end against a socialist-leaning senator from Vermont .\nPrimary season formally ends next week when the District of Columbia holds its Democratic contest .\nEven before Tuesday \u2019 s races , both parties effectively had their presumptive nominees .
