    "content": "This Could Be The Busiest And Most Consequential Week Before Trump Takes Office\nThe week before Donald Trump takes the oath of office will set the stage for his entry into the Oval Office .

All times are Eastern .\nAttorney General nominee Jeff Sessions is first up in the confirmation hearings for Trump 's Cabinet picks , beginning at 9:30 a.m . Typically , there 's a lot of deference shown toward sitting senators , and the Alabama senator is well-liked on Capitol Hill . But there will still be questions at his Judiciary Committee hearing about allegations that he once used racist language when he was a U.S. Attorney . Those allegations sank his hopes of a federal judgeship 30 years ago when he failed to win a Senate confirmation vote . Sessions has denied those allegations .\nHe 'll also likely be asked about how he would handle civil rights cases , which have renewed scrutiny given the increased tensions between the police and many African-American communities in recent years . And he could also be pressed on whether he would prosecute Trump 's former opponent , Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , over her time at the State Department and her use of a private email server . `` Lock her up !
