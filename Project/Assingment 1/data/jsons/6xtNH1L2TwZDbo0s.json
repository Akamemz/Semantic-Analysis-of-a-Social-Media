Offense is the best defense\n\nThe president clearly realized this second debate was not a drill (one actually has to seem like he wants the job in order to get reelected).\n\nAfter taking a bit to find his groove, Obama unleashed attacks against Romney early and often, growing more forceful as the 90 minutes wore on. If anyone doubted that his internal polls showed him slipping and Romney rising, the forcefulness of his offensive should have erased that notion.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama fights back)\n\nObama tossed out kitchen-sink type opposition research data, including Romney\u2019s personal investments in certain China-based companies. He hit the GOP nominee as an \u201coutsourcer\u201d of jobs and over his personal tax rate. He unloaded the clip, including calling Romney \u201cextreme\u201d and saying his tax plan doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nObama was clearly making up for lost time (and lost poll support). Romney was also aggressive, but Obama\u2019s performance was more notable for the contrast to the first debate. Romney\u2019s attack lines, while also predictable, were less surprising because he used a number of them last time, and he got tripped up by Obama a few times and seemed too defensive at others.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Debate transcript (text, video)\n\nThe problem for a more aggressive Obama is how this style meshes with a candidate whose calling card is personal likability, but the president did what he had to do.\n\n2. One stage, two potential presidents\n\nDemocrats are calling the debate a clear win for Obama, and there\u2019s a strong case that the president won on points. Republicans were not making nearly as forceful a case for a Romney triumph in the immediate post-debate spin, and Romney missed some opportunities.\n\n( See also: Complete coverage of 2012 presidential debates)\n\nObama reversed course from Denver and paved the way to grab the momentum back from Romney in the next three weeks \u2014 the last of the campaign. In the spin room afterward, his aides looked as though they had all just let out a huge gasp of air.\n\nBut for the first 20 minutes of the debate, Obama seemed nervous, and Romney seemed sure-footed.\n\nObama didn\u2019t smile enough early on, and Romney sounded effective making a case against the president\u2019s economic policies. Obama seemed testy and a bit beaten-down by Romney at the outset.\n\n\u201c(The) first debate, there was one guy on stage who looked like a president. Second debate, two guys on stage look like a president,\u201d said Republican strategist Bruce Haynes of Purple Strategies. \u201cThey\u2019ve battled to a draw. I suspect the snap polls will give a small advantage to Obama because he improved so substantially over the last debate.\u201d Haynes gave points to Romney for some of his more tactical answers to specific audiences, especially on coal and on energy.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Liberals relieved by Obama\u2019s performance)\n\nWhile Romney didn\u2019t have many breakout moments, he did generally project a presidential image and for the second debate in a row, he offered voters a plausible alternative.\n\nThe bottom line: Both candidates gave strong performances, but needed different things and how they are viewed by voters will depend largely on what qualities and issues mean most to those watching at home.
