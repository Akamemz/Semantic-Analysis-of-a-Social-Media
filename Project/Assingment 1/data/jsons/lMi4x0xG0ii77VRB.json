And Facebook , with its 2 billion or so users , has plenty of them . But while Zuckerberg said Facebook is now ranking news outlets by trustworthiness\u2014in person , he didn \u2019 t seem to distinguish among the quality of opinions .\n\u201c I do think that in general , within a news organization , there is an opinion , \u201d he said . \u201c I do think that a lot of what you all do , is have an opinion and have a view . \u201d\nAnd Facebook , he says , simply \u201c has more opinions. \u201d Show users more opinions , and you give them more options . \u201c It \u2019 s not about saying here \u2019 s one view ; here \u2019 s the other side , \u201d Zuckerberg said when I asked him to reconcile the contradiction . \u201c You should decide where you want to be . \u201d\nDeciding what to believe based on other people \u2019 s opinions is not only not journalistic , it \u2019 s arguably hostile to the press as a democratic institution . The truth may be nuanced , but reportable facts are often quite straightforward . As any journalist can tell you , the best answer to the question \u201c what happened ? \u201d is not why don \u2019 t you ask a bunch of your friends what they think , organize their views along a spectrum , and then decide where to plant yourself .\nI was , apparently , not the only journalist in the room who took issue with Zuckerberg \u2019 s reasoning . His view isn \u2019 t just reductionist but outright Trumpian , argued Joseph Kahn , the managing editor of The New York Times , and particularly harmful to journalistic institutions at a time when the president of the United States has made an argument not unlike Zuckerberg \u2019 s to attack the free press . \u201c The institutional values of most really good media companies should transcend any individual opinion , \u201d Kahn said . And to say that journalism can be categorized the way Zuckerberg suggests is \u201c part and parcel of the polarization of society . \u201d\n\u201c I think that \u2019 s fair , \u201d Zuckerberg said . In a newspaper , he continued , publishing opinions in close proximity to the news is \u201c pretty dangerous. \u201d Facebook , on the other hand , is surveying readers to determine which professional news organizations are broadly trustworthy .\nFacebook wants its users to see less news on its platform these days , and most publishers are feeling the pain .
