    "content": "Senate Republicans emerged from their weekly luncheon Tuesday with a clear directive from party leaders : Don \u2019 t let Harry Reid get away with acting like he \u2019 s still majority leader .\nThey reacted with frustration and amusement to the Nevada Democrat \u2019 s latest gambit to block bipartisan trade legislation that he and much of his caucus oppose unless Republicans first address his demands . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell implored his caucus to band together against Reid , sources inside the room said .\n\u201c It takes a bit of an adjustment to move from majority leader back to minority leader , \u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , who has served as an emissary between Reid and McConnell . \u201c Maybe Sen. Reid has got some adjusting to do . It \u2019 s the prerogative of the majority leader to set the schedule . \u2026 He should understand that . \u201d\nAnother senator , who asked not to be named , said of Reid \u2019 s strategy : \u201c It \u2019 s comical . If we \u2019 re going to avoid such a fate , we have got to stick together . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s unclear , though , whether Republicans have the votes to stop Reid . The Senate minority leader is trying to cobble together 41 votes against Trade Promotion Authority legislation that would allow the president to fast-track new trade deals . He \u2019 s attempting to force floor votes on surveillance legislation and a highway funding bill before the Senate takes up the trade measure , which Reid and much of his caucus oppose .\nReid \u2019 s procedural power play is putting pro-trade Democrats in a squeeze between supporting their Senate leader and backing President Barack Obama , who views the historic trade deals as a major part of his second-term agenda . If it works , the move would give opponents weeks longer to muster opposition to TPA , which is a necessary first step to enacting the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership , the largest trade agreement in history . Close votes are expected in the House and possibly the Senate , and White House officials have been blanketing the Hill trying to line up support .\nThe president \u201c needs to work it , there \u2019 s no question about it . It \u2019 s unusual when you have the leader of the Democrats against what the president would like to do , \u201d sighed Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) , the primary mover of the Senate \u2019 s pro-trade efforts . \u201c This is the most important bill in this president \u2019 s eight years . \u201d\nIn the Democrats \u2019 own lunch gathering Tuesday , Reid urged his caucus to hang tight on the procedural vote , saying that there isn \u2019 t enough time to finish efforts to overhaul infrastructure legislation and the PATRIOT Act , both of which expire when the Senate is set to adjourn for its Memorial Day recess . He seemed to have the support of much , if not all , of his caucus , senators said . The Democratic co-sponsor of the trade bill , Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden , did not object to Reid \u2019 s strategy , senators said .\nAfter their dueling lunches , McConnell and Reid sparred over who \u2019 s in charge .\n\u201c There \u2019 s been some question about what \u2019 s next . That \u2019 s the responsibility of the majority . And we \u2019 ll be going to trade promotion next , \u201d McConnell told reporters .\nThe Democratic leader \u2019 s response : \u201c Who \u2019 s he trying to convince : him or me ? \u201d\nReid \u2019 s tactics are emblematic of his approach as minority leader . While he frequently derided McConnell \u2019 s use of the filibuster when Republicans were in the minority , Reid has increasingly used the procedural tool as a negotiating tactic to force the GOP to capitulate to his demands . He thwarted GOP efforts to defund Obama \u2019 s immigration actions and held up a popular human-trafficking bill over liberal opposition to an abortion provision appended to it .\nIn so doing , Reid has been able to disrupt McConnell \u2019 s carefully planned agenda and what has become a surprisingly productive work period for the gridlocked Congress .\nBut Reid \u2019 s latest tactic is his biggest gamble yet , given the bipartisan support for trade legislation , including from at least one vulnerable Democrat \u2014 Michael Bennet of Colorado \u2014 and a White House eager to tout its strength on the global stage . He is telling his pro-trade Democrats that he will eventually yield and let the matter come for a debate \u2014 but that might not happen until June .\nSenators and aides supportive of Reid \u2019 s plan couldn \u2019 t say for sure whether he has the votes to block the fast-track legislation from being debated next week , leaving its immediate future in question .\n\u201c Probably not , \u201d said Sen. Tom Carper ( D-Del . ) , who voted for the TPA bill in the Finance Committee , when asked whether he \u2019 d back Reid \u2019 s tactics . \u201c I probably will have a different view . \u201d\nAdded Sen. Bill Nelson ( D-Fla. ) , who also voted for the bill in committee : \u201c I want to go on and get TPA up and get it passed . So they can go on and get the negotiating done \u201d on the TPP agreement .\nBut so far , Carper and Nelson are the only two Democrats who \u2019 ve said they \u2019 d break ranks with Reid ; at least four others would be needed to allow McConnell to forge ahead next week on trade legislation , assuming the GOP leader is able to keep Southern Republicans who are skeptical of trade deals to side with him on opening debate . Sen. Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) , the lone Republican to oppose the bill in committee , said in an interview he would vote to open debate on the bill , shoring up the GOP \u2019 s whip count .\nBut several other prominent Democratic backers of the TPA legislation refused to commit to advancing the bill when it comes to the floor next week , sometime after the Senate finishes an Iran-related bill . The list of on-the-fence senators includes Democratic Sens . Maria Cantwell of Washington , Ben Cardin of Maryland , Mark Warner of Virginia and even Finance Committee ranking member Wyden \u2014 all of whom supported the trade legislation in committee \u2014 as well as potential trade supporters Sens . Dianne Feinstein of California , Tim Kaine of Virginia and Patty Murray of Washington .\n\u201c We want to make sure some other things get dealt with , \u201d Cantwell said .\n\u201c The TPA has time . The highway bill and a couple of other things don \u2019 t , \u201d Feinstein concluded .\nGiven the array of Democrats who are declining to say they will break with Reid , the GOP \u2019 s chief vote counter conceded that the minority leader \u2019 s threat should be taken seriously .\n\u201c If they want to do it , then they can probably do it . But why they would want to kneecap the president \u2019 s biggest economic priority is beyond me , \u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) .\nWhile Reid is unlikely to stop the trade bill in the end , his move could make it impossible for the Senate to wrap up the measure before the chamber breaks for its Memorial Day recess around May 22 . And his goal is as much to disrupt new trade pacts as it is to smoke out McConnell \u2019 s tightly held plans on how to meet May \u2019 s deadlines .\nDemocrats believe there \u2019 s no hope of finishing trade and making tangible progress on the surveillance and transportation legislation in the limited time left before statutory deadlines , and they are seeking to highlight the increasingly likely possibility that lawmakers will be forced to swallow stopgap extensions for both at the last minute .\n\u201c Look , here \u2019 s the bottom line . We have two immediate deadlines : [ Surveillance ] and highways . If we get on trade , we \u2019 ll never get to them , \u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) . \u201c What Harry has done makes some sense . \u201d\nMcConnell prefers a straight reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act , shrugging off reform proposals from House members and some senators . And given the difficulty Congress has had passing infrastructure funding , it \u2019 s a long shot that Congress can come up with a multibillion dollar package for roads , bridges and transit in the next two weeks .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know if his math is different than mine , \u201d Reid said of McConnell . \u201c But I kinda understand how the floor works and I think it would be really unwise to leave here without doing something on [ surveillance ] and highways . \u201d",
