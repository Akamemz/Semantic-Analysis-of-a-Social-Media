The other system has made selections from Dole to McCain to Romney , and each of them did not succeed in winning the presidency . We just feel there is a better way of doing this . ''\nIf North Carolina goes early and holds its primary before March 1 , the RNC would chop its sizeable delegation of 72 delegates down to 12 , making the state a dubious prize for candidates on hunt for convention delegates .\n`` We have won a governorship , two U.S. senators and the General Assembly , '' he said . `` North Carolina has been one of the leading states in strengthening the Republican Party , and we feel that any sanctions against us would be against a group of people who have made great strides in helping the Republican Party in the Southeast and in the rest of the country .

Pat McCrory in late 2013 as part of an election overhaul package that included strict new voter identification regulations , dictates that the North Carolina primary , for both Democrats and Republicans , must occur on the Tuesday after South Carolina 's 2016 presidential primary .\nThe first four `` carve out '' states that kick off the primary process are the only ones allowed to hold contests in February . The exact dates have not been set .

But the new date also violates Democratic National Committee rules and would result in steep penalties for the state 's Democratic convention delegates .\nBesides the early burst of national attention , Rucho said one reason to hold the North Carolina primary in February , rather than its traditional slot in May , is that candidates will already be spending their money and time in South Carolina .\nSo , he asked , why not make it easier for candidates to compete in a contest next door , when they 've already unleashed their money on television ads in media markets such as Charlotte , Asheville and Wilmington that bleed into into northern swaths of South Carolina ?\n`` The logic behind it is that a good number of a people in the southern portion of the state , the media markets there , will already be engaged , '' Rucho said . `` Since they are here already , it would be smart for us to move forward and have it a week after South Carolina . It 's efficiency and reducing the costs of campaign expenses . They will have been here already , the money will have been spent . ''\nThat flies in the face of carefully laid plans by the RNC , which vowed to crack down on rogue states after an unruly 2012 nomination fight that saw several states jump the line , forcing Iowa and New Hampshire to move their contests into the frozen early days of January .\nSo far , the 2016 primary order seems to be holding , with other states such as Michigan passing laws to comply with RNC rules after their dates conflicted with the calendar . For the first time since 1996 , the Iowa caucuses are on pace to happen in February , sparing voters , campaign staffers and reporters from another holiday season in last-minute campaign mode .\nBut North Carolina remains a wild card , drawing scrutiny from national party leaders .\nRNC Chairman Reince Priebus called McCrory last week to discuss the situation , one GOP source told CNN , and Thom Tillis , the state 's junior senator , `` supports holding North Carolina 's primary on a date consistent with RNC rules , '' a spokesman for the senator said .\nRichard Burr , the state 's senior senator who is up for re-election in 2016 , declined to comment on the situation through a spokeswoman .\nNorth Carolina GOP Chairman Claude Pope Jr. , who has a fraught relationship with Rucho , published an op-ed in The Charlotte Observer calling on the legislature to move the primary to March 1 , where it would join seven other Southern states banding together for a multistate `` SEC Primary '' day .\n`` Our legislature had good intentions when it established a February primary date , assuming that the world would beat a path to our door -- bringing national media exposure , money , and an economic boom-let to North Carolina , '' Pope wrote . `` But the crowded field of presidential wannabes will not step foot in our state .
