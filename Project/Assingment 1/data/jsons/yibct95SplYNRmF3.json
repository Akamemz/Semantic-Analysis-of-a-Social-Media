    "content": "The Louisville Metro Police Department announced Tuesday that it has fired Brett Hankison , one of the officers involved in the March shooting death of 26-year-old emergency medical worker Breonna Taylor . In a letter to Hankison tweeted by the department , the Louisville police chief called his conduct `` a shock to the conscience . ''\nTaylor was killed on March 13 , when officers entered her home looking for illegal drugs . Officials claimed the officers knocked on the door and announced themselves , and only started shooting after they were `` immediately met by gunfire '' from Taylor 's boyfriend , Kenneth Walker . But Taylor 's family said in a lawsuit that the officers did not identify themselves , and that Walker \u2014 a licensed gun owner \u2014 thought someone was trying to break in .\nThe letter states that Hankison was found to have violated two standard operating procedures : obedience to rules and regulations and use of deadly force .\nHankison violated the first procedure when he `` wantonly and blindly fired ten ( 10 ) rounds '' into Taylor 's apartment , Chief of Police Robert Schroeder wrote in the letter , adding , `` These rounds created a substantial danger of death and serious injury to Breonna Taylor and the three occupants of the apartment next to Ms . Taylor 's . ''\nSchroeder said Hankison also violated the department 's use of force procedure when he fired the rounds `` without supporting facts that your deadly force was directed at a person against whom posed an immediate threat of danger or serious injury to yourself or others . ''\n`` In fact the ten ( 10 ) rounds you fired were into a patio door and window which were covered with material that completely prevented you from verifying any person as an immediate threat or more importantly any innocent persons present , '' he added .\nSchroeder also said three of the rounds Hankison fired entered the apartment next to Taylor 's , `` endangering the three lives in that apartment . ''\n`` Based upon my review , these are extreme violations of our policies , '' Schroeder wrote . `` I find your conduct a shock to the conscience . I am alarmed and stunned you used deadly force in this fashion . You have never been trained by the Louisville Metro Police Department to use deadly force in this fashion . Your actions have brought discredit upon yourself and the Department . ''\n`` I can not tolerate this type of conduct by any member of the Louisville Metro Police Department , '' he added . `` Your conduct demands your termination . ''\nThe three officers involved in the shooting \u2014 Hankison , Jon Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove \u2014 had all been placed on administrative reassignment throughout the investigation .
