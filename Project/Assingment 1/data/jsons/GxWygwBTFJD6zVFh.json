Scott Walker lost his re-election bid against Democrat Tony Evers, the state superintendent of public instruction.\n\nIt is a new feeling for Walker, who is used to victory in the Badger State. He first won the governorship in 2010. Then, two years later, he became the first governor to survive a recall vote after rolling back labor unions\u2019 collective bargaining rights. He then won re-election in 2014. But, he is finally forced to hand over the keys to the governor\u2019s mansion. Walker also ran for president in the 2016 election but was one of the first candidates to drop out of the race due to low polling.\n\nTeachers unions hadn\u2019t forgotten how he tampered with collective bargaining. Many Democrats in the state still \u201chate him\u201d for it, according to GOP strategist Brandon Scholz. Up until this February, some unions were trying to sue to get the law overturned.\n\nSo, then, it's no wonder they were eager to unseat him with someone like Evers. The 67-year-old state superintendent is a former teacher and he supports a $15-an-hour minimum wage.\n\nWhile some Wisconsinites and unions are cheering Evers's win, they seem more satisfied by Walker's loss.\n\nAs a long time Wisconsin resident, who got to see close up the very real damage that Scott Walker did to education (teachers, schools, universities) in Wisconsin, this put a very particular smile on my face. https://t.co/w7lve3lmKT \u2014 Neil Gaiman (@neilhimself) November 7, 2018",
