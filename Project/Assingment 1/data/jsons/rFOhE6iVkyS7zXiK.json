    "content": "In the homestretch of his final campaign , President Obama has ditched the language of lower expectations once prominent in his stump speech , focusing instead on a repackaged jobs plan and adding a heavy dose of ridicule for Republican rival Mitt Romney .\nWhen he embarked on his re-election bid more than a year ago , the president often sounded like he was on a mission to win back liberal supporters in a nonexistent Democratic primary . In his standard campaign speech , Mr. Obama would remind voters of the excitement generated by his candidacy in 2008 , and would try to explain in apologetic tones why the pace of change was so slow in the four years since .\n\u201c That old \u2018 Hope \u2019 poster is fading , \u201d he would say in a typical speech , referring to the iconic campaign image of him from 2008 . \u201c My hair is a little grayer now . But I just want to remind all of you that we never said this was going to be easy . We never said that change was going to happen overnight . \u201d\nEven after Mr. Romney was assured of the Republican Party nomination , in mid-August , the president was criticizing the policies of his predecessor , George W. Bush , more than he was taking aim at Mr. Romney or explaining in his campaign speeches what he would do over the next four years .\n\u201c When I walked into office , we already had a $ 1 trillion deficit , \u201d Mr. Obama said at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 15 . \u201c And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression . That \u2019 s the track record of the other party the last time they were in charge . \u201d\nBut over the final weeks of the campaign , amid criticism that he lacked a specific agenda for a second term , Mr. Obama has sharpened his message about creating opportunity for the middle class . Nowadays , he doesn \u2019 t dwell on economic history lessons , telling audiences instead , \u201c I \u2019 ve got a plan that will actually create jobs . \u201d\n\u201c We have a message that we want to talk to voters about moving this country forward , \u201d Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said Thursday in a conference call with reporters . \u201c That \u2019 s what we should be doing . \u201d\nThe Romney campaign has dismissed Mr. Obama \u2019 s \u201c new \u201d jobs plan that he outlines in his stump speech as recycled administration proposals of the past four years . For example , hiring more teachers was part of the president \u2019 s \u201c jobs bill \u201d that he proposed to a joint session of Congress in September 2011 . But after Mr. Romney and even some of Mr. Obama \u2019 s supporters started wondering aloud what the president planned do in a second term , in late October the president began referring to his plan to recruit 100,000 math and science teachers as part of his \u201c nation-building mission \u201d to improve education and worker training .\n\u201c It \u2019 s in part to respond to the central criticism that Romney \u2019 s levied against him , which is that he didn \u2019 t get the job done , \u201d said Simon Rosenberg , founder of the Washington-based New Democrat Network . \u201c The Romney campaign is a very simple campaign . They have one argument \u2014 that Obama didn \u2019 t get the job done . So Obama \u2019 s responding in his close by saying , \u2026 \u2018 This is what I \u2019 m going to do . \u2019 \u201d\nAnother feature that Mr. Obama has added to his stump speech , since his first debate with Mr. Romney on Oct. 3 , is nearly nonstop mocking of the Republican . By even his own account , the president badly lost the first debate to his GOP rival , a loss he blamed in part on a shift in positions from Mr. Romney on various issues . Since then , in his campaign speech , he has been trying to get back at the Republican .\nOn Oct. 4 , the president began talking about the difference between \u201c the real Mitt Romney \u201d and \u201c the guy on stage. \u201d The next day , he ridiculed Mr. Romney for undergoing \u201c an extreme makeover. \u201d The president started poking fun at his rival for wanting to eliminate funding for Big Bird and of \u201c Sesame Street \u201d and PBS , but dropped the reference when Mr. Romney began to criticize Mr. Obama for turning the campaign into a debate about \u201c small things . \u201d\nAt a rally at George Mason University in Fairfax on Oct. 19 , the president revealed a mocking term for Mr. Romney that he has kept in his stump speech since : \u201c Romnesia. \u201d It \u2019 s Mr. Obama \u2019 s name for the alleged condition in which Mr. Romney is unable to remember his previously stated positions on the issues .\n\u201c If you say women should have access to contraceptive care , but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care \u2014 you might have a case of Romnesia , \u201d Mr. Obama says , before adding a pitch for his own national health care law that he has become more open in defending .\nThe president \u2019 s punch line : \u201c Obamacare covers pre-existing conditions .
