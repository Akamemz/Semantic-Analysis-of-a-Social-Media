Your home can talk to you , filling you in on what 's happening with specific alerts , photos and video .\nSince most newer systems use cellular connections , they 're more reliable than older ones that relied on traditional phone line connections .

''\nMore than 15 % of U.S. homes have a home security system that will alert a monitoring firm in case of incidents , according to market researcher Parks Associates .
