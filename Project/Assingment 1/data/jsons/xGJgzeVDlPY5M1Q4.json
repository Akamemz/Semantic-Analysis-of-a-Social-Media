Emmett Till\u2019s lynching in 1955 drew attention to the brutality of the pre-civil rights era in the South. The beating of Rodney King and acquittal of the officers involved sparked the Los Angeles riots in 1992. The police killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown in 2014 brought the Black Lives Matter movement into the national consciousness.\n\nThey were, of course, not the only black people to be lynched, beaten or killed in those eras. But a combination of circumstances, timing and the context of the moment turned them into enduring figures. George Floyd\u2019s name will almost certainly join that list given the extraordinary nationwide reaction to the way he was killed by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nFloyd\u2019s death was part of a string of recent controversial killings. Ahmaud Arbery was gunned down by a white father and son while jogging through a suburban Georgia neighborhood. Breonna Taylor was shot eight times by police who busted through her apartment door late at night in Louisville, Ky.

But Floyd\u2019s death is what ultimately sparked a movement that will likely be remembered as one of the pivotal moments of the decade.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nPerhaps the simplest answer to what made Floyd\u2019s case unique is the circumstance of his death. The vast majority of the roughly 1,000 people killed each year by police are shot. Floyd died after having an officer\u2019s knee pressed into his neck for nearly nine minutes.

The officer who kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter.
