For our running post about developments on Saturday , go here . )\nAfter a massive manhunt that locked down most of the Boston metropolitan area , police apprehended Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , whom the FBI had identified as suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon . The Boston Police Department made the announcement in a twitter message late Friday night .\nDzhokhar was found hiding in a boat in the back of a house in Watertown , Massachusetts . A homeowner , who walked to his backyard , shortly after police called off the lockdown , saw blood on his boat . He picked up the canvas cover and saw the suspect lying there .\nPolice surrounded the house at around 7:30 p.m . ET . Using thermal sensors , helicopters picked up his movement and after more than an hour of the hostage rescue team trying to communicate with him unsuccesfully , they moved in and he was apprehended .\nKey Developments : \u2014 After a massive manhunt that locked down most of the Boston metropolitan area , police apprehended Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , whom the FBI had identified as suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon . \u2014 His older brother , Tamerlan , was killed in a gun exchange early Friday . \u2014 The two are ethnic Chechnyans , though relatives say they lived much of their lives in Kyrgyzstan and the U.S. \u2014 They are also suspected in the shooting death of an MIT university police officer .\nResidents of Watertown took the street en-masse . Television images showed them cheering on emergency workers and chanting `` USA ! USA ! USA ! ''\nWBUR 's Fred Thys reports the `` 19-year-old suspect was bloodied when taken into custody . '' NPR 's Richard Knox reports that he was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital .\nTamerlan Tsarnaev , Dzhokhar 's older brother , whom the FBI identified as suspect 1 in the bombings , was killed in a gun exchange early Friday with police in Watertown , Mass .\nThe two suspects , authorities initially told NPR and other news outlets , were brothers from Chechnya . Later Friday , relatives said that while the family is originally from Chechnya , the brothers lived there only briefly . The family lived for many years in Kyrgyzstan , before coming to the U.S. in the past decade .\nMass transit service in the Boston area was suspended Friday morning . So was taxi service for the first few hours of the day . Drivers were being told to stay off the streets in Watertown . Businesses there were told not to open . Boston city officials asked residents to `` please go home '' and not congregate at bus stops or other places . Just after 8 a.m . ET , officials said the `` shelter in place '' advisory had been extended to the entire city of Boston .\nThe dramatic series of events began to unfold late Thursday , with what turned out to be an unrelated robbery at a convenience store in Cambridge , Mass. , and the shooting death of a police officer on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Minutes later , officials say , an SUV was carjacked in Cambridge .\nThat SUV was driven to Watertown . There , authorities say , the suspects threw explosives at police and exchanged gunfire . One of the two \u2014 known as `` black hat '' for the cap he was seen wearing at the marathon \u2014 was critically injured and later died . The other , `` white hat , '' whom the FBI says was seen in security video dropping off a backpack near the second explosion , fled the area and led authorities in a massive manhunt that culminated late at night .\n`` CAPTURED ! ! ! The hunt is over . The search is done . The terror is over . And justice has won . Suspect in custody , '' Boston Police Department tweeted . They added : `` In our time of rejoicing , let us not forget the families of Martin Richard , Lingzi Lu , Krystle Campbell and Officer Sean Collier .

It read in part :\n`` None of this will bring our beloved Martin back , or reverse the injuries these men inflicted on our family and nearly two hundred others . We continue to pray for healing and for comfort on the long road that lies ahead for every victim and their loved ones . `` Tonight , our family applauds the entire law enforcement community for a job well done , and trust that our justice system will now do its job . ''\nA Department of Justice official tells NPR 's Carrie Johnson that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will not be read his Miranda rights for now .\n`` We plan to invoke the public safety exception to Miranda in order to question the suspect extensively about other potential explosive devices or accomplices and to gain critical intelligence , '' the official said .\n`` We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all our outstanding law enforcement officials , '' President Obama said this evening .\nObama then went on to remember the MIT officer killed during the course of the manhunt and went on to mention the three people who were killed during the bombings .\n`` Tonight there are still many unanswered questions , '' Obama said . Among them , he said , why would a young person , who grew up in the United States `` resort to such violence . '' Also : `` How did they plan '' this and `` did they have any help . ''\n`` The families of the victims deserve answers , '' Obama said . `` The wounded deserve answers . ''\nObama also took on the greater issues . He said whatever the bombers were trying to accomplish `` they 've already failed . ''\n`` They failed because we will not waiver from the character and the compassion and the values that define us as a country , '' Obama said .\nThe president reminded the country that as the investigation and judicial process continue , Americans need to `` stay true '' to the unity and diversity that `` makes us strong as a country . ''\nBoston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis says police were called to a residence in Watertown after a home owner came outside and saw blood on his boat . He picked up the tarp and saw a man covered in blood .\nPolice rushed to the scene , setting up a perimeter . Police and the suspect exchanged gun fire and the `` hostage rescue team made entry into the boat . ''\nThe suspect , said Davis , was alive . The hostage rescue team tried to communicate with him before moving in , but he did not respond .\n`` The man who found him at the boat said he was covered in blood , '' Davis said . `` We assume the injuries occurred the night before . ''\nCol. Timothy P. Alben , superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police , said the suspect was in `` serious condition . ''\n`` We 're exhausted but we have a victory here tonight , '' Col. Timothy P. Alben , superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police said during a televised news briefing .\nMass . Gov . Deval Patrick echoed those sentiments , saying that tonight is one `` where we 're all going to rest easier . ''\nPresident Obama is also scheduled to speak after this press conference is over .\nAn FBI source tells Dina Temple-Raston that a negotiator was key in helping convince Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to give himself up . She tells us :\n`` Source says it 's unclear whether the suspect was wearing a suicide vest or had some other type of booby trap . `` We expect more details about the operation later tonight . ''\nBoston Police tweeted that authorities would hold a 9:30 p.m . ET . press conference .\nUpdate at 9:19 p.m . ET .

Officers sweeping the area . Stand by for further info .\nTalking to All Things Considered , Keith Glavish , who lives about five houses away from where police believe Dzhokhar is located , says he can hear a helicopter overhead and has occasionally heard `` shots '' that `` sound like firecrackers . ''\n`` The whole scene is totally surreal , '' Glavish said . `` I mean , this is a very , very quiet neighborhood . ... I pinch myself to realize that this is actually unfolding , literally outside our door . We 've been inside all day long , cooped up , and thinking , 'Well , it 's on the other side of Watertown , we do n't really have to worry . ' I took the dog in the backyard a few times . But this is unbelievable . ''\nMeanwhile The Boston Globe tweets that one of its photographers can hear police talking to a person they believe is the suspect .\n`` We know you 're in there , '' the Globe reports police are saying . `` Come out on your own terms .

''\nAt the end of the investigation , they did n't `` find anything that was enough to allow them to hold onto him . ''\nTamerlan 's mother told Russia Today , a news organization funded by the Russian government , that her children had been followed by the FBI `` for years . '' RT reports :\n`` Her biggest suspicion surrounding the case was the constant FBI surveillance she said her family was subjected to over the years . She is surprised that having been so stringent with the entire family , the FBI had no idea the sons were supposedly planning a terrorist act . ''\nUpdate at 7:31 p.m . ET . Police Believe They 've Located Suspect :\nAn FBI source tells NPR 's Dina Temple-Raston that police have located the suspect .\n`` Officers are proceeding with caution as an official fears the suspect may have booby-trapped the scene . `` FBI is waiting for a tactical team and bomb technician . `` FBI is behaving as if the suspect is still alive .

But Alben said he believes the fugitive is still in Massachusetts .\nUpdate at 6:09 p.m . ET . Stay-Indoors Order Lifted ; No Apprehension :\nDuring a news briefing in Watertown , Massachusetts , a short time ago , authorities said the `` stay-indoors request '' has been lifted , but that no suspect has been arrested .\nGov .

'' Police followed many leads , but none of them have been fruitful .\n`` We do not have apprehension ... but we will have one , '' said Alben .\nWe 've already given you a timeline of events .

See this note about how we cover news such as this. For our running post about developments on Saturday, go here.)\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Matt Rourke/AP\n\nAfter a massive manhunt that locked down most of the Boston metropolitan area, police apprehended Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, whom the FBI had identified as suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon. The Boston Police Department made the announcement in a twitter message late Friday night.\n\nDzhokhar was found hiding in a boat in the back of a house in Watertown, Massachusetts. A homeowner, who walked to his backyard, shortly after police called off the lockdown, saw blood on his boat. He picked up the canvas cover and saw the suspect lying there.\n\nPolice surrounded the house at around 7:30 p.m. ET. Using thermal sensors, helicopters picked up his movement and after more than an hour of the hostage rescue team trying to communicate with him unsuccesfully, they moved in and he was apprehended.\n\nKey Developments: \u2014 After a massive manhunt that locked down most of the Boston metropolitan area, police apprehended Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, whom the FBI had identified as suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon. \u2014 His older brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a gun exchange early Friday. \u2014 The two are ethnic Chechnyans, though relatives say they lived much of their lives in Kyrgyzstan and the U.S. \u2014 They are also suspected in the shooting death of an MIT university police officer.\n\nResidents of Watertown took the street en-masse. Television images showed them cheering on emergency workers and chanting \"USA! USA! USA!\"\n\nWBUR's Fred Thys reports the \"19-year-old suspect was bloodied when taken into custody.\" NPR's Richard Knox reports that he was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital.\n\nTamerlan Tsarnaev, Dzhokhar's older brother, whom the FBI identified as suspect 1 in the bombings, was killed in a gun exchange early Friday with police in Watertown, Mass.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption FBI FBI\n\ntoggle caption AP\n\nThe two suspects, authorities initially told NPR and other news outlets, were brothers from Chechnya. Later Friday, relatives said that while the family is originally from Chechnya, the brothers lived there only briefly. The family lived for many years in Kyrgyzstan, before coming to the U.S. in the past decade.\n\nMass transit service in the Boston area was suspended Friday morning. So was taxi service for the first few hours of the day. Drivers were being told to stay off the streets in Watertown. Businesses there were told not to open. Boston city officials asked residents to \"please go home\" and not congregate at bus stops or other places. Just after 8 a.m. ET, officials said the \"shelter in place\" advisory had been extended to the entire city of Boston.\n\nThe dramatic series of events began to unfold late Thursday, with what turned out to be an unrelated robbery at a convenience store in Cambridge, Mass., and the shooting death of a police officer on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Minutes later, officials say, an SUV was carjacked in Cambridge.\n\nThat SUV was driven to Watertown. There, authorities say, the suspects threw explosives at police and exchanged gunfire. One of the two \u2014 known as \"black hat\" for the cap he was seen wearing at the marathon \u2014 was critically injured and later died. The other, \"white hat,\" whom the FBI says was seen in security video dropping off a backpack near the second explosion, fled the area and led authorities in a massive manhunt that culminated late at night.\n\n\"CAPTURED!!! The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over. And justice has won. Suspect in custody,\" Boston Police Department tweeted. They added: \"In our time of rejoicing, let us not forget the families of Martin Richard, Lingzi Lu, Krystle Campbell and Officer Sean Collier.\"\n\nWe're following the story and updating as news comes in. There's a timeline of the manhunt posted here; a story about the Boston lockdown is here; a profile of the suspects is here, and NPR's coverage of the bombings and the search for the suspects is collected here.\n\nUpdate at 11:01 p.m. ET. 'A Job Well Done':\n\nThe family of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed in the attack, just sent out a statement. It read in part:\n\n\"None of this will bring our beloved Martin back, or reverse the injuries these men inflicted on our family and nearly two hundred others. We continue to pray for healing and for comfort on the long road that lies ahead for every victim and their loved ones. \"Tonight, our family applauds the entire law enforcement community for a job well done, and trust that our justice system will now do its job.\"\n\nUpdate at 10:43 p.m. ET. No Miranda:\n\nA Department of Justice official tells NPR's Carrie Johnson that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will not be read his Miranda rights for now.\n\n\"We plan to invoke the public safety exception to Miranda in order to question the suspect extensively about other potential explosive devices or accomplices and to gain critical intelligence,\" the official said.\n\nUpdate at 10:12 p.m. ET. 'Tremendous Debt Of Gratitude':\n\n\"We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all our outstanding law enforcement officials,\" President Obama said this evening.\n\nObama then went on to remember the MIT officer killed during the course of the manhunt and went on to mention the three people who were killed during the bombings.\n\n\"Tonight there are still many unanswered questions,\" Obama said. Among them, he said, why would a young person, who grew up in the United States \"resort to such violence.\" Also: \"How did they plan\" this and \"did they have any help.\"\n\n\"The families of the victims deserve answers,\" Obama said. \"The wounded deserve answers.\"\n\nObama also took on the greater issues. He said whatever the bombers were trying to accomplish \"they've already failed.\"\n\n\"They failed because we will not waiver from the character and the compassion and the values that define us as a country,\" Obama said.\n\nThe president reminded the country that as the investigation and judicial process continue, Americans need to \"stay true\" to the unity and diversity that \"makes us strong as a country.\"\n\nUpdate at 9:54 p.m. ET. Suspect In Serious Condition:\n\nBoston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis says police were called to a residence in Watertown after a home owner came outside and saw blood on his boat. He picked up the tarp and saw a man covered in blood.\n\nPolice rushed to the scene, setting up a perimeter. Police and the suspect exchanged gun fire and the \"hostage rescue team made entry into the boat.\"\n\nThe suspect, said Davis, was alive. The hostage rescue team tried to communicate with him before moving in, but he did not respond.\n\n\"The man who found him at the boat said he was covered in blood,\" Davis said. \"We assume the injuries occurred the night before.\"\n\nCol. Timothy P. Alben, superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, said the suspect was in \"serious condition.\"\n\nUpdate at 9:42 p.m. ET.

Suspect In Custody:\n\nThe Boston Police Department tweets:\n\n\"Suspect in custody. Officers sweeping the area. Stand by for further info.\n\nUpdate at 8:38 p.m. ET. 'This Is Unbelievable':\n\nTalking to All Things Considered, Keith Glavish, who lives about five houses away from where police believe Dzhokhar is located, says he can hear a helicopter overhead and has occasionally heard \"shots\" that \"sound like firecrackers.\"\n\n\"The whole scene is totally surreal,\" Glavish said. \"I mean, this is a very, very quiet neighborhood. ... I pinch myself to realize that this is actually unfolding, literally outside our door. We've been inside all day long, cooped up, and thinking, 'Well, it's on the other side of Watertown, we don't really have to worry.' I took the dog in the backyard a few times. But this is unbelievable.\"\n\nMeanwhile The Boston Globe tweets that one of its photographers can hear police talking to a person they believe is the suspect.\n\n\"We know you're in there,\" the Globe reports police are saying. \"Come out on your own terms. Come out with your hands up.\"\n\nUpdate at 7:41 p.m. ET. FBI Had Previous Contact With Suspect:\n\nAs we wait for more information about what's happening at a boat in Watertown, we have more news on the investigation: NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports that an FBI source tells her that \"the agency interviewed the older brother Tamerlan in 2011 at the request of a foreign government.\"\n\nAt the end of the investigation, they didn't \"find anything that was enough to allow them to hold onto him.\"\n\nTamerlan's mother told Russia Today, a news organization funded by the Russian government, that her children had been followed by the FBI \"for years.\" RT reports:\n\n\"Her biggest suspicion surrounding the case was the constant FBI surveillance she said her family was subjected to over the years. She is surprised that having been so stringent with the entire family, the FBI had no idea the sons were supposedly planning a terrorist act.\"\n\nUpdate at 7:31 p.m. ET. Police Believe They've Located Suspect:\n\nAn FBI source tells NPR's Dina Temple-Raston that police have located the suspect.\n\nShe tells us:\n\n\"Officers are proceeding with caution as an official fears the suspect may have booby-trapped the scene. \"FBI is waiting for a tactical team and bomb technician. \"FBI is behaving as if the suspect is still alive.\"\n\nThe Boston Globe tweets:\n\n\"Marathon bombings suspect believed to be inside boat in back yard of Watertown home. The boat was surrounded by police.\"\n\nUpdate at 7:25 p.m. ET. Obama Speaks With Putin:\n\nPresident Obama spoke to Russian President Vladamir Putin today.

Timothy Alben asked Dzhokhar to \"stop any further violence toward anyone,\" and turn himself in.\n\nAlben said Dzhokhar escaped on foot, because police did not have enough police to create a perimeter. But Alben said he believes the fugitive is still in Massachusetts.\n\nUpdate at 6:09 p.m. ET. Stay-Indoors Order Lifted; No Apprehension:\n\nDuring a news briefing in Watertown, Massachusetts, a short time ago, authorities said the \"stay-indoors request\" has been lifted, but that no suspect has been arrested.\n\nGov. Deval Patrick said that while people should feel free to go about their business, they should \"remain vigilant\" because \"there is still a very dangerous person out there.\"\n\nCol. Timothy Alben said police went up and down 20 streets, \"door to door\" conducting \"limited searches.\" Police followed many leads, but none of them have been fruitful.\n\n\"We do not have apprehension ... but we will have one,\" said Alben.\n\nUpdate at 5:39 p.m. ET.

'A Setup':\n\nRadio Liberty, an overseas news service funded by the United States, spoke to Anzor Tsarnaeov, whom they and the AP identified as the suspects' father.\n\nAccording to an English translation by Sergei Sotnikov, a producer at NPR's Moscow bureau, the father said he could not imagine his sons doing such a thing.\n\n\"Knowing our children \u2014 you see we know our children \u2014 if a person didn't pray how he can go and blow up or something... I don't know. I have never seen either explosives... nothing,\" Tsarnaeov said. Later in the interview he said this was a \"setup.\"\n\nThis is very much in line with what the suspects' aunt, Maret Tsarnaev, told NPR's Joe Shapiro.\n\n\"This totally doesn't make sense to me,\" she said, adding that authorities had not released definitive proof that these were the people responsible for the Boston blasts.\n\n\"Tamerlan and Dzhokhar never were extremists,\" Tsarnaeve said. \"Never had enemies.

At 10:30 p.m., an MIT campus police officer was found shot in his vehicle in the area of Vassar and Main streets. According to authorities, the officer was found evidencing multiple gunshot wounds. \"He was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital and pronounced deceased. \"Authorities launched an immediate investigation into the circumstances of the shooting. The investigation determined that two males were involved in this shooting. \"A short time later, police received reports of an armed carjacking by two males in the area of Third Street in Cambridge. The victim was carjacked at gunpoint by two males and was kept in the car with the suspects for approximately a half hour. The victim was released at a gas station on Memorial Drive in Cambridge.

During this pursuit, an MBTA Police officer was seriously injured and transported to the hospital. \"During the pursuit, one suspect was critically injured and transported to the hospital where he was pronounced deceased.

It said there were no other victims. \"Meanwhile, in Watertown, witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots and explosions at about 1 a.m. Friday. Dozens of police officers and FBI agents were in the neighborhood and a helicopter circled overhead.\"\n\nNote: As happens when stories such as this are developing, there will likely be reports that turn out to be mistaken. Wednesday, for example, there were reports from CNN, the AP, WBUR and others that authorities either had arrested a suspect or were about to do that. It turned out that no one had been arrested or taken into custody. We will focus on news being reported by NPR, other news outlets with expertise, and statements from authorities who are in a position to know what's going on. And if some of that information turns out to be wrong, we'll update.\n\nTake me back to the top of this post.",
