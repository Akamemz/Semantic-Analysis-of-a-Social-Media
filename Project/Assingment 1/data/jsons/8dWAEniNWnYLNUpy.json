As befit the day , McConnell brought the love : `` I want to start by thanking you , Charles and David , for the important work you 're doing . I do n't know where we 'd be without you . ''\nIt \u2019 s a good thing McConnell sucked up to the wealthy right-wing industrialists . He could be looking for a job soon , once Kentuckians ( and opponent Alison Lundergan Grimes ) hear the audiotape of the session obtained by the Nation . ( A transcript can be found here . )\nThe same weekend ISIL began approaching Baghdad , and Eric Cantor had just lost his primary for , among other reasons , being too cozy with big donors , McConnell took time to schmooze the Kochs and their network of funders and organizers . He wasn \u2019 t the only Senate candidate there : the next day , GOP Senate nominees Joni Ernst of Iowa , Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Cory Gardner of Colorado joined the retreat , the Nation 's Lauren Windsor has reported , and all pledged allegiance to the Kochs .\n\u201c The exposure to this group and to this network , and the opportunity to meet so many of you , really started my trajectory , \u201d kvelled Ernst , who attended the summit last year . ( You can hear audio of her remarks at the Huffington Post ) .\nBut only McConnell was devoted enough to spend Father \u2019 s Day addressing the Kochs \u2013 and only McConnell said anything substantive enough to ensure him home-state trouble .\nKentuckians may find themselves chagrined to learn that McConnell promised the Kochs and their friends that he would intensify gridlock if Republicans win control of the Senate . While legislation requires 60 votes , he noted , budget bills only require a simple majority , and he promised to attach \u201c riders \u201d defunding Obamacare , financial regulation laws and the entire Environmental Protection Agency to any spending bill -- riders that President Obama would likely veto , which could trigger another government shutdown .\nHe also attacked Democrats for wasting time on their \u201c gosh darn proposals \u201d \u2013 like raising the minimum wage , which Kentuckians support by almost 2-1 , and extending unemployment insurance , likewise backed by his state \u2019 s voters .\nWe can pass the spending bill , and I assure you that in the spending bill , we will be pushing back against this bureaucracy by doing what 's called placing riders in the bill : No money can be spent to do this or to do that . We 're going to go after them on healthcare , on financial services , on the Environmental Protection Agency , across the board . And we 're not going to be debating all these gosh darn proposals . That 's all we do in the Senate is vote on things like raising the minimum wage -- cost the country 500,000 new jobs ; extending unemployment -- that 's a great message for retirees ; the student loan package the other day ; that 's going to make things worse . These people believe in all the wrong things .\nKentuckians can decide who believes in all the wrong things come November .\nIn June the Nation first reported on the annual Koch retreat , loftily titled \u201c American Courage : Our Commitment to a Free Society , \u201d and heavily focused on helping the GOP take back the Senate . 2016 contender Sen.

''\nIf dollars themselves could vote in Kentucky politics , McConnell would defeat Grimes in a landslide . At the Koch retreat , the Senate veteran depicted himself as a tireless soldier for the freedom of money in politics . He described the right to make unlimited political contributions as `` the one freedom , that without which we ca n't do anything . '' His fealty to the cause of money in politics got embarrassing at times .\nAccording to the Nation , McConnell talked about his many filibusters of campaign finance reform the way other men his age describe war battles . `` The worst day of my political life was when President George W.

Others might say 9/11 , or the day President Reagan was shot ( or further back , the assassinations of President Kennedy , Bobby Kennedy or Martin Luther King Jr. ) But not Mitch .\nThe only people he praises more than the Koch brothers are the five-member Supreme Court majority that voted to abolish McCain-Feingold in the Citizens United decision , calling the John Roberts-led bench :\nThe best Supreme Court in anybody 's memory on the issue of First Amendment political speech ... [ Now ] you can give to the candidate of your choice , You can give to Americans for Prosperity , or something else , a variety of different ways to push back against the party of government ...
