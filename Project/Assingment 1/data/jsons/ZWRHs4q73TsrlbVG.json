Every day , 130 Americans die from opioid overdoses , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Without some kind of national settlement with Big Pharma , communities wo n't get serious money to help with the crisis any time soon . Speaking this fall with reporters , Pennsylvania state Attorney General Josh Shapiro warned that there could be legal chaos .\n`` We will randomly and haphazardly litigate these cases , with no particular rhyme or reason , '' Shapiro said . `` The needs of people across this country will not be met . ''\nFor much of 2019 , a deal seemed close . Federal Judge Dan Polster in Ohio was holding high-level settlement talks while at the same time channeling thousands of civil lawsuits against the drug industry into a tidy legal pipeline .\nThen came a big federal case in Polster 's court in October that was expected to test the liability of drugmakers and distributors . At the very last minute , however , companies reached a local settlement with a couple of Ohio counties . The trial was abruptly called off .\nGreg McNeil , an activist whose son died from an opioid overdose in 2015 , told NPR outside the courthouse in Cleveland that he was flattened .\n`` We have no admission of wrongdoing , '' McNeil said . `` It seems as if nothing is changing . ''\nEven attorneys involved in the case acknowledged that the outcome left big questions unanswered .\n`` We do n't have a chance to test the legal theories that are being used here , if they are being properly used , what there limits are , '' said Mark Lanier who represents communities suing Big Pharma .\nSettlement talks aimed at reaching a deal with the pharmaceutical industry comparable to the tobacco settlement of the 1990s also splintered , with Polster still leading negotiations in Ohio while state attorneys general across the country pushed for a separate deal . Neither set of talks produced a `` global '' resolution .\nAdam Zimmerman at Loyola thinks it made sense for Polster and others to push for a big settlement this year , but it just did n't pay off .\n`` The opioid crisis has just presented such an emergency and it 's called for quick action , '' Zimmerman said . `` To the extent that it has n't worked , I do n't think that 's necessarily the fault of Judge Polster as much as just the extremely complicated nature of this litigation . ''\nThousands of states , local governments , school districts and Native American tribes have sued drug companies for aggressively marketing prescription opioid medications while allegedly downplaying the risks of addiction and overdose . More than 400,000 Americans have died during the epidemic that began in the 1990s .\nThe legal muddle that remains is scary for those cash-strapped towns and cities .
