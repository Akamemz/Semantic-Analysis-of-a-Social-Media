''\nSources in the Clinton campaign believe that the debate represented the first time in the race so far that Sanders was forced to address a long series of foreign policy questions that , in their view , exposed him as wanting .\nThe Clinton campaign was quick to pounce on Sanders ' remark Thursday night that North Korea was run by `` a handful of dictators '' to argue that he did not understand the tyrannical power structure led by the ruthless young leader in Pyongyang , Kim Jong Un .\nDuring the debate , Clinton 's Twitter account also blasted Sanders on his ability to protect the country , including the line : `` There is only one person who is ready to be commander in chief on stage at the # DemDebate . ''\nClinton 's campaign manager Robby Mook drove home the attack on Sanders on CNN after the debate .\n`` I think you saw Sen. Sanders fail that national security test , '' Mook said .\nIt 's not clear yet that Democratic primary voters actually care that much about foreign policy , however . In a CNN national poll last month , terrorism and foreign policy ranked fourth and eighth in a list of issues Democratic candidates are most concerned about . The top two concerns were the income gap and health care , which Sanders has built his campaign around .\nJust 25 % of Democrats said that foreign policy was extremely important in shaping their vote this year , compared to 32 % of Republicans .

She tried a similar line of argument against Obama in the 2008 primary campaign , suggesting with her infamous `` 3 a.m. phone call '' ad that only she had the experience to be president .\nVoters back then chose to side with Obama 's judgment owing to his famous repudiation of the Iraq war before he reached the Senate -- again , compared to Clinton 's vote to authorize it .\nAnd that is one significant national security card that Sanders holds -- and has been playing .\n`` I fully , fully concede that Secretary Clinton , who was secretary of state for four years , has more experience -- that is not arguable -- in foreign affairs , '' Sanders said at the debate . `` But experience is not the only point ; judgment is . ''\nHe continued , `` Once again , back in 2002 , when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq , one of us voted the right way and one of us did n't . ''\nIn a floor speech before casting a vote against President George W.

We have to look at the threats that we face right now , '' Clinton said , trying out a new answer on her vote on Iraq .\nThirteen years after the Iraq war began , Clinton continues to battle present-day perceptions that she 's too hawkish for the liberal base of Democratic primary voters on foreign policy .\nAfter all , she lobbied President Barack Obama hard on military action in Libya in 2011 and wanted him to do more to back anti-regime rebels in Syria as secretary of state -- and now pushes for a no-fly zone there , a much more aggressive military posture than Sanders and even several Republican candidates .\nBut if she reaches the general election , her hawkishness might become an asset given the public 's revived fears about terrorism following attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , California , and Americans ' ebbing confidence in Obama 's handling of it .\nAnd conversely , the former secretary of state is also making an implied case that the more dovish Sanders would be a liability in a general election .\n`` You are voting both for a president and a commander in chief , '' Clinton said in the debate in New Hampshire on Thursday , implicitly suggesting that Sanders was not up to the task of keeping Americans safe .\n`` There is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies , '' she said . `` I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here .
