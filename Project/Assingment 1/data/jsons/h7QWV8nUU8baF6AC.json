    "content": "Two weeks before a crucial midterm election , the US chief executive has embraced a term that can be benign or hateful depending on context and intent . \u201c Nationalist \u201d is not a tag President Trump has hung on himself before . It may be close in spirit to \u201c America First \u201d and other familiar slogans . But the president generally does not deal in \u201c isms \u201d and \u201c ists \u201d and other precise ideological suffixes . And it \u2019 s a word critics say has far-right echoes , a charge Mr. Trump appeared to implicitly acknowledge at the Houston rally Monday night at which he unfurled it . What \u2019 s changed ? The president \u2019 s final approach to the 2018 midterms seems rooted in an attempt to label Democrats as the party of \u201c them \u201d and the GOP as \u201c us. \u201d His rhetorical approach on Monday deftly defined \u201c nationalist \u201d only as the opposite of unnamed \u201c globalists \u201d who put the fortunes of the whole world above those of America . And some observers say that fits with his focus on the alleged danger of a caravan of Central American immigrants moving slowly in the direction of the US-Mexican border from 1,000 miles away .\nAt a rally in Houston on Monday night President Trump used a word he said he wasn \u2019 t supposed to utter . It was an old-fashioned sort of label , he said , one he would now gladly apply to himself . The designation ? \u201c Nationalist , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\n\u201c Nothing wrong . Use that word . Use that word , \u201d said the president , as the crowd cheered and began to chant , \u201c USA , USA ! \u201d\nTwo weeks before a crucial midterm election , with control of both chambers of Congress possibly at stake , the incumbent US chief executive is suddenly using a descriptive term that can be benign or hateful , uniting or divisive , democratic or authoritarian , depending on its context and the intent of the speaker .\n\u201c Nationalist , \u201d per se , is not a tag Trump has much hung on himself before . It may be close in spirit to America First , Make America Great Again , and other familiar Trump slogans . But the president generally does not deal in \u201c isms \u201d and \u201c ists \u201d and other precise ideological suffixes .\nTrump instead ascribes his ideas to his own brain and instincts , as opposed to systems of thought dreamed up by others . Plus , \u201c nationalism \u201d is indeed dangerous . It \u2019 s a word critics say has far-right , even fascistic echoes , a charge Trump appeared to implicitly acknowledge Monday night .\nWhat \u2019 s changed ? With days before the vote , the president \u2019 s final approach to the 2018 midterms seems rooted in an attempt to label Democrats as the party of \u201c them \u201d and the GOP as \u201c us. \u201d It fits with his focus on the alleged danger of a caravan of Central American immigrants moving slowly towards the US-Mexico border , 1,000 miles away .\nAnd Trump \u2019 s rhetorical approach on Monday deftly defined \u201c nationalist \u201d only as the opposite of unnamed \u201c globalists \u201d who put the fortunes of the whole world above those of America . Thus he can adopt the slogan without saying exactly what it means , says Jennifer Mercieca , a historian of American political rhetoric at Texas A & M University .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very noteworthy that Trump used the word . It \u2019 s another data point in this democratic erosion , this democratic backsliding , that political scientists and historians are concerned about , \u201d Dr. Mercieca says .\nNationalist and nationalism are indeed slippery terms . At their most basic they describe those who want independence for their own nation \u2013 Scottish nationalists want to split from the United Kingdom , for instance . The next level of definition includes a national consciousness that places one nation above all others and puts an emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to the culture and interests of other countries .\nNationalism can be a positive , even essential force in modern democracies , according to some analysts . The perception of a common national identity is important for unity in countries that depend on the willingness of citizens to pay taxes to support other citizens who they will never encounter , according to John Judis , an author and journalist who has written for Talking Points Memo and The New Republic .\nThe supranational initiatives of globalism , such as free trade , floating exchange rates , and the expansion of NATO , have been positive forces in the world , wrote Mr. Judis in an October opinion piece in The New York Times . But they have not really delivered as promised . The world economy is not downturn-proof , as the Great Recession painfully showed . Income growth for all but the top 1 percent remains sluggish . Rising immigration brings about a clash of cultures , as it has in centuries past .\nThe result : the base of support for Trump and far-right populist politicians of Europe .\n\u201c To achieve their historic objectives , liberals and social democrats will have to respond constructively to , rather than dismiss , the nationalist reaction to globalization , \u201d wrote Judis in October .\nBut \u201c state \u201d and \u201c nation \u201d aren \u2019 t interchangeable terms . The former is a place unified under a government with citizenship and taxes . The latter is a place with a common culture , history , and language .
