    "content": "Theresa May is awaiting the result of a vote by Conservative MPs on whether they want to keep her as their leader .\nThe UK prime minister made a last-minute appeal for support at an emotional meeting of backbench MPs .\nShe told them she will not lead the party into the next scheduled election in 2022 - but wants to stay on to deliver her Brexit deal , MPs said .\nShe faces a vote of confidence in her leadership after 48 Conservative MPs called for one to be held .\nThe majority of Conservative MPs have publicly said they will support the PM but it is a secret ballot and there were signs of nerves among party managers ahead of the vote in Committee Room 14 at the Palace of Westminster .\nVoting finished at 20:00 with the result expected within the next hour .\nThe prime minister was greeted with applause , and the traditional banging of desks , as she went in to the committee room to address her MPs . Some of them were reported to be in tears .\nShe is understood to have promised not to call a `` snap general election '' and told MPs that in her heart she would have liked to have led them into the next scheduled election , partly because of what had happened at last year 's election , when she lost her majority .\nBut , she added : `` I realise that the party would like a different leader to take them into that election . ''\nCabinet minister Amber Rudd said `` she was very clear that she wont be taking the general election in 2022 '' .\nBut Jacob Rees-Mogg , a key figure in the campaign to oust Mrs May , said she had received a `` half-hearted '' reception from MPs .\nShe had said it was not her `` intention '' to fight the next election , added Mr Rees-Mogg , which he said was a `` politician 's word '' .\nMarcus Fysh , who also submitted a no confidence letter , said Mrs May `` did n't really have anything new to say '' about Brexit .\nShe vowed to involve more people in developing policy , the MP told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , but he did not think that would happen .\nAnd he predicted that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote of all MPs - not just Conservative ones - when she tried to get her Brexit deal through the Commons .\n`` Whatever happens tonight I do n't think she will be able to command the confidence of the House for the type of Brexit she is trying to pursue . ''\nMinister Margot James said she was `` proud '' to have voted for the PM , tweeting a picture of her ballot paper .\nConservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader , undisturbed , for another 12 months .\nThat takes one uncertainty off the table . But she would be weaker - lonelier - and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through .\nAlready , cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack .\nThe parliamentary sums do n't change on her current planned agreement with the EU . The cabinet , let alone the rest of the Commons , wo n't give their backing .\nImmediate statements of loyalty for the prime minister were issued by every member of her cabinet , including several who have been touted as possible successors .\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was `` the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29 '' , while Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested the vote would `` flush out the extremists '' in his party whose Brexit agenda was `` not in the interests of the British people '' .\nSo far , 174 Tory MPs have publicly said they will vote for her , with 34 publicly against , according to BBC research . She needs to secure the votes of 159 MPs to survive .\nIf Mrs May wins the confidence vote she can not be challenged as Conservative leader for at least another year .\nIf she does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand .\nIf Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader and trigger a leadership contest in which she could not stand .\nIn her statement delivered early on Wednesday morning , Mrs May said : `` A leadership election would not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the Parliamentary arithmetic .\n`` Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country . None of that would be in the national interest . ''\nShe said she was making progress in her talks with EU leaders and vowed to `` deliver on the referendum vote and seize the opportunities that lie ahead '' .\nThe Conservatives had to build a `` country that works for everyone '' and deliver `` the Brexit people voted for '' .\n`` I have devoted myself unsparingly to these tasks ever since I became prime minister and I stand ready to finish the job . ''\nWill there be a new prime minister if she loses the vote ?\nNot immediately . She would be expected to stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a new Conservative leader is selected by the party , a process that could take up to six weeks .\nIf there are multiple candidates , Conservative MPs hold a series of votes to choose two to go forward to a vote of party members .\nAs leader of the largest party in the Commons , the new Conservative leader would then be expected to be asked to form a government and become prime minister , without a general election .\nMrs May faced repeated calls from Labour MPs for her to quit - or hold another EU referendum - at a rowdy Prime Minister 's Questions .\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said : `` The time for dithering and delay is over . The prime minister has negotiated her deal . She has told us it is the best and only deal available .\n`` There can be no more excuses , no more running away . Put it before Parliament and let 's have the vote . ''\nMrs May said the vote will take place , and as Labour MPs shouted `` when ? '' at her she said : `` We 've had a meaningful vote , we had it in in the referendum in 2016 . ''\nThe PM added : `` And if he wants a meaningful date I 'll give him one ; 29 March 2019 when we leave the European Union . ''\nVeteran pro-European MP Ken Clarke called the prospect of a leadership contest `` unhelpful , irrelevant and irresponsible '' , prompting loud cheers from the Tory benches .\nBut the SNP 's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford called on Mrs May to stand down , saying her government was `` an embarrassment '' .\nThe challenge has been brought by Conservative MPs who think Mrs May has watered down the Brexit voters were promised in the 2016 referendum .\nThe PM thought she had seen off an attempt by this group of Brexiteers to get rid of her last month .\nBut her decision to cancel Tuesday 's Parliamentary vote on her deal at the last minute proved to be the final straw for many who had previously given her the benefit of the doubt .\nThere needed to be 48 MPs calling for her to go - out of 317 Conservative MPs - to trigger a confidence vote and this threshold was reached on Tuesday .\nJacob Rees-Mogg , who has led backbench calls for her to go , said : `` Theresa May 's plan would bring down the government if carried forward .
