    "content": "Fourth Estate Why Did Brian Williams Lie ? He \u2019 s the one viewers are supposed to trust every night .\nJack Shafer is \u2588\u2588\u2588 's senior media writer . Previously , Jack wrote a column about the press and politics for Reuters and before that worked at Slate as a columnist and as the site 's deputy editor . He also edited two alternative weeklies , SF Weekly and Washington City Paper . His work has been published in The New York Times Magazine , The New York Times Book Review , The Washington Post , the Columbia Journalism Review , Foreign Affairs , The New Republic , BookForum and the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal .\nNBC News anchor Brian Williams deserves the public pillory he \u2019 s currently enduring for having peddled a fabricated war story about himself\u2014thereby joining an ignominious line that ranges from the Gipper to Hillary herself . However , Williams \u2019 s tall tale has struck an especially raw nerve with a public accustomed to seeing him hold others to the highest standards . So what possessed him ?\nIn case you \u2019 re late to the story , here \u2019 s a thumbnail : Over the years , Williams has told a shifting story about the day he flew aboard a U.S. Army helicopter during the 2003 invasion of Iraq . In later versions , he has said his helicopter was hit and forced down by enemy fire , the version he told last Friday . Called out for his fabrication , Williams came clean , calling the recollections a \u201c mistake \u201d and acknowledging that it was a helicopter flying well ahead of his helicopter that got hit . \u201c I don \u2019 t know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another , \u201d William told Stars and Stripes yesterday .\nWilliams isn \u2019 t the only notable who \u2019 s gotten caught embroidering war stories . In 1983 , President Ronald Reagan told the prime minister of Israel that he \u2019 d filmed the Nazi death camp as a U.S. Army photographer . Reagan also shared a version of his death camp story with Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal . But , as Lou Cannon \u2019 s March 5 , 1984 , Washington Post article demonstrated , Reagan couldn \u2019 t have possibly filmed the death camp because , by his own admission , he never left the country during World War II .\nAt least twice while campaigning for vice president in 2008 , Joe Biden implied that he \u2019 d seen some hot action in Afghanistan . Biden said that while riding a U.S. Army helicopter over the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan\u2014 \u201c the superhighway of terror \u201d in his parlance\u2014his bird had been \u201c forced down. \u201d As it turns out , a snowstorm and not enemy fire was behind the forced landing of Biden \u2019 s helicopter . John Kerry , who was also aboard the helicopter , later joked , \u201c We were going to send Biden out to fight the Taliban with snowballs , but we didn \u2019 t have to do it . \u201d\nHillary Clinton dispensed her own combat blarney during the 2008 campaign , asserting that during the Bosnia war she and her group landed \u201c under sniper fire \u201d at an airstrip in Tuzla and \u201c we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base. \u201d A week later she fessed up , saying she \u2019 d \u201c misspoke. \u201d According to U.S. Maj. Gen. William Nash , \u201c She never had her head down . \u2026 There was no sniper threat that I know of . \u201d\nOther politicians called out for military-service fudging include Sen. Richard Blumenthal , President George W. Bush , and Sen. Tom Harkin , who bragged about flying non-existent combat air missions in Vietnam . A 2005 Weekly Standard report singled out actors ( Tom Mix and Brian Dennehy ) , a Ku Klux Klan grand wizard ( David Duke ) , and an academic and a clergyman ( Joseph Ellis and Major Gary Probst ) as inflators or concoctors of their military resumes and a Talking Points Memo piece from 2010 snared even more politicians .\nThis dishonor roll of politicians disturbs few of us because taking liberties with the truth is their default setting . But we expect higher truth standards from members of the press , right ? Brian Williams might not be working as a shoe-leather reporter , but he \u2019 s as much a journalist as any newspaper rewrite-man . Journalists are paid to be more vigilant than civilians about the stories they tell . Millions listen to Williams because he \u2019 s sold himself as a truth-teller , not a fabulist . We expect the truth from him , whether he \u2019 s reading a human-interest piece into NBC \u2019 s cameras or recounting personal war stories on Dave Letterman \u2019 s show .\nAlas , the human tendency to juice our stories is universal , and it \u2019 s a temptation that some journalists find impossible to resist . When we tell our personal stories , we tend to add dramatic pauses that will build suspense . In each retelling , we tend to incorporate into it the reactions of the last audience , escalating the drama that got a good reaction , tamping down the events that dragged , and making up stuff to further engage our audiences . We supplement and reshape our stories both subconsciously and deliberately , because there is no public shame like the public shame that follows the telling of a boring tale . If don \u2019 t think you don \u2019 t do the same with your favorite stories , ask your spouse or siblings . They \u2019 ll happily regale you with your entertaining exaggerations .\nJournalists adhere to the same traditional story forms that other , more fanciful tellers use , but with the proviso that they don \u2019 t embellish . This is the journalistic commandment that Williams broke , and you can see it happening in the timeline of his changing stories compiled by CNN . Williams \u2019 s early tellings are accurate but boring .
