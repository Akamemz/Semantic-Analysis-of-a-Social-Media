    "content": "All eyes were on moderate House Democrats in swing districts Wednesday night , after the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump wrapped up with no major revelations -- but also highlighted weaknesses in Democrats ' key witnesses , who relied primarily on second-hand information and never once interacted with the president .\nAt one point in Wednesday 's hearing , Rep. Mike Quigley , D-Ill. , even appeared to embrace hearsay testimony , claiming that `` hearsay can be much better evidence than direct '' and that `` countless people have been convicted on hearsay because the courts have routinely allowed and created , needed exceptions to hearsay . '' It was unclear which of those limited exceptions would apply to Wednesday 's testimony -- and whether Quigley 's argument would persuade critical swing-vote Democrats .\nThe House is now comprised of 431 members , meaning Democrats need 217 yeas to impeach Trump . There are currently 233 Democrats , so Democrats can only lose 16 of their own and still impeach the president . 31 House Democrats represent more moderate districts that Trump carried in 2016 .\nFreshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin , D-Mich. -- who flipped a GOP district in 2018 that Trump won by 7 points in 2016 -- told Fox News that she was tentatively weighing all the evidence .\n`` My constituents expect me to make an objective decision , '' Slotkin said as the hearings concluded , `` not one based on an hour of testimony . ''\nSlotkin went on to acknowledge that launching an impeachment inquiry was a `` politically tough thing to do . ''\n`` I 'm not waking up in the morning looking for some golden poll , '' Slotkin said , insisting that she would analyze all testimony carefully in the coming days .\nReports have emerged that , should Trump be impeached by a majority vote in the House , Senate Republicans might strategically hold a lengthy trial to `` scramble '' the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- including by requiring several of the contenders to remain in Washington to handle the trial . Trump is all but certain to be acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate in the event of impeachment , given that a two-thirds vote is required in the Senate to remove the president .\nAs the public hearing wrapped up on Wednesday , the panel voted 13-9 , along party lines , to table a Republican motion to subpoena the whistleblower -- signaling that not many minds had been swayed .\n'COUP HAS STARTED , ' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY SAID IN 2017 , VOWING IMPEACHMENT\nA GOP source close to the House Intelligence Committee told Fox News late Wednesday that Republicans have full confidence in counsel Steve Castor , and he will continue to lead the questioning in the next round of public impeachment hearings . GOP members were pleased with his questioning today , the source said .\nThe day provided one previously undisclosed allegation .
