    "content": "As someone who makes his living by challenging ideas through humor , social commentary and , if warranted , ridicule , I care deeply about free speech . And there is a growing movement across our college campuses to shut down free speech of teachers , students and invited guests . This should scare the hell out of all us all .\nI \u2019 ve been doing talk radio for more than three decades and I host a daily podcast . This means I constantly have guests on who disagree with me on many subjects . Challenging their ideas and points of views \u2014 while they do the same to me \u2014 is an important part of the public discourse . One thing I \u2019 ve learned about Americans from talking with them for more than 30 years is that we like to argue and debate , even among friends \u2014 and we \u2019 re damn good at it .\nThe element of debate is a hallmark of our country , from the time of Sam Adams . By the way , he was not named after the beer , the beer was named after him . So , if you learn nothing else from today , hang on to that .\nBut seriously , America has been that \u201c safe space \u201d where truth can be spoken to power . Where \u201c We the People \u201d can challenge a king and a corrupt idea like a monarchy . This right has been reaffirmed through our history . It \u2019 s been fought for , and people have died for it . We must understand that we have the right to free expression , not the right to not be offended . This fundamental difference is being lost on today \u2019 s college campuses .\nWe should not be teaching students to retreat from debate , but to charge intellectually into it . This is one of the most valuable and profound gifts given to us in the founding of America .\nWhen we enter into robust debate , the best ideas will most often rise . It \u2019 s when ideas and points of view are censored that our country loses , because we may miss new ideas or other ones may not have been properly examined .\nI used to love to play colleges as a comedian . College campuses were a fantastic place to perform , but today the negatively-charged environment where everyone is offended has made it toxic . It \u2019 s so bad that some of the top comedians , including Jerry Seinfeld , Bill Maher and Chris Rock \u2014 not exactly a right-wing cabal \u2014 have noted that performing on a college campus is no longer a real option due to the labyrinth of speech codes and hurt feelings .\nAs comedians , we find subjects , which often includes stereotypes . Then , we make social commentary or a joke about it . String enough of those together and you have a routine . And here \u2019 s a window into my business : Offending people is the foundation of what comedians do . Finding a moment , person , group or idea and holding it up for ridicule has been a part of comedy since the very first joke ever told .\nSomeone will almost always be offended ; it \u2019 s risky , but if you \u2019 re a good comedian the joke will reveal a truth we can all recognize . Without this , we \u2019 re all just sitting in a dark theater buying two overpriced drinks . Comedians are the modern-day court jesters holding the mirror of truth back up to society .\nI also know that what happens at college does not stay at college . Given this generation \u2019 s impulse to post every moment of life online , nothing they do will stay in college . In fact , it will haunt them from job interview to job interview . There seems to be a growing movement to shut down differing points of view that are not politically correct or fit neatly into today \u2019 s \u201c speech codes , \u201d which are nothing short of thought-regulation .\nThe centrifuge of this movement is ironically the college campus \u2014 the place that has traditionally been the center of the free exchange of ideas . Instead , colleges now have places known as \u201c safe spaces \u201d where students who feel threatened by concepts , ideas , differing views , other ethnicities or different economic or geographical backgrounds may retreat .\nWe currently have more than 20 million people attending colleges or degree-granting programs . This is up from 17.8 million in 2006 . That \u2019 s a lot of trigger warnings and play-doh and puppy crap to pick up from safe spaces if we continue down the coddling road . But I digress .\nI \u2019 ve also seen how speakers have faced being shut down , intimidated from speaking and even physically assaulted on campus . I recently faced being shut down when nationally-syndicated radio host Dennis Prager and I planned to hold an event at Cal State Northridge in California . The producers of the event confirmed the rental of the facilities , and then , suddenly , two weeks prior to the event , were told the school did not want to have controversial speakers such as Dennis and myself on campus .\nMe , I can understand the offense , but Dennis , he \u2019 s just really tall and really smart . This was later deemed a \u201c scheduling conflict \u201d not a \u201c content conflict \u201d . Eventually , after lawyers jumped in , the scheduling conflict was resolved , and the event was held . It also produced a No . 1 iTunes comedy album . But it showed me up close what is happening on campus . To be candid , it shocked me , because our colleges should be an important place that embraces free speech , intellectual diversity and challenging ideas .\nWhat is provided in these safe spaces , and why is it a problem ? Instead of fostering the development of young adults , colleges are providing coloring books , play-doh , puppies and stuffed animals . It \u2019 s basically your four-year-old daughter \u2019 s bedroom where one can shut out the challenges , facts and outside world . Providing this bubble-wrapped type of education does not prepare the next generation for the challenges of life . It prepares them for failure .\nCan you imagine a student like this getting a job in customer service for an IT company where millions of dollars are on the line , and rather than being able to address or fix a problem , they will need play-do and puppies to get through the day ?\nWe also hear a cry for diversity on college campuses , which is total boloney . Diversity by definition doesn \u2019 t just mean differing races , genders or ethnicities coexisting . True diversity is intellectual diversity , where differing points of view and ideas can be discussed , even the ones we vehemently disagree with . True diversity requires points of view we disagree with , otherwise it won \u2019 t be diverse , only self re-affirming .\nBut this definition of diversity does not seem to fit within the current college campus . The definition being pushed is not one of true diversity , but reaffirming already approved thoughts . It \u2019 s basically like we \u2019 re dressing ideological uniformity in a cheap supermarket costume but calling it diversity . We all know the real kid behind the mask , but students and teachers are forced to go along with the charade .\nThis point couldn \u2019 t be made any clearer than by Sol Stern , one of the co-founders of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement in the 1960s . Stern , looking back 50 years later on what he saw as the failure of the original Free Speech Movement observed , \u201c Because the claim that the FSM was fighting for free speech for all ( i.e. , the First Amendment ) was always a charade . Within weeks of FSM \u2019 s founding , it became clear to the leadership that the struggle was really about clearing barriers to using the campus as a base for radical political activity . Our movement ignored Orwell \u2019 s warning that \u2018 political language is designed to make lies sound truthful . \u2019 \u201d\nOrwell was right , and 50 years later , the climate on college campuses is growing worse . The stated goal of diversity has been one of inclusion , but the recent growth of \u201c identity politics \u201d has reversed this to ultimately promote exclusion , nearly indiscernible from Jim Crow laws of the 1940s .\nWhile our national motto is \u201c E Pluribus Unum , \u201d or \u201c out of many , one , \u201d identity politics creates a divisive power play on the pattern of basing one \u2019 s identity on characterizations like race , gender , class , sexual orientation , religion and on down the line in as many divided categories of oppression as one can imagine .\nUltimately this movement against challenging ideas is a disservice to students , as they \u2019 re not being prepared for the world outside their \u201c safe spaces. \u201d Instead , their diplomas \u2014 some of which cost in the mid-six figures \u2014 will have actually set them back .
