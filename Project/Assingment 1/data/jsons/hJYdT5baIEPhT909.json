As recently as June 7 , 47 % of Americans thought the coronavirus situation was getting better , compared to just 30 % who thought it was getting worse . Just three weeks later , after the massive upsurge in COVID-19 cases , the share of Americans who thought the situation was getting better fell by half to just 23 % while the share who thought it was getting worse had more than doubled to 65 % . An ABC/Washington Post poll released on July 17 found that approval of the president \u2019 s handling of the pandemic fell from 51 % in March and 46 % in May to just 38 % in mid-July , while disapproval rose from 45 % in March to 53 % in May and 60 % today .\nAmericans are losing hope , at least for the near-term . Seventy-four percent expect the coronavirus disruption that has upended their lives to last through the end of 2020 or longer . Fifty-six percent worry about catching COVID-19 , the highest since April , and 72 % say that it is better to hunker down at home rather than resuming normal activities .
