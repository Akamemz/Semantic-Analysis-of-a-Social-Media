The 2016 presidential nominating process has been like one of those disastrous alpine blowdowns\u2014a freak storm that leaves millions of trees worth of tinder-dry kindling wood on the forest floor , just waiting for a hot , dry wind and a spark .\nAs we watch these two horribly flawed and widely reviled candidates bumble down the final 90 days of their scandal- and gaffe-strewn runways , millions of us are asking each other two questions .\n\u201c Is this the best America can do ? \u201d and \u201c Who \u2019 s got a match ? \u201d\nBut how ? How do you burn down a system with a 160-year-old stranglehold on our body politic ?\nI believe it \u2019 s time to adopt the approach of America \u2019 s favorite societal pyromaniacs : the technologists and venture investors of Silicon Valley . We need to take their strategies and tactics for disrupting and dismantling ossified industries and put them to work to eviscerate the two party system .\nIn dead earnestness , it \u2019 s time for the party in the cloud\u2014a citizens \u2019 political party-as-a-service . A 21st-century fast , agile digital movement built on the foundation of a powerful social web organization and communication platform . Not a party of insiders or elites . A party that lets the idiot fringe be the idiot fringe on both the left and right , and instead seeks to serve the citizens in the middle .\nAs venture capitalist Hank Vigil of Seattle-based Acequia Ventures said after a long discussion where I first broached the subject to him , \u201c I think what you \u2019 re talking about is creating some kind of technological infrastructure that forms a kernel capable of attracting talent to create the swarm dynamics that overwhelm the traditional model . \u201d\nYes , Hank . Yes . That is exactly what I \u2019 m talking about .\n\u201c Swarm dynamics. \u201d That \u2019 s a phrase nobody in politics has ever said . Swarm dynamics that allow us drones to gather together to batter down state and federal election law barriers to entry , and bring candidates and policies to the fore that actually represent mainstream American thinking , and burn those two big old dead trees right down to their jet-black stumps in plenty of time for November , 2020 .\nI want us to come together to build this Citizens \u2019 Party to enable the broad range of Americans who fall under the fat part of the bell curve in our political thinking and attitudes\u2014those of us who find the Democrats \u2019 socialism-fueled platform as repugnant as we find the Republicans \u2019 nativist one\u2014to identify and nurture candidates and raise funds and build organizations that reflect our non-outlier beliefs about how our country should work .\nI want Americans who believe in getting along with other Americans\u2014who still think that we \u2019 re all on the same team and that we \u2019 ve got to find a way to pull together rather than beat the snot out of each other\u2014to self-organize in a way that is vastly more powerful and transparent and user-friendly and effective than are the two doddering , self-absorbed almost-bi-centenarian incumbent parties .\nI want those of us who find the byzantine , arcane presidential caucus/primary/delegate nomination system to be mindlessly archaic and broken to go and do something about it . Something big and muscular and bristling with a healthy preference for economic prosperity and innovation and tolerance and a sense of shared purpose and destiny\u2014the stuff that truly does make America exceptional .\nIf we \u2019 re going to disrupt this market for political leadership\u2014the market the two parties collude to control in a way no Justice Department would ever allow in any other context\u2014we \u2019 re going to need to bring expertise from the technology , political , policy , legal , communications , and fundraising industries and communities into the swarm and make them all buzz together .\nIt will require us to develop and follow a roadmap and methodology that Silicon Valley has used to astonishing effect to disrupt the status quo and steamroll complacent , lazy , irredeemably customer-hostile competition in dozens and dozens of industries before this one .\nAnd when it happens , and it can happen , this disruption \u2019 s going to be vastly more satisfying . Because it won \u2019 t be done for profit or for self-aggrandizement . It will be done for our kids and each other\u2014the same reasons the best Americans have always come together to accomplish hard things .\n21st century America is a place where consumer things increasingly just work . Any physical good that exists can be on our front porches 48 hours from now . Unimaginable entertainment and social options are available to us anywhere , anytime with a few taps of the magic screens in our pockets . The world we live in , whether we \u2019 re average Josephines or one percenters , has been utterly transformed by information and connectivity , and now new information-based tools and business models are even starting to reform broken sectors that everybody needs like education and healthcare .\nAll that re-engineering and systemic improvement comes to us from organizations\u2014new ones in most cases , reinvented older ones in some\u2014that grasp the technological zeitgeist and ride it in order to serve our ( and thereby , their ) needs .\nExcept in one consumer market\u2014that for political leadership . In that market , American consumers would like to find some honest men and women who appeal to a broad majority of us , who understand the dynamism of the world we live in and the technology that \u2019 s reshaping it , and who are guided by some stomach-calming personal qualities like honesty , hard work , common sense , thrift , courage , respect , kindness , and maybe most of all , the ability to seek and find common ground .\nAnd what do we get when we try to order that for our national front porch ?\nWe get Donald F. Trump and Hillary F. Clinton . That \u2019 s what .\nOne reason why the political services market is so broken is the wildly geriatric age of the organizations serving it . The younger of the two , the \u201c Grand Old Party , \u201d is 162 years old .\nQuick : Name every phenomenal customer-oriented company you do business with that \u2019 s 160 years old . I \u2019 ll wait .\nIt \u2019 s also because the two parties have built their own gigantic regulatory barriers to entry inside an electoral-law system of their own molding . And because members of the two organizations themselves legislatively man the self-designed barricades , they \u2019 ve been able to repel all attempts to compete with them for almost two centuries .\nImagine if you were Jeff Bezos , circa 1994 , and every member of every state legislature and Congress was named \u201c Barnes \u201d or \u201c Noble. \u201d Think you \u2019 d have a clear runway to building your category-killing company ?\nBut it \u2019 s even worse than that , because Barnes & Noble used to run some pretty good bookstores . The two political parties are taking the technological tools that every other kind of consumer organization has used to make and deliver products and services that appeal to the fat center of the American consumer psyche and are instead using them to design products\u2014candidates and policy platforms , in their case\u2014that appeal to the most extreme tastes of their most extreme consumers .\nIt \u2019 s like going online to order a boxed set of all the James Bond movies and then receiving snuff porn videos . Over and over again .\nEnough . It \u2019 s time for our national Hulkamania moment , where the blows to our collective head from the fists of the two-party system stop concussing us and instead start building that crazy , wide-eyed intensity ( in the two-thirds of us that don \u2019 t find blind loyalty to extreme political ideologies to our liking , anyway ) that can enable us to rip our shirts off and pound the hell out of our Republican and Democrat tormentors .\nAnd maybe actually find some leadership that can pull us forward from the center instead of pulling us apart from the extremes .\nI \u2019 m not suggesting somehow that Silicon Valley can save our political system . It \u2019 s clear that there \u2019 s broad disagreement as to whether the technology industry is America 's most powerful engine for economic growth and vitality or whether alternatively it 's some kind of vampiric middle class woodchipper .\nBut who cares , in this case ? We \u2019 re watching a large cabal of party insiders on both sides carry out an ongoing 17-decade theft of America \u2019 s political patrimony . The Valley \u2019 s denizens ( and related digital forest-dwellers in Seattle , Boulder , Austin , Reston , and elsewhere , lumped for simplicity 's sake under the \u201c Valley \u201d umbrella ) have a burning urge to innovate and a strong experiential knowledge set about how to disrupt huge existing industries .\nWhat I \u2019 m suggesting is that the Valley has an approach , a kind of rough algorithm , for the way its ecosystem attacks and has successfully disrupted enormous markets/problems/opportunities over the past 30 years . This \u201c Valley Way , \u201d not surprisingly , isn \u2019 t uniform or codified , and of course often fails . But there \u2019 s a discernible pattern to how it \u2019 s gone about its successful work , particularly when invading an information-driven industry like politics .\nIf I were to give you my outside observer \u2019 s take on that algorithm for building revolutionary and disruptive organizations from scratch , I \u2019 d identify ten core elements in the process :\n1 ) Start with knowledge of the full technological stack\u2014the available tool kit\u2014and what existing participants in the marketplace are doing with it already .\nThis is table stakes . You can \u2019 t use information and technology as your disruption engine if you don \u2019 t understand how the engine works . And of course you don \u2019 t want to spin your wheels disrupting a market that \u2019 s already been disrupted . So you come to the fight armed and aware . And the political market hasn \u2019 t yet been disrupted \u2014 not in the Valley sense , anyway . It \u2019 s been co-opted by some ill-intentioned mountebanks , but it hasn \u2019 t been disrupted .\n2 ) Identify high-energy , high-achieving , highly intelligent , aggressive , inquisitive and hard-working individuals , and organize them into two- or three-person insurgent teams .\nThe single greatest determinant of success in the Valley , you \u2019 ll hear so many times when talking to people there that you \u2019 ll come to see it as gospel , is the quality of the entrepreneur and his or her founding team . It \u2019 s the sine qua non of disruption .\n3 ) Encourage those teams to identify huge commercial and societal problems and dysfunctions , and to seek out and break down the root causes of said dysfunctions .\nAt its best , the Valley doesn \u2019 t create small companies that offer niche improvements to existing products or business models ; instead , it creates wildly different approaches to serving huge existing categories . ( Online retail vs. 6,300 physical Wal-Mart stores , Uber vs. unreliable , corruptly-regulated taxi companies , iTunes vs. Tower Records , etc . )\n4 ) Pool capital to back the teams to identify and create small technologically-driven demonstration footholds while identifying plausible product and service roadmaps for the climb ahead .\nValley entrepreneurial teams can get a few hundred thousand to a few million dollars to start work on a big problem and to begin to try to craft a business model solution to it . They aim for \u201c minimum viable product \u201d to get into the game , knowing that they \u2019 ve got to start somewhere .\n5 ) Attack the climb . Test the footholds and either keep climbing or pivot in search of better footholds .\nValley VCs don \u2019 t expect a complete , elegant solution to be laid on their desk pre-funding . They expect early investments to be used to design small-scale , testable models that allow further exploration and/or route correction .\n6 ) When successful approaches become apparent , slam the accelerator to the floor and aggressively pour human , financial , and technological resources at the opening .\nThe whiff of successful progress inevitably brings the need ( and usually the abundant supply ) of new capital to exploit the opening like Hun invaders pouring through a breach in a walled city \u2019 s fortifications .\n7 ) Reach for alliances , partnerships , expertise and more capital to build scale quickly .\nDominating and disruptive new companies almost always seek to achieve the power and efficiencies that scale brings , and they want and need to achieve it before existing providers can effectively fight back . The power players in the venture capital business are masters at giving their rising young companies this form of organizational superfood .\n8 ) Provide real value to build a community of fervent followers , and foster the virality of your offerings .\nWhen a new model is succeeding and the fledgling company is providing something to a growing number of customers that \u2019 s exponentially better than what they \u2019 ve gotten before ( think of the evangelistic fervor of Apple users ) , find ways to help those customers join the battle and recruit other new converts as quickly as possible .\n9 ) Use scale , momentum and community to batter down barriers to entry and regulatory doors .\nNot to beat the Uber drum , but they and Airbnb are probably the two best examples of companies that have used their true-believer customers to help overwhelm local authorities trying to keep incumbent providers safe from brutal new competition .\n10 ) Fail fast , intensively collect data on what works and doesn \u2019 t , and iterate , iterate , iterate to magnify success .\nTraditional corporate brands innovate slowly and with overweening caution lest some misstep \u201c damage \u201d their standing with their customers . Valley disruptors tend to move products quickly to market and use intensive feedback and a strong measure of transparency and communication to ask forgiveness rather than permission from their users . And then they repeat the cycle as quickly as possible .\nThe most difficult element for the Citizens \u2019 Party effort ? The political entrepreneurs . It \u2019 s not a for-profit game , so that obvious Valley motivation is off the table . ( But if you believe the accounts of what motivates millennial entrepreneurs , it \u2019 s about \u201c making a difference \u201d more than it is about their bank accounts\u2014so there \u2019 s hope . )\nThe Valley likes to attack Big Problems . Healthcare \u2019 s the darling there right now , not surprisingly . And the Valley also likes big TAMS\u2014total addressable markets .\nThis one ( American politics ) serves , directly or indirectly , 320 million people . Its successful outputs directly control more than a third of the US GDP . Eighty percent of those 320 million people think the top level of that stack\u2014the federal government\u2014is badly broken . Sixty percent of voters , meanwhile , think the direct output of the two party duopoly sucks .\nMapping out a prospective path for how your company gets from an un-air conditioned class C office building to Destroyer of Industries is a critical step in the creation of any revolutionary enterprise . That \u2019 s what a product and service roadmap does .\nWhile it \u2019 s not certain what a smart , informed , motivated team would come up with for the Citizens \u2019 Party , certain elements of what it needs to create and offer are clear :\n\u2022 Form of organization . It \u2019 s a real political party . Not in the Iowa first , New Hampshire second , blind loyalty third kind of old-fashioned political party . But the Citizens \u2019 Party is also definitively not some feel-good , can \u2019 t-we-all-get-along non-profit , either . We \u2019 re talking about an honest to goodness 26 USC Section 527 political organization . Just like the two dead sequoias . Play to win .\n\u2022 Technology platform . The cloud computing and software-as-a-service references are just technology model starting points . There \u2019 s no illusion that a group of coders are going to stand up a competitive political party . But if we \u2019 re designing a 21st century political organization around 21st century technologies in order to dominate a 21st century societal landscape , it \u2019 s quite likely that what we create will have its foundation in a sophisticated digital platform . The party will likely have an approach that moves from the physical , linear , proximity-based world we \u2019 ve lived in\u2014with precinct walkers and door knockers and phone banks\u2014to one that is anchored in our modern virtual reality . ( Does anyone you know who \u2019 s younger than your grandmother like or appreciate having their door knocked on by a creepy political volunteer ? )\n\u2022 Ideology and policy development . Here \u2019 s a radical thought : Maybe the Citizens \u2019 Party should , by definition , stand for what the center 60 % of Americans stand for . Rather than the \u201c I \u2019 m a Republican but\u2026. \u201d or \u201c I consider myself a Democrat except for\u2026 \u201d -style excuse-making , maybe the ideology just flows from , and wraps around , the participants . It could center on a methodology to produce candidates who reflect the will of voters\u2014and it could also help place priority on the perception of being able to build a consensus around reforming a horribly broken government . That means the party needs to provide aggregation and analytics on the core values , beliefs , and emerging opinions of the 60 percent . The party is a two-way market enabler , where its users provide information about their needs and preferences and candidates provide information right back about their policy approaches and personal insights , seeking a match .\n\u2022 Fundraising . No illusions . Money makes the political world go \u2018 round in exactly the same way it does the business world . Star fundraisers in a new technologically-centered party architecture might look exactly like they do in the duopoly\u2014or they might look more like YouTube or Twitter stars\u2014individuals whose content or analysis or informed commentary make them emerging authorities on emerging candidates . But lest you think that disruptive digital organizations can \u2019 t come to play with the big boys , Apple is the 9th largest revenue company in the world , and Amazon is 44th after just two decades in business , and growing at one of the fastest organic rates in the Fortune 500 . If the Citizens \u2019 Party punches start landing , money will flow like blood from an MMA fighter \u2019 s nose .\n\u2022 People/volunteers . The Republican and Democratic parties still don \u2019 t have high-functioning digital hubs , and what technological expertise there is tends to reside in individual campaigns . A disruptive party will put the technology builds at the center of its agenda always , with no greater focus than in its ability to find and organize human resources\u2014both volunteer and staff\u2014for its candidates and campaigns . Making technology available to all its candidates could also put the focus on issues and personal qualities and capabilities rather than on who can build the best data shop .\n\u2022 Legal . No illusions here , either . If you think Uber or Napster or 23 and Me have faced huge legal and regulatory obstacles , you ain \u2019 t seen nothing yet . The two parties will wage wild-eyed state-house-to-state-house jihad against any prospectively powerful and disruptive new force in the political market . The Citizens \u2019 Party will need the same hardball mobilization and legal skills demonstrated by the likes of Uber to get its users to help overturn the duopoly \u2019 s barricades .\n\u2022 Nominating process . Transparency to see through to clearly defined nominating processes are critical . The ridiculous complexity and non-standardization of the duopoly \u2019 s nominating processes are , as they say in the software business , a feature not a bug\u2014designed to repel all but members of the parties \u2019 inner priesthood from seeking or controlling access to power . Further , those processes aren \u2019 t designed to produce the best choices . They \u2019 re an amalgam of tradition , ego , greed , and band aids .\nEconomists would say that the selection of a political leader in a democratically-advised republic like ours is a kind of market , but since there are no exchanges of value and no prices , it \u2019 s what \u2019 s known as a matching market . The members of one group\u2014voters\u2014need to match themselves with members of another group \u2014candidates\u2014 to get the leadership services they seek .\nI \u2019 m not a market design expert , but I \u2019 m smart enough to know you \u2019 d go recruit someone like the god of smart market design economists , Stanford \u2019 s Nobel laureate Alvin Roth , who \u2019 s designed marketplaces to match everything from organ donations to medical resident fellowship placements , to help the party figure out what a 21st century political matching market ought to look like . Those designs will no doubt be oriented toward making the nominating process\u2014the party \u2019 s \u201c marketplace \u201d \u2014fair , orderly , and ultimately worthy of consumer trust .\nAt the presidential level , it would be easy to imagine a disciplined plan by which party customers vote securely online\u2014yes , that \u2019 s entirely plausible for a party nomination process\u2014in five or six evenly spaced primary tranches . What tranche a state goes in , rather than favoring some and disadvantaging others , could be determined by rotation or lottery . Seems a lot more logical and fair , doesn \u2019 t it , and more likely to produce a non-anomalous candidate ?\nNo one person has all the answers or talents necessary to design , build , and deploy the solution set to fire up a new common-sense and consensus-driven political movement . But the elements are all out there . Everything we need is resident in the brains of some combination of individuals \u2014 software engineers , financiers , algorithm designers , market designers , communicators , evangelists , political scientists , social memeticians , pollsters , analytics gurus and god knows who else .\nCreating the party in the cloud is a weirdly cross-disciplinary effort that will require a wide variety of subject matter expertise .\nIn my experience , most Valleyites and political professionals alike will , on being invited to discuss the possibility of disrupting the political system , first say something like , \u201c A new party ? Well who would you run for president ? \u201d . Which of course would have been like asking Howard Schultz where he planned to put his 24,000th Starbucks store when he was pitching for seed funding to open his first one .\nValley pros see the overwhelming complexity of the legal and procedural barriers to entry and conclude they \u2019 ve got better things to do than try to figure this out on their own . To the extent any of them have dipped their toes in the water , they \u2019 ve tended to try standard electoral politics ( Meg Whitman , Steve Westly ) with varying degrees of success or have been donors to major-party candidates or toyed with pet issues or technology projects . Political pros meanwhile , are by and large afraid of technology designed for anything other than identifying and turning out voters .\nAs for a movement arising on its own somehow , the 60 percent of us in the center are neatly cleaved in two , half swallowing hard to justify the socialist energies of the left and half trying to rationalize the nativist and racist line of the hard right . While there \u2019 s very little of substance standing between the two 30 percent voter blocks on each side of the separating line , we \u2019 ve both long been successfully divided and conquered by the centrifugal forces of partisanship .\nBut so what ? The Valley crowd didn \u2019 t have a depth of understanding about the intricacies of public livery laws when Uber was formed in 2009 . Alvan Bovay was no Karl Rove when he organized that first proto-Republican party meeting in Ripon , Wisconsin in 1854 . And the rising new Ciudadanos party in Spain is finding ways to grow from the center outward , and changing the balance of power in the process .\nI believe it \u2019 s time to organize some sit-downs at The Cup in Boulder , Buck \u2019 s of Woodside , Houndstooth in Austin , and anywhere else investors and innovators gather . I think it \u2019 s time to find a core political entrepreneurial team\u2014and start whiteboarding and talking , connecting dots , hypothesizing , and testing . Good ideas appeal to good names , and good names beget other good names .",

We need to take their strategies and tactics for disrupting and dismantling ossified industries and put them to work to eviscerate the two party system.\n\nIn dead earnestness, it\u2019s time for the party in the cloud\u2014a citizens\u2019 political party-as-a-service. A 21st-century fast, agile digital movement built on the foundation of a powerful social web organization and communication platform. Not a party of insiders or elites. A party that lets the idiot fringe be the idiot fringe on both the left and right, and instead seeks to serve the citizens in the middle.\n\nIn fact, let\u2019s just call it the Citizens\u2019 Party.\n\nAs venture capitalist Hank Vigil of Seattle-based Acequia Ventures said after a long discussion where I first broached the subject to him, \u201cI think what you\u2019re talking about is creating some kind of technological infrastructure that forms a kernel capable of attracting talent to create the swarm dynamics that overwhelm the traditional model.\u201d\n\nYes, Hank. Yes. That is exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n\u201cSwarm dynamics.\u201d That\u2019s a phrase nobody in politics has ever said.

Something big and muscular and bristling with a healthy preference for economic prosperity and innovation and tolerance and a sense of shared purpose and destiny\u2014the stuff that truly does make America exceptional.\n\nIf we\u2019re going to disrupt this market for political leadership\u2014the market the two parties collude to control in a way no Justice Department would ever allow in any other context\u2014we\u2019re going to need to bring expertise from the technology, political, policy, legal, communications, and fundraising industries and communities into the swarm and make them all buzz together.\n\nIt will require us to develop and follow a roadmap and methodology that Silicon Valley has used to astonishing effect to disrupt the status quo and steamroll complacent, lazy, irredeemably customer-hostile competition in dozens and dozens of industries before this one.\n\nAnd when it happens, and it can happen, this disruption\u2019s going to be vastly more satisfying. Because it won\u2019t be done for profit or for self-aggrandizement. It will be done for our kids and each other\u2014the same reasons the best Americans have always come together to accomplish hard things.\n\nThe Two-Party Disconnect\n\n21st century America is a place where consumer things increasingly just work. Any physical good that exists can be on our front porches 48 hours from now. Unimaginable entertainment and social options are available to us anywhere, anytime with a few taps of the magic screens in our pockets. The world we live in, whether we\u2019re average Josephines or one percenters, has been utterly transformed by information and connectivity, and now new information-based tools and business models are even starting to reform broken sectors that everybody needs like education and healthcare.\n\nAll that re-engineering and systemic improvement comes to us from organizations\u2014new ones in most cases, reinvented older ones in some\u2014that grasp the technological zeitgeist and ride it in order to serve our (and thereby, their) needs.\n\nExcept in one consumer market\u2014that for political leadership. In that market, American consumers would like to find some honest men and women who appeal to a broad majority of us, who understand the dynamism of the world we live in and the technology that\u2019s reshaping it, and who are guided by some stomach-calming personal qualities like honesty, hard work, common sense, thrift, courage, respect, kindness, and maybe most of all, the ability to seek and find common ground.\n\nAnd what do we get when we try to order that for our national front porch?\n\nWe get Donald F. Trump and Hillary F. Clinton. That\u2019s what.\n\nBuilt to Last\u2026 160 years?\n\nOne reason why the political services market is so broken is the wildly geriatric age of the organizations serving it. The younger of the two, the \u201cGrand Old Party,\u201d is 162 years old.\n\nQuick: Name every phenomenal customer-oriented company you do business with that\u2019s 160 years old. I\u2019ll wait.\n\nIt\u2019s also because the two parties have built their own gigantic regulatory barriers to entry inside an electoral-law system of their own molding.

The two political parties are taking the technological tools that every other kind of consumer organization has used to make and deliver products and services that appeal to the fat center of the American consumer psyche and are instead using them to design products\u2014candidates and policy platforms, in their case\u2014that appeal to the most extreme tastes of their most extreme consumers.\n\nIt\u2019s like going online to order a boxed set of all the James Bond movies and then receiving snuff porn videos. Over and over again.\n\nEnough. It\u2019s time for our national Hulkamania moment, where the blows to our collective head from the fists of the two-party system stop concussing us and instead start building that crazy, wide-eyed intensity (in the two-thirds of us that don\u2019t find blind loyalty to extreme political ideologies to our liking, anyway) that can enable us to rip our shirts off and pound the hell out of our Republican and Democrat tormentors.\n\nAnd maybe actually find some leadership that can pull us forward from the center instead of pulling us apart from the extremes.\n\nBut how?\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting somehow that Silicon Valley can save our political system. It\u2019s clear that there\u2019s broad disagreement as to whether the technology industry is America's most powerful engine for economic growth and vitality or whether alternatively it's some kind of vampiric middle class woodchipper.\n\nBut who cares, in this case? We\u2019re watching a large cabal of party insiders on both sides carry out an ongoing 17-decade theft of America\u2019s political patrimony. The Valley\u2019s denizens (and related digital forest-dwellers in Seattle, Boulder, Austin, Reston, and elsewhere, lumped for simplicity's sake under the \u201cValley\u201d umbrella) have a burning urge to innovate and a strong experiential knowledge set about how to disrupt huge existing industries.\n\nWhat I\u2019m suggesting is that the Valley has an approach, a kind of rough algorithm, for the way its ecosystem attacks and has successfully disrupted enormous markets/problems/opportunities over the past 30 years. This \u201cValley Way,\u201d not surprisingly, isn\u2019t uniform or codified, and of course often fails. But there\u2019s a discernible pattern to how it\u2019s gone about its successful work, particularly when invading an information-driven industry like politics.\n\nIf I were to give you my outside observer\u2019s take on that algorithm for building revolutionary and disruptive organizations from scratch, I\u2019d identify ten core elements in the process:\n\n1) Start with knowledge of the full technological stack\u2014the available tool kit\u2014and what existing participants in the marketplace are doing with it already.\n\nThis is table stakes. You can\u2019t use information and technology as your disruption engine if you don\u2019t understand how the engine works. And of course you don\u2019t want to spin your wheels disrupting a market that\u2019s already been disrupted. So you come to the fight armed and aware. And the political market hasn\u2019t yet been disrupted \u2014 not in the Valley sense, anyway. It\u2019s been co-opted by some ill-intentioned mountebanks, but it hasn\u2019t been disrupted.\n\n2) Identify high-energy, high-achieving, highly intelligent, aggressive, inquisitive and hard-working individuals, and organize them into two- or three-person insurgent teams.\n\nThe single greatest determinant of success in the Valley, you\u2019ll hear so many times when talking to people there that you\u2019ll come to see it as gospel, is the quality of the entrepreneur and his or her founding team. It\u2019s the sine qua non of disruption.\n\n3) Encourage those teams to identify huge commercial and societal problems and dysfunctions, and to seek out and break down the root causes of said dysfunctions.\n\nAt its best, the Valley doesn\u2019t create small companies that offer niche improvements to existing products or business models; instead, it creates wildly different approaches to serving huge existing categories. (Online retail vs. 6,300 physical Wal-Mart stores, Uber vs. unreliable, corruptly-regulated taxi companies, iTunes vs. Tower Records, etc.)\n\n4) Pool capital to back the teams to identify and create small technologically-driven demonstration footholds while identifying plausible product and service roadmaps for the climb ahead.\n\nValley entrepreneurial teams can get a few hundred thousand to a few million dollars to start work on a big problem and to begin to try to craft a business model solution to it. They aim for \u201cminimum viable product\u201d to get into the game, knowing that they\u2019ve got to start somewhere.\n\n5) Attack the climb. Test the footholds and either keep climbing or pivot in search of better footholds.\n\nValley VCs don\u2019t expect a complete, elegant solution to be laid on their desk pre-funding. They expect early investments to be used to design small-scale, testable models that allow further exploration and/or route correction.\n\n6) When successful approaches become apparent, slam the accelerator to the floor and aggressively pour human, financial, and technological resources at the opening.\n\nThe whiff of successful progress inevitably brings the need (and usually the abundant supply) of new capital to exploit the opening like Hun invaders pouring through a breach in a walled city\u2019s fortifications.\n\n7) Reach for alliances, partnerships, expertise and more capital to build scale quickly.\n\nDominating and disruptive new companies almost always seek to achieve the power and efficiencies that scale brings, and they want and need to achieve it before existing providers can effectively fight back. The power players in the venture capital business are masters at giving their rising young companies this form of organizational superfood.\n\n8) Provide real value to build a community of fervent followers, and foster the virality of your offerings.\n\nWhen a new model is succeeding and the fledgling company is providing something to a growing number of customers that\u2019s exponentially better than what they\u2019ve gotten before (think of the evangelistic fervor of Apple users), find ways to help those customers join the battle and recruit other new converts as quickly as possible.\n\n9) Use scale, momentum and community to batter down barriers to entry and regulatory doors.\n\nNot to beat the Uber drum, but they and Airbnb are probably the two best examples of companies that have used their true-believer customers to help overwhelm local authorities trying to keep incumbent providers safe from brutal new competition.\n\n10) Fail fast, intensively collect data on what works and doesn\u2019t, and iterate, iterate, iterate to magnify success.\n\nTraditional corporate brands innovate slowly and with overweening caution lest some misstep \u201cdamage\u201d their standing with their customers. Valley disruptors tend to move products quickly to market and use intensive feedback and a strong measure of transparency and communication to ask forgiveness rather than permission from their users. And then they repeat the cycle as quickly as possible.\n\nThe most difficult element for the Citizens\u2019 Party effort? The political entrepreneurs. It\u2019s not a for-profit game, so that obvious Valley motivation is off the table. (But if you believe the accounts of what motivates millennial entrepreneurs, it\u2019s about \u201cmaking a difference\u201d more than it is about their bank accounts\u2014so there\u2019s hope.)\n\nBig Problems and Total Addressable Markets\n\nThe Valley likes to attack Big Problems. Healthcare\u2019s the darling there right now, not surprisingly. And the Valley also likes big TAMS\u2014total addressable markets.\n\nThis one (American politics) serves, directly or indirectly, 320 million people. Its successful outputs directly control more than a third of the US GDP. Eighty percent of those 320 million people think the top level of that stack\u2014the federal government\u2014is badly broken. Sixty percent of voters, meanwhile, think the direct output of the two party duopoly sucks.\n\nSo check and check.\n\nProduct and Service Roadmap\n\nMapping out a prospective path for how your company gets from an un-air conditioned class C office building to Destroyer of Industries is a critical step in the creation of any revolutionary enterprise. That\u2019s what a product and service roadmap does.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not certain what a smart, informed, motivated team would come up with for the Citizens\u2019 Party, certain elements of what it needs to create and offer are clear:\n\n\u2022 Form of organization. It\u2019s a real political party. Not in the Iowa first, New Hampshire second, blind loyalty third kind of old-fashioned political party. But the Citizens\u2019 Party is also definitively not some feel-good, can\u2019t-we-all-get-along non-profit, either. We\u2019re talking about an honest to goodness 26 USC Section 527 political organization. Just like the two dead sequoias. Play to win.\n\n\u2022 Technology platform. The cloud computing and software-as-a-service references are just technology model starting points. There\u2019s no illusion that a group of coders are going to stand up a competitive political party. But if we\u2019re designing a 21st century political organization around 21st century technologies in order to dominate a 21st century societal landscape, it\u2019s quite likely that what we create will have its foundation in a sophisticated digital platform. The party will likely have an approach that moves from the physical, linear, proximity-based world we\u2019ve lived in\u2014with precinct walkers and door knockers and phone banks\u2014to one that is anchored in our modern virtual reality. (Does anyone you know who\u2019s younger than your grandmother like or appreciate having their door knocked on by a creepy political volunteer?)\n\n\u2022 Ideology and policy development. Here\u2019s a radical thought: Maybe the Citizens\u2019 Party should, by definition, stand for what the center 60% of Americans stand for. Rather than the \u201cI\u2019m a Republican but\u2026.\u201d or \u201cI consider myself a Democrat except for\u2026\u201d-style excuse-making, maybe the ideology just flows from, and wraps around, the participants. It could center on a methodology to produce candidates who reflect the will of voters\u2014and it could also help place priority on the perception of being able to build a consensus around reforming a horribly broken government. That means the party needs to provide aggregation and analytics on the core values, beliefs, and emerging opinions of the 60 percent. The party is a two-way market enabler, where its users provide information about their needs and preferences and candidates provide information right back about their policy approaches and personal insights, seeking a match.\n\n\u2022 Fundraising. No illusions. Money makes the political world go \u2018round in exactly the same way it does the business world. Star fundraisers in a new technologically-centered party architecture might look exactly like they do in the duopoly\u2014or they might look more like YouTube or Twitter stars\u2014individuals whose content or analysis or informed commentary make them emerging authorities on emerging candidates. But lest you think that disruptive digital organizations can\u2019t come to play with the big boys, Apple is the 9th largest revenue company in the world, and Amazon is 44th after just two decades in business, and growing at one of the fastest organic rates in the Fortune 500. If the Citizens\u2019 Party punches start landing, money will flow like blood from an MMA fighter\u2019s nose.\n\n\u2022 People/volunteers. The Republican and Democratic parties still don\u2019t have high-functioning digital hubs, and what technological expertise there is tends to reside in individual campaigns. A disruptive party will put the technology builds at the center of its agenda always, with no greater focus than in its ability to find and organize human resources\u2014both volunteer and staff\u2014for its candidates and campaigns. Making technology available to all its candidates could also put the focus on issues and personal qualities and capabilities rather than on who can build the best data shop.\n\n\u2022 Legal. No illusions here, either. If you think Uber or Napster or 23 and Me have faced huge legal and regulatory obstacles, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. The two parties will wage wild-eyed state-house-to-state-house jihad against any prospectively powerful and disruptive new force in the political market. The Citizens\u2019 Party will need the same hardball mobilization and legal skills demonstrated by the likes of Uber to get its users to help overturn the duopoly\u2019s barricades.\n\n\u2022 Nominating process. Transparency to see through to clearly defined nominating processes are critical. The ridiculous complexity and non-standardization of the duopoly\u2019s nominating processes are, as they say in the software business, a feature not a bug\u2014designed to repel all but members of the parties\u2019 inner priesthood from seeking or controlling access to power. Further, those processes aren\u2019t designed to produce the best choices. They\u2019re an amalgam of tradition, ego, greed, and band aids.\n\nEconomists would say that the selection of a political leader in a democratically-advised republic like ours is a kind of market, but since there are no exchanges of value and no prices, it\u2019s what\u2019s known as a matching market. The members of one group\u2014voters\u2014need to match themselves with members of another group \u2014candidates\u2014 to get the leadership services they seek.\n\nI\u2019m not a market design expert, but I\u2019m smart enough to know you\u2019d go recruit someone like the god of smart market design economists, Stanford\u2019s Nobel laureate Alvin Roth, who\u2019s designed marketplaces to match everything from organ donations to medical resident fellowship placements, to help the party figure out what a 21st century political matching market ought to look like. Those designs will no doubt be oriented toward making the nominating process\u2014the party\u2019s \u201cmarketplace\u201d\u2014fair, orderly, and ultimately worthy of consumer trust.\n\nAt the presidential level, it would be easy to imagine a disciplined plan by which party customers vote securely online\u2014yes, that\u2019s entirely plausible for a party nomination process\u2014in five or six evenly spaced primary tranches. What tranche a state goes in, rather than favoring some and disadvantaging others, could be determined by rotation or lottery. Seems a lot more logical and fair, doesn\u2019t it, and more likely to produce a non-anomalous candidate?\n\nNo one person has all the answers or talents necessary to design, build, and deploy the solution set to fire up a new common-sense and consensus-driven political movement. But the elements are all out there. Everything we need is resident in the brains of some combination of individuals \u2014 software engineers, financiers, algorithm designers, market designers, communicators, evangelists, political scientists, social memeticians, pollsters, analytics gurus and god knows who else.\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t this happened already?\n\nCreating the party in the cloud is a weirdly cross-disciplinary effort that will require a wide variety of subject matter expertise.\n\nIn my experience, most Valleyites and political professionals alike will, on being invited to discuss the possibility of disrupting the political system, first say something like, \u201cA new party? Well who would you run for president?\u201d. Which of course would have been like asking Howard Schultz where he planned to put his 24,000th Starbucks store when he was pitching for seed funding to open his first one.\n\nValley pros see the overwhelming complexity of the legal and procedural barriers to entry and conclude they\u2019ve got better things to do than try to figure this out on their own. To the extent any of them have dipped their toes in the water, they\u2019ve tended to try standard electoral politics (Meg Whitman, Steve Westly) with varying degrees of success or have been donors to major-party candidates or toyed with pet issues or technology projects. Political pros meanwhile, are by and large afraid of technology designed for anything other than identifying and turning out voters.\n\nAs for a movement arising on its own somehow, the 60 percent of us in the center are neatly cleaved in two, half swallowing hard to justify the socialist energies of the left and half trying to rationalize the nativist and racist line of the hard right. While there\u2019s very little of substance standing between the two 30 percent voter blocks on each side of the separating line, we\u2019ve both long been successfully divided and conquered by the centrifugal forces of partisanship.\n\nBut so what? The Valley crowd didn\u2019t have a depth of understanding about the intricacies of public livery laws when Uber was formed in 2009. Alvan Bovay was no Karl Rove when he organized that first proto-Republican party meeting in Ripon, Wisconsin in 1854. And the rising new Ciudadanos party in Spain is finding ways to grow from the center outward, and changing the balance of power in the process.\n\nFirst steps\n\nI believe it\u2019s time to organize some sit-downs at The Cup in Boulder, Buck\u2019s of Woodside, Houndstooth in Austin, and anywhere else investors and innovators gather. I think it\u2019s time to find a core political entrepreneurial team\u2014and start whiteboarding and talking, connecting dots, hypothesizing, and testing. Good ideas appeal to good names, and good names beget other good names.\n\nBecause disruption starts with a kernel, remember?",
