    "content": "President Donald Trump is just one week away from one of the most important moments of his presidency \u2014 and he \u2019 s trying to lower expectations in advance .\nTrump plans to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam at the end of February for their second summit . Trump \u2019 s main goal , as it was when they met for the first time in Singapore last June , is to strike a deal to dismantle North Korea \u2019 s nuclear program .\nThat \u2019 s easier said than done . After months of talks , both sides are at an impasse : The US has demanded that North Korea offer a full , detailed list of its nuclear inventory before it lifts sanctions , while North Korea says the sanctions should be lifted before it provides the full list and seriously begins to downgrade its nuclear capabilities .\nIt \u2019 s no wonder , then , that Trump has used nearly every public opportunity to try to lower mounting pressure ahead of the historic meeting .\nLet \u2019 s start with the first instance . On Tuesday , Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in response to a question about North Korea , \u201c We \u2019 re in no rush whatsoever . ... As long as there \u2019 s no testing , I \u2019 m in no rush . If there \u2019 s testing , that \u2019 s another deal. \u201d It \u2019 s a comment he \u2019 s made before , but it carries more weight now that he mentioned it again before the February 27 meeting .\nTrump often points to the fact that Pyongyang hasn \u2019 t detonated a nuclear device since September 2017 or tested a missile since November of that year , but it \u2019 s not the full story . About three years have passed between North Korea \u2019 s first and second nuclear tests , and about four years between its second and third . It has completed six tests in total , only one of which took place during the Trump administration . There have also been years-long gaps between North Korea \u2019 s missile tests , which began in the 1980s .\nSo the current lull is nothing new , and North Korea has used the break to continue improving its nuclear arsenal that threatens regional allies and American territory .\n\u201c This only reinforces the perception among some that Trump either doesn \u2019 t understand the threat or is cynically approaching the North Korea issue from a political rather than security perspective , \u201d Frank Aum , a North Korea expert at the US Institute of Peace in Washington , told me .\nAnd on Wednesday , Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that the Hanoi summit likely won \u2019 t be the last time he meets with Kim . In other words , don \u2019 t expect a massive deal to end North Korea \u2019 s nuclear program next week .
