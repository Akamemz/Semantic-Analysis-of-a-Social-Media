He concluded that Q is better informed than the mainstream media about Washington and other topics .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know for a fact who Q is , \u201d Mr. Brown said . \u201c I have strong thoughts that it certainly could be someone in the administration . All I know is , when I read what is posted on the \u2018 Q board , \u2019 it seems to be more relevant and more true than what I \u2019 m reading in the papers . \u201d\nOn message boards such as QAnon.pub and 8ch.net , a person or group of people identified only as Q has been posting provocative questions about the government since October .\nIn a typical post , Q wrote last week about election security , \u201c How do you safeguard the integrity of our elections from domestic & foreign criminal actors ? How do you utilize the Russia narrative to knock out decades old election corruption ? Why are D \u2019 s opposed to cleaning up voter rolls ? Why are D \u2019 s opposed to imposing VOTER ID LAWS to further safeguard our elections ? \u201d\nQ claims to have top-level security clearance and knowledge of a worldwide criminal conspiracy involving special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation . It says Mr. Mueller is looking into top Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama instead of suspected collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign .\nMany of Q \u2019 s followers believe top Democrats and others such as Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , will soon be sent to prison in a development they call \u201c the storm. \u201d It is a reference to a comment by Mr. Trump last year , when he quipped during a meeting with his military chiefs that their gathering might be \u201c the calm before the storm . \u201d\nFollowers also have been promoting theories that certain Hollywood figures are involved in child-sex rings . Their anonymous posts often share the view that Mr. Trump will prevail over globalists and \u201c deep state \u201d operatives .\nRoseanne Barr frequently has tweeted about QAnon and has shared on Twitter a phrase used by QAnon followers : \u201c wwg1wga , \u201d short for \u201c where we go one , we go all. \u201d Former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling has retweeted QAnon videos .\nQAnon.pub has been receiving about 7 million hits per month . From the shadowy corners of the internet , Q \u2019 s followers burst onto the political scene last week .\nAt a Trump rally in Tampa , Florida , some in the crowd held up a \u201c We are Q \u201d signs in view of television cameras . Others wore T-shirts bearing the letter . Followers later were gleeful about a video that appeared to show Mr. Trump pointing from the stage at a \u201c Q \u201d cutout held aloft in the crowd .\nAt a Trump rally two days later in Pennsylvania , more Q signs and T-shirts appeared .\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked last week whether the president \u201c encouraged the support \u201d of rally-goers wearing Q shirts , some of whom heckled journalists at the Tampa rally .\n\u201c The president condemns and denounces any group that would incite violence against another individual and certainly doesn \u2019 t support groups that would promote that type of behavior , \u201d Mrs. Sanders said .\nHer answer was panned on message boards by Q devotees , who said she either dodged the question or was wrongly associating them with violence .\nSome coverage of Q followers in the mainstream media has characterized the movement as a \u201c cult , \u201d a \u201c fringe group \u201d and even a \u201c virus. \u201d Mr. Brown said he and many other Q followers are \u201c just regular folks . \u201d\n\u201c All of us are looking for truth , \u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview . \u201c Are there nut jobs on there ? Yeah , there are . There are goofballs on there . But that \u2019 s the whole world . We \u2019 re all about trying to separate truth from fiction . \u201d\nAsked whether Mr. Trump \u2019 s constant complaints about \u201c fake news \u201d have helped create the Q phenomenon , Mr. Brown said he believes public dissatisfaction and mistrust of the media were prominent long before Mr. Trump ran for office .\n\u201c I think there has been a great sense of distrust that has been growing for a very long time , even way before Trump , \u201d he said . \u201c I just want the media to tell us the truth without an agenda . The American public is not stupid ; we can sort things out . I don \u2019 t think that Trump \u2019 s comments have given legs to Q ; I think the legs were already there . \u201d\nHe added : \u201c If you get a sense that the stories that you \u2019 re hearing on the radio and on TV are not true , you almost want to tune it out . If you \u2019 re not going to tell me the truth , don \u2019 t bother telling me anything . The timing of Q was rather interesting .

Last week , Praying Medic posted a YouTube video offering explanations for recent posts by Q and highlighted Mr. Trump \u2019 s comment at a rally that he had visited Washington 17 times before he was elected president .\n\u201c The president could have picked out any random number , \u201d Praying Medic said on the video . \u201c But he happened to pick out the number 17 . Q is the 17th letter of the alphabet . \u201d\nQ claims that fewer than 10 people in government know Q \u2019 s identity and says more than 50 million people are tracking the movement regularly .\nEven before Q followers began showing up at Trump rallies , the movement was morphing into public view .

Comey \u2019 s handling of the Clinton email investigation .
