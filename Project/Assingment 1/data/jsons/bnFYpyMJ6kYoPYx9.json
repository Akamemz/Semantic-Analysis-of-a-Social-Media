    "content": "Back in 2006 , former President George H.W . Bush addressed Florida state lawmakers during the last of his son Jeb 's leadership gatherings in the lower chamber of the Legislature . During the speech , Poppy Bush broke down sobbing while recalling how Jeb lost his first 1994 gubernatorial bid to the Democratic candidate , Lawton Chiles .\nSaid the patriarch of the Bush dynasty , `` He did n't whine about it . He did n't complain . '' Bush continued through his tears and crackling voice , `` A true measure of a man is how you handle victory and how you handle defeat , so in '94 Floridians chose to rehire the governor . They took note of his worthy opponent , who showed with not only words but with actions what decency he had . ''\nBy all measures , Jeb Bush has all but lost his first and perhaps only campaign for the White House , and must now be flirting with the inevitability of dropping out of the race entirely unless his electoral fortunes change drastically . They wo n't , and it 's surprisingly depressing to observe the sad , slow descent of Jeb Bush from presumptive front-runner to droopy beta-male . It probably should n't be this way , but Jeb 's suddenly outdated style of politics has been rendered impotent by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz . And , frankly , I think we 're going to miss the Jeb Bushes of the world .\nI hasten to underscore that his positions are mostly loathsome , as is his older brother George W. , who 's responsible for bungling us into two wars and a crippling financial crisis . Suffice to say , this is n't any sort of paean to Jeb 's agenda or his record as governor . Far from it . But Jeb , along with his dad , represent a dying breed of Republican . In this regard , watching Jeb awkwardly skulk through retail politicking in Iowa and New Hampshire is not unlike watching an endangered sea turtle flailing desperately on the beach -- confused and pained , tourists splashing Solo cups of water on his head .\nOn Tuesday , following his dreary showing in Iowa , Jeb spoke to a small crowd at the Hanover Inn in New Hampshire . During a high point in his remarks , Jeb once again tried in futility to accost his nemesis , Trump , exclaiming : `` I won \u2019 t be out here blowharding , talking a big game without backing it up . ''\nIndeed , the New York Times described the crowd 's reaction as `` total silence . ''\nThen , as if to amplify his newly ordained role as the official GOP presidential sad-sack , the beached sea turtle begged , he added :\nIn hindsight , Jeb Bush 's actual campaign slogan might as well have been : `` Jeb ! Please clap . '' Indeed , nothing else has successfully defined his campaign for president more than those two words .\nBush 's rarely sated thirst for acceptance and respect has been a running theme through most of his campaign , and especially during the conga line of televised GOP debates . During those excruciatingly long political game shows , it 's been painfully obvious that the political universe has left Jeb behind , while Trump has turned the Bush dynasty 's favorite son into a 90-pound weakling . No matter what he says , no matter what tactic he and his advisers roll out as another pointed jab against Trump , the New York reality show star somehow manages to effortlessly dodge then castrate Jeb before one record-setting television audience after another , to a point where even liberal Bush-family haters have found themselves rooting for Jeb out of sympathy . Time after time , Jeb has almost unknowingly walked directly into the Trump machine 's propeller blades , only to be expertly julienned by the front-runner -- all while that deflated `` awww man , not again '' expression washes across his familiar mug . Even the timing of Trump 's campaign announcement on the day after Jeb 's announcement totally stepped on his thunder .\nEvery time he stepped right onto Trump 's bear traps , Jeb invariably disintegrated into the bedraggled stagehand character played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in `` Boogie Nights '' -- scolding himself behind his crying-on-the-inside sad-clown face . The rest of us wondering to ourselves , How the hell can `` the smart one '' allow himself to walk right into it , over and over again ?\nOn top of being a political dinosaur in the reality-show media landscape that passes for serious campaigning these days , Jeb , of course , had several key obstacles working against him from the beginning .\nFirst , political dynasties in the United States rarely extend beyond two , at least in terms of the presidency . There 's John and John Quincy . Teddy and Franklin . Bush 41 and Bush 43 . Perhaps Bill and Hillary . American voters can accept two , but never three . And the Bush family definitely is n't cut out to be the exception . Therefore , adding a `` Bush 45 '' to the menu was a historical long-shot from the start , even though it was well-acknowledged that Jeb was the best skilled heir to his father 's legacy and that Bush 43 was a glitch along the way . In fact , when Poppy openly sobbed during his Florida remarks , many of us hypothesized that he lamented the ascent of George W. , rather than Jeb , coming as it did during perhaps the lowest point in W 's presidency .\nFurthermore , Jeb mistakenly thought that by being a known commodity with a massive war chest , he could simply coast to the nomination on his name and his establishment cred as the smarter and more presidential Bush boy . No one fully understood at the time how Election 2016 would become the clown show with the entrance of Trump . I mean , many of us expected the clowns , but not like this . Not this level of insanity . Not even record-breaking fundraising could extricate Jeb from the GOP clownscape . He spent roughly $ 2,800 for every vote he received in the Iowa caucus , and it still was n't anywhere near enough .\nSo far , Jeb has raised $ 135 million , more than any other candidate from either party , and it 's still not enough to put Humpty together again .\nWe 've obviously drilled through another rock layer in American politics , descending blindly and ever deeper into the unknown . Appearing `` presidential '' is nearly irrelevant now , especially in the face of novelty candidates capable of producing endless content for viral Facebook memes , who offer lofty promises such as Christian theocracy ( Cruz ) and `` big beautiful walls '' ( you know who ) , in the absence of rational policy proposals . Assembling a comprehensive series of workable positions while assembling a wise old team of GOP policy advisers , as Jeb has , is pointless today , unless the candidate is prepared to ignore sage advice in lieu of pandering to the inchoate derangement of his or her base .\nAnd finally , we 'd be remiss if we did n't mention the poisonous taint of the Bush name that still exists seven years after Bush 43 moved back to Texas to paint his pictures .\nSo , what 's next for Jeb ? As George H.W . Bush said back in \u2018 06 , it \u2019 s all about how he handles defeat .\nGiven the money he 's raised , Jeb could probably end up waiting out the rest of the field to eventually end up in third place or something similar . Call it campaigning by attrition . But regardless of what Jeb does between now and the summer , it 's a foregone conclusion that he 'll be viewed as the last of a dying breed -- the old-school political schlub whom everyone felt sorry for . In this regard , maybe he deserves a round of applause for eschewing Trump-style trolling and , at the very least , taking the process more seriously when so many of his colleagues do n't . Please , by all means , clap .",
