    "content": "Paul Vallely is author of a new biography , Pope Francis : The Struggle for the Soul of Catholicism ( Bloomsbury ) .\nPope Francis has been brushing up on his English ahead of his arrival in Washington in September , and tickets to his U.S. events are already a hot commodity . But anyone expecting his message to be simply one of mercy and love could be in for a distinct surprise .\nIn his speech to a joint meeting of Congress , the pope of the poor could well deliver a harsh message for the world \u2019 s richest nation . For all the genuine warmth of his smile , his track record suggests he sees it as his job not just to comfort the afflicted , but also to afflict the comfortable . And however delicately he fine-tunes his language , the hard fact is that he believes the United States is as much a part of the problem as the solution .\nFor more than a century , popes have made nuanced criticisms of the free-market capitalism that drives the American dream . But Pope Francis , with an unprecedented vigor , is locking horns with much that Washington and Wall Street hold dear . Why does he take such a hard line ?\nIn the two-plus years since his election , he has enchanted and bewildered the world in equal measure with his compassion and his contradictions . But he has also proved himself a wily and sophisticated politician . Understanding this side of Francis\u2014capable of crafty maneuvering , unafraid of confrontation , ready to seek out unlikely allies\u2014is essential for understanding the complicated effect he is having on American politics .\nThe pope born in Argentina as Jorge Mario Bergoglio has been called both a Marxist and a reactionary . But unpack the long biography of this 78-year-old cleric , and a more complex and intriguing reality emerges . Francis has never embraced one particular political ideology , though he has been comfortable around people who have . His first boss , the woman who ran the Buenos Aires chemistry laboratory where he worked , was a Communist whose diligence and integrity he greatly admired . \u201c Marxist ideology is wrong , \u201d the pope said in 2013 , \u201c but in my life I have known many Marxists who are good people , so I don \u2019 t feel offended . \u201d\nWhat has shaped Francis , instead , is his lived experience . Born into an Italian immigrant family , he has a long-standing bias toward the underdog and those who must struggle to survive . The most formative part of his priestly life was the 19 years he spent among the very poorest in the shantytowns of Buenos Aires , where he was known as the \u201c bishop of the slums . \u201d\nBut there is another key to understanding the pope \u2019 s worldview . His predecessor , Pope Benedict XVI , was above all a theologian . Pope John Paul II , before that , was originally an actor and a philosopher . But Francis trained as a scientist . One of his adages is : \u201c Facts are more important than ideas. \u201d The intersection of these two threads in Francis \u2019 life\u2014his sympathy for the poor and his insistence that reality comes before theory\u2014help account for how the United States and its unrestrained capitalism have come into the papal crosshairs .\nLike many Latin Americans , Pope Francis is ambivalent toward America . \u201c He combines both a sense of respect and a feeling of resentment at the economic and cultural dominance of his bigger neighbor , \u201d one senior member of the Roman Curia told me . As a young man , Bergoglio was schooled in the politics of Argentine President Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n . \u201c Peronism \u201d was a curious alliance of labor unions , the army and the church . It sought what Per\u00f3n called a \u201c third position \u201d between communism and capitalism . It favored authoritarian nationalism and looked to the state rather than the market for solutions ; Francis was much influenced by the latter .\nIn his later years , as archbishop of Buenos Aires , Francis saw firsthand the devastation wrought upon ordinary people by economic policies originating in Washington . During Argentina \u2019 s 2001 economic crisis , when half the population was plunged into poverty , the International Monetary Fund , World Bank and U.S. Treasury agreed to policies that imposed severe austerity on Argentina \u2019 s lower class . Six years later , Francis took the leading role in shaping the pro-poor , anti-colonial spirit of the Latin American church articulated by the region \u2019 s bishops at their seminal meeting in Aparecida , Brazil .\nPope Francis is no knee-jerk liberal . He has held the traditional Catholic line on issues like abortion , gay marriage and even contraception , yet he has radically shifted the focus of the Catholic Church away from sexual ethics onto the morality of money .\nThat became clear in the eco-encyclical he released this year , Laudato Si . To the horror of climate skeptics , it endorsed the worldwide scientific consensus that global warming is largely human-created . It was ironic that , before publication , Catholic Republican presidential candidates like Jeb Bush and Rick Santorum had been admonishing the pope that science is better left to scientists . That was exactly what Francis , the former chemist , thought he was doing by accepting the view of 97 percent of actively publishing climate scientists . For Francis , the source of the Earth \u2019 s degradation was clear : \u201c [ T ] he degree of human intervention , often in the service of business interests and consumerism , is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful , ever more limited and grey . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not Marxism . ...
