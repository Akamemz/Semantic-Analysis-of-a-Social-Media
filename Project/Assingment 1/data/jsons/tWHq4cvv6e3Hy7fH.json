And he has failed to say anything about Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem.\n\nSo whatever the intent, he appears to have sided with Israel on one of the most volatile issues in the peace process and prejudiced the final outcome of any talks.\n\nDoes this mean an explosion?\n\nThe Trump administration has also sided with Israel in its response to the deadly violence on the Gaza border.\n\nThe White House accused Gaza's Hamas leaders of \"intentionally and cynically\" provoking Israel in an attempt at \"gruesome propaganda\" but, unlike European countries, it did not call on the army to exercise restraint.\n\nHamas has been directing the weeks-long protest campaign by Palestinians frustrated with Israel's economic blockade of Gaza.\n\nAnalysts said it was a chance for the militant Islamist movement to shift the blame for its own poor performance in government.\n\nThe question now is whether the hundreds of casualties will trigger an uprising, or intifada, that spreads to the West Bank.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years\n\nThe Jerusalem decision itself did not do so and there are many reasons why the Gaza violence may not. That includes divisions in the Palestinian leadership and the high cost for Palestinians of a return to sustained conflict.\n\nBut it is a volatile situation fuelled by a sense of Palestinian hopelessness that could lead to further escalation.\n\nCrossing a red line?\n\nWhat seems more likely to me at the moment is a slower unravelling of the peace process framework which for the past 25 years has led to neither peace nor all-out war.\n\nDespite spasms of conflict, it has maintained certain fundamentals.\n\nThe Israelis have not annexed the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority continues security co-operation, in effect helping Israel police its own people.\n\nThe framework is held up by an American mediator that is seen by many as somewhat credible, if not neutral.\n\nEvery previous US administration has been pro-Israel but made some effort to understand and respond to the Palestinian narrative, says Mr Miller.\n\nThis one is so \"deeply ensconced\" in the Israeli narrative it has crossed a red line, he says.\n\nIf so, it will be difficult for it to keep propping up the framework, with unpredictable results.\n\nIt is true that key Arab countries seem more willing to sanction a settlement less favourable to the Palestinians than before because they want Israel as an ally against Iran.\n\nBut Mr Trump's decision on Jerusalem, and Israel's heavy-handed approach in Gaza, reduces their room for manoeuvre.",
