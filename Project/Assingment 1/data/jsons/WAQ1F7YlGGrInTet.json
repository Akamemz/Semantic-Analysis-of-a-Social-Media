    "content": "During World Wars I and II , the United States government assumed powers it could never have acquired in peacetime \u2014 powers such as the military draft , wage\u2010\u200band\u2010\u200bprice controls , rationing , close control of labor and production and astronomical tax rates . Constitutional restrictions on federal power were swiftly eroded .\nThat doesn \u2019 t tell us whether those wars should have been fought . It does mean that we should understand the consequences of war for our entire social order and thus go to war only when absolutely necessary .\nThird , the United States can no more police and plan the whole world than it can plan a national economy . Without a superpower threat to rally against , the political establishment wants us to deploy our military resources on behalf of democracy and self\u2010\u200bdetermination around the world and against such vague or decentralized threats as terrorism , drugs and environmental destruction . The military is designed to fight wars in defense of American liberty and sovereignty ; even the world \u2019 s largest bureaucracy is not well\u2010\u200bequipped to be policeman and social worker to the world .\nFourth , our Cold War allies have recovered from the destruction of World War II and are fully capable of defending themselves . The countries of the European Union have a collective population of more than 500 million , a gross domestic product of $ 18 trillion a year and nearly 2 million troops . They can defend Europe and deal with internal problems such as the conflict in Ukraine without U.S. assistance . South Korea has twice the population and 40 times the economic output of North Korea ; it doesn \u2019 t need our 29,000 troops to protect itself .\nFifth , the communications explosion means that the information imbalance between political leaders and citizens is much reduced . For all our vast intelligence network , presidents often watch world events unfolding on satellite news networks , along with all the rest of us . That means that presidents will find it more difficult to expect public deference on matters of foreign policy , so they should proceed cautiously in undertaking foreign commitments without popular support .\nDespite the constant warnings of war hawks , and the ongoing images of conflict on our screens , the world is safer than it \u2019 s ever been . And for the United States , the most secure power in world history , protected by two oceans and friendly neighbors , that \u2019 s especially true .\nThe first purpose of government is to protect the rights of citizens . We must maintain an adequate national defense , but we can defend the vital interests of the United States with a military budget about half the size of the one we have \u2014 if we reorient our foreign policy to one of self\u2010\u200bdefense and restraint , not global commitments to collective security agreements .\nLibertarians who propose to bring U.S. troops home and concentrate on the defense of the United States are sometimes accused of being isolationist . That \u2019 s a misconception . Libertarians are , in fact , confident and cosmopolitan . We look forward to a world bound together by free trade , global communications and cultural exchange . We support maintaining the world \u2019 s largest and most powerful military , by a wide margin , although not as big as the foreign\u2010\u200bpolicy establishment wants .\nMilitary intervention around the world costs Americans substantial blood and treasure and benefits them little . Although the world is growing closer together in many ways , it is inappropriate to view the whole world as a village in which everyone must pitch in to stop every fight . In a world with terrorism and nuclear weapons , it is better to keep military conflicts limited and regional rather than to escalate them through superpower involvement .",
