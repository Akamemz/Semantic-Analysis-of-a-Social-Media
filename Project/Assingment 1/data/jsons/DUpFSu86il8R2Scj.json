    "content": "Just days after their historic midterm victories , the Republican congressional leadership is sending out signals to the caucus that infighting and gridlock will not be tolerated.According to Politico , incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested he will not go along with conservative calls to use the debt ceiling as leverage for spending cuts , an insistence by tea party members which triggered the government shutdown last year . `` Emboldened by sweeping midterm election victories , Republican leaders are vowing not to repeat the errors of past years , when messy fiscal fights eroded public confidence in Washington and became the hallmark of the GOP-controlled House , '' Politico said . McConnell has already vowed that there will not be a government shutdown on his watch.And in his victory speech Tuesday night , he made it clear he would also be extending the olive branch to President Barack Obama , saying the GOP has a `` duty '' to work with the White House on issues they agree on . `` I 'm pretty familiar with our conference including the new members who are coming in , '' McConnell said , according to Politico . `` The vast majority of them do n't feel they were sent to Washington to fight all the time . `` House Speaker John Boehner is telling colleagues he plans to be a `` responsible leader , '' and that the party needs to be unified to take advantage of its political dominance , Politico reported.The leadership may also feel more justified in demanding loyalty from the conservative wing of the party , given that the victories from this election cycle were mainly the result of the party 's early backing of establishment candidates , some of whom are from moderate districts . `` What this election did is give us a working majority where we have at least 218 votes to pass a Republican agenda , and what I think will be a responsible Republican agenda , '' Ohio GOP Rep. Steve Stivers , a close ally of Boehner , told Politico . `` We 're not veering hard right , we 're playing it straight down the fairway , to use a Boehner-ism . `` Boehner and McConnell have already set out their legislative agenda , saying in a joint editorial that their top priority is to help the struggling middle class , and a first step will be passing many of the bills the House has already approved . `` Enacting such measures early in the new session will signal that the logjam in Washington has been broken , and help to establish a foundation of certainty and stability that both parties can build upon , '' they wrote.The leadership will also be aware that unity could be paramount to maintaining the Senate majority in 2016 , when a number of senators from blue and purple states are up for re-election , Politico reported .",
