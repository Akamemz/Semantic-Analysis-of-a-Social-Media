But over the past two weeks , it seems that his administration has taken policies that affect the Pentagon without keeping it in the loop .\nTake what happened right after Trump \u2019 s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last week . During a press conference , Trump vowed to end joint military drills with South Korea , catching the Defense Department almost , if not entirely , by surprise .\nAnd on Monday , Trump announced the creation of an entirely new military service \u2014 the space force . The problem is there was no official , Pentagon-approved plan to make one yet , which is why Trump immediately dispatched Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford , chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , to look into establishing the new service .\nAnd when speaking to reporters last Wednesday , Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis was obviously uncomfortable answering questions about what role , if any , the Pentagon may play in housing thousands of child migrants \u2014 seemingly trying to keep his department out of the political maelstrom .\nThis only adds to Trump \u2019 s complicated relationship with the military . Trump also surprised the Pentagon last summer by ordering a ban on transgender military service , withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal , and contradicting top defense officials by saying that he wants US troops out of Syria .\nBut the president and the Pentagon seem more out of sync now than ever , as NBC News reported first on Monday morning \u2014 and experts have some theories as to why .\nJohn Bolton took over as national security adviser in April , which means there may still be some growing pains . \u201c It \u2019 s not surprising that with a new National Security Council team there would be hiccups in communication , particularly if previously Mattis was closer to the president himself than [ former National Security Adviser ] H.R . McMaster , \u201d Loren Schulman , a defense expert at the Center for a New American Security think tank , told me .\nIt could also be that the defense secretary wants to avoid the spotlight and not convey the Pentagon \u2019 s priorities more forcefully in public , allowing others to dictate the national security agenda . \u201c Secretary Mattis has had a much lower profile , but that may well be his intent as he contemplates his own future , \u201d says Mark Groombridge , formerly a top Bolton adviser at the State Department and United Nations .\nDana White , the top DOD spokesperson , told me it was \u201c pure silliness \u201d to conclude Mattis is out of the president \u2019 s decision-making loop , the same response she gave to NBC News .\nWhatever the reason , it \u2019 s disconcerting to see the Pentagon caught off guard in a time of great uncertainty , especially as relations with North Korea enter a sensitive stage while there \u2019 s and turmoil on America \u2019 s southern border .\nThat , to put it mildly , is not the best way for the world \u2019 s greatest military to operate .\nTrump kicked off the tumultuous past two weeks with a striking statement in Singapore .\n\u201c We will stop the war games [ with South Korea ] which will save us a tremendous amount of money , \u201d Trump said a June 12 press conference after meeting with North Korea \u2019 s leader . \u201c Under the circumstances we are negotiating a comprehensive and complete deal . It is inappropriate to have war games . \u201d\nThat was a big announcement . America \u2019 s security relationship with South Korea is the backbone of their alliance , and joint military exercises are the most visible way for Washington to show its commitment to Seoul . That \u2019 s why one would expect the president and his team to work with the South Koreans to cancel the drills responsibly .\nBut that \u2019 s not what happened , as Seoul and the Pentagon had no idea Trump would make that statement . In fact , America \u2019 s 28,500 troops in South Korea were still preparing for a joint exercise in August . A spokesperson for the US military in South Korea told the New York Times on June 12 that they had \u201c received no updated guidance on execution or cessation of training exercises \u2014 to include this fall \u2019 s schedule Ulchi Freedom Guardian , \u201d referring to the drill \u2019 s name .\nAnd on June 18 , a week after Trump \u2019 s announcement , the Pentagon announced it would not hold the August exercise with South Korea . \u201c Consistent with President Trump \u2019 s commitment and in concert with our Republic of Korea ally , the United States military has suspended all planning for this August \u2019 s defensive \u2018 wargame , \u2019 \u201d White , the top Pentagon spokesperson , said in a statement . White also noted that both countries have yet to make any decisions about other joint exercises .\nOn that same day , Trump stunned the military and Congress by announcing his desire to create a space force . Should it materialize , the space force would become the sixth military service . It would centralize the armed force \u2019 s activities in space , which currently reside mostly with the Air Force , under a whole new military branch .\nThe US has not created a new military service since 1947 when Congress authorized the Air Force . Forming a new branch out of thin air would require tons of planning and bureaucratic reorganization \u2014 but that didn \u2019 t matter to the president .\nInstead , Trump assigned his top military adviser to figure out how to create the space force mere seconds after announcing his desire to establish it . Here \u2019 s the exchange during a space-related event at the White House last Monday :\nTRUMP : We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force \u2014 separate but equal . It is going to be something . So important . Gen. Dunford , if you would carry that assignment out , I would be very greatly honored , also . Where \u2019 s Gen. Dunford ? General ? Got it ? DUNFORD : We got it . TRUMP : Let \u2019 s go get it , General .\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal on June 22 , Trump made the stunning announcement after feeling that the Pentagon had stonewalled him for months . Trump had said since at least March he wanted the US to have a space force .\nBut Mattis , Dunford , and top Air Force officials all previously argued against creating the new military branch . Plus , the Pentagon studied the issue and effectively made the case that this \u201c will happen , but now is not the time , \u201d a source told the Journal .\nTrump , however , clearly wants the space force to become a thing sooner rather than later .\nIn another example of the increasing disconnect , last Wednesday Mattis had trouble answering questions about how the Pentagon might house around 20,000 child migrants on military bases . Government officials visited four military bases in the past two weeks to see if they could potentially keep the children .\nReporters wanted to know what that signaled . The testy exchange , as transcribed by Task & Purpose \u2019 s Jeff Schogol , is worth reading :\nREPORTER : HHS [ Department of Health and Human Services ] is looking at four US military bases in terms of housing the migrants\u2026 MATTIS : We \u2019 ll see what they come in with . We support DHS [ Department of Homeland Security ] and right now this is their lead and we \u2019 ll respond if requested . REPORTER : But would you allow the US military to house families or children in US military bases ? MATTIS : We have housed refugees . We have housed people thrown out of their homes by earthquakes and hurricanes . We do whatever is in the best interest of the country . REPORTER : There are a lot of questions about children being separated from their parents\u2026 MATTIS : You \u2019 re going to have to ask about the border and the situation [ inaudible ] the people responsible for it . I \u2019 m not going to chime in from the outside . There \u2019 s people responsible for it . Secretary Nielson [ sic ] , obviously , maintains close collaboration with us .

REPORTER : This has been going on for several weeks . So they have identified four bases\u2026 MATTIS : We support whatever they need .\nIf you watch the edited video of the press conference above , it \u2019 s noticeable just how uncomfortable Mattis is .\n\u201c His body language said it all , \u201d Groombridge , the former Bolton adviser , told me . \u201c He will salute and follow orders to provide shelter but wants absolutely nothing to do with the political controversy swirling around this issue . His constant referral of the issue back to Homeland Security and Health and Human Services is clear evidence of this fact . \u201d\nHowever , it could also be that Mattis was uncomfortable speaking to reporters on camera by himself \u2014 something he typically tries to avoid .\nIt \u2019 s hard to know , especially now , just how much influence Mattis has with the president . According to NBC News , Trump and Mattis went from speaking several times a day on the phone to the secretary finding out about major policy decisions after the fact .\nBut whatever Mattis wants to achieve , he and other top Pentagon officials will likely continue to try to persuade Trump quietly because what the president wants is not necessarily what the Pentagon recommends .\n\u201c I am fully convinced that both the secretary and Joint Chiefs chairman are defaulting to a very passive public affairs posture and active and substantive private policy posture where they are being heard , \u201d a former White House official told me .\nOf course , it seems hard to convince Trump of anything . \u201c I think perhaps [ Mattis ] has accepted the fact that no one in the administration is really able to stay in step with an unpredictable and unconventional boss , \u201d says the former official .\nPrivate consultation is one thing , but Mattis also doesn \u2019 t like explaining the Pentagon \u2019 s priorities much to the public .\nMattis has yet to conduct a press conference of his own in the Pentagon briefing room .
