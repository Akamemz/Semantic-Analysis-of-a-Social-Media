Clinton \u2019 s national lead in our polls-only forecast has gone from a peak of about 8.5 percentage points two weeks ago to 6.5 percentage points as of Sunday evening \u2014 that is , a 2-point gain for Trump over two weeks . Correspondingly , Trump \u2019 s chances of winning the election have improved from a low of 11 percent to 19 percent .

If Trump keeps gaining 1 percentage point a week , he \u2019 ll beat Clinton by a couple of percentage points on Nov. 8 . Hence , Clinton should probably not be picking out the White House drapes just yet . Continued gains may not be so easy for Trump , however . He \u2019 s still at only 37 or 38 percent in national polls that include third-party candidates . That might seem like an easy number to improve upon , but his favorability rating is only about 35 percent , meaning that he \u2019 s already relying on support from a few voters who don \u2019 t like him but may vote for him to prevent a Clinton presidency . Clinton also has some work to do . She \u2019 s at about 43 percent in national polls and in polls of key swing states \u2014 not enough to clinch victory , even if 6 to 10 percent of the vote eventually goes to third-party candidates , as appears increasingly likely .

It isn \u2019 t all that close \u2014 Clinton is up by around 6 percentage points as best as we can figure , a larger lead than Obama had at almost any point in 2012 or until the very end of the 2008 campaign . But it \u2019 s August , and the number of undecided voters is high , and so the outcome remains fairly uncertain .
