NCAA, striking down a federal law that blocks states from legalizing sports gambling under their own state laws. The ruling is a major victory for federalism, and has important implications that go beyond the issue of sports gambling.\n\nMurphy invalidates a provision of the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which mandates that states may not \"sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize by law or compact\" sports betting. A coalition of sports leagues, including the NCAA, the NBA, the NFL, and Major League Baseball, filed a lawsuit arguing that New Jersey's laws partially legalizing sports gambling within the state qualifies as \"authorization\" and thus violates PASPA. New Jersey argued that that PASPA violates the \"anti-commandeering\" principles of the Tenth Amendment. Under several longstanding Supreme Court precedents, the Tenth Amendment prevents the federal government from compelling the states to enforce federal law, including by forcing state legislatures to enact laws of their own. The Supreme Court majority ruled that PASPA is unconstitutional.\n\nMore:Winners & losers in Supreme Court sports betting decision: Vindication for Donald Trump?\n\nMore:Listen up Supreme Court: Warrantless tracking of smartphones violates our rights\n\nTo get around the anti-commandeering rule, the sports leagues and the Trump administration claimed that there is a distinction between commandeering and federal laws blocking \"affirmative authorization\" of gambling under state law. By this reasoning, PASPA is not \"commandeering\" because it does not prevent complete legalization of sports gambling. It only bans state laws that affirmatively authorize gambling in some way, as New Jersey supposedly does by restricting it to some types of locations and limiting the range of teams that gamblers can bet on. Writing for a 7-2 Supreme Court majority, Justice Samuel Alito correctly concluded that \u201cthis distinction is empty\u201d because laws banning affirmative \u201cauthorization\u201d still violate \"the basic principle \u2026 that Congress cannot issue direct orders to state legislatures.\u201d\n\nJustice Alito is right. The distinction between legalization and \"authorization\" makes little sense, because virtually any law that legalizes a previously banned activity, but does not completely abolish all restrictions on it, can be described as affirmative authorization.

But if it cannot rely on the backing of the states and their own laws, enforcing such federal prohibitions in dissenting states can be expensive and difficult. In practice, federal prohibition of gambling, drugs and other activities relies heavily on state cooperation and support.
