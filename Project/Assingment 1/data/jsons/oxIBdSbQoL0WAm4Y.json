    "content": "Many national Republican leaders pulled their support for Roy Moore , the Alabama Senate candidate , in the wake of allegations claiming he had inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls .\nThe Washington Post reported that four women accused Moore of initiating sexual contact with them in the late 1970s and early 1980s , when he was an assistant district attorney in his early 30s . One of the women , Leigh Corfman , told the newspaper that Moore had sexual contact with her when she was 14 . The age of consent in Alabama is 16 .\nSeveral additional women have since come forward to accuse Moore of sexually inappropriate behavior .\nMoore denied the allegations , saying in a statement obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the allegations are `` based on a lie supported by innuendo . ''\n`` It seems that in the political arena , to say that something is not true is simply not good enough . So let me be clear . I have never provided alcohol to minors , and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct , '' he said .\nMultiple Republican lawmakers called on Moore to step aside from the Dec. 12 special election . However , President Trump offered his endorsement for the embattled politician , and the Republican National Committee began supporting Moore after having previously cut its fundraising ties to him .\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president had no plans for an in-person appearance on Moore 's behalf .\nIn addition , the president previously signed off on a decision by the Republican National Committee to cut off support for Moore 's campaign .\nBut publicly , Trump unleashed his criticism on Democratic candidate Doug Jones instead of Moore .\n\u201c The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is weak on crime , weak on the border , bad for our military and our great vets , bad for our 2nd Amendment , and wants to [ raise ] taxes to the sky . Jones would be a disaster , \u201d Trump tweeted on Nov. 26 .\nAnd just over one week before the election , Trump said he needed Moore \u2019 s vote in the Senate when it comes to certain issues , such as immigration , gun rights and judicial appointments .\nTrump also encouraged his Twitter followers to vote for Moore on the morning of the election as he contended that Moore `` will always vote with us . ''\nVice President Mike Pence \u201c found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes , if true , this would disqualify anyone from serving in office , \u201d his press secretary , Alyssa Farah , has told reporters .\nWhile speaking to reporters , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , said he believes the women quoted in the Washington Post story . He urged Moore to step aside in light of the allegations .\nPreviously , McConnell said Moore should step aside if `` these allegations are true . ''\nCory Gardner , the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman , said he believes the women who have alleged Moore 's misconduct . In a statement , he encouraged the Senate to `` vote to expel '' Moore should he win the election next month .\n`` He does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate , '' Gardner , R-Colo. , said .\nA former backer of Moore , Sen. Mike Lee , R-Utah , pulled his endorsement from Moore after the allegations came to light .\n`` Having read the detailed description of the incidents , as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign , I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate , '' Lee said in a tweet .\nHe had also requested that Moore 's campaign no longer use his image .\n\u201c I \u2019 m horrified and if it \u2019 s true , he should step down immediately , \u201d Murkowski told reporters .\nShe reportedly also urged Sen. Luther Strange , who was appointed to fill Jeff Sessions \u2019 seat when he was tapped to become attorney general , to launch a write-in campaign . The deadline to take Moore off the ballot has passed .\n\u201c If they are true , then he should seriously think about stepping aside , '' Sen. Mike Rounds , R-S.D. , said .\n\u201c I find it deeply distrusting and troubling . It \u2019 s up to the governor and the folks of Alabama to make that decision as far as what the next steps are , '' Majority Whip John Cornyn , R-Texas , said . He later withdrew his endorsement of Moore .\n\u201c If they \u2019 re accurate , he absolutely should [ step aside ] , '' Tim Scott , of South Carolina , said .\nIn a tweet , Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , called for Moore to `` withdraw from the Senate race in Alabama . ''\nCollins wrote that she listened to Moore deny the allegations in a recent radio interview , but `` did not find his denials to be convincing . ''\nCollins ' most recent statement comes after she previously tweeted : `` If there is any truth at all to these horrific allegations , Roy Moore should immediately step aside as Senate candidate . ''\n`` I am pulling my endorsement and support for Roy Moore for U.S. Senate , '' said Sen. Steve Daines , R-Mont .\n`` The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying . He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of , '' Arizona Sen. John McCain said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a devastating nasty story , \u201d Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby told reporters . \u201c If it \u2019 s true , I don \u2019 t believe there \u2019 d be a place for him in the U.S. Senate . \u201d\nHe said that he did not vote for Moore when he sent in his absentee ballot but voted instead for a `` distinguished Republican write-in . ''\nLike other Republicans , Flake called on Moore to \u201c step aside \u201d from the election .\n`` Just to be clear . If the choice is between Roy Moore and a Democrat , I would run to the polling place to vote for the Democrat , '' Flake tweeted .\nHe \u2019 s said that \u201c Republicans to support Roy Moore over Doug Jones is political tribalism at its worst . \u201d\nFlake also tweeted a photo of a check made out to Jones for $ 100 with `` Country over Party '' written in the memo line .\nAlabama Sen. Luther Strange , who lost the special election primary to Roy Moore , called the allegations \u201c disturbing . \u201d\nIt is too late to take Moore off the ballot , but Strange has been encouraged to launch a write-in campaign .\n\u201c I think if what we read is true , and people are on the record so I assume it is , then he should step aside , \u201d Ohio Sen . Rob Portman said .\nSen. Ben Sasse , R-Neb. , called the Washington Post \u2019 s story `` heartbreaking . ''\nSasse also slammed the Republican National Committee for providing funds to Moore \u2019 s race .\n\u201c This is a bad decision and very sad day . I believe the women \u2013 and the RNC previously did too . What \u2019 s changed ? Or is the party just indifferent ? \u201d Sasse said on Twitter . \u201c This sends a terrible message to victims \u2018 it \u2019 s not that the party won \u2019 t believe you if you come forward . It might . But just doesn \u2019 t care . \u2019 \u201d\nThe senator than warned that if the National Republican Senatorial Committee decided to contribute to Moore , he would \u201c no longer be a donor to or fund-raiser for it . \u201d\n`` These are serious and troubling allegations , '' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , who previously endorsed Moore , said in a statement . `` If they are true , Judge Moore should immediately withdraw . However , we need to know the truth , and Judge Moore has the right to respond to these accusations . ''\nSen. Bill Cassidy , R-La. , officially withdrew his support from the candidate .\n`` Based on the allegations against Roy Moore , his response and what is known , I withdraw support , '' he said .\n`` I stand with the Majority Leader on this . These are serious and disturbing accusations , and while the decision is now in the hands of the people of Alabama , I believe Luther Strange is an excellent alternative , '' Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , tweeted .\nBut a week before the election , Hatch said Trump didn \u2019 t have another choice but to endorse Moore , Bloomberg reported . He also said that \u201c many of the things he allegedly did are decades ago . So it \u2019 s hard to \u2013 that \u2019 s a decision that has to be made by the people in that state . \u201d\n\u201c If they make that decision , who are we to question them ? \u201d Hatch said .\n\u201c We 'll probably never know for sure exactly what happened , '' Sen. Pat Toomey , R-Pa. , said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . ''\n`` But \u2026 I think the accusations have more credibility than the denial . I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside . \u201d\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham took to Twitter to say Moore should step aside in the Alabama Senate race .\n`` In light of the most recent allegations and the cumulative effect of others , I believe [ Moore ] would be doing himself , the state , the GOP , and the country a service by stepping aside , '' Graham said . `` If he continues this will not end well for Mr . Moore . ''\nHe has also bemoaned Trump \u2019 s attempt \u201c to throw a lifeline to \u201d Moore .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , said if the allegations are true , they would disqualify Moore from the special election .\n\u201c These allegations are disqualifying if true . Anyone who would do this to a child has no place in public office , let alone the United States Senate , \u201d Ryan said in a statement .\n`` I would say unless he can prove his innocence , the burden is now on him within the next day or so , I believe he has to step down . He owes it to himself , he owes it to the state and and he owes it to the U.S. Senate , '' New York Rep. Peter King said after the allegations came out .\nIn a tweet , Rep. Lee Zeldin , R-N.Y. , called for that `` creepy Roy Moore dude '' to step aside from the campaign .\n`` It 's about that time for that creepy Roy Moore dude to exit stage left . He should step aside & let someone take his spot on the ballot who does n't prey upon young teenage girls as a grown man , '' he said .\nOhio Gov . John Kasich said on Twitter that he \u2019 s \u201c long opposed \u201d Moore and called on him to step aside from the race as well .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve long opposed Roy Moore [ and ] his divisive viewpoints . The actions described make him unfit for office . The GOP must not support him . He should step aside , \u201d Kasich said .\nMitt Romney , the 2012 Republican presidential nominee , slammed Moore on Twitter .\n\u201c Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions , not elections . I believe Leigh Corfman , \u201d the former governor said . \u201c Her account is too serous to ignore . Moore is unfit for office and should step aside . \u201d\n`` Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation . Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes . No vote , no majority is worth losing our honor , our integrity , '' Romney said in another tweet on Dec. 4 .\nFormer Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov . Jeb Bush said Moore should step down in light of the allegations .\n`` This is not a question of innocence or guilt like in a criminal proceeding ; this is a question of what \u2019 s right and what \u2019 s wrong . Acknowledging that you \u2019 re dating teenagers when you \u2019 re 32 years old as assistant state attorney is wrong . It \u2019 s just plain wrong , '' he told CNBC , adding that he agreed with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who said earlier Monday that Moore should `` step aside . ''\n`` We need to stand for basic principles , and decency has to be one of those , '' Bush added . `` In the really poisonous political environment we have right now , one of the rules I think has to apply is that when you attack somebody on the other party , and the other team for doing something wrong , when it happens on your team , you have an obligation I think to speak out as well . ''\n`` There 's a special place in hell for people who prey on children . I 've yet to see a valid explanation , and I have no reason to doubt the victims ' accounts , '' Ivanka Trump told the Associated Press .\nWhile she didn \u2019 t name Moore , former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \u2013 who is from Alabama \u2013 encouraged voters to \u201c take a stand for our core principles and for what is right . \u201d\n\u201c These critical times require us to come together to reject bigotry , sexism and intolerance , \u201d Rice said in a statement to AL.com .\n`` It is imperative for Americans to remain focused on our priorities and not give way to side shows and antics . I know that Alabamans need an independent voice in Washington .
