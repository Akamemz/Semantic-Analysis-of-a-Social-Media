Mr. Obama is proving the truism that the executive branch will use any power it is given and very likely abuse it . That is one reason we have long argued that the Patriot Act , enacted in the heat of fear after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks by members of Congress who mostly had not even read it , was reckless in its assignment of unnecessary and overbroad surveillance powers .\nBased on an article in The Guardian published Wednesday night , we now know that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency used the Patriot Act to obtain a secret warrant to compel Verizon \u2019 s business services division to turn over data on every single call that went through its system . We know that this particular order was a routine extension of surveillance that has been going on for years , and it seems very likely that it extends beyond Verizon \u2019 s business division . There is every reason to believe the federal government has been collecting every bit of information about every American \u2019 s phone calls except the words actually exchanged in those calls .",
