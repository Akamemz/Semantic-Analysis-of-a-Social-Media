Let\u2019s take a look at what happens to the money we pay the IRS, and how much we each personally spend.\n\n\n\nWhere the Government Gets Its Money\n\nAbout half of the federal government\u2019s money comes from income taxes. You also probably pay state and local taxes of various kinds, but we\u2019re not calculating those today. Another 33 percent comes from payroll taxes\u2014more about those in a minute.

Only about half of these come out of your salary; your employer pays the other half. It\u2019s sort of \u201cyour\u201d money, because if this tax didn\u2019t exist, your employer would be able to add that money to your wages.

When you add up social security, medicare, and unemployment insurance, payroll taxes total 15.3 percent of your salary, or a little less than that if you make above $118,500.\n\nHere\u2019s where your payroll taxes go. If you make $50,000, roughly the median household income in the US, you pay:\n\n$6,200 to Social Security\n\n$1,450 to Medicare\n\n$420 to unemployment insurance.\n\nNext, let\u2019s consider your income tax.
