    "content": "As hundreds of thousands of independent creators across the country are aware , there is a much-anticipated bill on the horizon called the CASE Act , legislation that they are counting on Congress to pass as quickly as possible . The CASE Act , now co-sponsored by more than 100 members of Congress , proposes the creation of a \u201c small claims tribunal \u201d within the United States Copyright Office where creators can defend and protect their copyrighted works . Why is something like this necessary ? Because individual creators such as visual journalists going to federal court to defend their work against copyright infringement is cost prohibitive , leaving those creators with a right but no remedy .\nDespite the fact that the CASE Act has been discussed for years , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) announced only recently its interest in amending the bill under the guise of concern regarding due process and freedom of speech . The organization that I represent \u2013 the National Press Photographers Association ( NPPA ) \u2013 serves as the Voice of Visual Journalists and , since 1946 , has advocated for freedom of the press and speech . As someone who takes these rights and freedoms very seriously , I am disheartened that the ACLU has framed its concerns under such pretexts . Furthermore , it \u2019 s discouraging that it chose to wait until the 11th hour to intercede versus participating in a meaningful dialogue with the Copyright Office , legislative staff members , creators , and other stakeholders that have been working on the bill for the past decade .\nWhile it \u2019 s appreciated that the ACLU acknowledges independent creators face a daunting problem regarding protecting their works , and while it doesn \u2019 t oppose the idea of creating a small claims process , the concerns it \u2019 s voicing about the bill \u2013 most of which have absolutely nothing to do with free speech or due process , and more to do with its donors \u2019 wallets \u2013 are frustratingly dishonest . Under the CASE Act , anyone notified of an infringement claim can simply and easily opt-out if they don \u2019 t want to participate in the process outlined by the bill . Free speech and due process are about giving people the right to choose . To speak or not to speak . To participate or not to participate . That is exactly what the CASE Act does .\nEveryone would benefit if the ACLU and its ilk spent just a small portion of its time , money and energy attempting to inform and educate the infringers whose rights they are so concerned about versus creating public hysteria regarding the CASE Act through misinformation and fear-mongering , while demonizing anyone with the audacity to enforce their copyrighted works .\nAs the NPPA pointed out in comments to the Copyright Office as far back as 2012 , our images and videos serve as a valuable tool to help viewers understand the world around them . We believe that freedom of speech is an inalienable right for journalists , who dedicate their time and skills to cover events that are important to viewers on a community , city , state , and national level . At times , they even put themselves at risk to actively seek out the truth and provide honest and transparent reporting . We respect creators in the field of journalism , and we want to ensure that they get access to the rights they need to remain solvent .\nBut as media outlets continue to trim staffing , an unprecedented number of our members have found themselves working as independent contractors , making a living by licensing their images and footage . And as more creators become owners and operators of small businesses , copyright infringement has continued to take a debilitating toll on those who must police infringements while simultaneously seeking and fulfilling photographic assignments .\nIt \u2019 s an untenable situation for creators to face , to say the least , and it shouldn \u2019 t continue . The bottom line is that anyone notified of a claim can simply and easily opt-out if they do not wish to participate in this copyright infringement process . It \u2019 s one thing for the ACLU to advocate for free speech and quite another to promote a free-for-all ( in the literal and figurative sense ) when it comes to copyrighted works .\nTo help visual creators ( and all creators and artists who work hard to make a living ) get a fair shot , I respectfully urge everyone with decision making power to disregard the last minute and unsubstantiated concerns raised by the ACLU , and pass the CASE Act in order to provide a viable remedy to copyright infringement .\nMickey H.
