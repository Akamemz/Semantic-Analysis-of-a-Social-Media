But Ms. Mikell and 42 coworkers were recently and abruptly laid off from their jobs at Lighthouse for the Blind in New Orleans because of a little-known change in federal procurement rules that encourages military forces in Afghanistan to buy from manufacturers and brokers in Central Asia .\nThe change was intended to provide a lift to allies \u2019 depressed economies , but critics cite a lack of transparency and say the new procurement initiative is costing American jobs .\n\u201c The fact is , the people feeling the impact are the most underemployed people in our country , \u201d said Renee Vidrine , president of Lighthouse for the Blind , who said the changes break both the intent and the letter of the law .\nHer organization has lost at least $ 14 million in revenue as military orders for mess trays went elsewhere , she said .\nOther organizations for the blind and disabled have also been hit hard , and AbilityOne officials have privately registered their concerns with the administration .\n\u201c They want to work , \u201d said Erin McQuade Wright , vice president for development at Lighthouse . \u201c That \u2019 s the heart of our mission . We don \u2019 t want to rely on handouts or philanthropy for all our support ; we want to be able to generate our own revenue to help support our programs , but we can \u2019 t do that if the law is not being followed .\nThe Defense Department changed its guidelines last year to encourage some military operations to use local suppliers . Following the new rules , the General Services Administration ( GSA ) created a catalog of products that Afghan and other countries \u2019 manufacturers would be able to make for U.S. military forces there .\nBut many of those items historically had been bought from AbilityOne nonprofits , including the mess trays that are Lighthouse \u2019 s biggest seller . Officials at Lighthouse say they understand the reason behind the initiative but take issue with how GSA has implemented the program , saying organizations for the blind and disabled have been hit disproportionately .\nThe new rules have steered tens of millions of dollars away from U.S. organizations to companies in the Central Asian region . Who those companies are , however , remains shrouded .\nJay Scoggin , a vice president of program support for TWI , the private company now overseeing the Central Asian States Procurement Initiative , declined to provide a list of companies providing products in the region , but said they have a thorough vetting process for those they choose .\nHe said in a phone interview that he understands the frustrations of AbilityOne organizations , but said the decisions are \u201c really a GSA issue . \u201d\nJackeline Stewart , a GSA spokeswoman , said the agency is working to help AbilityOne and its supplier base \u201c identify and pursue untapped markets . \u201d\n\u201c GSA is strongly committed to maintaining its partnership with AbilityOne without compromising support for the Department of Defense \u2019 s mission , \u201d she said .\nCommission spokesman George Selby told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 they support the Obama administration \u2019 s decisions , including the new Defense Department directive that has sent business overseas , \u201c which has been determined to be in our national interest . \u201d\n\u201c That said , the commission is sensitive to the impact the initiative is having on some local nonprofit agencies and their employees , and is working to mitigate that situation to the extent possible , \u201d Mr. Selby said .\nMr. Scoggin said he understands the frustration of AbilityOne affiliates and that nobody wants to see revenue drop at the nonprofits supplying products , but said business was going to decline anyway with the drawdown of troops .\n\u201c The contract was specifically for local sources in Central Asia , \u201d he said . \u201c And that \u2019 s what TWI \u2019 s requirements were under the contract , so that \u2019 s what we did . \u201d\nThe company issued a press release in May saying its logistics hub in Kazakhstan had saved more than $ 10 million in transportation costs .\nBut Ms. Vidrine said those savings are due to the U.S. military securing distribution routes , making shipping more affordable .\nShe said the lack of transparency over which Central Asian suppliers are getting American taxpayers \u2019 money is troubling . The GSA , in reply to an open records request from Lighthouse officials , said it doesn \u2019 t require the company now overseeing the procurement initiative to audit suppliers or supplies in the region .\nIn an email , she questioned why GSA would allow for taxpayer dollars to be \u201c wrapped up in a large international purchasing program without monitoring compliance and instead trust an international company to self-monitor their compliance ? \u201d she said .\nMs. Vidrine also said the new procurement rules set a bad precedent for future wars .\n\u201c Should we be involved in another conflict over there , they could easily do this again unless we find a way to stop the precedent from being set , \u201d she said .\nSome lawmakers on Capitol Hill have taken an interest in the impact of the government \u2019 s procurement policies on AbilityOne affiliates .\nEarlier this month Sen.
