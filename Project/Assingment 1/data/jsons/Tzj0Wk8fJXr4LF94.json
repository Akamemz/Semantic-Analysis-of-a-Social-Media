Moreover , union political spending now exceeds direct donations :\n`` The usual measure of unions ' clout encompasses chiefly what they spend supporting federal candidates through their political-action committees , which are funded with voluntary contributions , and lobbying Washington , which is a cost borne by the unions ' own coffers . These kinds of spending , which unions report to the Federal Election Commission and to Congress , totaled $ 1.1 billion from 2005 through 2011 , according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .\nThe unions ' reports to the Labor Department capture an additional $ 3.3 billion that unions spent over the same period on political activity .\nThe costs reported to the Labor Department range from polling fees , to money spent persuading union members to vote a certain way , to bratwursts to feed Wisconsin workers protesting at the state capitol last year . Much of this kind of spending comes not from members ' contributions to a PAC but directly from unions ' dues-funded coffers . There is no requirement that unions report all of this kind of spending to the Federal Election Commission , or FEC . ''\n`` Laurence E. Gold , counsel to the AFL-CIO , said the Labor Department reports show that `` unions by law are the most transparent institutions about their electoral spending . ''\nOf course , the article also notes the only reason we have this new information is because of disclosure requirements put in place by the Bush administration :\n`` The new figures come from a little-known set of annual reports to the Labor Department in which local unions , their national parents and labor federations have been required to detail their spending on politics and lobbying since 2005 . ''\nAs I detailed in The Weekly Standard last year , unions have lobbied the Obama administration to roll back a number of Bush administration transparency requirements for unions :\n`` The Bush administration was arguably the first to require unions to make meaningful financial disclosure , and their leaders to report conflicts of interest . The change had tangible effects . An unassuming Safeway bakery clerk was elected head of a powerful Denver grocers ' union in 2009 after she revealed that the union 's influential leader had put two relatives on salary for six figures and was using union dues to support a lavish lifestyle that included hefty bar tabs and NFL tickets . The corrupt union boss 's ouster was made possible because the Bush Labor Department for the first time had mandated itemized expenses and staff salaries on the LM-2 union financial disclosure form .\nThat might be the first and last union election , however , where financial transparency plays a decisive role . Since then , Obama 's labor secretary Hilda Solis has rolled back Bush administration LM-2 transparency requirements and stopped enforcing the requirement that union bosses disclose on form LM-30 whether they 're being paid on the side by companies doing business with the union .
