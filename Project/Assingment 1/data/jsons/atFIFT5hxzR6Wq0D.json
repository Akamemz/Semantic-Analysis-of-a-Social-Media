Many Democrats are demanding that the measure be amended so it doesn \u2019 t kill the deal before it can be finalized by a June 30 deadline . So the onus is on Republicans to work with Democrats \u2014 particularly if they want to assemble a 67-vote veto-proof majority \u2014 although it \u2019 s not clear exactly what legislative changes would preserve the complex and still-evolving agreement .\nIndependent Maine Sen.

Corker said he \u2019 s open to changing the bill , although he \u2019 s going to have to balance Democratic demands with hawks in his own party who would prefer to scuttle the agreement .\nIt may be late April or even May before Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) can bring the Iran bill to the floor .
