It 's a cop in Philadelphia , swinging his baton into protestors , the Atlanta police needlessly tasing two college students , the NYC cops beating a bicyclist , and dozens of cases where police lied about what they 'd done until bodycams or cellphone cameras revealed the truth .\nNone of this justifies looting , arson , and violence against other cops .\nPolicing is the rare profession given where employees are given a legal right to use deadly force . Most officers use that power responsibly .\nBut America has 800,000 cops . If just a fraction is racist or sadistic , that 's a lot of racist and sadistic bullies .\n`` The problem is repeat offenders . The system does n't fire those cops , '' says Washington Post columnist Radley Balko . `` The job of a union is to protect the interest of its members , really at any cost .

They must make split-second decisions and act as peacekeepers, baby sitters, marriage counselors, and more. They deal with people at the worst time of those people's lives. It may be why officers have a high suicide rate.\n\n\"Unions are there for a reason,\" says Larry Cosme, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. \"You have to protect these men and women.\"\n\nAfter two New York City cops drove into a crowd of protesters, I asked Cosme to justify that.\n\n\"Crowds are throwing bricks at them!

So you try to get out of the situation!\"\n\nHe added, \"The police should police themselves.\"\n\n\"But you don't,\" I said. \"They're not held accountable. Especially union officers. They do it again and again.

Where cops are not unionized, says Balko, \"there's no shortage of police officers.\"\n\nPolice unions also make police departments harder to manage.\n\nIn crime-ridden Camden, New Jersey, union cops took so much sick time and family leave that, most days, nearly 30 percent of the force just didn't show up. So, Camden fired all of them.\n\nCamden rehired some, but only those willing to go along with new rules that made it easier to fire and discipline.\n\nThe result: Murder went down, and Camden saved money.\n\nPer-officer costs dropped from $182,168 to $99,605. That allowed Camden to double the size of its force from \"bare bones\" to \"near the highest police presence of any city.\"\n\nExtra police allow for community policing\u2014more people walk the beat, talking to residents.\n\nUnfortunately, today's protesters rarely mention police unions.

Police presence does reduce crime.\n\nBut we need cops who can be held responsible for their actions.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2020 BY JFS PRODUCTIONS INC.\n\nDISTRIBUTED BY CREATORS.COM",
