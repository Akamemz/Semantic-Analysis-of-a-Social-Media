    "content": "( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - Four months before a swarm of drones and missiles crippled the world \u2019 s biggest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia , Iranian security officials gathered at a heavily fortified compound in Tehran .\nThe group included the top echelons of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , an elite branch of the Iranian military whose portfolio includes missile development and covert operations .\nThe main topic that day in May : How to punish the United States for pulling out of a landmark nuclear treaty and re-imposing economic sanctions on Iran , moves that have hit the Islamic Republic hard .\nWith Major General Hossein Salami , leader of the Revolutionary Guards , looking on , a senior commander took the floor .\n\u201c It is time to take out our swords and teach them a lesson , \u201d the commander said , according to four people familiar with the meeting .\nHard-liners in the meeting talked of attacking high-value targets , including American military bases .\nYet , what ultimately emerged was a plan that stopped short of direct confrontation that could trigger a devastating U.S. response . Iran opted instead to target oil installations of America \u2019 s ally , Saudi Arabia , a proposal discussed by top Iranian military officials in that May meeting and at least four that followed .\nThis account , described to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by three officials familiar with the meetings and a fourth close to Iran \u2019 s decision making , is the first to describe the role of Iran \u2019 s leaders in plotting the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Aramco , Saudi Arabia \u2019 s state-controlled oil company .\nThese people said Iran \u2019 s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved the operation , but with strict conditions : Iranian forces must avoid hitting any civilians or Americans .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 was unable to confirm their version of events with Iran \u2019 s leadership . A Revolutionary Guards spokesman declined to comment . Tehran has steadfastly denied involvement .\nAlireza Miryousefi , spokesman for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York , rejected the version of events the four people described to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . He said Iran played no part in the strikes , that no meetings of senior security officials took place to discuss such an operation , and that Khamenei did not authorize any attack .\n\u201c No , no , no , no , no , and no , \u201d Miryousefi said to detailed questions from \u2588\u2588\u2588 on the alleged gatherings and Khamenei \u2019 s purported role .\nThe Saudi government communications office did not respond to a request for comment .\nThe U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon declined to comment . A senior Trump administration official did not directly comment on \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 findings but said Tehran \u2019 s \u201c behavior and its decades-long history of destructive attacks and support for terrorism are why Iran \u2019 s economy is in shambles . \u201d\nYemen \u2019 s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels , at the center of a civil war against Saudi-backed forces , claimed responsibility for the assault on Saudi oil facilities . That declaration was rebuffed by U.S. and Saudi officials , who said the sophistication of the offensive pointed to Iran .\nThe kingdom is Iran \u2019 s principal regional rival and a petroleum giant whose production is crucial to the world economy . It is an important U.S. security partner . But its war on Yemen , which has killed thousands of civilians , and the brutal murder of Washington-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents last year , have strained its relations with U.S. lawmakers . There was no groundswell of support in Congress for military intervention to aid the Saudis after the attack .\nThe 17-minute strike on two Aramco installations by 18 drones and three low-flying missiles revealed the vulnerability of the Saudi oil company , despite billions spent by the kingdom on security . Fires erupted at the company \u2019 s Khurais oil installation and at the Abqaiq oil processing facility , the world \u2019 s largest .\nThe attack temporarily halved Saudi Arabia \u2019 s oil production and knocked out 5 % of the world \u2019 s oil supply . Global crude prices spiked .\nThe assault prompted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to accuse Iran of an \u201c act of war. \u201d In the aftermath , Tehran was hit with additional U.S. sanctions . The United States also launched cyber attacks against Iran , U.S. officials told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe Islamic Republic has blamed \u201c thugs \u201d linked to the United States and other regional adversaries for orchestrating street demonstrations that have rocked Iran since mid-November , when the government hiked fuel prices .\nSpeaking at a televised , pro-government rally in Tehran on Monday , Salami , the Revolutionary Guards chief commander , warned Washington against any further escalation of tensions : \u201c We have shown patience towards the hostile moves of America , the Zionist regime ( Israel ) and Saudi Arabia against Iran ... but we will destroy them if they cross our red lines . \u201d\nThe plan by Iranian military leaders to strike Saudi oil installations developed over several months , according to the official close to Iran \u2019 s decision making .\n\u201c Details were discussed thoroughly in at least five meetings and the final go ahead was given \u201d by early September , the official said .\nAll of those meetings took place at a secure location inside the southern Tehran compound , three of the officials told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . They said Khamenei , the supreme leader , attended one of the gatherings at his residence , which is also inside that complex .\nOther attendees at some of those meetings included Khamenei \u2019 s top military advisor , Yahya Rahim-Safavi , and a deputy of Qasem Soleimani , who heads the Revolutionary Guards \u2019 foreign military and clandestine operations , the three officials said . Rahim-Safavi could not be reached for comment .\nAmong the possible targets initially discussed were a seaport in Saudi Arabia , an airport and U.S. military bases , the official close to Iran \u2019 s decision making said . The person would not provide additional details .\nThose ideas were ultimately dismissed over concerns about mass casualties that could provoke fierce retaliation by the United States and embolden Israel , potentially pushing the region into war , the four people said .\nThe official close to Iran \u2019 s decision making said the group settled on the plan to attack Saudi Arabia \u2019 s oil installations because it could grab big headlines , inflict economic pain on an adversary and still deliver a strong message to Washington .\n\u201c Agreement on Aramco was almost reached unanimously , \u201d the official said . \u201c The idea was to display Iran \u2019 s deep access and military capabilities . \u201d\nThe attack was the worst on Middle East oil facilities since Saddam Hussein , the late Iraqi strongman , torched Kuwait \u2019 s oil fields during the 1991 Gulf crisis .\nU.S .
