    "content": "Conservative commentator Ann Coulter had a warning for Republicans , who said they could work with Clinton : you \u2019 re traitors . In an interview with The Washington Examiner , they mention Rep. Steve King \u2019 s remarks while on the stump , where he said that he could work with Hillary Clinton , though he \u2019 s definitely voting for Trump in the general come November :\nAny Republican who says he can work with Hillary Clinton is a traitor to the nation , '' she said . `` It 's finished . '' Coulter , author of the new book In Trump We Trust : E Pluribus Awesome ! , told the Examiner the U.S. and the GOP are both `` over '' if Clinton wins . `` They 're whistling past the grave yard , '' she said . `` It 's not just the GOP , it 's the country . It 's over . It was fun while it lasted but the country is finished . She and [ vice presidential nominee ] Tim Kaine have vowed to push through amnesty . \u2026 You grant amnesty , there will be a rush for a border . \u2026 It 's over . It 's over if she 's elected . \u2026 Go to a Cubs game and see how many people are in the stands because when you ca n't win , nobody cares anymore . ''\nWell , there may not be amnesty , but Trump does seem open to supporting earned legal status , illegals paying back taxes , and deporting ones with criminal records . You know , what Jeb Bush was advocating when he was running for president . It \u2019 s no shock that Coulter is unhappy with Trump \u2019 s possible pivot on immigration , an issue that catapulted him to frontrunner status and eventually nabbed him the Republican nomination . She said such a move would be a mistake . Still , if Trump loses , I doubt members on the Hill will worry about the wrath of Ann Coulter .\nFrankly , I can see some outreach here . It \u2019 s not totally insane to work with the president on issues where you find agreement . I would be more vexed at those Republicans who have endorsed Clinton this cycle .
