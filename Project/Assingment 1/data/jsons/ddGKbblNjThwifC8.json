    "content": "It being the holiday season and all , the time feels right for a bit of unbridled optimism . 2015 has just begun , which means it has n't had an opportunity to disappoint , and is therefore a ripe receptacle for some of my ( mostly ) irrational political hopes . With the full realization that some ( or most , or all ) of these will not come to pass and that I 'm likely just setting myself up for sadness and mockery , here 's a short list of things I hope will happen in the next year .\nI like Bernie Sanders . Vermont \u2019 s independent senator comes off as affable and engaging , and he has a pleasingly down-to-earth frumpiness that contrasts with the perma-tanned , hair-gelled , forever-TV-ready facades of many of his colleagues . He \u2019 s been laying the groundwork for a 2016 presidential campaign , though up to this point he \u2019 s been deliberately cagey about whether he \u2019 d run as an Independent or a Democrat \u2013 or if he \u2019 ll actually do it .\nI hope he does . I think the New Yorker \u2019 s Ryan Lizza got it right when he wrote that Sanders is \u201c the Democratic Party \u2019 s Ron Paul : his chance of winning would be infinitesimal , but his presence in the race and his passion about a few key issues would expose vulnerabilities in the front-runner \u2019 s record and policies. \u201d In Sanders \u2019 case , that means a relentless focus on kitchen-table economic issues and income inequality , and it looks like he \u2019 s finally ready to step up and get in the other candidates \u2019 faces about their records on economic issues and ties to Wall Street . \u201c The Clinton Administration worked arm in arm with Alan Greenspan \u2013 who is , on economic matters , obviously , an extreme right-wing libertarian \u2013 on deregulating Wall Street , and that was a total disaster , \u201d Sanders told Lizza .\nAnd that \u2019 s a good thing ! Hillary Clinton is heavily favored to waltz away with the nomination , and more than a few Democrats are hoping for a quiet , uneventful primary that will allow the nominee to rest easy while the Republicans duke it out amongst themselves . But coronations are dull affairs . Arguments are interesting and help to sharpen policy positions while exposing and ironing out contradictions . Sanders would be a refreshing counter-establishment antidote to the slate of would-be Democratic nominees who stand against him .\nEarlier this month , the National Center for Health Statistics released a big batch of data on the status of health insurance coverage in the country . Per NCHS , the uninsured rate in the country has plummeted over the past year , marking the largest drop since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid during the Johnson administration .\nThe Affordable Care Act , for all the controversy surrounding it , is working , and the surge of people signing up for coverage during the second open enrollment period will likely push the uninsured rate down even further heading into 2015 . Costs are being contained , more insurers are participating in the exchanges , employer coverage is remaining steady \u2013 these are all good things . There is , obviously , some bad that comes with the good ( no legislation is perfect , and not everyone can be a winner ) , but on balance the ACA is getting it done .\nHovering over all of this is a big , black-robed cloud of uncertainty .

Vermont\u2019s independent senator comes off as affable and engaging, and he has a pleasingly down-to-earth frumpiness that contrasts with the perma-tanned, hair-gelled, forever-TV-ready facades of many of his colleagues.

I think the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza got it right when he wrote that Sanders is \u201cthe Democratic Party\u2019s Ron Paul: his chance of winning would be infinitesimal, but his presence in the race and his passion about a few key issues would expose vulnerabilities in the front-runner\u2019s record and policies.\u201d In Sanders\u2019 case, that means a relentless focus on kitchen-table economic issues and income inequality, and it looks like he\u2019s finally ready to step up and get in the other candidates\u2019 faces about their records on economic issues and ties to Wall Street. \u201cThe Clinton Administration worked arm in arm with Alan Greenspan \u2013 who is, on economic matters, obviously, an extreme right-wing libertarian \u2013 on deregulating Wall Street, and that was a total disaster,\u201d Sanders told Lizza.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a good thing!

But coronations are dull affairs. Arguments are interesting and help to sharpen policy positions while exposing and ironing out contradictions. Sanders would be a refreshing counter-establishment antidote to the slate of would-be Democratic nominees who stand against him.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSo run, Bernie, run.\n\nThat Obamacare Won\u2019t Be Gutted\n\nEarlier this month, the National Center for Health Statistics released a big batch of data on the status of health insurance coverage in the country. Per NCHS, the uninsured rate in the country has plummeted over the past year, marking the largest drop since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid during the Johnson administration.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, for all the controversy surrounding it, is working, and the surge of people signing up for coverage during the second open enrollment period will likely push the uninsured rate down even further heading into 2015.

The court already functions as an unelected, unaccountable and highly politicized super-legislature through which all controversial legislation must pass, which is upsetting enough. To blow a giant hole in the law would, in the words of the decidedly non-liberal Wall Street Journal editorial board, inflict \u201can immediate refugee crisis\u201d among health insurance customers.\n\nThat\u2019s the sort of chaos on regular Americans that responsible agents of government are supposed to avert.\n\nThat Benghazi Will Fade Away\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBenghazi has become the sort of scandal in which the hunt for scandalous information (and the assumption, against all evidence, that such information exists) is the only thing keeping it alive.
