'' The current headline now reads , `` Donald Trump seems to connect President Obama to Orlando shooting . ''\n`` We changed the headline shortly after it posted to more properly reflect what Trump said . We did so on our own ; the Trump campaign never contacted us about it , '' Post Vice President for Communications Kristine Coratti Kelly told NPR .\nIn the story , the Post quoted a Fox News interview from Monday morning in which Trump said that Obama `` either is not tough , not smart , or he 's got something else in mind '' in his refusal to mention the words `` radical Islamic terrorism '' following the mass shooting at an Orlando gay nightclub that killed 49 people early Sunday morning .\nThis headline , however , is not the first Post item that has gotten under Trump 's skin . Reporter David Farenthold pressed Trump for details about donations he promised to make to veterans groups after a January fundraiser . And only after that reporting did Trump donate the $ 1 million he had promised and already said he had donated . Trump held a press conference to reveal that he had donated the money and called Farenthold a `` nasty guy . ''\nTrump has also alleged that Post owner Jeff Bezos was using the newspaper to protect Amazon , which he also owns , from higher taxes . He offered no evidence for that claim . In a statement explaining why he banned the Post , one of the most influential newspapers in the country , Trump 's campaign repeated that accusation .\n`` We no longer feel compelled to work with a publication which has put its need for 'clicks ' above journalistic integrity , '' the Republican 's campaign said in a statement . `` They have no journalistic integrity and write falsely about Mr. Trump . Mr. Trump does not mind a bad story , but it has to be honest . ''\nIn his own statement , Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said the newspaper was `` proud of our coverage '' and would n't relent in questioning Trump :\n`` Donald Trump 's decision to revoke The Washington Post 's press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press .

I 'm not going to change . ''\n`` Donald Trump misunderstands \u2014 or , more likely , simply opposes \u2014 the role a free press plays in a democratic society , '' Thomas Burr , the National Press Club president , said after that contentious press conference . `` Reporters are supposed to hold public figures accountable .
