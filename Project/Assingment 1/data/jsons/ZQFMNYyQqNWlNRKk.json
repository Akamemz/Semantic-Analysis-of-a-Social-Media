    "content": "Some of the biggest Republican donors , who collectively have contributed tens of millions of dollars to shape the presidential race , are tightening their purse strings out of frustration with their inability to boost their favored candidates , or to slow Donald Trump .\nRather than continuing to write huge checks to support the cluster of establishment candidates jockeying to emerge as the leading alternative to Trump , a billionaire real estate showman roundly despised by the GOP elite , these donors have mostly retreated to the sidelines .
