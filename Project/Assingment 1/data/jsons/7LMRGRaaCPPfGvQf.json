    "content": "The Senate on Thursday confirmed William Barr , President Donald Trump \u2019 s nominee for attorney general .\nBarr , who previously held the position under President George H.W . Bush , will now become head of the US Department of Justice . He \u2019 ll replace Matthew Whitaker , who became acting attorney general after Jeff Sessions resigned from the job last year .\nFor now , a lot of the attention around Barr has focused on what his new role could mean for the Russia investigation .\nBut as head of the Justice Department , Barr will have a lot of control over the federal criminal justice system more broadly . And although criminal justice reform has gained momentum in recent years ( leading to the passage of the federal First Step Act , with Trump \u2019 s support ) , Barr \u2019 s views have historically been on the opposite end of the spectrum \u2014 supportive of mass incarceration and other \u201c tough on crime \u201d policies .\nAmes Grawert , senior counsel at the Brennan Center , which supports criminal justice reform , tweeted in reaction to Barr \u2019 s nomination last year : \u201c Barr is one of the few people left in policy circles who could reasonably be called as bad as , or worse than , Jeff Sessions on criminal justice reform. \u201d And make no mistake : Sessions had a very bad record on criminal justice reform .\nIn fact , Barr praised Sessions \u2019 s record at the Justice Department , including some of his work dismantling criminal justice reform efforts by President Barack Obama \u2019 s administration .\nIn short : If you were hoping that Sessions \u2019 s replacement would be better on criminal justice reform , Barr \u2019 s nomination should be of great concern .\nBarr doesn \u2019 t just have a record of supporting the war on drugs and mass incarceration . As attorney general for George H.W . Bush , he was one of the architects for federal policies that supported both .\nHere are some examples , noted in part by Grawert and civil rights lawyer Sasha Samberg-Champion :\nAs deputy attorney general from 1990 to 1991 and attorney general from 1991 to 1993 , Barr pushed for and helped implement more punitive criminal justice policies , including a 1990 crime law that , among other things , escalated the war on drugs .\nIn 1992 , Barr signed off on a report by the Department of Justice titled The Case for More Incarceration . In a letter of support , he argued that \u201c there is no better way to reduce crime than to identify , target , and incapacitate those hardened criminals who commit staggering numbers of violent crimes whenever they are on the streets. \u201d He also called on the country to build more jails and prisons . ( Although he specified violent criminals , the federal system , unlike the much larger state systems , locks up mostly drug offenders . )\nIn 1992 , asked about racial disparities in prisons by Los Angeles Times reporter Ronald Ostrow , Barr argued that \u201c our system is fair and does not treat people differently. \u201d He went on to defend laws that made prison sentences for crack cocaine much harsher than prison sentences for powder cocaine . The disparity between the two was reduced by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 , in part because there \u2019 s little justification for it based on the drugs \u2019 effects , but the higher sentence for crack has a disproportionate racial impact since crack was more commonly used in black communities and powder cocaine was more commonly used in white communities .\nIn 1994 , Barr co-chaired a commission for Virginia \u2019 s governor that released a plan to abolish parole ( which allows certain inmates to go free before the completion of their sentences ) in the state , increase prison sentences , and build more prisons .\nBarr also once said that it was \u201c simply a myth \u201d that there were \u201c sympathetic people \u201d and \u201c hapless victims of the criminal justice system \u201d in prisons , according to David Krajicek at Salon .\nIt \u2019 s possible that Barr \u2019 s views have evolved over the years , just as many people \u2019 s views have toward the drug war and mass incarceration , especially as crime has plummeted in the past two decades . This may even apply to Trump , who ran on a \u201c tough on crime \u201d platform in 2016 but went on to sign the biggest federal criminal justice reform bill in decades , the First Step Act , after the urging of his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner .\nBut Barr has continued advocating for \u201c tough on crime \u201d views , at least until recently . In 2015 , he signed a letter with other former law enforcement officials to oppose a federal sentencing reform bill , according to Michael Balsamo at the Associated Press .\nIn November , Barr and two other former attorneys general wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post in which they defended Sessions \u2019 s \u201c tough on crime \u201d record . They criticized the Obama administration for investigating police abuses and discouraging more aggressive policing practices . They also praised Sessions for his memo encouraging federal prosecutors to pursue harsher prison sentences against drug offenders .\nIn his opening remarks at the Senate confirmation hearings , Barr vowed to \u201c diligently implement \u201d the First Step Act but also affirmed his commitment to \u201c keep up the pressure on chronic , violent criminals. \u201d And he later argued at the hearings that the 1980s and \u2019 90s were a different time , when crime was much higher and prison sentences much shorter , so his call for more punitive punishments was warranted .\nBarr \u2019 s support for more punitive criminal justice policies goes against the research , which has found that more incarceration and longer prison sentences do little to combat crime .\nA 2015 review of the research by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that more incarceration \u2014 and its abilities to incapacitate or deter criminals \u2014 explained about 0 to 7 percent of the crime drop since the 1990s , though other researchers estimate it drove 10 to 25 percent of the crime drop since the \u2019 90s .\nAnother huge review of the research , released last year by David Roodman of the Open Philanthropy Project , found that releasing people from prison earlier doesn \u2019 t lead to more crime , and that holding people in prison longer may actually increase crime .\nThat conclusion matches what other researchers have found in this area . As the National Institute of Justice concluded in 2016 , \u201c Research has found evidence that prison can exacerbate , not reduce , recidivism . Prisons themselves may be schools for learning to commit crimes . \u201d\nThis is the kind of research that has driven support for criminal justice reform over the years , including the First Step Act . But it also suggests that much of Barr \u2019 s initial work on criminal justice issues , particularly his support for mass incarceration , was misguided . It remains unclear if and how that has changed Barr \u2019 s mind .\nThe silver lining : the federal criminal justice system isn \u2019 t that big\nIf there is any sign of optimism for criminal justice reformers here , it \u2019 s that the federal criminal justice system is a relatively small part of the national criminal justice system .\nConsider the numbers : According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics , 87 percent of US prison inmates are held in state facilities ( and most state inmates are in for violent , not drug , crimes ) . That doesn \u2019 t even account for local jails , where hundreds of thousands of people are held on a typical day in America . Just look at this chart from the Prison Policy Initiative , which shows both local jails and state prisons far outpacing the number of people incarcerated in federal prisons :\nOne way to think about this is what would happen if Trump used his pardon powers to their maximum potential \u2014 meaning he pardoned every single person in federal prison right now . That would push down America \u2019 s overall incarcerated population from about 2.1 million to about 1.9 million .\nThat would be a hefty reduction . But it also wouldn \u2019 t undo mass incarceration , as the US would still lead all but one country in incarceration : With an incarceration rate of around 590 per 100,000 people , only the small nation of El Salvador would come out ahead \u2014 and America would still dwarf the incarceration rates of other developed nations like Canada ( 114 per 100,000 ) , Germany ( 76 per 100,000 ) , and Japan ( 41 per 100,000 ) .\nSimilarly , almost all police work is done at the local and state level . There are about 18,000 law enforcement agencies in America , only a dozen or so of which are federal agencies .\nWhile the federal government can incentivize states to adopt specific criminal justice policies , studies show that previous efforts , such as the 1994 federal crime law , had little to no impact . By and large , it seems local municipalities and states will only embrace federal incentives on criminal justice issues if they actually want to adopt the policies being encouraged .\nCriminal justice reform , then , is going to fall largely to municipalities and states . To this end , many local and state governments are actually way ahead of the federal government when it comes to criminal justice reform , enacting changes like reduced prison sentences across the board , the defelonization of drug offenses , and marijuana legalization in recent years .\nSo Barr may represent another grim few years for criminal justice reformers at the federal level . But they \u2019 ll still have plenty of opportunities in cities , counties , and states , which hold far more sway in the overall justice system .",
