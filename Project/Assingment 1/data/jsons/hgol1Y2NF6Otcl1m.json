    "content": "Many Republicans may have sided with Donald Trump 's controversial proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. , but his rival Jeb Bush predicts that the GOP faithful will eventually oppose the plan and see it his way .\n`` Trump clearly banning all Muslims would actually be so counterproductive in our efforts to destroy ISIS that it 's foolhardy , '' the former Florida governor told NPR 's Steve Inskeep in an interview Wednesday in Boston . `` I mean , it 's beyond ridiculous ; it 's quite dangerous . ''\nEarlier this month , in response to terrorist threats , Trump said there should be `` a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country 's representatives can figure out what is going on . ''\nThe plan was renounced by many of his Republican rivals and GOP leaders ; Bush himself said Trump had become `` unhinged . '' But polls showed a majority of Republican voters sided with Trump , and Trump 's poll numbers went up in the aftermath , too .\nBut Bush believes that will change by the time actual voting rolls around in February .\nI think the emotion of the here and now will subside .\n`` In a month from now they wo n't [ agree ] . That 's the point , '' Bush said . `` The point is that we 're living in this reality-TV kind of political environment , where [ Trump ] fills the space by saying outrageous things . People based on their emotions will express support for the sentiment , not necessarily the specifics , because there are none , and then he 'll backtrack . And he 'll move on to the next thing , and he fills the space . ''\n`` I think the emotion of the here and now will subside , '' Bush continued . `` Are people scared about the national security interests of our country being violated because of a lax immigration system or a visa waiver program that was n't designed for people being radicalized ? Yes , they 're scared , and the job of a president \u2014 or a candidate , for that matter \u2014 is n't to scare them more ; it 's to give them solutions , and that 's what I 'm trying to do . ''\nPresident Obama believes Trump is `` exploiting '' the anxieties of blue-collar workers in his campaign , as Obama told Inskeep in a wide-ranging interview at the White House this month .\nBush said he did n't exactly agree with the president 's characterization of the root of that frustration .\n`` [ Obama 's ] got this notion of what blue-collared , white voters kind of think that 's so out of touch , '' he said . `` People are legitimately angry with Washington , D.C. And , yes , Mr. President , they 're legitimately angry with you . You have divided the country up in all sorts of disparate parts . ''\nThat division in the country , Bush argued , has allowed for an unconventional candidate to rise .\n`` I would argue that Donald Trump is in fact a creature of Barack Obama , '' he continued . `` But for Barack Obama , Donald Trump 's effect would not be nearly as strong as it is .
