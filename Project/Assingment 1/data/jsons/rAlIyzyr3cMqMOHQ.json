If President Trump \u2019 s nominee to lead the agency , physician and Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson , is confirmed , he will be the fourth .\nEach has sought to fix the department , laying out visions and priorities \u2014 Shulkin \u2019 s top priority was \u201c access , \u201d making sure veterans get appointments when they need them . His predecessor , former Procter and Gamble CEO Bob McDonald , focused on staffing , training and veteran-centered customer service .\nBut year after year , critical deficiencies remain and veterans are bearing the brunt of the failures . Here are some key , seemingly intractable shortfalls that continue to plague the system \u2014 and that Jackson will face if confirmed .\nThe furor over VA health care exploded in 2014 when whistle-blowers in Arizona divulged that thousands of patients were backlogged at the Phoenix veterans hospital , and some of them had died awaiting care . VA investigators soon determined that medical center administrators knew about the crisis , yet put out fraudulent wait-time data to collect bonus pay .\nThe problems weren \u2019 t just in Phoenix . A \u2588\u2588\u2588 investigation in 2016 found supervisors instructed employees to falsify patient wait times at VA medical facilities in at least seven states . And employees at 40 VA medical facilities in 19 states and Puerto Rico regularly \u201c zeroed out \u201d veteran wait times .\nA few weeks after Shulkin was sworn in last year , the VA inspector general released a report finding widespread inaccuracies in scheduling records at a dozen hospitals in North Carolina and Virginia . The records vastly understated how long veterans were waiting for appointments and prevented as many as 13,000 from getting VA-funded care in the private sector \u2014 an option they were entitled to if they waited longer than 30 days . At the time , Shulkin said the findings were based on outdated rules and that he had instituted new regulations to prevent such problems in the future .\nBut just two weeks ago , another inspector general investigation found the problems continued .\nLooking at 64 VA hospitals and clinics in a swath of states from Kentucky to Illinois , investigators found scheduling staff entered the wrong dates in the system in more than 5,000 cases . That masked how long veterans were actually waiting for specialty care and mental health appointments .\nThey estimated 2,500 of those waited longer than a month , but the scheduling system falsely showed only 1,300 waited that long . Even in the cases accurately reflected in the system , they concluded , most weren \u2019 t offered the chance to get care in the private sector .\n\u201c VA data continues to be a high-risk area , \u201d wrote Larry Reinkemeyer , VA assistant inspector general for audits and evaluations .\nThe VA \u2019 s lowest performing hospitals remained at the bottom of the pack on the agency \u2019 s own internal quality measures for two years in a row .\nThe VA regularly scores its medical centers based on dozens of quality factors , including death and infection rates , instances of avoidable complications and wait times . The agency uses a five-star scale with one being the worst and five being the best .\nThe rankings compare VA hospitals against each other but the number of one-star hospitals is not constant . Medical centers in that bracket can be elevated to two stars based on quality-of-care factors .\nAmong the facilities who received only one star in both 2015 and 2016 were the VA hospital in Phoenix and another in Memphis , Tenn. One Memphis employee dubbed the facility a \u201c house of horrors \u201d when \u2588\u2588\u2588 obtained internal documents revealing reported threats to patient safety soared in recent years from 700 to more than 1,000 .\nOne veteran had to have his leg amputated after a VA provider there left a piece of plastic tubing in a critical blood vessel during a procedure .\nOn a number of patient safety factors , the VA overall on average scores better than the private sector on many key patient-safety measures , including instances of avoidable death , respiratory failure , and infection . But there are vast disparities among VA hospitals , according to VA data collected from October 2015 to March 2017 .\nThe death rate for surgical patients with treatable complications ranged from zero at the VA hospital in Sacramento , Calif. , to more than 20 % in Miami ; Columbia , Mo . ; and Washington , D.C . In Long Beach . Calif , it was 29 % . That \u2019 s more than double the private sector average of 14 % , according to Medicare data .\nIn Washington , the VA inspector general issued a rare emergency report last year saying that patients were in imminent danger at the hospital . The facility had dirty sterile storage areas and was regularly running out of critical supplies needed for surgeries and other procedures , including patches to seal blood vessels and tubes for kidney dialysis .\nShulkin quickly removed the hospital director there and sent teams from headquarters to try to fix the problems . But an inspector general report released this month found that VA officials at every level \u2014 local , regional and national \u2014 knew about the problems for years but did n't fix them .\nInvestigators found \u201c a culture of complacency and a sense of futility pervaded offices at multiple levels . \u201d\n\u201c In interviews , leaders frequently abrogated individual responsibility and deflected blame to others , \u201d the investigation report says . \u201c Despite the many warnings and ongoing indicators of serious problems , leaders failed to engage in meaningful interventions of effective remediation . \u201d\nMorale at the agency has taken a beating amid the constant drumbeat of crises . Employees ranked it as the second to worst agency to work for among large departments last year . The only department scoring lower was Homeland Security .\nThe inspector general singled out frontline workers at the Washington hospital , saying they went to great lengths to make do and they may be the only reason no patients were actually harmed .\n\u201c The OIG did not find evidence of adverse clinical outcomes , a condition that is largely attributable to front-line care providers who were committed to providing the best possible care by borrowing supplies , improvising , or personally ensuring patients received what they needed , \u201d the investigation report said .\nThe VA has had persistent difficulties recruiting and keeping enough medical care providers to meet veterans needs .\nIn 2015 , one in six critical VA jobs \u2014 intake workers , doctors , nurses and assistants \u2014 were unfilled , a \u2588\u2588\u2588 investigation found .
