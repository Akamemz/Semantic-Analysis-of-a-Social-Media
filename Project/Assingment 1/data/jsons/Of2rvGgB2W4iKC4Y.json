You have to win the majority of electoral votes \u2014 that is , 270 of them . * In most states , a candidate wins electoral votes by winning the most voters .\nSo . Win a state by just one vote , and you win all of its electoral votes ( unless you live in Nebraska or Maine , which divvy up their votes a little differently ) .\nThis can lead to off-kilter election results \u2014 in 2000 , for example , Democrat Al Gore won the popular vote by a few hundred thousand votes , but lost the presidency by five electoral votes . So we wondered : Just how few votes would a candidate need to win 270 electoral votes ?\nWe decided to find out . A candidate only needs to win the 11 states with the most electoral votes to hit 270 . Assuming only two candidates ( a big assumption ; see below ) and that one candidate won all of those states by just one vote , and then did n't win a single vote in any of the other states ( or D.C. ) , how many votes would that candidate have to win ? It depends on how you do the math . Either way , it 's far less than half .\nInitially when we did this story , we found that if you start with the biggest-electoral-vote states , the answer is 27 percent . However , we have an update : as Andrej Schoeke very nicely pointed out to us on Twitter , there 's another way to do it ( via CGP Grey ) that requires even less of the popular vote : start with the smallest-electoral-vote states . Our math went through a few iterations on this but by our final math , in 2012 that could have meant winning the presidency with only around 23 percent of the popular vote .\nThe idea here is that a voter in a low-population state like Wyoming counts for a larger share of electoral votes than popular votes .\nAnd if one were to start with the largest states , it would be 27 percent . Here 's a look at that math :\nWe 're making a lot of assumptions here \u2014 we 're using vote totals from 2012 , for one thing . Moreover , we 're assuming there are only two candidates in the race .\nAnd let 's be clear about the obvious here : This kind of an extreme election is n't going to happen . And if it did \u2014 if there were somehow a bunch of 1- or 2-vote wins , you can bet the recounts would stretch into 2017 .\nAnd we 're also sure that with any number of tweaks to the math ( like plugging in a third or fourth candidate ) , you could come up with results that are slightly-to-moderately different . But that 's not really the point here . The point is that the Electoral College can skew election results to a fantastic degree .\nThis kind of popular-electoral vote discrepancy is why some articles about the 2008 election had to be careful to call Obama 's win an electoral landslide \u2014 he won 68 percent of the electoral vote but only about 53 percent of the popular vote .\nSkewed wins like this happen regularly in U.S. elections \u2014 a modest popular vote margin can yield a ridiculously large Electoral College margin . For example , in 1984 , Ronald Reagan beat Walter Mondale in the popular vote by 18 points \u2014 a sizable gap , but nothing like the Electoral College walloping : Reagan won 525 electoral votes , beating Mondale by 95 percentage points .\nHere 's what those gaps look like in every election going back to 1960 's race , in which John F.
