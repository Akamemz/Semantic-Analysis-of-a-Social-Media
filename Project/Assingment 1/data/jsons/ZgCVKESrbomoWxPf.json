And , in questioning fellow Republican Jon Huntsman \u2019 s decision to serve as ambassador to China in President Barack Obama \u2019 s administration in 2011 , Mr. Bolton said , \u201c There is no patriotic obligation to help advance the career of a politician who is otherwise pursuing interests that are fundamentally antithetical to your values. \u201d In other words , Mr. Trump \u2019 s frequent demeaning of the Atlantic alliance , his obtuse bromance with Putin , and his apparent acquiescence in Russian interference with the American electoral process may have persuaded Mr. Bolton to desert the president on principle .\nThen there are his professional principles . Mr. Bolton , unlike Mr. Trump and some of the fiercest members of his inner circle , is a seasoned government professional with an informed respect for the institutional architecture and ethos of American foreign policy . Before becoming Mr. Trump \u2019 s national security adviser , Mr. Bolton served as ambassador to the United Nations , undersecretary of state , assistant secretary of state and assistant attorney general .\nMr. Bolton reportedly characterized Mr. Trump \u2019 s meddling with aid to Ukraine as a \u201c drug deal \u201d \u2014 a crude metaphor for actions that violate his sense of foreign policy professionalism . He also disdained the president \u2019 s circumvention of normal diplomatic channels by informally enlisting Rudolph Giuliani , his personal lawyer , whom Mr. Bolton called a \u201c hand grenade who \u2019 s going to blow everybody up. \u201d Separate from his sense of patriotic duty , Mr. Bolton may have felt that Mr. Trump had so demeaned the integrity of the foreign policy structure that something radical had to be done .\nWell , maybe . Another explanation is personal indignation and greed . Mr. Bolton spent much of his career dreaming of the national security adviser job , and reportedly lobbied the president for it for years . And , of course , his book is due to come out March 17 , and these revelations are sure to make it an instant best seller ( a fact not lost on the president : Mr. Trump \u2019 s backers have predictably cast him as a \u201c disgruntled \u201d former employee , and Mr. Trump himself has accused him of merely trying to sell books ) .\nLet \u2019 s not judge John Bolton too harshly , though . He lasted almost a year and a half in a job under a famously mercurial president , and toward the end was reportedly unhappy in it . And his book , for which he received a reported $ 2 million advance , didn \u2019 t need this revelation to make it a hot item or line his pockets .
