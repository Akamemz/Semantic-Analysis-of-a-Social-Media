    "content": "On a third-down play last season , the Washington Redskins quarterback Alex Smith stood in shotgun formation , five yards behind the line of scrimmage . As he called his signals , a Houston Texans cornerback , Kareem Jackson , suddenly sprinted forward from a position four yards behind the defensive line . To hear more feature stories , see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app . Jackson \u2019 s timing was perfect . The ball was snapped . The Texans \u2019 left defensive end , J.J. Watt , sprinted to the outside , taking the Redskins \u2019 right tackle with him . The defensive tackle on Watt \u2019 s right rushed to the inside , taking the offensive right guard with him . The result was a huge gap in the Redskins \u2019 line , through which Jackson could run unblocked . He quickly sacked Smith , for a loss of 13 yards . Special-teams players began taking the field for the punt . But Smith didn \u2019 t get up . He rolled flat onto his back , pulled off his helmet , and covered his face with his hands . He was clearly in excruciating pain . The slow-motion replay immediately showed the television audience why : As Smith was tackled , his right leg had buckled sharply above the ankle , with his foot rotating significantly away from any direction in which a human foot ought to point . The play-by-play announcer Greg Gumbel said grimly , \u201c We \u2019 ll be back , \u201d and the network abruptly cut to a break . There was nothing more to say .\nEven without the benefit of medical training , and even without conducting a physical examination , viewers knew what had happened . They may not have known what the bones were called or what treatment would be required , but they knew more than enough , and they knew what really mattered : Smith had broken his leg , very badly . They knew that even if they were not orthopedists , did not have a medical degree , and had never cracked open a copy of Gray \u2019 s Anatomy . They could tell\u2014they were certain\u2014something was seriously wrong . And so it is , or ought to be , with Donald Trump . You don \u2019 t need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows , and you don \u2019 t need to be a mental-health professional to see that something \u2019 s very seriously off with Trump\u2014particularly after nearly three years of watching his erratic and abnormal behavior in the White House . Questions about Trump \u2019 s psychological stability have mounted throughout his presidency . But those questions have been coming even more frequently amid a recent escalation in Trump \u2019 s bizarre behavior , as the pressures of his upcoming reelection campaign , a possibly deteriorating economy , and now a full-blown impeachment inquiry have mounted . And the questioners have included those who have worked most closely with him . No president in recent memory\u2014and likely no president ever\u2014has prompted more discussion about his mental stability and connection with reality . Trump \u2019 s former chief of staff John Kelly is said to have described him as \u201c unhinged , \u201d and \u201c off the rails , \u201d and to have called the White House \u201c Crazytown \u201d because of Trump \u2019 s unbalanced state . Trump \u2019 s former deputy attorney general , Rod Rosenstein , once reportedly discussed recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the Twenty-Fifth Amendment , the Constitution \u2019 s provision addressing presidential disability , including mental disability .\nRead more : Donald Trump \u2019 s 50 most unthinkable moments Rosenstein denies that claim , but it is not the only such account . A senior administration official , writing anonymously in The New York Times last September , described how , \u201c given the instability many witnessed , there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment \u201d \u2014but \u201c no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. \u201d And NBC News last week quoted someone familiar with current discussions in the White House warning that there is \u201c increasing wariness that , as this impeachment inquiry drags out , the likelihood increases that the president could respond erratically and become \u2018 unmanageable. \u2019 \u201d In September , a former White House official offered a similar assessment to a Business Insider reporter : \u201c No one knows what to expect from him anymore , \u201d because \u201c his mood changes from one minute to the next based on some headline or tweet , and the next thing you know his entire schedule gets tossed out the window . He \u2019 s losing his shit. \u201d Even a major investment bank has gotten into the mix , albeit in a roundabout way : JPMorgan Chase has created a \u201c Volfefe Index \u201d \u2014named after Trump \u2019 s bizarre May 2017 \u201c covfefe \u201d tweet\u2014designed to quantify the effect that Trump \u2019 s impulsive tweets have on interest-rate volatility . The bank \u2019 s press release understatedly observed that its \u201c volatility fair value model \u201d shows that \u201c the president \u2019 s remarks on this social media platform [ have ] played a statistically significant role in elevating implied volatility . \u201d\nThe president isn \u2019 t simply volatile and erratic , however\u2014he \u2019 s also incapable of consistently telling the truth . Those who work closely with him , and who aren \u2019 t in denial , must deal with Trump \u2019 s lying about serious matters virtually every day . But as one former official put it , they \u201c are used to the president saying things that aren \u2019 t true , \u201d and have inured themselves to it . Trump \u2019 s own former communications director Anthony Scaramucci has on multiple occasions described Trump as a liar , once saying , \u201c We \u2026 know he \u2019 s telling lies , \u201d so \u201c if you want me to say he \u2019 s a liar , I \u2019 m happy to say he \u2019 s a liar. \u201d He went on to address Trump directly : \u201c You should probably dial down the lying because you don \u2019 t need to \u2026 So dial that down , and you \u2019 ll be doing a lot better. \u201d That was good advice , but clearly wishful thinking . Trump simply can \u2019 t dial down the lying , or turn it off\u2014even , his own attorneys suggest , when false statements may be punished as crimes . A lawyer who has represented him in business disputes once told me that Trump couldn \u2019 t sensibly be allowed to speak with Special Counsel Robert Mueller , because Trump would \u201c lie his ass off \u201d \u2014in effect , that Trump simply wasn \u2019 t capable of telling the truth , about anything , and that if he ever spoke to a prosecutor , he \u2019 d talk himself into jail . Trump \u2019 s lawyers in the Russia investigation clearly agreed : As Bob Woodward recounts at length in his book Fear , members of Trump \u2019 s criminal-defense team fought both Trump and Mueller tooth and nail to keep Trump from being interviewed by the Office of Special Counsel . A practice testimonial session ended with Trump spouting wild , baseless assertions in a rage . Woodward quotes Trump \u2019 s outside counsel John Dowd as saying that Trump \u201c just made something up \u201d in response to one question . \u201c That \u2019 s his nature. \u201d Woodward also recounts Dowd \u2019 s thinking when he argued to Trump that the president was \u201c not really capable \u201d of answering Mueller \u2019 s questions face to face . Dowd had \u201c to dress it up as much as possible , to say , it \u2019 s not your fault \u2026 He could not say what he knew was true : \u2018 You \u2019 re a fucking liar. \u2019 That was the problem. \u201d ( Dowd disputes this account . ) Which raises the question : If Trump can \u2019 t tell the truth even when it counts most , with legal jeopardy on the line and lawyers there to help prepare him , is he able to apprehend the truth at all ?\nBehavior like this is unusual , a point that journalists across the political spectrum have made . \u201c This is not normal , \u201d Megan McArdle wrote in late August . \u201c And I don \u2019 t mean that as in , \u2018 Trump is violating the shibboleths of the Washington establishment. \u2019 I mean that as in , \u2018 This is not normal for a functioning adult. \u2019 \u201d James Fallows observed , also in August , that Trump is having \u201c episodes of what would be called outright lunacy , if they occurred in any other setting , \u201d and that if he \u201c were in virtually any other position of responsibility , action would already be under way to remove him from that role. \u201d Trump \u2019 s erratic behavior has long been the subject of political criticism , late-night-television jokes , and even speculation about whether it \u2019 s part of some incomprehensible , multidimensional strategic game . But it \u2019 s relevant to whether he \u2019 s fit for the office he holds . Simply put , Trump \u2019 s ingrained and extreme behavioral characteristics make it impossible for him to carry out the duties of the presidency in the way the Constitution requires . To see why first requires a look at what the Constitution demands of a president , and then an examination of how Trump \u2019 s behavioral characteristics preclude his ability to fulfill those demands . The Framers of the Constitution expected the presidency to be occupied by special individuals , selfless people of the highest character and ability . They intended the Electoral College to be a truly deliberative body , not the largely ceremonial institution it has become today . Because the Electoral College , unlike Congress and the state legislatures , wouldn \u2019 t be a permanent body , and because it involved diffuse selections made in the various states , they hoped it would help avoid \u201c cabal , intrigue and corruption , \u201d as Alexander Hamilton put it in \u201c Federalist No . 68 , \u201d and deter interference from \u201c these most deadly adversaries of republican government , \u201d especially \u201c from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils . \u201d\nThough the Constitution \u2019 s drafters could hardly have foreseen how the system would evolve , they certainly knew the kind of person they wanted it to produce . \u201c The process of election affords a moral certainty , \u201d Hamilton wrote , \u201c that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. \u201d \u201c Talents for low intrigue , and the little arts of popularity , \u201d might suffice for someone to be elected to the governorship of a state , but not the presidency . Election would \u201c require other talents , and a different kind of merit , \u201d to gain \u201c the esteem and confidence of the whole Union , \u201d or enough of it to win the presidency . As a result , there would be \u201c a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue. \u201d This was the Framers \u2019 goal in designing the system that would make \u201c the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided. \u201d Read more : The presidency is the hardest job in the world Hamilton \u2019 s use of the word trust in The Federalist Papers to describe the presidency was no accident . The Framers intended that the president \u201c be like a fiduciary , who must pursue the public interest in good faith republican fashion rather than pursuing his self-interest , and who must diligently and steadily execute Congress \u2019 s commands , \u201d as a recent Harvard Law Review article puts it . The concept is akin to the law of private fiduciaries , which governs trustees of trusts and directors and officers of corporations , an area that has been central to my legal practice as a corporate litigator . \u201c Indeed , \u201d as the Harvard Law Review article explains , \u201c one might argue that what presents to us as private fiduciary law today had some of its genesis in the law of public officeholding. \u201d The overarching principle is that a fiduciary\u2014say , the CEO of a corporation\u2014when acting on behalf of a corporation , has to act in the corporation \u2019 s best interests . Likewise , a trustee of a trust must use the assets for the benefit of the beneficiary , and not himself ( a fundamental rule , incidentally , that Trump apparently couldn \u2019 t adhere to with his own charitable foundation ) .\nIn providing for a national chief executive , the Framers incorporated the very similar law of public officeholding into his duties in two places in the Constitution\u2014in Article II , Section 3 ( the president \u201c shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed \u201d ) , and in Article II , Section 1 , Clause 8 , which requires the president to \u201c solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States. \u201d That language\u2014particularly the words faithfully execute\u2014was in 1787 \u201c very commonly associated with the performance of public and private offices , \u201d the Harvard Law Review article points out , and \u201c anyone experienced in law or government \u201d at that time would have recognized what it meant , \u201c because it was so basic to \u2026 the law of executive officeholding. \u201d In a nutshell , while carrying out his official duties , a president has to put the country , not himself , first ; he must faithfully follow and enforce the law ; and he must act with the utmost care in doing all that . But can Trump do all that ? Does his personality allow him to ? Answering those questions doesn \u2019 t require mental-health expertise , nor does it really require a diagnosis . You can make the argument for Trump \u2019 s unfitness without assessing his mental health : Like James Fallows , for example , you could just ask whether Trump would have been allowed to retain any other job in light of his bizarre conduct . At the same time , the presence of a mental disorder or disturbance doesn \u2019 t necessarily translate to incapacity ; to suggest otherwise would unfairly stigmatize tens of millions of Americans . Someone battling a serious psychological ailment can unquestionably function well , and even nobly , in high public office\u2014including as president . The country , in fact , has seen it : Abraham Lincoln endured \u201c no mere case of the blues \u201d ; he suffered such \u201c terrible melancholly , \u201d said one of his contemporaries , that \u201c he never dare [ d ] carry a knife in his pocket. \u201d Many historians speculate that he suffered from what we would now diagnose as clinical depression . Yet Lincoln \u2019 s mechanisms for coping with his lifelong affliction may have supplied him with the vision , the creativity , and the moral fortitude to save the nation , to achieve for it a new birth of freedom . As a writer in this magazine once put it : Lincoln \u2019 s \u201c political vision drew power from personal experience \u2026 Prepared for defeat , and even for humiliation , he insisted on seeing the truth of both his personal circumstances and the national condition . And where the optimists of his time would fail , he would succeed , envisioning and articulating a durable idea of free society . \u201d\nMore than a diagnosis , what truly matters , as Lincoln \u2019 s case shows , is the president \u2019 s behavioral characteristics and personality traits . And understanding how people behave and think is not the sole province of professionals ; we all do it every day , with family members , co-workers , and others . Nevertheless , how the mental-health community goes about categorizing those characteristics and traits can provide helpful guidance to laypeople by structuring our thinking about them . Read more : Donald Trump is not well And that \u2019 s where the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders comes into play . The DSM , now in its fifth edition , \u201c contains descriptions , symptoms , and other criteria for diagnosing mental disorders , \u201d and serves as the country \u2019 s \u201c authoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders. \u201d What \u2019 s useful for nonprofessionals is that , for the most part , it \u2019 s written in plain English , and its criteria consist largely of observable behaviors\u2014words and actions . That \u2019 s especially true of its criteria for personality disorders\u2014they don \u2019 t require a person to lie on a couch and confess his or her innermost thoughts . They turn on how a person behaves in the wild , so to speak . If anything , a patient \u2019 s confessions in an office may disadvantage a clinician , because patients can and do conceal from clinicians central aspects of their true selves . If you can observe people going about their everyday business , you \u2019 ll know a lot more about how they act and behave .\nAnd Donald Trump , as president of the United States , is probably the most observable and observed person in the world . I \u2019 ve personally met and spoken with him only a few times , but anyone who knows him will tell you that Trump , in a way , has no facade : What you see of him publicly is what you get all the time , although you may get more of it in private . Any intelligent person who watches Trump closely on television , and pays careful attention to his words on Twitter and in the press , should be able to tell you as much about his behavior as a mental-health professional could . One scholarly paper has suggested that accounts of a person \u2019 s behavior from laypeople who observe him might be more accurate than information from a clinical interview , and that this is especially true when considering two personality disorders in particular\u2014what the DSM calls narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder . These two disorders just happen to be the ones that have most commonly been ascribed to Trump by mental-health professionals over the past four years . Of these two disorders , the more commonly discussed when it comes to Trump is narcissistic personality disorder , or NPD\u2014pathological narcissism . It \u2019 s also more important in considering Trump \u2019 s fitness for office , because it touches directly upon whether Trump has the capacity to put anyone \u2019 s interests\u2014including the country \u2019 s and the Constitution \u2019 s\u2014above his own .\nNarcissus , the Greek mythological figure , was a boy who fell so in love with his own reflection in a pool of water that , according to one version of the story , he jumped in and drowned . Psychiatrists and psychologists now use the term narcissism to describe feelings of self-importance and self-love . As Craig Malkin , a clinical psychologist who has written extensively on the subject , has explained , narcissism is a trait that , to some extent , all human beings have : \u201c the drive to feel special , to stand out from \u2026 other [ s ] \u2026 to feel exceptional or unique. \u201d A certain amount of narcissism is healthy , and helpful\u2014it brings with it confidence , optimism , and boldness . Someone with more than an average amount of narcissism may be called a narcissist . Many politicians , and many celebrities , could be considered narcissists ; presidents seem especially likely to \u201c rank high in extroverted narcissism , \u201d Malkin writes , although they have varied greatly in the degree of their narcissism . But extreme narcissism can be pathological , an illness\u2014and potentially a danger , as it was for Narcissus . \u201c Pathological narcissism begins when people become so addicted to feeling special that , just like with any drug , they \u2019 ll do anything to get their \u2018 high , \u2019 including lie , steal , cheat , betray , and even hurt those closest to them , \u201d Malkin says . The \u201c fundamental life goal \u201d of an extreme narcissist \u201c is to promote the greatness of the self , for all to see , \u201d the psychologist Dan P. McAdams wrote in \u2588\u2588\u2588 . To many mental-health professionals , Donald Trump provides a perfect example of such extreme , pathological narcissism : One clinical psychologist told Vanity Fair that he considers Trump such a \u201c classic \u201d pathological narcissist that he is actually \u201c archiving video clips of him to use in workshops because there \u2019 s no better example \u201d of the characteristics of the disorder he displays . \u201c Otherwise , \u201d this clinician explained , \u201c I would have had to hire actors and write vignettes . He \u2019 s like a dream come true. \u201d Another clinical psychologist said that Trump displays \u201c textbook narcissistic personality disorder . \u201d\nNot everyone agrees that Trump meets the diagnostic criteria for NPD . Allen Frances , a psychiatrist who helped write the disorder \u2019 s entry in the DSM , has argued that a mental \u201c disturbance \u201d becomes a \u201c disorder \u201d only when , as the DSM puts it , the affliction \u201c causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , or other important areas of functioning. \u201d The idea behind this threshold is to separate \u201c mild forms \u201d of problems from pathological ones , \u201c in the absence of clear biological markers or clinically useful measurements of severity for many mental disorders. \u201d In Frances \u2019 s view , that dividing line disqualifies Trump from having a disorder , particularly NPD . Trump \u201c may be a world-class narcissist , \u201d he has written , \u201c but this doesn \u2019 t make him mentally ill , because he does not suffer from the distress and impairment required to diagnose mental disorder . Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded , rather than punished , for his grandiosity , self-absorption and lack of empathy. \u201d But from the perspective of the public at large , the debate over whether Trump meets the clinical diagnostic criteria for NPD\u2014or whether psychiatrists can and should answer that question without directly examining him\u2014is beside the point . The goal of a diagnosis is to help a clinician guide treatment . The question facing the public is very different : Does the president of the United States exhibit a consistent pattern of behavior that suggests he is incapable of properly discharging the duties of his office ?\nEven Trump \u2019 s own allies recognize the degree of his narcissism . When he launched racist attacks on four congresswomen of color , Senator Lindsey Graham explained , \u201c That \u2019 s just the way he is . It \u2019 s more narcissism than anything else. \u201d So , too , do skeptics of assigning a clinical diagnosis . \u201c No one is denying , \u201d Frances told Rolling Stone , \u201c that he is as narcissistic an individual as one is ever likely to encounter. \u201d The president \u2019 s exceptional narcissism is his defining characteristic\u2014and understanding that is crucial to evaluating his fitness for office . Read more : Is something neurologically wrong with Donald Trump ? The DSM-5 describes its conception of pathological narcissism this way : \u201c The essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandiosity , need for admiration , and lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts. \u201d The manual sets out nine diagnostic criteria that are indicative of the disorder , but only five of the nine need be present for a diagnosis of NPD to be made . Here are the nine : 1 . Has a grandiose sense of self-importance ( e.g. , exaggerates achievements and talents , expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements ) . 2 . Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success , power , brilliance , beauty , or ideal love . 3 . Believes that he or she is \u201c special \u201d and unique and can only be understood by , or should associate with , other special or high-status people ( or institutions ) . 4 . Requires excessive admiration . 5 . Has a sense of entitlement ( i.e. , unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations ) . 6 . Is interpersonally exploitative ( i.e. , takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends ) 7 . Lacks empathy : is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings or needs of others . 8 . Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her . 9 . Shows arrogant , haughty behaviors or attitudes . These criteria are accompanied by explanatory notes that seem relevant here : \u201c Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very sensitive to \u2018 injury \u2019 from criticism or defeat. \u201d And \u201c criticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated , degraded , hollow and empty . They may react with disdain , rage , or defiant counterattack. \u201d The manual warns , moreover , that \u201c interpersonal relations are typically impaired because of problems derived from entitlement , the need for admiration , and the relative disregard for the sensitivities of others. \u201d And , the DSM-5 adds , \u201c though overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high achievement , performance may be disrupted because of intolerance of criticism or defeat . \u201d\nFinally , ( 7 ) Lacks empathy : is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings or needs of others ? One of the most striking aspects of Trump \u2019 s personality is his utter and complete lack of empathy . By empathy , psychologists and psychiatrists mean the ability to understand or relate to what someone else is experiencing\u2014the capacity to envision someone else \u2019 s feelings , perceptions , and thoughts . The notorious lawyer and fixer Roy Cohn , who once counseled Trump , said that \u201c Donald pisses ice water , \u201d and indeed , examples of Trump \u2019 s utter lack of normal human empathy abound . Trump himself has told the story of a charity ball\u2014an \u201c incredible ball \u201d \u2014he once held at Mar-a-Lago for the Red Cross . \u201c So what happens is , this guy falls off right on his face , hits his head , and I thought he died \u2026 His wife is screaming\u2014she \u2019 s sitting right next to him , and she \u2019 s screaming. \u201d By his own account , Trump \u2019 s concern wasn \u2019 t the poor man \u2019 s well-being or his wife \u2019 s . It was the bloody mess on his expensive floor . \u201c You know , beautiful marble floor , didn \u2019 t look like it . It changed color . Became very red \u2026 I said , \u2018 Oh , my God , that \u2019 s disgusting , \u2019 and I turned away . I couldn \u2019 t , you know , he was right in front of me and I turned away. \u201d Trump describes himself as saying , after the injured man was hauled away on a makeshift stretcher , \u201c \u2018 Get that blood cleaned up ! It \u2019 s disgusting ! \u2019 The next day , I forgot to call [ the man ] to say is he okay \u2026 It \u2019 s just not my thing . \u201d\nAnd then there was 9/11 . Trump gave an extraordinary call-in interview to a metropolitan\u2013New York television station just hours after the Twin Towers collapsed . He was asked whether one of his downtown buildings , 40 Wall Street , had suffered any damage . Trump \u2019 s immediate response was to brag about the building \u2019 s brand-new ranking among New York skyscrapers : \u201c 40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan , and it was actually , before the World Trade Center , was the tallest\u2014and then when they built the World Trade Center , it became known as the second-tallest . And now it \u2019 s the tallest. \u201d ( This wasn \u2019 t even true\u2014a building a block away from Trump \u2019 s , 70 Pine Street , was a little taller . ) That human empathy isn \u2019 t Trump \u2019 s thing has been demonstrated time and again during his presidency as well . In October 2017 , he reportedly told the widow of a serviceman killed in action \u201c something to the effect that \u2018 he knew what he was getting into when he signed up , but I guess it hurts anyway. \u2019 \u201d ( Trump later claimed that this account was \u201c fabricated \u2026 Sad ! \u201d and that \u201c I have proof , \u201d but of course he never produced any . ) On a less macabre note , on Christmas Eve last year , Trump took calls on NORAD \u2019 s Santa Tracker phone line , which children call to find out where Santa Claus is as he makes his rounds . Trump asked a 7-year-old girl from South Carolina : \u201c Are you still a believer in Santa ? Because at 7 , it \u2019 s marginal , right ? \u201d\nAccording to Woodward \u2019 s Fear , when Trump \u2019 s first chief of staff , Reince Priebus , resigned , he found out about his replacement when he saw a tweet from Trump saying that he had appointed John Kelly as the new chief of staff\u2014moments after Priebus and Trump had spoken about waiting to announce the news . Kelly was appalled , and that night apologetically told Priebus , \u201c I \u2019 d never do this to you . I \u2019 d never been offered this job until the tweet came out . I would have told you. \u201d His predecessor , though , wasn \u2019 t surprised . \u201c It made no sense , Priebus realized , unless you understood \u2026 \u2018 The president has zero psychological ability to recognize empathy or pity in any way. \u2019 \u201d Priebus apparently isn \u2019 t the only White House staffer to have learned this ; in February 2018 , when Trump met with survivors of the Parkland , Florida , school shooting and their loved ones , his communications aide actually gave him a note card that made clear that \u201c the president needed to be reminded to show compassion and understanding to traumatized survivors , \u201d as The New York Times put it . The empathy cheat sheet contained a reminder to say such things as \u201c I hear you. \u201d One aide to President Obama told the Times that had she and her colleagues given their boss such a reminder card , \u201c he would have looked at us like we were crazy people. \u201d Most recently , in July of this year , in a stunning scene captured on video , Trump met in the Oval Office with the human-rights activist Nadia Murad , a Yazidi Iraqi who had been captured , raped , and tortured by the Islamic State , and had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 for speaking out about the plight of the Yazidis and other victims of genocide and religious persecution . Her voice breaking , she implored the president of the United States to help her people return safely to Iraq . Trump could barely look her in the eye . She told him that ISIS had murdered her mother and six brothers .

As he called his signals, a Houston Texans cornerback, Kareem Jackson, suddenly sprinted forward from a position four yards behind the defensive line. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. Jackson\u2019s timing was perfect. The ball was snapped. The Texans\u2019 left defensive end, J.J. Watt, sprinted to the outside, taking the Redskins\u2019 right tackle with him. The defensive tackle on Watt\u2019s right rushed to the inside, taking the offensive right guard with him. The result was a huge gap in the Redskins\u2019 line, through which Jackson could run unblocked. He quickly sacked Smith, for a loss of 13 yards. Special-teams players began taking the field for the punt. But Smith didn\u2019t get up. He rolled flat onto his back, pulled off his helmet, and covered his face with his hands. He was clearly in excruciating pain. The slow-motion replay immediately showed the television audience why: As Smith was tackled, his right leg had buckled sharply above the ankle, with his foot rotating significantly away from any direction in which a human foot ought to point. The play-by-play announcer Greg Gumbel said grimly, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back,\u201d and the network abruptly cut to a break. There was nothing more to say.\n\nEven without the benefit of medical training, and even without conducting a physical examination, viewers knew what had happened. They may not have known what the bones were called or what treatment would be required, but they knew more than enough, and they knew what really mattered: Smith had broken his leg, very badly. They knew that even if they were not orthopedists, did not have a medical degree, and had never cracked open a copy of Gray\u2019s Anatomy. They could tell\u2014they were certain\u2014something was seriously wrong. And so it is, or ought to be, with Donald Trump. You don\u2019t need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, and you don\u2019t need to be a mental-health professional to see that something\u2019s very seriously off with Trump\u2014particularly after nearly three years of watching his erratic and abnormal behavior in the White House. Questions about Trump\u2019s psychological stability have mounted throughout his presidency. But those questions have been coming even more frequently amid a recent escalation in Trump\u2019s bizarre behavior, as the pressures of his upcoming reelection campaign, a possibly deteriorating economy, and now a full-blown impeachment inquiry have mounted. And the questioners have included those who have worked most closely with him. No president in recent memory\u2014and likely no president ever\u2014has prompted more discussion about his mental stability and connection with reality. Trump\u2019s former chief of staff John Kelly is said to have described him as \u201cunhinged,\u201d and \u201coff the rails,\u201d and to have called the White House \u201cCrazytown\u201d because of Trump\u2019s unbalanced state. Trump\u2019s former deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, once reportedly discussed recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, the Constitution\u2019s provision addressing presidential disability, including mental disability.\n\nRead more: Donald Trump\u2019s 50 most unthinkable moments Rosenstein denies that claim, but it is not the only such account. A senior administration official, writing anonymously in The New York Times last September, described how, \u201cgiven the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment\u201d\u2014but \u201cno one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis.\u201d And NBC News last week quoted someone familiar with current discussions in the White House warning that there is \u201cincreasing wariness that, as this impeachment inquiry drags out, the likelihood increases that the president could respond erratically and become \u2018unmanageable.\u2019\u201d In September, a former White House official offered a similar assessment to a Business Insider reporter: \u201cNo one knows what to expect from him anymore,\u201d because \u201chis mood changes from one minute to the next based on some headline or tweet, and the next thing you know his entire schedule gets tossed out the window. He\u2019s losing his shit.\u201d Even a major investment bank has gotten into the mix, albeit in a roundabout way: JPMorgan Chase has created a \u201cVolfefe Index\u201d\u2014named after Trump\u2019s bizarre May 2017 \u201ccovfefe\u201d tweet\u2014designed to quantify the effect that Trump\u2019s impulsive tweets have on interest-rate volatility. The bank\u2019s press release understatedly observed that its \u201cvolatility fair value model\u201d shows that \u201cthe president\u2019s remarks on this social media platform [have] played a statistically significant role in elevating implied volatility.\u201d\n\nThe president isn\u2019t simply volatile and erratic, however\u2014he\u2019s also incapable of consistently telling the truth. Those who work closely with him, and who aren\u2019t in denial, must deal with Trump\u2019s lying about serious matters virtually every day. But as one former official put it, they \u201care used to the president saying things that aren\u2019t true,\u201d and have inured themselves to it. Trump\u2019s own former communications director Anthony Scaramucci has on multiple occasions described Trump as a liar, once saying, \u201cWe \u2026 know he\u2019s telling lies,\u201d so \u201cif you want me to say he\u2019s a liar, I\u2019m happy to say he\u2019s a liar.\u201d He went on to address Trump directly: \u201cYou should probably dial down the lying because you don\u2019t need to \u2026 So dial that down, and you\u2019ll be doing a lot better.\u201d That was good advice, but clearly wishful thinking. Trump simply can\u2019t dial down the lying, or turn it off\u2014even, his own attorneys suggest, when false statements may be punished as crimes. A lawyer who has represented him in business disputes once told me that Trump couldn\u2019t sensibly be allowed to speak with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, because Trump would \u201clie his ass off\u201d\u2014in effect, that Trump simply wasn\u2019t capable of telling the truth, about anything, and that if he ever spoke to a prosecutor, he\u2019d talk himself into jail. Trump\u2019s lawyers in the Russia investigation clearly agreed: As Bob Woodward recounts at length in his book Fear, members of Trump\u2019s criminal-defense team fought both Trump and Mueller tooth and nail to keep Trump from being interviewed by the Office of Special Counsel. A practice testimonial session ended with Trump spouting wild, baseless assertions in a rage. Woodward quotes Trump\u2019s outside counsel John Dowd as saying that Trump \u201cjust made something up\u201d in response to one question. \u201cThat\u2019s his nature.\u201d Woodward also recounts Dowd\u2019s thinking when he argued to Trump that the president was \u201cnot really capable\u201d of answering Mueller\u2019s questions face to face. Dowd had \u201cto dress it up as much as possible, to say, it\u2019s not your fault \u2026 He could not say what he knew was true: \u2018You\u2019re a fucking liar.\u2019 That was the problem.\u201d (Dowd disputes this account.) Which raises the question: If Trump can\u2019t tell the truth even when it counts most, with legal jeopardy on the line and lawyers there to help prepare him, is he able to apprehend the truth at all?\n\nBehavior like this is unusual, a point that journalists across the political spectrum have made. \u201cThis is not normal,\u201d Megan McArdle wrote in late August. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean that as in, \u2018Trump is violating the shibboleths of the Washington establishment.\u2019 I mean that as in, \u2018This is not normal for a functioning adult.\u2019\u201d James Fallows observed, also in August, that Trump is having \u201cepisodes of what would be called outright lunacy, if they occurred in any other setting,\u201d and that if he \u201cwere in virtually any other position of responsibility, action would already be under way to remove him from that role.\u201d Trump\u2019s erratic behavior has long been the subject of political criticism, late-night-television jokes, and even speculation about whether it\u2019s part of some incomprehensible, multidimensional strategic game. But it\u2019s relevant to whether he\u2019s fit for the office he holds. Simply put, Trump\u2019s ingrained and extreme behavioral characteristics make it impossible for him to carry out the duties of the presidency in the way the Constitution requires. To see why first requires a look at what the Constitution demands of a president, and then an examination of how Trump\u2019s behavioral characteristics preclude his ability to fulfill those demands. The Framers of the Constitution expected the presidency to be occupied by special individuals, selfless people of the highest character and ability. They intended the Electoral College to be a truly deliberative body, not the largely ceremonial institution it has become today. Because the Electoral College, unlike Congress and the state legislatures, wouldn\u2019t be a permanent body, and because it involved diffuse selections made in the various states, they hoped it would help avoid \u201ccabal, intrigue and corruption,\u201d as Alexander Hamilton put it in \u201cFederalist No. 68,\u201d and deter interference from \u201cthese most deadly adversaries of republican government,\u201d especially \u201cfrom the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.\u201d\n\nThough the Constitution\u2019s drafters could hardly have foreseen how the system would evolve, they certainly knew the kind of person they wanted it to produce. \u201cThe process of election affords a moral certainty,\u201d Hamilton wrote, \u201cthat the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.\u201d \u201cTalents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity,\u201d might suffice for someone to be elected to the governorship of a state, but not the presidency. Election would \u201crequire other talents, and a different kind of merit,\u201d to gain \u201cthe esteem and confidence of the whole Union,\u201d or enough of it to win the presidency. As a result, there would be \u201ca constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue.\u201d This was the Framers\u2019 goal in designing the system that would make \u201cthe choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided.\u201d Read more: The presidency is the hardest job in the world Hamilton\u2019s use of the word trust in The Federalist Papers to describe the presidency was no accident. The Framers intended that the president \u201cbe like a fiduciary, who must pursue the public interest in good faith republican fashion rather than pursuing his self-interest, and who must diligently and steadily execute Congress\u2019s commands,\u201d as a recent Harvard Law Review article puts it. The concept is akin to the law of private fiduciaries, which governs trustees of trusts and directors and officers of corporations, an area that has been central to my legal practice as a corporate litigator. \u201cIndeed,\u201d as the Harvard Law Review article explains, \u201cone might argue that what presents to us as private fiduciary law today had some of its genesis in the law of public officeholding.\u201d The overarching principle is that a fiduciary\u2014say, the CEO of a corporation\u2014when acting on behalf of a corporation, has to act in the corporation\u2019s best interests. Likewise, a trustee of a trust must use the assets for the benefit of the beneficiary, and not himself (a fundamental rule, incidentally, that Trump apparently couldn\u2019t adhere to with his own charitable foundation).\n\nIn providing for a national chief executive, the Framers incorporated the very similar law of public officeholding into his duties in two places in the Constitution\u2014in Article II, Section 3 (the president \u201cshall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\u201d), and in Article II, Section 1, Clause 8, which requires the president to \u201csolemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States.\u201d That language\u2014particularly the words faithfully execute\u2014was in 1787 \u201cvery commonly associated with the performance of public and private offices,\u201d the Harvard Law Review article points out, and \u201canyone experienced in law or government\u201d at that time would have recognized what it meant, \u201cbecause it was so basic to \u2026 the law of executive officeholding.\u201d In a nutshell, while carrying out his official duties, a president has to put the country, not himself, first; he must faithfully follow and enforce the law; and he must act with the utmost care in doing all that. But can Trump do all that? Does his personality allow him to? Answering those questions doesn\u2019t require mental-health expertise, nor does it really require a diagnosis. You can make the argument for Trump\u2019s unfitness without assessing his mental health: Like James Fallows, for example, you could just ask whether Trump would have been allowed to retain any other job in light of his bizarre conduct. At the same time, the presence of a mental disorder or disturbance doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to incapacity; to suggest otherwise would unfairly stigmatize tens of millions of Americans. Someone battling a serious psychological ailment can unquestionably function well, and even nobly, in high public office\u2014including as president. The country, in fact, has seen it: Abraham Lincoln endured \u201cno mere case of the blues\u201d; he suffered such \u201cterrible melancholly,\u201d said one of his contemporaries, that \u201che never dare[d] carry a knife in his pocket.\u201d Many historians speculate that he suffered from what we would now diagnose as clinical depression. Yet Lincoln\u2019s mechanisms for coping with his lifelong affliction may have supplied him with the vision, the creativity, and the moral fortitude to save the nation, to achieve for it a new birth of freedom. As a writer in this magazine once put it: Lincoln\u2019s \u201cpolitical vision drew power from personal experience \u2026 Prepared for defeat, and even for humiliation, he insisted on seeing the truth of both his personal circumstances and the national condition. And where the optimists of his time would fail, he would succeed, envisioning and articulating a durable idea of free society.\u201d\n\nMore than a diagnosis, what truly matters, as Lincoln\u2019s case shows, is the president\u2019s behavioral characteristics and personality traits. And understanding how people behave and think is not the sole province of professionals; we all do it every day, with family members, co-workers, and others. Nevertheless, how the mental-health community goes about categorizing those characteristics and traits can provide helpful guidance to laypeople by structuring our thinking about them. Read more: Donald Trump is not well And that\u2019s where the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders comes into play. The DSM, now in its fifth edition, \u201ccontains descriptions, symptoms, and other criteria for diagnosing mental disorders,\u201d and serves as the country\u2019s \u201cauthoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders.\u201d What\u2019s useful for nonprofessionals is that, for the most part, it\u2019s written in plain English, and its criteria consist largely of observable behaviors\u2014words and actions. That\u2019s especially true of its criteria for personality disorders\u2014they don\u2019t require a person to lie on a couch and confess his or her innermost thoughts. They turn on how a person behaves in the wild, so to speak. If anything, a patient\u2019s confessions in an office may disadvantage a clinician, because patients can and do conceal from clinicians central aspects of their true selves. If you can observe people going about their everyday business, you\u2019ll know a lot more about how they act and behave.\n\nAnd Donald Trump, as president of the United States, is probably the most observable and observed person in the world. I\u2019ve personally met and spoken with him only a few times, but anyone who knows him will tell you that Trump, in a way, has no facade: What you see of him publicly is what you get all the time, although you may get more of it in private. Any intelligent person who watches Trump closely on television, and pays careful attention to his words on Twitter and in the press, should be able to tell you as much about his behavior as a mental-health professional could. One scholarly paper has suggested that accounts of a person\u2019s behavior from laypeople who observe him might be more accurate than information from a clinical interview, and that this is especially true when considering two personality disorders in particular\u2014what the DSM calls narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. These two disorders just happen to be the ones that have most commonly been ascribed to Trump by mental-health professionals over the past four years. Of these two disorders, the more commonly discussed when it comes to Trump is narcissistic personality disorder, or NPD\u2014pathological narcissism. It\u2019s also more important in considering Trump\u2019s fitness for office, because it touches directly upon whether Trump has the capacity to put anyone\u2019s interests\u2014including the country\u2019s and the Constitution\u2019s\u2014above his own.\n\nNarcissus, the Greek mythological figure, was a boy who fell so in love with his own reflection in a pool of water that, according to one version of the story, he jumped in and drowned. Psychiatrists and psychologists now use the term narcissism to describe feelings of self-importance and self-love. As Craig Malkin, a clinical psychologist who has written extensively on the subject, has explained, narcissism is a trait that, to some extent, all human beings have: \u201cthe drive to feel special, to stand out from \u2026 other[s] \u2026 to feel exceptional or unique.\u201d A certain amount of narcissism is healthy, and helpful\u2014it brings with it confidence, optimism, and boldness. Someone with more than an average amount of narcissism may be called a narcissist. Many politicians, and many celebrities, could be considered narcissists; presidents seem especially likely to \u201crank high in extroverted narcissism,\u201d Malkin writes, although they have varied greatly in the degree of their narcissism. But extreme narcissism can be pathological, an illness\u2014and potentially a danger, as it was for Narcissus. \u201cPathological narcissism begins when people become so addicted to feeling special that, just like with any drug, they\u2019ll do anything to get their \u2018high,\u2019 including lie, steal, cheat, betray, and even hurt those closest to them,\u201d Malkin says. The \u201cfundamental life goal\u201d of an extreme narcissist \u201cis to promote the greatness of the self, for all to see,\u201d the psychologist Dan P. McAdams wrote in The Atlantic. To many mental-health professionals, Donald Trump provides a perfect example of such extreme, pathological narcissism: One clinical psychologist told Vanity Fair that he considers Trump such a \u201cclassic\u201d pathological narcissist that he is actually \u201carchiving video clips of him to use in workshops because there\u2019s no better example\u201d of the characteristics of the disorder he displays. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d this clinician explained, \u201cI would have had to hire actors and write vignettes. He\u2019s like a dream come true.\u201d Another clinical psychologist said that Trump displays \u201ctextbook narcissistic personality disorder.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees that Trump meets the diagnostic criteria for NPD. Allen Frances, a psychiatrist who helped write the disorder\u2019s entry in the DSM, has argued that a mental \u201cdisturbance\u201d becomes a \u201cdisorder\u201d only when, as the DSM puts it, the affliction \u201ccauses clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\u201d The idea behind this threshold is to separate \u201cmild forms\u201d of problems from pathological ones, \u201cin the absence of clear biological markers or clinically useful measurements of severity for many mental disorders.\u201d In Frances\u2019s view, that dividing line disqualifies Trump from having a disorder, particularly NPD. Trump \u201cmay be a world-class narcissist,\u201d he has written, \u201cbut this doesn\u2019t make him mentally ill, because he does not suffer from the distress and impairment required to diagnose mental disorder. Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy.\u201d But from the perspective of the public at large, the debate over whether Trump meets the clinical diagnostic criteria for NPD\u2014or whether psychiatrists can and should answer that question without directly examining him\u2014is beside the point. The goal of a diagnosis is to help a clinician guide treatment. The question facing the public is very different: Does the president of the United States exhibit a consistent pattern of behavior that suggests he is incapable of properly discharging the duties of his office?\n\nEven Trump\u2019s own allies recognize the degree of his narcissism. When he launched racist attacks on four congresswomen of color, Senator Lindsey Graham explained, \u201cThat\u2019s just the way he is. It\u2019s more narcissism than anything else.\u201d So, too, do skeptics of assigning a clinical diagnosis. \u201cNo one is denying,\u201d Frances told Rolling Stone, \u201cthat he is as narcissistic an individual as one is ever likely to encounter.\u201d The president\u2019s exceptional narcissism is his defining characteristic\u2014and understanding that is crucial to evaluating his fitness for office. Read more: Is something neurologically wrong with Donald Trump? The DSM-5 describes its conception of pathological narcissism this way: \u201cThe essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.\u201d The manual sets out nine diagnostic criteria that are indicative of the disorder, but only five of the nine need be present for a diagnosis of NPD to be made. Here are the nine: 1. Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements). 2. Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love. 3. Believes that he or she is \u201cspecial\u201d and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions). 4. Requires excessive admiration. 5. Has a sense of entitlement (i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations). 6. Is interpersonally exploitative (i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends) 7. Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings or needs of others. 8. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her. 9. Shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes. These criteria are accompanied by explanatory notes that seem relevant here: \u201cVulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very sensitive to \u2018injury\u2019 from criticism or defeat.\u201d And \u201ccriticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow and empty. They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack.\u201d The manual warns, moreover, that \u201cinterpersonal relations are typically impaired because of problems derived from entitlement, the need for admiration, and the relative disregard for the sensitivities of others.\u201d And, the DSM-5 adds, \u201cthough overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high achievement, performance may be disrupted because of intolerance of criticism or defeat.\u201d\n\nFinally, (7) Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings or needs of others? One of the most striking aspects of Trump\u2019s personality is his utter and complete lack of empathy. By empathy, psychologists and psychiatrists mean the ability to understand or relate to what someone else is experiencing\u2014the capacity to envision someone else\u2019s feelings, perceptions, and thoughts. The notorious lawyer and fixer Roy Cohn, who once counseled Trump, said that \u201cDonald pisses ice water,\u201d and indeed, examples of Trump\u2019s utter lack of normal human empathy abound. Trump himself has told the story of a charity ball\u2014an \u201cincredible ball\u201d\u2014he once held at Mar-a-Lago for the Red Cross. \u201cSo what happens is, this guy falls off right on his face, hits his head, and I thought he died \u2026 His wife is screaming\u2014she\u2019s sitting right next to him, and she\u2019s screaming.\u201d By his own account, Trump\u2019s concern wasn\u2019t the poor man\u2019s well-being or his wife\u2019s. It was the bloody mess on his expensive floor. \u201cYou know, beautiful marble floor, didn\u2019t look like it. It changed color. Became very red \u2026 I said, \u2018Oh, my God, that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019 and I turned away. I couldn\u2019t, you know, he was right in front of me and I turned away.\u201d Trump describes himself as saying, after the injured man was hauled away on a makeshift stretcher, \u201c\u2018Get that blood cleaned up! It\u2019s disgusting!\u2019 The next day, I forgot to call [the man] to say is he okay \u2026 It\u2019s just not my thing.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was 9/11. Trump gave an extraordinary call-in interview to a metropolitan\u2013New York television station just hours after the Twin Towers collapsed. He was asked whether one of his downtown buildings, 40 Wall Street, had suffered any damage. Trump\u2019s immediate response was to brag about the building\u2019s brand-new ranking among New York skyscrapers: \u201c40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest\u2014and then when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second-tallest. And now it\u2019s the tallest.\u201d (This wasn\u2019t even true\u2014a building a block away from Trump\u2019s, 70 Pine Street, was a little taller.) That human empathy isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s thing has been demonstrated time and again during his presidency as well. In October 2017, he reportedly told the widow of a serviceman killed in action \u201csomething to the effect that \u2018he knew what he was getting into when he signed up, but I guess it hurts anyway.\u2019\u201d (Trump later claimed that this account was \u201cfabricated \u2026 Sad!\u201d and that \u201cI have proof,\u201d but of course he never produced any.) On a less macabre note, on Christmas Eve last year, Trump took calls on NORAD\u2019s Santa Tracker phone line, which children call to find out where Santa Claus is as he makes his rounds. Trump asked a 7-year-old girl from South Carolina: \u201cAre you still a believer in Santa? Because at 7, it\u2019s marginal, right?\u201d\n\nAccording to Woodward\u2019s Fear, when Trump\u2019s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, resigned, he found out about his replacement when he saw a tweet from Trump saying that he had appointed John Kelly as the new chief of staff\u2014moments after Priebus and Trump had spoken about waiting to announce the news. Kelly was appalled, and that night apologetically told Priebus, \u201cI\u2019d never do this to you. I\u2019d never been offered this job until the tweet came out. I would have told you.\u201d His predecessor, though, wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cIt made no sense, Priebus realized, unless you understood \u2026 \u2018The president has zero psychological ability to recognize empathy or pity in any way.\u2019\u201d Priebus apparently isn\u2019t the only White House staffer to have learned this; in February 2018, when Trump met with survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and their loved ones, his communications aide actually gave him a note card that made clear that \u201cthe president needed to be reminded to show compassion and understanding to traumatized survivors,\u201d as The New York Times put it. The empathy cheat sheet contained a reminder to say such things as \u201cI hear you.\u201d One aide to President Obama told the Times that had she and her colleagues given their boss such a reminder card, \u201che would have looked at us like we were crazy people.\u201d Most recently, in July of this year, in a stunning scene captured on video, Trump met in the Oval Office with the human-rights activist Nadia Murad, a Yazidi Iraqi who had been captured, raped, and tortured by the Islamic State, and had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 for speaking out about the plight of the Yazidis and other victims of genocide and religious persecution. Her voice breaking, she implored the president of the United States to help her people return safely to Iraq. Trump could barely look her in the eye. She told him that ISIS had murdered her mother and six brothers. Trump, apparently not paying much attention, asked, \u201cWhere are they now?\u201d \u201cThey killed them,\u201d she said once again. \u201cThey are in the mass grave in Sinjar, and I\u2019m still fighting just to live in safety.\u201d Trump, who has publicly said that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, seemed interested in the conversation only at the end, when he asked Murad about why she won the prize.\n\nAnother equally unforgettable video documents Trump visiting Puerto Rico shortly after Hurricane Maria, tossing rolls of paper towels into a crowd of victims. He later responded vindictively to charges that his administration hadn\u2019t done enough to help the island, prompting the mayor of San Juan to observe that Trump had \u201caugmented\u201d Puerto Rico\u2019s \u201cdevastating human crisis \u2026 because he made it about himself, not about saving our lives,\u201d and because \u201cwhen expected to show empathy he showed disdain and lack of respect.\u201d In October 2018, a gunman burst into Shabbat morning services at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh and sprayed worshippers with semiautomatic-rifle and pistol fire. Eleven people died. Three days later, the president and first lady visited the community, and the day after that, the first thing Trump tweeted about the visit was this: \u201cMelania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day. We were treated so warmly. Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite\u2014Disgraceful!\u201d Similarly, after gunmen killed dozens in the span of a single August weekend in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, Trump went on a one-day sympathy tour that was marked by attacks on his hosts and on political enemies, and an obsessive focus on himself.
