    "content": "Barney Frank spent a whopping 32 years of his life as a U.S. congressman , and retired at a time when his party \u2019 s chances of retaking the House majority looked pretty grim . So when the onetime representative of Massachusetts \u2019 4th District announced in 2011 that he was calling it a career , I couldn \u2019 t really blame him . All the same , I must admit that as I read through his recent interview with Reuters \u2014 a wide-ranger in which Frank \u2019 s in his usual witty , incisive and cantankerous form \u2014 I felt a bit melancholy over what the federal government , and liberalism itself , has lost .\nThe whole thing is worth your time , but if I had to pick one section of the interview that seemed the most distinctly Barney Frank-esque , it would have to be the moment when the former congressman takes aim not at favorite liberal targets like Chris Christie or Jeb Bush but at two liberal heroes : Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert . \u201c The press is very different today , \u201d Frank told Reuters , comparing the current media landscape to the one of 20 years ago . Calling it \u201c a major contributing factor to pro-right-wing , anti-government feeling , \u201d Frank argued that the media had anything but a liberal bias . \u201c [ E ] ven the liberal press is anti-government , \u201d Frank complained . \u201c Ever watched Jon Stewart say anything good about government ? \u201d\nAccording to Frank , Stewart and Colbert go wrong by letting a general weariness of the corruption and plasticity of American politics blind them to recognizing the difference between the left and the right . Using Bill Maher as a contrast , Frank said that the HBO host is \u201c very funny , but also has good and bad guys on the show. \u201d As a result , Maher \u2019 s viewers , Frank argued , can determine for themselves which side they found more persuasive . On the other hand , Frank said , \u201c You come away from Stewart and especially Colbert \u201d believing that all politicians are \u201c assholes. \u201d Both sides are terrible , in other words , so why bother ?\nI \u2019 m not sure Frank \u2019 s setup here can withstand strict scrutiny ( if Maher \u2019 s establishing \u201c bad guys , \u201d can it really be said that he \u2019 s letting his audience make up its own mind ? ) ; and I definitely think it \u2019 s a mistake to lump Colbert and Stewart together as he does . But at least as far as Stewart and \u201c The Daily Show \u201d goes , I believe Frank \u2019 s got a point \u2014 and a good one at that . I \u2019 ve written previously about why I find Stewart \u2019 s habit of saying he \u2019 s \u201c just a comedian \u201d whenever he \u2019 s challenged so annoying . But what Frank \u2019 s getting at is different , and is more about Stewart \u2019 s overall approach . More than \u201c The Colbert Report \u201d or Maher \u2019 s stand-up and HBO series , \u201c The Daily Show \u201d tends to inspire glib cynicism more than outrage or understanding . But I \u2019 d argue it \u2019 s the show \u2019 s utter dependence on Jon Stewart , Media Personality \u2014 not an \u201c anti-government \u201d inclination \u2014 that explains the reason why .\nWhen I say \u201c Jon Stewart , Media Personality , \u201d what I mean to emphasize is the difference between being a television host or a comedian \u2014 like Maher and Colbert \u2014 and being a celebrity who \u2019 s popular due to his skill at connecting with his audience . Because while I \u2019 m sure there are many people out there who ( wrongly ) still think Jon Stewart is funny , the strength of \u201c The Daily Show \u201d for years now has been its writing and \u201c correspondents \u201d more than its host \u2019 s incessant mugging . What Stewart still excels at , however , is making his audience feel not only like they know and understand him , but like he knows and understands them in turn . During moments of crisis or tragedy , this can be a small blessing , since it creates a space where \u201c The Daily Show \u2019 s \u201d liberal , secular and cosmopolitan audience can feel like part of a larger community .\nBut much more often , the result of \u201c The Daily Show \u2019 s \u201d reliance on Jon Stewart , Media Personality , is to leave its audience with an understanding of politics that suffers from Stewart \u2019 s weakness for the superficial . Sen. John McCain , for example , may support myriad policies that Stewart finds objectionable \u2014 most especially those involving the killing and maiming of other people \u2014 but because McCain is witty , personable and seemingly forthright , he \u2019 ll always have a spot in \u201c The Daily Show \u2019 s \u201d heart ( albeit one that \u2019 s less luxurious than it used to be ) . Along the same lines , Stewart has a penchant for sneering at political activists who promote all the same causes as he might , but do so without his signature ( and glib ) ironic distance . By focusing so heavily on the style of politics rather than the substance , Stewart leaves his audience with the mistaken impression that , ultimately , none of it really matters .\nIt \u2019 s the shallowness of Stewart \u2019 s politics that leads to his other notable weakness as a political pundit ( which , \u201c just a comedian \u201d protestations aside , he clearly is ) ; namely , his tendency to fall prey to the trap of blaming \u201c both sides. \u201d As the journalist Sasha Issenberg once snarked , there are times when Stewart \u2019 s desperation to maintain his cooler-than-thou remove from the political process ends up making him sound like \u201c a David Broder column with punchlines. \u201d Like Broder , the now-deceased legendary reporter who became known as the \u201c dean of the Washington press corps , \u201d Stewart can be so worried about sounding partisan , and thus losing his straight-shooter credibility , that he can make arguments and jokes that are insincere on their face . Predictably , this tic has been more obvious in the Obama years \u2014 like when he tried to give the conservative ( and thinly veiled ) Obama-needs-a-teleprompter meme a \u201c Daily Show \u201d spin .\nTake a look at Stewart 's interview with President Obama in 2010 as a case in point . Aired around the same time as Stewart was organizing and starring in his `` Rally to Restore Sanity '' \u2014 which asked tens of thousands of `` Daily Show '' fans to congregate in Washington in order to ... ask both sides , politely , to adhere to an ill-defined , ahistorical standard of reasoned discourse \u2014 he was venting to the president about all of his frustration and disappointment . `` So here you are , you 're two years into your administration , '' Stewart complained at one point , `` and the question that arises in my mind [ is ] : Are we the people we were waiting for or does it turn out those people are still out there and we do n't have their number ? '' It was a decent zinger , hoisting Obama 's famous 2008 campaign slogan on its own petard . But coming as it did from a guy who mocks activists , ridicules earnestness and downplays the sincerity of the left and right 's political differences , it was annoying as well as hypocritical .\nSo while I 'd quibble with Frank 's conclusion that Stewart is `` anti-government , '' I 'd still say he had more than a little bit of a point . If liberals want to see more of the kind of direct action that 's characterized the Occupy Wall Street and # blacklivesmatter movements \u2014 if they really want to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable \u2014 they 're going to have to embrace a political vision that has grown beyond the idiosyncratic limitations of Jon Stewart .",
