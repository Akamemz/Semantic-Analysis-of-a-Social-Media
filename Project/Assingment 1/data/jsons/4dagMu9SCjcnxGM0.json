    "content": "The Mueller probe appears to be in the home stretch .\nSome Trump aides and advisers have been making that claim for more than a year , with little basis . But the signs are mounting that it \u2019 s finally happening .\nSeveral came in what was an unusually busy week for Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation into 2016 Russian election interference , with multiple clues that the special counsel \u2019 s work is finishing with a final report to the Justice Department .\nOn Wednesday , a federal judge handed a second prison sentence to Paul Manafort . That closed the book on Mueller \u2019 s prosecution of the former Trump campaign chairman , which will put Manafort in jail through the end of 2024 if President Donald Trump doesn \u2019 t pardon him or commute the sentence .\nMeanwhile other clues emerged this week suggesting that Mueller \u2019 s probe is coming to an end . On Tuesday , the special counsel \u2019 s lawyers told a federal judge that they have all the information they need from former national security adviser Michael Flynn , who has been cooperating with Mueller \u2019 s team since he pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI .\nTwo key members of Mueller \u2019 s team are also moving on . The FBI confirmed a week ago Friday that its lead agent assigned to the special counsel \u2019 s team has been reassigned to lead the bureau \u2019 s Richmond field office . And a Mueller spokesman on Thursday issued a rare public statement confirming that one the office \u2019 s prosecutors , Andrew Weissmann , planned to finish his assignment \u201c in the near future . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

And I do not believe he would leave if he thought major new veins of information and significant charges were still to come , \u201d he added .\nWhile Mueller and his Justice Department supervisors aren \u2019 t saying anything official about the conclusion of the special counsel \u2019 s work , Congress is getting ready for the big moment .

On Thursday , a judge set Nov. 5 as the opening date in the trial of former Trump political adviser Roger Stone on charges that he lied to Congress about efforts to contact Wikileaks during the 2016 campaign .\nHere \u2019 s a recap of all the week \u2019 s major events in the Mueller probe :\nPaul Manafort : The former Trump campaign chairman finally learned how long he \u2019 ll spend in federal prison \u2014 nearly 7.5 years \u2014 after U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Wednesday meted out the final portion of his sentence for a series of lobbying and obstruction crimes that were folded into Manafort \u2019 s guilty plea last fall .\nJackson agreed with U.S. District Court Judge T.S . Ellis III , who sentenced Manafort earlier this month separately for his conviction in Virginia on financial fraud , that the longtime GOP operative can get credit for the nine months he \u2019 s already served at a pair of interim detention facilities since being jailed last June for witness tampering .\nManafort \u2019 s lawyers have asked that the rest of his sentence be served in Cumberland , Maryland , though that decision rests with the Federal Bureau of Prisons .\nFederal prosecutors also have moved to begin seeking restitution from Manafort for about $ 24 million tied to his crimes , which involves forfeiting several of his New York properties , plus bank accounts and a life insurance policy . He also must pay a $ 50,000 fine .\nManafort still appears to be playing for a Trump pardon or commutation of his sentence . Outside the D.C. courthouse this week , Manafort lawyer Kevin Downing invoked a favorite presidential talking point : that Mueller had revealed no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign , even though his client \u2019 s case never was about the topic . Mueller tried Manafort on charges related to his lucrative political work in Ukraine , which ended prior to the 2016 election .\nBut any help from Trump can \u2019 t protect Manafort from new charges he faces in New York , where the Manhattan district attorney obtained a 16-count grand jury indictment on Wednesday for residential mortgage fraud and other alleged state crimes . A presidential pardon can not absolve a person convicted at the state level .\nRoger Stone : The longtime Trump associate got an early November trial date for allegedly misleading lawmakers about his 2016 contacts with WikiLeaks , which released thousands of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign aides . That means D.C. jurors will begin to hear his case just as the one-year countdown begins to the next presidential election .\nStone \u2019 s lawyers during a court hearing Thursday acknowledged receiving nine terabytes of material from the government in discovery , which they said stacks up \u201c as high as the Washington Monument twice. \u201d His lawyers also got an April 12 deadline to file any motions seeking to toss out the case , something they signaled they plan to do in earlier filings that cited \u201c selective or vindictive prosecution \u201d and an \u201c error in the grand jury proceeding . \u201d\nMueller \u2019 s plans for trying Stone are unclear . Special counsel deputy Jeannie Rhee took the lead participating in Thursday \u2019 s hearing for the prosecution while the soon-to-depart Weissmann made an appearance in the courtroom , seated just inside the courtroom bar with other support staff . The government also has two assistant U.S. attorneys from D.C. who are widely seen as being ready for a hand-off should the special counsel close up shop before November .\nFor his part , Stone blasted out a fundraising plea Thursday night featuring a picture of him , his wife and Trump . Stone said he needs money to defeat the special counsel \u2019 s charges and \u201c be free to help the President \u2019 s re-election in 2020 . \u201d\nMichael Flynn : The former Trump national security adviser continues to heed the advice of U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan , who in December urged Flynn to wait until he \u2019 d exhausted all cooperation demands before agreeing to be sentenced .\nOn Wednesday , Mueller \u2019 s prosecutors in a joint status report acknowledged Flynn could still be called to testify in the government \u2019 s upcoming trial against his former business partner , Bijan Rafiekian , on charges of failing to disclose foreign lobbying on behalf of Turkey . But the special counsel \u2019 s office also noted they view Flynn \u2019 s cooperation as \u201c otherwise complete . \u201d\nIn a separate court filing related to the Rafiekian case , defense attorneys revealed this week they \u2019 d seen FBI interview notes that suggest Flynn had helped prosecutors in several \u201c ongoing investigations. \u201d Government lawyers during a Friday hearing indicated some of those investigations involve Mueller \u2019 s office and some involve other prosecutors , though they didn \u2019 t delve into specifics .\nRick Gates : The former Trump campaign deputy is still cooperating with federal prosecutors in \u201c several ongoing investigations \u201d and isn \u2019 t ready to be sentenced yet .\nThat was the takeaway from a one-page joint status report filed in federal court in D.C. , the fifth of its kind since Gates pleaded guilty last February to financial fraud and lying to investigators .\nIt \u2019 s unclear whether Gates \u2019 ongoing cooperation still involves the Mueller probe . But Friday \u2019 s filing suggests Gates may be helping federal prosecutors in New York who are investigating Trump \u2019 s inauguration committee , which he helped run alongside real estate developer and longtime Trump friend Tom Barrack .
