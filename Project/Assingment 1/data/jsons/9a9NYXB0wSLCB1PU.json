    "content": "After a week spent shifting his position on climate change , Rep. Cory Gardner , the Republican challenging Mark Udall of Colorado for his Senate seat , finally met his match : the yes-or-no question .\nIn a debate Tuesday night , the Colorado candidate was asked to give a simple , one-word answer to the question of whether `` humans are contributing significantly to climate change . ''\nHe could n't do it . Even though , as the debate 's monitor explained to him , he 'd later get a full minute to explain his answer . Even though the scientific community overwhelmingly agrees that human activity is the main cause of climate change .\n`` Look , this is an important issue and I do n't think you can say yes or no , '' Gardner plead . He got the first part right .\nAlso this week , over in Kentucky , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell spent an excruciating 14 minutes on a sports radio program , which only got more awkward when host Matt Jones asked him whether or not he believes in global warming .\n\u201c What I have said repeatedly is I \u2019 m not a scientist , '' he replied , getting off to an inauspicious start . `` But what I can tell you is , even if you thought that was important -- and there are some scientists who do and some scientists who don \u2019 t -- but even if you thought that was important , the United States doing this by itself is going to have zero impact . ''\n`` Senator , that 's a 'yes or no ' question , '' Jones pushed . `` Do you believe in global warming ? ''\n`` No it is n't . It is not a yes or no question , '' McConnell snapped . `` There are differences of opinion among scientists . My job is to try to protect jobs in Kentucky now , not speculate about science in the future . ''\nIn New Hampshire , meanwhile , Senate candidate Scott Brown had some difficulty defining his own stance on climate : Is climate change `` absolutely '' real and caused by a combination of man-made and natural factors , as he claimed in 2012 , not scientifically proven , as he asserted in late August , or , wait , actually , the first one : Monday night , Brown was back to the `` real and caused by a combination of factors '' stance , which his campaign confirms is his actual position .\nThese pols may not be scientists , but they 're not stupid . Gardner himself acknowledged , just a day before the debate , that `` there is no doubt that pollution contributes to the climate changing around us . '' And McConnell ... well , he still denies , against all evidence to the contrary , that the climate is even changing . But if anything , we should probably just call him stubborn .\nPrivately , Bloomberg recently reported , many Republicans in office do believe that humans are causing climate change -- as do 52 percent of their constituency -- and that something needs to be done . But what these self-contradicting Republicans , so keen to boast of their lack of scientific education , seem to be realizing that when it comes to climate change , there 's no safe place to stand .\nThings were n't always so complicated . Legend has it , prominent Republicans once readily believed that man-made climate change was happening and , having accepted the science , took the natural next step of supporting climate action . `` We stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world that time is short and the dangers are great , '' John McCain said during his 2008 presidential campaign . And so , `` we need to think straight about the dangers ahead and to meet the problem with all the resources of human ingenuity at our disposal . ''\nObviously , things have changed . By March of this year , McCain had dialed things way back , telling Time that , while he 's still interested in climate change , `` I just leave the issue alone because I don \u2019 t see a way through it . '' So much for the power of human ingenuity .\nAccording to Bloomberg , McCain 's current position is the one most Republicans have found themselves caught in : believing that not much is going to happen , legislatively , to make a significant difference in greenhouse gas emissions . So they 're better off , the thinking goes , keeping the Tea Party happy by bowing out of the debate entirely -- by trying to change the subject , by using their lack of scientific degree to disqualify them from stating an opinion and by hedging , avoiding , at all costs , that yes-or-no question .\nBut here 's the problem for these politicians : 400,000 people marching in the streets of New York say leaders can no longer ignore the issue and hope it goes away . What we 're seeing now is politicians confronted with the awkwardness of finding a position on climate that 's both politically tenable and yet not entirely mockable . They 're damned if they do , damned if they do n't : Answer the question with a no , and they 'll be slapped with the cold , hard facts , their anti-science stance putting them at risk of alienating moderate and younger voters . But acknowledge that there is a problem , and they 're basically making the de-facto admission that something has to be done to solve it .\nThat 's what Gardner was trying to get around in his wordy answer to a simple question . The congressman understands that a `` yes '' implies a need for action , and as such had to qualify his response with the assertion that climate change , while happening , is n't the big deal the media makes it out to be . It 's why McConnell , in the same breath in which he was disavowing the reality of climate change , also argued that any steps the U.S. took to reduce emissions would n't have a significant impact .\nBut those qualifiers , too , fall apart under scrutiny . The `` highly conservative '' U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found , in its most recent report , that we 're already feeling the effects of climate change , and that , barring significant action to reduce emissions , they 're only going to get worse . Even in the best-case scenario , the one seized upon by Gardner in Brown , in which humans turn out to have the least possible effect on the climate , we 'll still only be able to avoid the most dangerous effects of warming if our extremely good luck is coupled with aggressive steps taken to reduce emissions . A failure to take action on the part of the U.S. , regardless of how effective that action turns out to be , is tantamount to throwing in the towel , and allowing us all to continue on a course we might not be able to recover from .\nAnd a defeatist attitude like that does not make for a very electable candidate .\nSo what 's a Republican hoping to stake out a viable position on climate change to do ? None of the candidates seem to have figured that out , hence all the stammering , bumbling and self-contradiction every time the issue is raised . Perhaps the answer is simply that there is n't an answer ; at least , not one that 's both based in reality and tenable for the party as it currently operates . But seeing as how the science is only getting stronger , and the impacts of climate change more and more apparent , the GOP had best get busy working on an answer they can live with . Because the question is n't going away .",
