''\n`` We can not have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States , '' Obama warned . `` Let 's not get into that way of doing business . ''\nThe President also made clear that he would respond to the cyberattack `` forcefully '' and at a time of his choosing but did n't specifically say what he would do .\nObama opened the 50-minute session with a 'Morning in America '' moment -- making his most explicit case yet that his leadership has led the nation out of the darkness of economic pain to sunnier times .\n`` Take any metric you want . America 's resurgence is real . We are better off , '' Obama said told journalists , before he leaves wintry Washington for his annual vacation in his balmy home state of Hawaii .\n'We are better positioned than we have been for a very long time , '' said Obama who has for years been reluctant to publicly tout his achievements on the economy because the recovery has been uneven and so many Americans have been left behind .\n`` We are better positioned than we have been in a very long time , and the future is ready to be written . We 've set the stage for this American moment , '' Obama said .\nThe President rattled off a string of economic success , proclaiming he had created `` more jobs , more people insured , a growing economy , shrinking deficits , bustling industry , booming energy . ''\nHe also sought to try to extricate himself from the aura of crisis that has stifled his administration for much of a year marked by the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and the horror of Ebola in west Africa and racial tension everywhere from Ferguson , Missouri , to New York .\n`` Yes , there were crises that we had to tackle around the world -- many that were unanticipated , '' Obama said . `` We have more work to do to make sure our economy , our justice system and our government work not just for the few but the many . But there is no doubt we can enter into the new year with renewed confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts . ''\nDespite feuding with the GOP for much of his administration , Obama offered some home that he and his foes will be able to get something done . He said tax reform was one area where he and the GOP could get together .\nBut he showed no sign of compromise on the Keystone XL pipeline which would carry oil from Canada 's tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico , which Republicans leaders have said will be the first order of business in January .\nHe said the project , which environmentalists say will worsen global warming , is `` not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S . consumers . ''\nObama did n't threaten to veto a bill that would take approval of the 1,179-mile , pipeline out of the State Department 's hands but said Republicans should work with him to create jobs if they were so concerned about employment .\nThe President also defended his bombshell announcement this week that he would end a half-century of estrangement with Cuba by establishing diplomatic relations and seeking to expand trade and travel to the communist island .\n`` I do n't anticipate overnight changes . But what I know deep in my bones is that if you 've done the same thing for 50 years and nothing 's changed , you should try something different if you want a different outcome , '' he said . `` Suddenly Cuba is open to the world in ways that it has not been before . ''\nRepublicans , including potential 2016 presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio reacted angrily to Obama 's move , saying he had rewarded a brutal dictatorship and ignored the need to promote human rights .\nObama again proved himself more open to talking more freely about race than he had in his first term , reflecting on what needed to be done after several young men died in confrontations with white police officers , sparking mass protests and a consuming national debate .\n`` This is n't a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying , '' he said . `` I think that troubles everybody . So there 's an opportunity for all of us to come together and take a practical approach to these problems . ''\nObama largely steered clear of some of the intractable foreign crises that have exhausted his White House in recent weeks , including the rise of ISIS , the vicious civil war in Syria and the worst showdown with Russia since the end of the Cold War .\nInstead , he appeared to be in an almost mischievous mood .\nHe teased several top network television correspondents in the front row that they were n't on the list of questioners handed him by spokesman Josh Earnest because `` you 've been naughty .
