Michael D \u2019 Antonio is author of Never Enough : Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success .\nIf Donald Trump is nothing else , he \u2019 s an American brand . The Trump name adorns luxury condominiums , hotels and golf courses around the world ; it has sold a TV show , millions of books , a line of cologne and even , briefly , an airline .\nAnd that brand , according to new data published here in \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine for the first time , is taking a major hit in the wake of his presidential campaign .\nTrump has built his distinctive trademark over the course of decades in public life , turning his own wealth , glamorous lifestyle and personality into emblems of his multi-billion dollar company through endless self-promotion . Trump considers this reputation alone a hugely significant part of his business : Financial documents the candidate released earlier this year set the value of his company \u2019 s \u201c deals , brand and branded developments \u201d at $ 3 billion , which makes his name the single most significant item in his portfolio . Trump \u2019 s brand was also his first great advantage as a presidential candidate , giving him name recognition and the gloss of success that even a Bush might envy .\nBut as Trump the candidate has ascended , hitting the top of the polls and staying there thanks to a series of controversial statements and a groundswell of Republican populist support , the opposite has happened to Trump the brand : Among the people Trump \u2019 s business depends on\u2014the consumer making over $ 100,000 a year\u2014the value of the Trump name is collapsing .\nA December survey of American consumer opinion , fielded by the BAV Consulting division of advertising and marketing giant Young & Rubicam ( and the largest and longest running study of brands in the world ) , found that since Donald Trump \u2019 s run for president , the Trump brand has lost the confidence of the people who can afford to stay at one of his hotels , play at one of his country clubs or purchase a home in one of his developments . It is also rapidly losing its association with the gilded traits Trump has long promoted as the essence of his business .\nIn categories such as \u201c prestigious , \u201d \u201c upper class \u201d and \u201c glamorous \u201d the Trump name has plummeted among high-income consumers . Within the same group , it is also losing its connection with the terms \u201c leader , \u201d \u201c dynamic \u201d and \u201c innovative \u201d \u2014quite a blow for a man who criticizes others for being \u201c low energy \u201d and considers himself an industry trailblazer . The brand has been a survey subject for BAV Consulting \u2019 s regular surveys for over a decade and has never before experienced such a precipitous drop in reputation . It \u2019 s the kind of change that usually follows a big corporate scandal , like a product recall or financial misconduct . But in Trump \u2019 s case it \u2019 s a man \u2019 s personality that is in play .\nThe billionaire Trump might brush off complaints about his politics ; he might even shrug off short-term commercial losses . But this plunge in brand status would be seen as a crisis in the offices of any major consumer-oriented company . Public companies often claim losses in net worth when customers turn against them because of a public relations disaster ; they call it a decline in \u201c goodwill. \u201d As a private corporation , the Trump Organization is not obligated to report any such a decline\u2014or to report it accurately\u2014but any CEO will tell you that a brand deterioration like this is likely to have a significant financial impact , affecting sales , borrowing and even efforts to attract high quality employees .\nThe first visible signs of the commercial cost associated with Trump \u2019 s extreme politics came after his inflammatory comments about undocumented Mexican immigrants , which he made as he announced his candidacy last June . NBC quickly dumped him as host of Celebrity Apprentice , a gig that netted him millions of dollars per year . Univision , Macy \u2019 s , Serta and others began unwinding marketing relationships with him . More recently , real estate partners have talked of taking his name off developments , and a home furnishings retailer in the Middle East took Trump products off display . In Vancouver , 50,000 people have petitioned to prevent the brand name from decorating a skyscraper under construction .\nLess visible , but no less important , are hits Trump has taken among his target consumer base : the luxury , or \u201c aspirational \u201d market of those making over $ 100,000 a year . The wealthiest respondents in the BAV survey\u2014those with incomes over $ 150,000\u2014judge Trump the harshest of any income bracket . In this group , as measured by BAV \u2019 s consumer opinion index , Trump \u2019 s reputation for being \u201c obliging \u201d and \u201c upper class \u201d has declined by more than 50 percent since the outset of the campaign , followed by \u201c leader \u201d ( with a 41 percent decline ) and \u201c prestigious \u201d ( down by 39 percent ) . The next lower income level\u2014households making between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000\u2014wasn \u2019 t much kinder , with a 56 percent decline for \u201c obliging , \u201d a 45 percent decline in \u201c prestigious \u201d and a 38 percent drop for \u201c upper class . \u201d\nEven the one notable upward spike in Trump traits\u2014the wealthiest view the Trump brand as 65 percent more \u201c traditional \u201d than they did when the trait was measured before the campaign\u2014points to commercial trouble . Although Trump \u2019 s political loyalists might cheer his standing as a traditional figure , this quality is not a good thing for a business seeking to sell glamour and luxury . In commercial terms , other products that are deemed \u201c traditional \u201d are the canned meat product Spam and Idaho potatoes .\nIn interviews we conducted before the campaign , Trump \u2019 s children , who work in his companies , acknowledged that their father is the brand and that he will dominate its marketing for the rest of his days . \u201c He became synonymous with success and aspiration , \u201d noted daughter Ivanka . \u201c That is still at the core of what the brand is today . \u201d\nBut the challenge of a brand future clouded by his father \u2019 s polarizing views was on Donald Trump .

The answer is 100-percent , \u201d Donald Jr. said . \u201c He will be out there , and he will question these things in a way that you don \u2019 t see anyone doing today\u2014or certainly not anyone that has a brand . \u2026 There could be potentially ramifications to his business for taking these stances . \u201d\nHow serious will these ramifications be ?
