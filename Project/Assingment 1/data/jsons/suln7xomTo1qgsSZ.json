Marsha Blackburn in her tight Senate race against the state 's Democratic ex-Gov . Phil Bredesen for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker .\nTrump praised Blackburn as a `` true fighter '' for the state , telling the crowd , `` She 's all about Tennessee values . ''\n`` A vote for Marsha is really a vote for me , '' he said .\nBredesen , like other Democratic candidates across Trump country , has painted himself as a pragmatist willing to work with the president on certain issues . The Tennessee campaign is among several closely watched races expected to determine control of the Senate , where Republicans are desperate to defend a narrow two-seat majority in the face of surging Democratic enthusiasm .\nAnd the stakes could n't be clearer . The rally came as the FBI investigated sexual misconduct allegations against Trump 's Supreme Court nominee , Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 a probe that was forced by a small group of undecided senators who could doom the nomination . Earlier Monday , Trump disputed reports that his White House tried to narrow the scope of the probe and limit which witnesses the FBI could interview , saying he wants them `` to do a very comprehensive investigation , whatever that means . ''\nBut Trump was far less sympathetic in front of his enthusiastic rally crowd , accusing Democrats of trying to slow down the investigation and insisting that nothing will come of it .\n`` If we took 10 years , they 'd want more time , '' he complained , charging that Democratic senators are `` willing to do anything or hurt anyone '' to subvert his agenda , including taking down his nominee .\n`` They 're trying to destroy a very fine person , and we ca n't let it happen , '' Trump said .\nKavanaugh has staunchly denied allegations now leveled by multiple women , including one who testified that he pinned her against a bed , groped her , tried to take her clothes off and covered her mouth to silence her when they were in high school .\nThe rally was the first of a busy week of campaign travel for the president that will take him to states including Mississippi , Minnesota and Kansas .\nPreviewing his own re-election playbook , Trump criticized a number of rumored 2020 presidential opponents , including Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey , Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden .\n`` We call him 1 percent Biden , '' said Trump , claiming that his political career was finished until former President Barack Obama `` took him off the trash heap . ''\nTrump , who railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement during his 2016 campaign , also hailed the revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico unveiled late Sunday , drawing loud cheers from his crowd .\n`` It 's fair , it 's modern and it 's balanced , '' Trump said . `` America 's winning again . ''\nBut Trump spent far more time railing against `` radical Democrats , '' who he said had been `` in a blind rage '' since his election win .\n`` They 've gone crazy , '' he said . `` Trying to burn our future down . ''\nBlackburn 's contest , in a state that Trump won by 26 points , has drawn heavy interest from the White House , with repeat visits by both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence .\nBredesen has tried to distance himself from the national Democratic Party , presenting himself as an independent thinker who will support Trump 's policies when they 're beneficial to the state .\nThe former two-term governor , who would be the first Democrat to win a Senate campaign in Tennessee since Al Gore in 1990 if he 's victorious , has run TV ads in which he says that he 's `` not running against Donald Trump '' and learned long ago to `` separate the message from the messenger .
