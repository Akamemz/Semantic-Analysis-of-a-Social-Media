''\nErakat called for Israel to pull troops out of Gaza .\nIsrael is n't acting in self-defense , he said . `` They 're the occupying power . They should be responsible for the human lives there . ''\nErakat said U.N. figures show `` 90 % of those killed are women and children . ''\nIt was unclear what he was basing those figures on . The United Nations estimates that more than 70 % of the Palestinians killed were civilians , including 226 youths and 117 women .

Militants also use civilian facilities such as homes , schools , mosques and hospitals to launch attacks on Israeli civilians and store weapons .\nThe Gaza crisis was discussed Monday in a joint call involving U.S. President Barack Obama . British Prime Minister David Cameron , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi .\nA statement from Cameron 's office said the leaders agreed on `` the urgent need for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and Israel , backing the efforts of the Egyptian government to achieve this . ''\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry returned to Washington after a trip to the Middle East and Paris , where he held discussions in an attempt to calm the violence . His efforts were criticized by Israeli media and Palestinian leaders .\nA spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday night that he was concerned the IDF had dropped leaflets in the northern Gaza Strip , warning thousands of residents to leave their homes and evacuate to Gaza City . If true , this would have a `` devastating humanitarian impact '' on Gaza residents , he said .\nAt a midnight meeting , the U.N. Security Council proclaimed its support for `` a comprehensive peace based on the vision of a region where two democratic states , Israel and Palestine , live side by side in peace with secure and recognized borders as envisioned in Security Council resolution 1850 ( 2008 ) . ''\nThat fell short of Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour 's desires .

''\nObama had another phone conversation with Netanyahu on Sunday , reiterating concern about the rising Palestinian civilian deaths , Israeli deaths and the `` worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza . ''\nThe Israeli military said it was not responsible for anyone killed last week when an `` errant Israeli mortar '' hit the courtyard of a U.N. school that was shelter to many Gaza residents .\nU.N. and Palestinian officials said 16 people were killed and hundreds were wounded Thursday when the school in northern Gaza was struck .\nIsrael Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said militants had fired anti-tank missiles from the immediate area of the school , and the IDF fired several mortar shells back in that direction .\n`` A single errant Israeli mortar landed in the courtyard in the school , '' Lerner said . `` The footage we have shows the courtyard was empty . ''\n`` We reject the claim that people were killed by the IDF mortar on the school premises , '' he added . But Lerner said there could have been people who were wounded by shrapnel .\nIsraeli government spokesman , Mark Regev said , `` The question is who is responsible , and for that we have to look at seriously and judiciously and make sure we get to the truth . ''\nA CNN team that visited the shelter several hours after the mortar attack saw evidence that people were badly wounded at the courtyard .\nThe team saw blood and strewn possessions concentrated close to the edge of the courtyard along the wall of the building , the area that would have been shady around 3 p.m. when the school was hit .\nThe IDF released a high-altitude aerial video of the round hitting the school , but it did not have high resolution and it is impossible to tell if anybody was sitting on the courtyard edge .",

Hide Caption 73 of 73\n\nMap of the Middle East\n\nIsrael: We're not responsible for last week's school deaths\n\nThe Israeli military said it was not responsible for anyone killed last week when an \"errant Israeli mortar\" hit the courtyard of a U.N. school that was shelter to many Gaza residents.\n\nU.N. and Palestinian officials said 16 people were killed and hundreds were wounded Thursday when the school in northern Gaza was struck.\n\nIsrael Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said militants had fired anti-tank missiles from the immediate area of the school, and the IDF fired several mortar shells back in that direction.\n\n\"A single errant Israeli mortar landed in the courtyard in the school,\" Lerner said. \"The footage we have shows the courtyard was empty.\"\n\n\"We reject the claim that people were killed by the IDF mortar on the school premises,\" he added. But Lerner said there could have been people who were wounded by shrapnel.\n\nIsraeli government spokesman, Mark Regev said, \"The question is who is responsible, and for that we have to look at seriously and judiciously and make sure we get to the truth.\"\n\nA CNN team that visited the shelter several hours after the mortar attack saw evidence that people were badly wounded at the courtyard.\n\nThe team saw blood and strewn possessions concentrated close to the edge of the courtyard along the wall of the building, the area that would have been shady around 3 p.m. when the school was hit.\n\nThe IDF released a high-altitude aerial video of the round hitting the school, but it did not have high resolution and it is impossible to tell if anybody was sitting on the courtyard edge.",
