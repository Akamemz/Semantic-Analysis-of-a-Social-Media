Bannon and Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow , Trump spoke in an easy , matter-of-fact way that America needs a leader that understands international relationships and global politics .\nAfter delivering a rousing speech that shook the Hoyt Sherman Place auditorium at the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines , Trump told Bannon and Marlow that he is \u201c very , very serious \u201d about what \u2019 s at stake for America and the need for new leadership in 2016 . Trump emphasized in his speech on Saturday that \u201c politicians are all talk and no action . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been watching the IRS . I \u2019 ve been watching Benghazi . I \u2019 ve been watching immigration and \u2018 the walls we \u2019 re going to build , \u2019 and it \u2019 s all talk . It \u2019 s talk for two days and then it dies , and nobody does anything about it , \u201d he lamented . Trump claims that it \u2019 s not just Democrats who keep kicking the political can down the road but Republicans too .\n\u201c I \u2019 m very disappointed in them . I \u2019 m a very strong Republican and a conservative Republican , a very conservative Republican . I am somebody that gets things done . They don \u2019 t get things done , \u201d Trump asserted . The brash businessman says that he \u2019 s a fighter and that Republicans have to learn how to fight . \u201c I \u2019 m all for getting things done , and competently getting things done . Right now we have a president who is grossly incompetent and we have to change things around , \u201d he added .\nMarlow asked Trump if it was time for a non-politician to become president . Trump recounted that he is in many ways very politically oriented . The real estate tycoon explained that he has been doing very well with politicians all over the world and in America for twenty-five years .\nTrump referenced his very public political battles with politicians in NYC , noting that \u201c people say that if you can get a zoning law changed in New York , you can get anything. \u201d He added , \u201c I \u2019 ve gotten more zone changes in New York than anybody . I built a city on the Westside of Manhattan . \u201d\nTrump asserted that if he runs for president in 2016 his theme would be : \u201c Make America Great Again. \u201d In order to achieve that goal the first priority for Trump is to get rid of Obamacare . \u201c We have to repeal and replace it with something far better and far less expensive , \u201d he said .\nTrump \u2019 s plan includes \u201c freeing up the borders \u201d of Obamacare , so that you can buy insurance from any company in the United States and not be restricted to buying only from regional companies . \u201c The insurance companies are making a fortune with Obamacare and it is outrageous , \u201d he stated . Breitbart \u2019 s Executive Chairman agreed , pointing out the surge in insurance company stock prices . \u201c That \u2019 s because the government mitigates their risks and they get all the upside , \u201d explained Bannon .\n\u201c They are making a fortune and it \u2019 s a joke . You should bring it back to free enterprise and you would see much better health care , \u201d Trump said . He added that the deductibles are now so high that you pay for everything anyway and you never really use your health plan .\nNext on his agenda , the purveyor of Celebrity Apprentice said that he would put an end to \u201c these foreign countries from just ripping us with the deals they are making . They make deals with us that are so good they just laugh . \u201d\nBannon asked Trump how he would change things . \u201c First I would let China know that it is over . There is no more free ride , \u201d said Trump . Bannon chimed in , \u201c You \u2019 re saying no more free ride in Africa ? No more free ride in Latin America ? \u201d Trump answered that China is benefiting from all these countries \u2019 natural resources without lending a hand to fighting terrorism or dealing with disease control .\n\u201c Do you ever see Chinese soldiers trying to stop ISIS ? \u201d he asked . \u201c China \u2019 s all over the place but don \u2019 t want to go near the people with the Ebola , because they don \u2019 t want to be infected . Yet we are sending thousands of soldiers over there helping them . \u201d\nTrumps says that China , along with other countries , is doing another thing that is hurting America \u2019 s economy and getting away with it : devaluing their currency \u201c to a point that no one thought would be possible and get away with it. \u201d The devaluation makes US exports far less competitive with Chinese products .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t play by the same rules that we do , \u201d he told the Breitbart team . America won \u2019 t be doing business with China in a Trump administration unless they drastically change their ways , he maintained .\nMoreover , Trump stated confidently that he thinks that he would do a \u201c fantastic job \u201d as Commander-in-Chief . \u201c I would bring this country back to the highest level it has ever been . And I think I would make America great again . \u201d\nMarlow asked Trump what qualities he has that distinguishes him from the other candidates speaking at the Summit . He explained that he would be able to create jobs because , \u201c That \u2019 s what I do . I have thousands of people working for me. \u201d He added that he has had \u201c thousands of successes\u2026 The nice part is that I can self-fund my campaign\u2026 I would just use my own money . It is much easier . \u201d\nIn evaluating why Mitt Romney lost to Obama in 2012 , Trump stated , \u201c He choked . He choked . He failed to be a candidate in the last month . He had it won . You know a lot of people don \u2019 t know how to win . He couldn \u2019 t close . Like I said in my speech he is like a deal maker who can \u2019 t close a deal . By the way most people are like that , just so he doesn \u2019 t feel too bad . \u201d\nTrump says that the reason he is willing to put himself through the grueling process of running for president is because \u201c I want to make this country great again .
