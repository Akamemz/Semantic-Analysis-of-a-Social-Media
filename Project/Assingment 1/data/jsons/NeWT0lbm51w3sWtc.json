    "content": "Two prominent Hong Kong activists , Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow , were arrested Friday for participating in unauthorized assembly and inciting other protesters to do the same . Both have been released on bail . Hong Kong police have also denied organizers permission to hold a march planned for Saturday .\nThe two 22-year-olds are leaders of Demosisto , an organization that backs greater autonomy and self-government for Hong Kong . ( Wong serves as secretary-general while Chow is on the standing committee . ) Wong first entered protest politics during Hong Kong 's `` umbrella movement '' of 2014 . Those roughly three months of demonstrations called for giving the semi-autonomous Chinese city 's residents the right to elect their chief executive directly , without the Communist Party pre-screening the candidates . Currently , citizens `` elect '' the chief executive , but have no options aside from candidates who have earned Beijing 's stamp of approval .\nThe current round of protests was set off by a bill , introduced in early June and suspended shortly thereafter , that would have allowed Hong Kong to extradite accused criminals to both Taiwan and mainland China . While the marchers are glad the legislation was suspended , they want it fully pulled\u2014and they have broader demands too .\n`` The chief executive of Hong Kong should be elected by Hong Kong 's people instead of picked by Beijing , '' Wong tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` We urge the government to terminate the bill , stop police brutality , and respond to our calls for free elections . ''\nThough Hong Kong is technically a part of China , it operates under a `` one country , two systems '' policy that allows Hongkongers to enjoy basic democratic norms and due process . In 2047 , though , Hong Kong 's quasi-independent government will be dissolved and it will become fully absorbed into mainland China . The protesters fear China is speeding up this timeline .\n`` 'One country , two systems ' has already eroded , '' says Wong . `` It 's one country , one and a half systems . '' He adds that `` Mainland Chinese people also deserve democracy . ''\nTensions between the protesters and the authorities have escalated in recent weeks .
