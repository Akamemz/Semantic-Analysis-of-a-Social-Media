Kelly told Fox News he wants the U.S.-Mexico border wall finished in two years \u2013 setting an ambitious schedule for the project ordered last week by President Trump .\n`` The wall will be built where it 's needed first , and then it will be filled in . That 's the way I look at it , '' Kelly said . `` I really hope to have it done within the next two years . ''\nFox News traveled with Kelly in McAllen , Texas , on Wednesday where he saw first-hand the challenges for Border Patrol agents . The Rio Grande Valley , known as the `` RGV sector , '' is among the busiest . On any given day , Border Patrol agents pick up at least 600 people who have crossed the Mexican border , entering the U.S. illegally .\nThose personnel , he explained , are all part of the broader plan for securing the border .\n`` Any discussion about the protection of our southwest border involves discussion of physical barriers but also of technological sensors , things like that , \u201d he said . \u201c But it 's a layered approach , and it \u2019 s got to be backed up by great men and women who are going to make sure that the wall is intact . ''\nBut first , the department faces the tough task of funding \u2013 and then building \u2013 what would be the largest-ever construction project undertaken by the president who made his name in real estate .\nKelly , who was tasked by the president \u2019 s executive order with overseeing the planning and construction of the wall , echoed Trump in saying they already \u201c have the authority \u201d under existing law .\n\u201c We 're looking at the money aspect , \u201d he acknowledged . But he said the White House is working with Congress on the timetable .\n\u201c I think the funding will come relatively quickly and like I said , we will build it where it 's needed first as identified by the men and women who work the border , '' Kelly emphasized .\nKelly said it will be only a matter of months before construction begins .\nKelly also said he supported a `` surge '' of resources to the border so that processing those who cross illegally can happen in a matter of weeks , not `` 600 plus days . ''\n`` If we could surge the court proceedings -- immigration court proceedings on the border -- and within the law , do it very rapidly ... I think that alone would act as a huge deterrent for people who are considering making the trip up , '' he said .\nAs for hostility to the wall from Mexico , Kelly said the safety of Americans comes first , though he wants to build a partnership on shared border issues . `` I 'd really like to establish a relationship on this , on the other side . It would be a mutually beneficial relationship . ''\nKelly also defended his agents in the wake of last week \u2019 s controversial executive order suspending the refugee program and restricting travel from seven mostly Muslim countries . As his agency came under fire over the weekend , he said the department worked to verify reports of mistreatment , and could not . Kelly suggested critics had blown the issue out of proportion .\n`` Mr. Trump is not loved by everyone in America , and I think this very rapid succession of decisions , I do n't think the American public is really all that used to people making decisions , \u201d he said . \u201c I really do n't think they 're used to people that say things on the campaign trail actually turning them into action . ''\nAsked if the pace had come as a `` shock '' to the public , Kelly said : `` Yes , I think so . But I will tell you the men and women of Homeland Security did a great job out on the front lines , in this case mostly at the airports . People were treated with dignity and respect . ''\nKelly knocked down media reports that he first learned of the executive order by watching television , the day it was signed , a story first reported by the New York Times : `` As soon as I was confirmed which was on Friday a couple of weeks ago , inauguration day , I knew that they were being developed . \u201d\nAsked if he was `` blindsided by the order , '' Kelly said , `` Not at all . I saw the initial couple of cuts on them probably on Tuesday maybe Thursday , knew it was coming soon and then it came. ``\nAfter more than 45 years of service , Kelly retired last year , and did not plan a return to Washington or full-time employment . He said it all changed with a cold call from the transition team when he and his wife Karen were relaxing .\nKelly was initially skeptical about the caller , who is now White House chief of staff .\n`` We were sitting on the couch when I got the original call on a Saturday afternoon and Reince Priebus called me , \u201d he said . \u201c I do n't know him . Once he convinced me it was really Reince Priebus , he said , \u2018 Would you come up and talk to Mr. Trump , he 'd like to talk to you about a position in the administration. \u2019 And I said , \u2018 I can do that , I 'll be up tomorrow . \u2019 \u201d\nHe told his wife he thought the Trump administration was about to offer him a job .\n\u201c She said , \u2018 take it , your whole life , our whole life , the Kelly family is a life of service . \u2019 ''",
