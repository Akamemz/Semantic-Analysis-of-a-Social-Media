With impeachment upon us , he \u2019 s now onto the Sixth Amendment \u2014 specifically , the confrontation clause . It guarantees the right of cross-examination : In all criminal trials , the accused must be given the right to confront the accusers .

There is but a small circle of people who fit that description , so Paul , like many in Washington , has known the name , to near certainty , for some time .\nThe senator makes the fair point that there is no legal barrier to the media \u2019 s naming the man . We can be confident that if a Democratic president had been accused of impeachable offenses , that would already have happened weeks ago ( and , indeed , some right-leaning media sites have published the name ) .\nPaul conveniently omits , though , that , as a senator , he has speech or debate-clause immunity .

Yet , he is not a whistleblower in the statutory sense . That \u2019 s the only sense that matters because the relevant statute is what triggers whistleblower protections .

The statute does not apply to the president \u2019 s conducting of foreign policy , including his communications with foreign heads of state .\nIn this instance , the inspector general of the intelligence community ( IGIC ) chose to handle the man \u2019 s complaint as if it raised an intelligence-related \u201c urgent concern , \u201d as defined by the statute . The IGIC thus treated the man as if he had protected status . That was an error . The acting director of national intelligence correctly found that the complaint did not meet the statutory criteria , and he therefore declined to pass it along to Congress ( as the statute mandates for complaints that do meet the criteria ) .

Whistleblowers who are essential witnesses in criminal prosecutions do not get to remain anonymous .
