'' `` In fact , for the next 10 years , it 's gon na be in a sustainable place . ''\nIt 's an assessment that will throw cold water on the latest attempt to achieve a so-called grand bargain to reduce the deficit . After all , a grand bargain would require excruciatingly difficult decisions for both sides - for Republicans , it would mean raising taxes , and for Democrats , cutting future spending on cherished programs like Social Security and Medicare . If there is no crisis , why would either side do it ?\nSo , what happens if this latest effort to reach a deficit agreement falls through ? Once again , the president 's answer was , essentially , no big deal .\n`` Ultimately , it may be that the differences are just too wide '' to get a deal , President Obama said . `` That wo n't create a crisis . It just means that we will have missed an opportunity . ''\nThe president 's reasoning is that the series of 11th hour agreements he has struck with Republicans over the last two years - to prevent a government shutdown , raise the debt ceiling and avoid the fiscal cliff - have resulted in enough deficit reduction to get the debt under control .\n`` I think what 's important to recognize is that we 've already cut $ 2.5- $ 2.7 trillion out of the deficit , '' he told Stephanopoulos . `` If the sequester stays in , you 've got over $ 3.5 trillion of deficit reduction already . ''\nBy that accounting , we have already achieved nearly all the $ 4 trillion the Bowles-Simpson debt commission called for back in 2010 - mission ( almost ) accomplished .\nFirst , the Congressional Budget Office projects a deficit of $ 845 billion - that 's lower than the $ 1 trillion-plus deficits we 've seen over the past four years and , as a percentage of the total economy , half the annual deficit of 2009 . But , CBO also warns that the deficit is projected to continue rising once again after 2015 , adding a total of $ 7 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years .\nSecond , Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson are now saying we are nowhere near accomplishing the amount of deficit reduction needed to put the government on sustainable path .\n`` They have n't done any of the tough stuff , any of the important stuff , '' Bowles told me last month . `` They have n't reformed the tax code\u2026they have n't done anything to slow the rate of health care , to the rate of growth of the economy , they have n't made Social Security sustainably solvent . There 's about $ 2.4 trillion more of hard work we 've got ta do . ''\nAllan Simpson went further , calling the failure to control entitlement spending `` madness . ''\n`` Ten thousand [ Americans ] a day are turning 65 , '' Simpson told me . `` This is madness . And life expectancy is 78.1 , and in five years will be 80. Who is kidding who ?

Neither side 's gon na get 100 percent . That 's what the American people are lookin ' for . That 's what 's gon na be good for jobs .

It may be that ideologically , if their position is , 'We ca n't do any revenue , ' or , 'We can only do revenue if we gut Medicare or gut Social Security or gut Medicaid ' - if that 's the position , then we 're probably not gon na be able to get a deal .
