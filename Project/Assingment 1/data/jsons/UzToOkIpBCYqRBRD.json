For example, their ship, the Mayflower, was a wine carrier that had been poorly converted to passenger use. It was much too small for 102 people in addition to the crew and forced the mingling of individuals who had little in common with one another. Most passengers were hell-bent only on making money in the New World, while a minority, \u201cthe Saints,\u201d as they would be derisively called, hoped to build an economically viable religious community unchallenged by English political authorities.\n\nDuring the 66-day voyage, the Saints, subsequently dubbed Pilgrims, sang hymns, while the other passengers chimed in boos. To be sure, many had signed an agreement aboard the ship setting up a form of government in the new country, but there was squabbling over the details. The one redeeming aspect as the two groups moved ashore with the frozen sea spray on their coats was that the Saints gave thanks for finally reaching their destination dubbed Plymouth \u2014 a thanksgiving a year before its formal observance.\n\nWhat followed in the weeks, months and years to come was an answer to their prayers, namely, that the initial adversity of living, first on ship and then in caves and shoddy wooden shacks, would develop into a religious community fortified by a strong private enterprise economy. The two leaders who accomplished these goals were governors, William Bradford of Plymouth and John Winthrop of the nearby Massachusetts Bay colony, founded in 1630, that eventually subsumed the smaller Plymouth settlement.\n\nBradford was 31 when he became governor of Plymouth for the first time. As a boy, he proved to be a maverick, deserting his family\u2019s church for a separatist faith. As a man, he believed that idleness was religiously wrong and economically devastating. Because English officials began to persecute his sect, he and other church members fled to the more tolerant Holland, the center of Europe\u2019s textile industry.

But Holland\u2019s worldliness was too tempting for religious dissidents, especially children, and off they moved to America.\n\nAs governor, Bradford forged private enterprise principles into a colony bound by religious dogmas. Repudiating a backer\u2019s loan requirement that the settlement own property only communally, he paid off the balance quickly with interest rates as high as 45 percent.\n\nJohn Winthrop, like Bradford, came from a solid family that also provided him with an ample inheritance. He would study law, become a lawyer and justice of the peace and move to higher legal positions in London. He also became utterly bored.
