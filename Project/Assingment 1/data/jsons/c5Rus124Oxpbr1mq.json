    "content": "The Conservative Political Action Conference is usually reserved for conservatives , which could explain why Donald Trump chose to stay away from this year 's event , rival GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio said during an appearance Saturday at the annual convention . `` Look , either the ideas behind conservatism matter , or they do not , '' Rubio told CNN 's Dana Bash during a question and answer session following his main stage speech before an enthusiastic , filled-to-capacity crowd at the Washington D.C. event , sponsored by the American Conservative Union . `` I believe they do . It is not vote for me because I 'm angry and more over-the-top . `` Trump , who was also to speak at the large annual conservative gathering , backed out at the last minute to hold campaign rallies in Kansas and Florida.Rubio told Bash that there are many young conservatives like himself , in their 40s and 50s , including Ted Cruz , Rand Paul , and Susana Martinez serving the country because they grew up in the era of President Ronald Reagan . `` Reagan looked and acted nothing like Donald Trump , '' said Rubio . `` Look at the Democrats . Who is the young up and coming Democrat ? Bernie Sanders . `` Rubio told Bash that he 's been stepping up his words about Trump , including calling him a `` con artist and a fraud , '' but waited until February to start because he was busy fighting off the other candidates who were attacking him . `` I did not get into this to beat up on other candidates , '' said Rubio . `` If you told me a year ago that the front-runner of the Republican campaign would be a supporter of Planned Parenthood , who does not stand with Israel , I would say , on what planet would that be the Republican front runner ? It has happened . We have to ask yourself , why have we allow that to happen ? `` But despite the line of questions \u2014 and the audience 's wild reactions following Rubio 's answers to them \u2014 the Florida senator showed some annoyance toward Bash , saying that Trump is the front-runner because of the media focus on him . `` I have been sitting here for five minutes , and the questions have all been about Donald Trump , '' Rubio said.And when Bash reminded him that the questions come because Trump is the front-runner , Rubio replied that he got too much media focus even before that happened . `` Even before he was the front-runner , Donald would offend someone personally , would make fun of a disabled reporter , or attack a woman journalist , and would dominate the news coverage , '' said Rubio . `` I 'm not complaining about it . The reason we 're talking about is , the other night at the debate , over half the questions I was asked were about my opinion of Donald Trump . I 'm running for president because I think the country needs to re-embrace the constitution , re-embrace free enterprise , and re-embrace a strong national defense . `` But he said he was `` more than happy '' to answer another question on attacking Trump . `` Donald Trump may have grown up the way he did , with a lot of money , and going to boarding school , '' said Rubio . `` Where I grew up , if someone is punching someone in the face , eventually someone will have to stand up and punch them back . '' Fear and anger , though , wo n't solve any problems , said Rubio during the speech itself . `` Do people have a right to be fearful of the future right now ? '' he said . `` Yes . For over two decades , leaders in neither party have solved the problems before us . People have the right to be angry about every institution in society , absolutely . Neither anger nor fear will solve our problems . It will serve to motivate us , but will not solve our problems . `` Rubio also extolled the virtues of conservatism and told the CPAC audience that the 21st century is tailormade for young Americans , who will be devastated if Hillary Clinton or Sanders , or a Republican who is not a conservative wins the White House . `` These young Americans have the chance to fulfill an incredible destiny , '' Rubio said . `` We have to give them the chance . They will not have the chance if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is elected . They wo n't have the chance if the conservative movement is hijacked by someone who is not a conservative . `` `` Do we want another president who believes ISIS is not a threat to our nation ? '' said Rubio . `` Another president who thinks citizens do n't need to own certain types of weapons ? We all know Bernie Sanders would be a disastrous president . Think waiting minds at the DMV , but for everything , health care , taxes . Bernie will politely , and snip our paychecks in half . `` Clinton , meanwhile , `` tells us we should vote for her because she is a woman , '' said Rubio . `` The reality is real equality for women is not by telling us who to vote for .
