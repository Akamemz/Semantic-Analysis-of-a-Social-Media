With his acknowledgment of political arithmetic , Sanders guarantees that Biden will have seven months to unify the Democratic Party and work to defeat Trump . And to his credit , Sanders leaves the race without ever having mounted a personal attack on Biden that Republicans could use against the former vice president this fall. \u201d Walter Shapiro , New Republic\nOthers write , \u201c What we hope Sanders doesn \u2019 t take from his failed candidacy \u2014 or communicate to his fervent followers \u2014 is a conviction that the process was rigged against him and that a conspiracy of party leaders and the \u2018 billionaire class \u2019 stymied his campaign . The truth is that , as an independent senator who viewed the Democratic Party as an instrument for his ambitions rather than a political home , Sanders faced resistance not just from benighted bigwigs but from ordinary Democratic voters , including older African Americans\u2026 \u201c This page has expressed concerns about [ Biden \u2019 s ] sharpness , his gaffes and his ability to stand up to Trump forcefully during a general election campaign , and we fear that his presence in the race cast too great a shadow over a new and less familiar generation of candidates with compelling ideas . But we also believe that it \u2019 s vital that voters bring to an end the incompetent and corrupt administration of Donald Trump . It is imperative that Sanders do a better job in 2020 leading his supporters to back Biden in November than he did in getting out the vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016\u2026 For his part , Biden must show Sanders \u2019 supporters that he shares their goals for a more just , humane and equitable society , even if he differs on how to achieve them. \u201d Editorial Board , Los Angeles Times\nMany note that \u201c Sanders \u2019 campaign was , truly , funded by regular people : As one oft-cited analysis found , the professions found most disproportionately often among his donors included \u2018 bartender , \u2019 \u2018 vet assistant , \u2019 \u2018 butcher , \u2019 and \u2018 fast food worker \u2019 \u2026 Even as Biden passed him in 2020 , he continued to be the preferred candidate of lower-income voters . But it wasn \u2019 t enough , and it \u2019 s not a coincidence that the candidate who defeated him told donors at New York City \u2019 s Carlyle Hotel last June that \u2018 nothing would fundamentally change \u2019 about their positions in society if he were elected\u2026 \u201c Over and over , voters heard from business leaders\u2014even the ones who typically support Democrats\u2014that Sanders \u2019 plans would , e.g. , \u2018 bankrupt the health-care system \u2019 and \u2018 be a disaster for our country \u2019 and that they would rather vote for Trump than the senator from Vermont\u2026 The result was Sanders losing repeatedly in primaries in which a crucial subset of voters who liked his proposals chose Biden because of his presumably superior electability\u2026 In four or more years , Sanders \u2019 successors\u2014the AOCs and Marie Newmans and , depending on how things go , perhaps the Elizabeth Warrens again\u2014might ride the significant momentum he has created to do things differently . But for now , money still talks . \u201d Ben Mathis-Lilley , Slate\n\u201c Everyone in the field agreed that the government role in health care should be more expansive , that education spending should go up , that there should be more income support for the poor , that the welfare state should be extended into matters related to child care and family leave , and that the country needs to be more aggressive about environmental regulation , gun regulation , anti-racism , and LGBTQ rights while taking a less harsh approach to criminals and immigrants . The entire argument in modern Democratic Party politics , in other words , is simply over how far left to go on a range of issues , not about which direction to take the country or the party . Sanders can take a bow. \u201d Matthew Yglesias , Vox\n\u201c When Sanders launched his first campaign in 2015 , he was pretty close to a joke candidate : The septuagenarian Jewish socialist from Brooklyn , a senator from one of the smallest , weirdest states in the nation , was going to take on the former secretary of state and first lady , who had virtually the entire Democratic Party apparatus behind her . Good luck , ha ha . When he decided to run again in 2019 , he was almost universally described \u2014 by the same pundit class that misjudged him the first time around \u2014 as an afterthought or throwback\u2026 The pundits were wrong about Bernie Sanders , and then they were right . Both things are true\u2026 He was never going to be president , but he got a lot closer to that possibility than any of us expected . \u201d Andrew O'Hehir , Salon\nThe right worries that despite his failure to win the nomination Sanders has successfully moved the Democratic party to the left .\nThe right worries that despite his failure to win the nomination Sanders has successfully moved the Democratic party to the left .\n\u201c He lost against former Vice President Joe Biden because he couldn \u2019 t figure out how to grow beyond his core base . Consider the numbers : In Iowa and New Hampshire , he won the support of roughly 25 percent of participants and won the popular vote in each . In Nevada , he got 33 percent of the vote . But when the field narrowed , he still got roughly a third of the vote \u2013 and it wasn \u2019 t enough , as supporters of the other candidates decided to vote for Biden\u2026\n\u201c But even though the \u2018 Bernie base \u2019 is just a third of the Democratic party \u2013 it \u2019 s an important third \u2013 and Biden needs to ensure solid support from them if he \u2019 s to win in November\u2026 Looking at voters who are undecided or with other candidates , it \u2019 s clear why Biden is looking to those Sanders voters . Among voters who disapprove of Trump , Biden has a solid lead , but fully 14 percent ( one in seven ) say they \u2019 re planning on voting for a third-party candidate , will refuse to vote , or say they still \u2018 don \u2019 t know. \u2019 In an election that likely will be decided by a small number of voters in a small number of states , losing one in seven voters who ought to be in your column should give Biden pause . \u201d\n\u201c [ Bernie ] never won the percentages this time \u2019 round that he did in 2016 against Hillary Clinton . It \u2019 s now clear that his success then was more about being the only alternative to her \u2014 the only practical protest vote against her coronation \u2014 than about the appeal of his blame-the-rich , grow-the-government message . Still , the most successful socialist and Jewish candidate for president in US history has made his mark\u2026\n\u201c Where Obama ran in 2008 promising to cut taxes overall by nearly $ 3 trillion in a decade ( while raising them on the rich , yes ) , Clinton in 2016 proposed to raise them by $ 1.4 trillion , and all the candidates this year called for even bigger tax hikes . Biden , last we noticed , wants $ 3.4 trillion . \u201d\n\u201c Predictions from his high tide in February that Sanders would be the Reagan of the Democrats now look embarrassingly premature . He did not transform his party ; it came together with startling speed and cohesiveness to reject him in favor of a man who has been in D.C. for half a century and lives and breathes the old Senate norms of bipartisan centrism and corporate fundraising\u2026\n\u201c [ But ] Like conservatives in 1965-68 , Sanders-style progressives now have a message , a self-identity as a faction , a generation of younger spokespeople in Congress and state governments , and a sympathetic apparatus of writers , pundits , and think-tankers\u2026 While this may be a day to celebrate the defeat of socialism within the Democratic Party , the fight that Sanders started almost alone in 2016 is far from over . Both the right and the center-left would be foolish to think it is . \u201d\n\u201c [ The ] \u2018 authenticity , \u2019 they always say , is Bernie \u2019 s strength , but it \u2019 s also a weakness . When he throws brimstone at private employers , voters know he means it . When he sees a silver lining in Fidel Castro \u2019 s Cuba , voters know he means that , too . How will fans of this combo take to Joe Biden ? Mr. Sanders on Wednesday called Mr. Biden \u2018 a very decent man , who I will work with to move our progressive ideas forward. \u2019 That \u2019 s notably short of an endorsement ...\n\u201c A second question is whether Mr. Biden can placate the Bernie bros without repelling independent voters .
