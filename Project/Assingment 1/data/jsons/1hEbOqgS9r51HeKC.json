Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) made the case that the proposed Wuhan coronavirus relief package that 's currently floating in Congress shows why progressive ideas and the progressive movement are achievable .\n`` It 's actually a fascinating progressive moment because what it 's shown is that all of these issues have never been about how are you going to pay for it . It 's never been about whether we have the capacity to do these things or if the logistics have worked out , '' AOC explained in a video for Sen. Bernie Sanders ' presidential campaign . `` All of these excuses that we have been given as to why we can not treat people humanely have suddenly gone up in smoke and what has been revealed is all of these issues was really about a lack of a political will and who you deemed worthy to be in an emergency or not . ''\nAccording to the freshman congresswoman , progressives have been pushing for housing to be deemed a right for a `` very , very long time . ''\n`` Now that we are experiencing everybody who is threatened by the uncertainty of this moment , everyone 's realizing , 'Wait . We 're all in this together . ' That applies to not just economic prosperity but it also applies to issues of criminal justice , of civil rights , of human rights , '' she explained .\n. @ AOC `` And it 's actually a fascinating progressive moment , because what it 's shown is that all of these issues have never been about how are you going to pay for it .
