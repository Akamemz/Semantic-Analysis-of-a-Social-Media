He \u2019 s now the only major-party Senate candidate in the nation to be a dues-paying democratic socialist .\nRingelstein \u2019 s leap is the latest evidence of a nationwide surge in the strength and popularity of an organization that , until recently , operated on the fringes of the liberal movement \u2019 s farthest left flank . As Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency stretches into its second year , democratic socialism has become a significant force in Democratic politics . Its rise comes as Democrats debate whether moving too far left will turn off voters .\n\u201c I stand with the democratic socialists , and I have decided to become a dues-paying member , \u201d Ringelstein told AP . \u201c It \u2019 s time to do what \u2019 s right , even if it \u2019 s not easy . \u201d\nThere are 42 people running for offices at the federal , state and local levels this year with the formal endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America , the organization says . They span 20 states , including Florida , Hawaii , Kansas , and Michigan .\nThe most ambitious Democrats in Washington have been reluctant to embrace the label , even as they embrace the policies defining modern-day democratic socialism : Medicare for all , a $ 15 minimum wage , free college tuition and the abolition of the federal department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , also known as ICE .\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , Congress \u2019 only self-identified democratic socialist , campaigned Friday with the movement \u2019 s newest star , New York City congressional candidate Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez , a 28-year-old former bartender who defeated one of the most powerful House Democrats last month .\nHer victory fed a flame that was already beginning to burn brighter . The DSA \u2019 s paid membership has hovered around 6,000 in the years before Trump \u2019 s election , said Allie Cohn , a member of the group \u2019 s national political team .\nThere is little distinction made between the terms \u201c democratic socialism \u201d and \u201c socialism \u201d in the group \u2019 s literature . While Ringelstein and other DSA-backed candidates promote a \u201c big-tent \u201d philosophy , the group \u2019 s constitution describes its members as socialists who \u201c reject an economic order based on private profit \u201d and \u201c share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production , economic planning , equitable distribution , feminism , racial equality and non-oppressive relationships . \u201d\nMembers during public meetings often refer to each other as \u201c comrades , \u201d wear clothing featuring socialist symbols like the rose and promote authors such as Karl Marx .\nThe common association with the failed Soviet Union has made it difficult for sympathetic liberals to explain their connection .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t like the term socialist , because people do associate that with bad things in history , \u201d said Kansas congressional candidate James Thompson , who is endorsed by the DSA and campaigned alongside Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez , but is not a dues-paying democratic socialist . \u201c There \u2019 s definitely a lot of their policies that closely align with mine . \u201d\nThompson , an Army veteran turned civil rights attorney , is running again after narrowly losing a special election last year to fill the seat vacated by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo . Even in deep-red Kansas , he embraces policies like \u201c Medicare for all \u201d and is openly critical of capitalism .\nIn Hawaii , 29-year-old state Rep. Kaniela Ing isn \u2019 t shy about promoting his status as a democratic socialist in his bid for Congress . He said he was encouraged to run for higher office by the same activist who recruited Ocasio-Cortez .\n\u201c We figured just lean in hard , \u201d Ing told the AP of the democratic socialist label . He acknowledged some baby boomers may be scared away , but said the policies democratic socialists promote \u2014 like free health care and economic equality \u2014 aren \u2019 t extreme .\nRepublicans , meanwhile , are encouraged by the rise of democratic socialism \u2014 for a far different reason . They have seized on what they view as a leftward lurch by Democrats they predict will alienate voters this fall and in the 2020 presidential race .\nThe Republican National Committee eagerly notes that Sanders \u2019 plan to provide free government-sponsored health care for all Americans had no co-sponsors in 2013 . Today , more than one-third of Senate Democrats and two-thirds of House Democrats have signed onto the proposal , which by one estimate could cost taxpayers as much as $ 32 trillion .\nThe co-sponsors include some 2020 presidential prospects , such as Massachusetts Sen.
