The consensus was that he did not make a strong showing, so now what? \"I could have done better,\" Bush reportedly told senior staffers and top donors on an emergency call Thursday. His campaign is \"not on life support,\" he then told reporters while campaigning in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. \"The end is not near.

But Team Jeb! has a plan to turn the ship around, campaign officials are assuring donors, even while one top Bush adviser tells The Washington Post that the candidate and his camp won't be panicked by \"the insanity of the pundit world.\" Here are some key points in the revival program for Jeb Bush, as shared with the media on one of the darker days for Bush 2016.\n\n1. Focus on New Hampshire: Bush's cash-flush super PAC has set aside almost $11 million for an advertising blitz starting Jan. 5, and $5.6 million of that is for New Hampshire, according to a 112-page campaign document leaked to U.S. News.

Bush plans to lose in Iowa.\n\n2. Focus on proven leadership over \"performance\": Bush doesn't seem to be a great debater, so he's downplaying the importance of debates. \"It's not about the big personalities on the stage,\" Bush said Thursday. \"It's not about performance. It's about leadership.\"\n\n3. Keep attacking Marco Rubio: In the leaked campaign memo, handed to donors on Monday, the Bush campaign paints Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a former Bush prot\u00e9g\u00e9, as his key competitor for the GOP establishment vote and money pot.
