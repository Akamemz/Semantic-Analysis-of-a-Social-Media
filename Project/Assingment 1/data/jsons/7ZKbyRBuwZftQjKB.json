Ator was a man marked with mental illness . As they searched his home , police noted that this man was on a downward spiral , which apparently culminated when he was fired from his job the day he committed his heinous crime . As the anti-gun Left mobilized again , many questions remained .\nHow did Ator get a rifle ? He failed a previous background check via mental health adjudication . Well , it seems Ator obtained his firearms from someone who might have been illegally manufacturing and selling guns without a license .

Ator , 36 years old , was prohibited under federal law from owning a firearm because a court had previously found him mentally unfit , law-enforcement officials previously said . He had tried to buy a gun in January 2014 but failed because a nationwide criminal-background-check system flagged the mental-health determination by a local court and prevented the purchase , according to the officials . Authorities suspect the Lubbock man sold Ator the gun through a private sale . Such a sale allowed Ator to purchase a gun without going through a criminal-background check . Gun-control proponents have frequently complained that private sales are a hole in the background-check system that should be addressed .
