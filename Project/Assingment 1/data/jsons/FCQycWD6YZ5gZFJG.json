    "content": "With the announcement Wednesday that President Barack Obama would nominate centrist appeals court judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court , the White House caught the Washington political establishment by surprise . Instead of picking a jurist with an expedient , built-in constituency , whose confirmation fight with the Republican Senate could be used as leverage in the November elections , Obama appeared to strip the nomination of any overt political subtext by offering forth the most bipartisan , even-tempered name on his Supreme Court short list .\nSeasoned court watchers had favored fellow D.C . Circuit Court judge Sri Srinivasan for the Supreme Court nod , citing the 49-year-old \u2019 s bipartisan background , sterling ( but brief ) credentials , and his ability to mobilize minority voters in the upcoming elections . Jeffrey Toobin , who had once called Srinivasan a \u201c nominee-in-waiting , \u201d had predicted shortly after Antonin Scalia \u2019 s death that he would be the pick , as did several other outlets . Garland , on the other hand , does little to excite the Democratic base , while offering about the same chance of being successfully confirmed : none . Within hours of Scalia \u2019 s death , Republican Senate leaders vowed not to confirm , or even meet with , any Obama nominee , arguing that the next president should get the opportunity to fill the late justice \u2019 s seat .\nOn the surface , the decision to nominate the 63-year-old is somewhat perplexing . \u201c On paper , Garland is exactly the sort of candidate one might expect President Obama to appoint at this time , meaning relatively conservative , a moderate who doesn \u2019 t have a lot of enemies , who is on the second most powerful court in the land , \u201d noted ABC \u2019 s chief legal correspondent and LawNewz owner , Dan Abrams , who admitted he was surprised by the announcement . But Garland lacks the kind of background that would \u201c pressure \u201d Republicans in this political environment , he said , whereas Srinavasan \u2019 s youth and Asian-American heritage would have mobilized Democratic interest groups to lobby on his behalf . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t have the kind of political juice to force the Republicans \u2019 hand that other candidates would . \u201d\nIn many ways , Garland makes more sense as a sacrificial lamb . In floor remarks immediately after Obama \u2019 s announcement , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated that he would not break his promise to block any Obama nominee , arguing that his opposition was based on principle , and not \u201c about a person. \u201d Obama surely knew that Garland , despite being widely respected for his 19 years on the D.C . Circuit Court , would never be nominated before November . If Hillary Clinton wins the election , Republicans would likely race to nominate Garland in the ensuing lame-duck session , preempting Clinton from picking her own more progressive nominee . And it would preserve the reputation of a potential future candidate , like Srinavasan , if Garland is forced to withdraw . Either way , Garland\u2014who was confirmed 76 to 23 to the D.C .
