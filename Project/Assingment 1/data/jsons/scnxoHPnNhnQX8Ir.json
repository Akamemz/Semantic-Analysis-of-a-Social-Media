Iowa had better take advantage of Ohio State University , he said . `` Our basketball team is down this year . ''\nKasich \u2019 s signature down-home small talk over , Larry asked the Republican presidential candidate if he supports the Renewable Fuel Standard \u2019 s requirement that gas contain a certain amount of ethanol , much of it made from Iowa corn . Kasich supports the existing law .\n\u201c You keep going , \u201d Larry told Kasich , calling him `` Johnny . '' \u201c If you \u2019 re ever in the great state of Iowa and you \u2019 re close , we \u2019 ll come and wave to ya . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s right : Kasich was talking to Larry , and more than 12,000 other Iowa voters , in a telephone town-hall meeting Thursday night . Kasich was calling from the other early-voting state : New Hampshire .\nKasich is polling at just less than 3 % in Iowa ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses , putting him in ninth , according to the RealClearPolitics rolling average of recent polls . Talk among the Kasich team of a possible top-five finish has faded .\nWhile other candidates have swarmed Iowa this month , Kasich has appeared just twice : Jan. 4 in West Des Moines and Jan. 10 in Council Bluffs . He plans Iowa visits this week in the Quad Cities , Des Moines and Cedar Rapids , but he 's not scheduled to be in Iowa on caucus day .\nInstead , he \u2019 s taking his town-hall game in person to New Hampshire . Ahead of the Feb. 9 primary , he 's in a tight battle with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for second place . Finishing just behind poll-leading Donald Trump , he hopes , could propel him to prominence among establishment Republicans leery of Trump and Cruz , who are topping national surveys .\nHis approach , Kasich and his advisers say , has its roots in reality : It \u2019 s next to impossible to win both contests , so they 're focusing on the state where they have the best shot . The same candidate has won both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary only once in the last seven contested GOP elections : 1976 , the first year Iowa Republicans kicked off the nation \u2019 s voting .\n\u201c I wish I had more time for Iowa , \u201d Kasich said in an interview Wednesday on his campaign bus in New Hampshire . \u201c When we go , we get such good response , so it \u2019 s tempting to keep going back . It \u2019 s time management . It \u2019 s nothing against the folks in Iowa . \u201d\nThe Iowa tele-town halls \u2014 Kasich has held three \u2014 have helped some . On Thursday night , people dropped in and out of the conversation , with as many as 4,375 participants at any time , data from the vendor show . The average participant spent a whopping 32 minutes on the hour-long call , up from 15 minutes and eight minutes in the previous calls . Some Iowans , at least , are interested in Kasich .\nHe told participants on the phone call that he \u2019 d appreciate any boost he can get from their caucus votes .\nWhat about caucusgoers who worry about \u201c throwing away \u201d their votes on a low-polling candidate ?\n\u201c I vote for the person that I like . I don \u2019 t worry about throwing away my vote . I vote for the person who can do a good job , \u201d Kasich said in the interview .\nIn the tele-town halls , Iowans get a taste of the same Kasich they \u2019 d see in person \u2014 minus the teal puffy coat he \u2019 s been wearing this winter , the national debt ticker that decorates his town-hall meetings and the blue bus carting him through the New Hampshire snow .\nWith Kasich , voters get an hour of folksy explanations of complicated policies , plus exhortations to take care of each other , seek a personal purpose , become part of something bigger than themselves .\nHe also makes jokes that make fun of audience members , or himself , or the presidential process . He drops names . ( He \u2019 s friends with John McCain , who twice won the New Hampshire primaries . He got Leonardo DiCaprio \u2019 s autograph for his daughters at a restaurant this month . )\nHe sometimes interrupts questioners or finishes their queries for them .\n\u201c My mind works very fast , you know , and there \u2019 s things that they say that trigger something that I can \u2019 t wait to tell them , \u201d he said in the interview . \u201c I \u2019 m really not trying to cut anybody off , and I \u2019 m certainly not trying to show them any disrespect , but \u2014 can \u2019 t we just kind of get to it ? I \u2019 m just bursting to tell them . \u201d\nRushad Thomas walked right into a Kasich joke Monday night at a town hall in Lebanon , New Hampshire .\n\u201c I think immigration is a good thing , because our population is getting very old-people heavy , \u201d Thomas , 26 , said to the audience , which was also very \u201c old-people heavy , \u201d since the event was at a senior center .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a good thing you \u2019 re not running for president , \u201d Kasich joked .\nKasich almost never travels with his wife , Karen , and 16-year-old twin daughters , Reese and Emma .
