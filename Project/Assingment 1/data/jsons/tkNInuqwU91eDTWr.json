    "content": "( CNN ) President Donald Trump 's allies are mounting a stiff defense of his declaration of a national emergency amid increasing signs that the biggest threat to his border wall now comes not from Congress , but the courts .\nOne of the President 's top policy advisers , Stephen Miller , on Sunday indicated that Trump would cast the first veto of his presidency to defend the highly contentious declaration if lawmakers seek to terminate it .\nDemocrats argued that Trump had launched an unconstitutional power grab because Congress refused to grant his request for billions of dollars in wall funding , and he decided to fund it anyway with money appropriated for other purposes including military construction projects .\nAnd California 's Attorney General Xavier Becerra promised to `` definitely and imminently '' launch a legal challenge to the emergency declaration , one of an expected flurry of suits against Trump 's aggressive executive power move .\nTrump 's announcement , made during a rambling news conference Friday , came after he admitted defeat in his bid to get Congress to pay $ 5.7 billion in wall funding , but avoided triggering a second government shutdown .\nDuring that event , the President appeared to undermine his own arguments in several ways by saying he `` did n't need '' to declare the emergency but wanted to go faster than Congress on border security .\nMiller tried to clean up that remark in an appearance on `` Fox News Sunday .
