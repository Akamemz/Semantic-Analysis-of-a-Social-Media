That 's where , for the first time , he will hop on the campaign plane he will use between now and the November election .

His presidency , stressed Romney , would n't stop the oceans from rising , but it would create jobs , expand energy production and prevent tax increases .\n`` President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet , '' Romney told the crowd after making a State of the Union-like entrance in Tampa . `` My promise is to help you and your family . ''\nHe went after the president with a velvet glove , not a bare fist .

He laid the foundation for this last night . But it is the debates where he 'll have to complete the sale .\nABC 's RICK KLEIN : The country is angry and disappointed , but Mitt Romney cast his fate this week with the latter sentiments . He built the foundations of his candidacy around his biography , and more importantly gave voters who supported President Obama four years ago a permission slip to change their minds about him . The nation may never fall in love with Mitt Romney , but the type of love they talked about this week in Tampa can stay in the family . That works particularly well if someone in that family needs a job .

ABC 's Russell Goldman and Emily Friedman report : In an energized address that followed three days of speeches by allies , friends and family members , Romney sought to reintroduce himself as a candidate who is sympathetic to the concerns of struggling Americans . `` I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed , '' Romney said . `` But his promises gave way to disappointment and division .

Thursday night at the Republican National Convention involved more direct discussion of Romney 's Mormonism than we 've seen previously in this campaign to date , as Romney highlighted something about himself that observers thought might damage him among evangelical Christian voters in the GOP primary . Romney rarely says the word `` Mormon , '' but he did in his primetime speech , and later in it he joked about religion and not asking the church 's pension fund to invest in Bain Capital-because he did n't want to go to Hell-another word Romney rarely , if ever , uses . The quote : `` I figured it was bad enough that I might lose my investors ' money , but I did n't want to go to Hell , too . Shows what I know .
