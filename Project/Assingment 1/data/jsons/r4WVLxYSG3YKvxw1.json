Given the thesis of my book , it should come as little surprise that I 've grown increasingly concerned about the extent to which significant swaths of the US population do not venerate the First Amendment 's core pillars the way we all should , with some prizing tribalism or ideology over principle . For too many , speech that they like is `` free speech , '' whereas speech they dislike is `` hate speech '' or whatever ( reminder : there is no 'hate speech ' exception in the First Amendment ) . As I 've argued before , from both a constitutional and cultural vantage point , our legal and societal commitment to the First Amendment free expression is tested not by anodyne content , but by unpopular , extreme , or even evil views . In the aftermath of Charlottesville , YouGov asked the public whether certain fringe and despicable worldviews should be censored or banned by the government .

Americans are also roughly evenly split on whether people should be barred by law from joining the Klan ( 35/39 ) or the American Nazi Party ( 38/37 ) . There is one demographic that \u2019 s an outlier in the case of the KKK : \u201c Narrow pluralities of Trump voters would allow the speech ( 49 % -39 % ) , and keep the book on the shelves ( 46 % would not remove the book , 39 % would ) . \u201d This is , of course , the correct position if you support the First Amendment .\nHe 's right .

Neo-Nazis or Klansmen do still spill blood , but non-violent expressions of those ideologies are more readily identifiable than is the case with ISIS . But some of this gets complicated . Those of us who are basically First Amendment absolutists have to grapple with the thorny questions like the extent to which someone 's free speech on behalf of , say , pro-ISIS ideas can or should be used to monitor that individual for additional signs of radicalization that may cause him or her to cross into physical attacks . Law enforcement would be derelict not to heed such glaring warning signs -- and that calculation surely also applies to radical right-wing groups and militias , no ? Meanwhile , you may be wondering , what about Antifa ? YouGov did n't poll any explicitly left-wing organizations or movements in its poll ( I 'd love to know why not , given the political violence problem in contemporary America ) .
