'' He was deputy chief of mission in Libya and became top U.S. diplomat in the country after Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in the terror attack .\nThe other statement , by Mark Thompson of the State Department Counterterrorism Bureau , is mostly biographical . Testimony also is due Wednesday from Eric Nordstrom , a diplomatic security officer who was formerly the regional security officer in Libya .\nThe administration has parried Republican allegations lately by arguing that the attack is old news , that the State Department already has investigated it and that Republicans are engaged in a political witch hunt .\nBut a series of carefully timed leaks on the whistle-blowers ' testimony indicates House Republicans could have the goods to at least merit a second look at the administration narrative .\n`` The question is , where 's the accountability for lying to the American people ?
