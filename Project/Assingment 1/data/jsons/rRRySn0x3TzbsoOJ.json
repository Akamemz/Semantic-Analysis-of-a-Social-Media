The influential music publication NME called it an amalgamation of `` warped showtunes , skronking industrial rock , soulful balladeering , airy folk-pop , even hip-hop . ''\nThat in a nutshell was Bowie : There was hardly a musical style he did n't dabble in -- and indelibly leave his mark upon .\nSince his breakthrough with `` Ziggy Stardust , '' Bowie 's reach was eclectic : glam rock , prog rock , pop rock , electronic rock .\nAnd the results ? Electric . To the tune of more than 130 million records sold . The album titles , including `` Aladdin Sane , '' `` Station to Station '' and `` Scary Monsters , '' are familiar to any music fan .\nThough he did n't have his first No . 1 single in the United States until `` Fame '' in 1975 , he 'd already been making a mark with heavily played singles , including `` Space Oddity , '' `` Changes , '' `` Suffragette City , '' `` Rebel Rebel '' and his first Top 40 hit , 1975 's `` Young Americans . ''\nAfter that , he was almost as present on the singles charts as the album charts , with hits such as `` Golden Years , '' `` Under Pressure '' ( with Queen ) , `` Let 's Dance '' ( another No . 1 ) , `` Blue Jean '' and `` Never Let Me Down . ''\n`` David Bowie was one of my most important inspirations , so fearless , so creative , he gave us magic for a lifetime , '' tweeted rapper Kanye West , as news of Bowie 's death made the rounds .\nDavid Bowie was one of my most important inspirations , so fearless , so creative , he gave us magic for a lifetime . \u2014 KANYE WEST ( @ kanyewest ) January 11 , 2016\nHe was born David Jones , to a waitress and a nightclub owner in South London on January 8 , 1947 .\nThough he began his musical life with his birth name , riding the mod wave of the mid-1960s , he changed to `` Bowie '' to avoid confusion with Davy Jones , the lead singer of the Monkees , who was enjoying serious pop success at the time .\nThat reinvention was the first of many . And his timing was often impeccable .\nHe released his song about a doomed astronaut , `` Space Oddity , '' just days before the 1969 moon landing .\nFour years later he killed off his most famous creation , the other-worldly `` Ziggy Stardust , '' just at the point where it threatened to overwhelm him .\nHe soon transformed into the Thin White Duke , a cocksure but coked-out mad aristrocrat . While Ziggy was all arena rock , the Duke was chilled soul . While Ziggy gave him `` Space Oddity , '' the Duke gave him yet another timeless classic , `` Fame , '' a song co-written with John Lennon , one of his many admirers .\n`` I went to the 'Diamond Dogs ' show ( in June 1974 ) expecting something like Ziggy Stardust , '' fan John Neilson told NPR in 2014 . `` And then in October I expected to see something like 'Diamond Dogs , ' and it was the soul revue . It might as well have been a completely different artist . ''\nBowie was as much observer as observed . In a 1974 interview with Dick Cavett , he said he started carrying a cane when he noticed his fans doing so .\n`` He was chameleon in many ways , as we know , '' stage and film producer Robert Fox told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour . `` But he could become a very ordinary-looking man . And sometimes I 'd meet him in New York at a caf\u00e9 , and people would n't recognize him . And they 'd be sitting three feet from him . He could just -- he could fit in . ''\nStill , if it was all part of the package , the burden of living his art in public took a toll . By the mid-1970s , `` Bowie was lost in a haze of cocaine addiction , '' wrote Ultimate Classic Rock 's Frank Mastropolo . He finally holed up in Berlin and recorded the groundbreaking `` Berlin '' trilogy : `` Low , '' `` 'Heroes ' `` and `` Lodger . '' ( The quotation marks around the album title `` 'Heroes ' `` were a deliberate ironic touch . )\n`` I had approached the brink of drug-induced calamity one too many times , and it was essential to take some kind of positive action , '' he said in an interview years later , according to Ultimate Classic Rock\nMusically , he kept one foot in the avant garde . On the song `` Heroes , '' he half-sings , half-screams , with some of the atmosphere provided by white noise .\nOthers paid attention . Composer Philip Glass used `` Low '' and `` 'Heroes ' `` as the subjects of symphonies in the 1990s .\n`` David Bowie was a true innovator , a true creative . May he rest in peace , '' tweeted uber-producer Pharrell Williams\nDespite the edginess , Bowie 's work still resonated with the mainstream . `` Heroes , '' in fact , later became a theme for many . The 2012 British Olympic team entered the stadium to the tune .\nHe even sang a Christmas song , `` The Little Drummer Boy , '' with the most mainstream of American crooners , Bing Crosby , on a 1977 TV special . There were no theatrics , no frills , just Bowie 's pure voice meshing with one of the oldest of the Old Guard .\nStarting with his collaboration with Queen on `` Under Pressure , '' he brilliantly reinvented himself to take full advantage of the music video era .\nThe 1983 `` Let 's Dance '' album , produced by Chic 's Nile Rodgers , became his most commercially successful album , its sound and his look influencing a new generation of musicians . The videos for the album 's singles , including the title cut and `` China Girl , '' were ubiquitous on the music video channel MTV .\nBowie , by then pushing 40 , was as relevant as the era 's power chord-slamming 20-somethings or synthesizer-playing Euro pop stars -- musicians for whom he 'd paved the way .\nThrough it all , his Midas touch made classics of other people 's songs . He produced Lou Reed 's `` Transformer , '' with its hit `` Walk on the Wild Side , '' and Iggy Pop 's `` Lust for Life , '' among others .\n`` David 's friendship was the light of my life . I never met such a brilliant person . He was the best there is , '' Iggy Pop tweeted\nHe also innovated in the sale of his work . In 1997 , he raised $ 55 million by promising investors income from his back catalog . The financial device , labeled the `` Bowie bond , '' was later used for artists such as James Brown and Marvin Gaye .\nBowie 's output thinned in the 1990s and the 2000s , but he was no less envelope-pushing . He experimented with heavy metal , with industrial rock , and with drum and bass .\nBowie 's theatricality was n't limited to performing on stage . In 1976 he played the lead in Nicholas Roeg 's film `` The Man Who Fell to Earth '' as -- perhaps appropriately -- an alien . Four years later , he portrayed Joseph Merrick , who 'd been deformed by a medical condition , in Broadway 's `` The Elephant Man . ''\nBowie continued acting through most of his life , often drawn to unusual characters . He played a vampire in 1983 's `` The Hunger , '' the Goblin King in 1986 's `` Labyrinth , '' Pontius Pilate in 1988 's `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' and Andy Warhol ( about whom Bowie had once written a song ) in 1996 's `` Basquiat . ''\nHe was n't above a little comedy , however . He had cameos in TV shows such as `` SpongeBob SquarePants '' and `` Extras '' and played himself in 2001 's `` Zoolander . ''\nHis androgynous look sometimes led to questions of his sexuality that , like his music , defied classification .\nHe told Playboy magazine in the 1970s that he was bisexual . He told Rolling Stone in the 1980s he had always been a `` closet heterosexual . ''\n`` I was virtually trying anything . I really had a hunger to experience everything that life had to offer , from the opium den to whatever , '' he said . But , he added , he was `` not a particularly hedonistic person -- I tried my best . I was up there with the best of them . I pushed myself into areas just for experiment and bravado , to see what would happen . But , in the final analysis , it 's not really me . ''\nIn 1992 , Bowie married his second wife , model Iman . Their daughter , Alexandria , was born in 2000 .\nBowie had some health problems in the early 2000s , including an emergency angioplasty in 2004 .\nHe also stopped touring after the `` A Reality '' tour in 2003-04 and , until 2013 's `` The Next Day , '' he had n't put out an album in 10 years .\nBut recent months had seen signs of a Bowie re-emergence . Aside from `` The Next Day , '' he co-wrote the current stage play `` Lazarus , '' based on `` The Man Who Fell to Earth , '' and recorded and released `` Blackstar . ''\n`` He 'd just go from zero to 60 once we walked out of the control room and into the studio , '' drummer Mark Guiliana told Rolling Stone about the `` Blackstar '' sessions . `` And his vocal performances were always just stunning , amazing . ''\nLongtime producer Tony Visconti reportedly turned the tables on Friday , having fans sing `` Happy Birthday '' to Bowie over the phone during Visconti 's live performance in New York .\nFox , who produced Bowie 's musical `` Lazarus '' and knew the singer for 40 years , told CNN that Bowie was in good spirits when the pair met only weeks ago .\n`` He was n't felling particularly well . I knew that I only had a brief moment , '' Fox said . `` But he was impeccable as ever . His manners were impeccable . And he talked about the future of the show . He talked a little about the treatment that he was going to start . And he was optimistic and hopeful and positive as ever . ''\nBowie was always busy , always on to the next thing .\nTwenty years ago , interviewed by Mick Brown of the UK Telegraph , he coolly assessed his past , but -- typically Bowie -- looked to the future .\nAt the time , he was reveling in the paintings of Damien Hirst and had plans for another project with producer Brian Eno . And there was no sense in waiting , he said .",
