    "content": "The influx of children and mothers from Central America last summer has caused an even larger backlog in an already overtaxed immigration court system , according to a Syracuse University study . The backlog hit a record 445,607 at the end of April , according to the report , a rise of 9.2 percent since the beginning of the current fiscal year.The backlog has risen 29.5 percent since the beginning of fiscal year 2014 , the report said , when it was at 344,230 cases.The backlog existed even before the well-publicized cases of mothers with children and unaccompanied minors flooding into the southern border a year ago from El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras . But those cases have received expedited `` rocket docket '' status , pushing older cases off.Some now are n't scheduled to be heard until 2019.Some immigrants who expect to be deported once their cases are heard are happy with the wait , The Dallas Morning News reports . But that is n't so for others , who expect to win their cases and be allowed to stay in the country . `` We see people coming into our office every day whose lives are being negatively impacted by this , '' Jonathan Ryan , executive director of the San Antonio-based legal advocacy group Raices , told the Los Angeles Times . Ryan gave the example of a Syrian family unable to work until their case is heard in 2019 . `` Their whole family is in a state of paralysis or suspense because they can \u2019 t move forward in the backlog , '' Ryan said . `` The people being prioritized in the backlog are the most vulnerable children and mothers who are essentially getting railroaded . The prioritization is backwards . `` Most of the cases making up the backlog are from Mexico , the report says , but those cases have risen only 3.7 percent since fiscal 2014 . Cases among people from Honduras are up 142.7 percent , while those from El Salvador are up 92.4 percent and Guatemala 62.5 percent.Backlogged cases of people from China fell 2.4 percent.Another contributor to the backlog is a low number of immigration judges . The high workload has them retiring as soon as they are eligible . `` The pace of these cases continues to be relentless , particularly as the administration has chosen to prioritize recent arrivals , \u201d San Francisco immigration Judge Dana Leigh Marks told the Times . `` It means that my pending caseload just gets pushed to the back , which is problematic in its own right because often there are compelling issues in those cases , '' she said . `` People lose track of witnesses , a qualifying relative may pass away or become an adult , where it \u2019 s required the person be a child to confer a benefit . `` Currently serving as president of the National Association of Immigration Judges , Marks expects a `` tsunami '' of retirements and is calling for 100 more judges to be hired .",
