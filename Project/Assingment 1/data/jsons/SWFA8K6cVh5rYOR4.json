    "content": "As a critical care doctor in New York City , Monica is used to dealing with high-octane situations and treating severely ill patients . But she says the COVID-19 outbreak is unlike anything she \u2019 s seen before . Over the past few weeks , operating rooms have been transformed into ICUs , physicians of all backgrounds have been drafted into emergency room work , and two of her colleagues became ICU patients . While Monica is proud of her coworkers for rising to the challenge , she says it \u2019 s been hard for them to fight a prolonged battle against a deadly , highly contagious illness with no known cure .\nTo make matters worse , Monica recently tested positive for COVID-19 , and she believes she brought the virus home to her husband . Both have gotten sick and are improving , but he had a much harder time with the disease than she did . Monica says that , while she \u2019 s used the inherent risk of her job , she feels her hospital failed to protect her and her family \u2014 and she blames herself , in part , for her husband \u2019 s illness . \u201c There \u2019 s this sinking feeling that you have , \u201d says Monica , who requested anonymity because she feared professional repercussions for speaking candidly , \u201c not only , like , the hospital let you down , and that the system let us down as doctors and didn \u2019 t protect us , but then I didn \u2019 t protect my own family . \u201d\nIn hospitals around the world , doctors , nurses and other healthcare workers like Monica are fighting an enemy that has already killed more than 95,000 people , including over 16,000 in the United States . And as with any war , the fight against COVID-19 will result not just in direct casualties , but also take a terrible toll on the minds of many of those who survive .\nIt will be years before the mental health toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is fully understood , but some early data already paints a bleak picture . A study published March 23 in the medical journal JAMA found that , among 1,257 healthcare workers working with COVID-19 patients in China , 50.4 % reported symptoms of depression , 44.6 % symptoms of anxiety , 34 % insomnia , and 71.5 % reported distress . Nurses and other frontline workers were among those with the most severe symptoms .\nIn interviews with TIME , several doctors and nurses said that fighting COVID-19 is making them feel more dedicated to their profession , and determined to push through and help their patients . However , many also admitted to harboring darker feelings . They \u2019 re afraid of spreading the disease to their families , frustrated about a lack of adequate protective gear and a sense they can \u2019 t do enough for their patients , exhausted as hours have stretched longer without a clear end in sight , and , most of all , deeply sad for their dying patients , many of whom are slipping away without their loved ones at their side .\nIt \u2019 s those lonely deaths that have hit the hardest for some . Natalie Jones , an ICU-registered nurse at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton in New Jersey , says it \u2019 s been agonizing to have to turn away people who want to visit their loved ones one last time . She \u2019 s trying to find ways to be compassionate where she can \u2014 last week , she passed on a message from a patient \u2019 s wife just before he died : \u201c That they love him , and it \u2019 s O.K . to go. \u201d But even simply carrying a message of such emotional weight can take a toll .\n\u201c We carry that burden for the families , too , \u201d says Jones , who \u2019 s having difficultly sleeping without nightmares . \u201c And we understand it \u2019 s so difficult that they can \u2019 t be there . And that hurts us too . As nurses , we \u2019 re healers , and we \u2019 re compassionate . It hits very close to home for us as well . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 re all affected , \u201d adds Jones , whose already hectic schedule has gotten even more intense amid the outbreak , costing her the sleep that might otherwise help her cope with what she \u2019 s experiencing . \u201c To say that we \u2019 re not would be a lie . \u201d\nThe coronavirus is taking a mental toll even on those medical experts who aren \u2019 t on the front lines . Since the start of the outbreak , Dr. Morgan Katz , an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University , has been advising nursing homes and long-term care centers on dealing with the coronavirus . But she \u2019 s struggling with the gap between what she believes to be the proper procedures and what \u2019 s actually possible in this crisis . Many of the facilities she \u2019 s advising are suffering from a lack of protective equipment , limited staffing and insufficient testing , and a sense of helplessness is taking hold .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t have the resources before this that we needed , and this has completely strapped them beyond anything feasible , \u201d says Katz . \u201c It \u2019 s so sad . I really feel for these nursing homes and the staff of these nursing homes , because I truly believe that they \u2019 re trying to do the right thing . But I really don \u2019 t feel like they \u2019 re being protected the way that we need to protect them . \u201d\nFinding ways to support medical workers \u2019 mental health could be a key component in the fight against COVID-19 . Dr. Albert Wu , professor of health policy and management and medicine at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , says that evidence from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggests that failing to support healthcare workers in a crisis , including by not providing enough protective gear , can erode their \u201c wellbeing and resilience , \u201d ultimately leading to chronic burnout . Some healthcare workers could leave the profession , be absent more often from work , or develop PTSD , and any preexisting mental health conditions could be exacerbated . Furthermore , healthcare workers are human like the rest of us , and under extreme stress , they could be prone to making mistakes \u2014 which could lead to worse outcomes for patients , and further erode doctors \u2019 and nurses \u2019 mental health . \u201c We can \u2019 t get away from our physiology , \u201d says Wu .\nIf healthcare workers can \u2019 t provide the care they typically believe is medically necessary for their patients , they may experience a phenomenon known as \u201c moral injury , \u201d says Dr. Wendy Dean , a psychiatrist and the co-founder of the nonprofit Fix Moral Injury . Dean says that American healthcare providers are used to doing anything and everything to help their patients , but inadequate protective gear and triage procedures will force them to make \u201c exquisitely painful \u201d decisions , such as choosing whether or not to risk infecting themselves , their family and other patients in order to help everyone in their care .\nStill , Dean says the scope of the mental health crisis among healthcare workers won \u2019 t come into focus until the more immediate problem has ebbed .\n\u201c When I think the real challenge is going to come is when the pandemic eases up and people start having time to process , \u201d she says . \u201c All that they \u2019 ve seen , all that they \u2019 ve done , all that they \u2019 ve felt and pushed away . \u201d\nSeveral healthcare workers said that , amid all the uncertainty and horrors , they have found some relief in drawing upon support from their families , communities , and one another .
