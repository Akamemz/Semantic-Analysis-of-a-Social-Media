The memo was also signed by Julia Sinclair, senior vice president of clinical services and incident commander.\n\nBrigham spokesperson Erin McDonough said the providers did not work while symptomatic. She said the hospital can not identify or release details about the providers or their specific jobs because of privacy rules. Another person with knowledge of the situation said they are both doctors.\n\nMcDonough said in an e-mail that the hospital undertook an \u201cintensive tracing process\u201d that involved a detailed review of every patient and employee the providers interacted with during a particular time period.\n\nAmid all the precautions about the coronavirus spread, government leaders were aghast Sunday at reports of crowds spotted flocking to bars and restaurants in South Boston Saturday night.\n\nThe city\u2019s Licensing Board moved swiftly Sunday \u2014 even before Baker\u2019s broader restrictions were announced in the evening \u2014 announcing a voluntary agreement with more than a dozen bars and restaurants to shut down.\n\nThe mayor announced in the morning that he would restrict Boston restaurants, bars, and clubs to half their capacity and to close their doors each night by 11. But Walsh\u2019s order was ultimately overtaken by Baker\u2019s broader bans.\n\nMeanwhile, Sunday, Senator Edward J. Markey called for a wartime-like mobilization of private manufacturing to supply hospitals with the tests and protective equipment they need to handle the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn a Boston press conference, Markey urged the Trump administration to use the Defense Production Act, a law passed near the start of the Korean War in 1950, to mobilize private industry for defense production. Markey called for exponential increases in production of testing kits and protective gear such as respirator masks for health care workers.\n\nMarkey\u2019s comments were echoed by Dr. Peter Slavin, the president of Massachusetts General Hospital, who said he\u2019s worried about the shortage of personal protective equipment needed to keep doctors and nurses safe as they confront rising numbers of infected patients.\n\n\u201cWe need to think of this in almost a war-like stance,\u201d Slavin said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\n\u201cEven before the most significant battles [that] lie ahead, our supplies are low,\" he said of the protective gear. \"We wouldn\u2019t want to send soldiers into war without helmets and armor. We don\u2019t want to do the same with our health care workers.\u201d\n\nGal Tziperman Lotan, Liz Kowalczyk, Priyanka Dayal McCluskey, Jaclyn Reiss, Adam Vaccaro of the Globe staff, and Globe correspondents Lucas Phillips, Max Jungreis, and Abigail Feldman contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\nFelice Belman can be reached at felice.belman@globe.com.
