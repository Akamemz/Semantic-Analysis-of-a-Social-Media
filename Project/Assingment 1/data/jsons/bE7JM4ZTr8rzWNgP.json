He loves baseball and basketball , plays Xbox with his friends when they come over , and posts innocuous pictures of the family dog on his Instagram feed . Given these mundane facts about the boy , you can imagine my surprise when , while watching the news ( again , seemingly from out of nowhere ) he asked me , `` If pot is so bad , why are they trying to legalize it ? ''\nAnd , just like that , the long and involved talk my wife and I had given our children about drugs was tossed out the window .\nWe had explained the harmful effects of marijuana .

Let me tell you why .\nIf you have a fever and you go to the doctor and he tells you that you have pneumonia , do you ask him to treat the fever , or do you ask him to treat the pneumonia ? Most of us would ask him to treat the pneumonia because the pneumonia is the problem ; the fever is the symptom .\nIt 's the same way with the argument about the legalization of marijuana . I 'm not interested in focusing on the symptom ; I want to eradicate the problem . And the problem is that we 're even considering legalizing marijuana at all .\nLet 's take a look at the medical marijuana issue in Los Angeles ( where I live ) and we can see where legalization takes us . It has been my experience that anyone can get a medical marijuana card in L.A. ; all you need is $ 25- $ 100 and the ability to lie about needing it . You just make an appointment with some company , walk in and state your problem ( s ) and why you need a card ( with no proof of medical conditions whatsoever ) and you will be prescribed a card that is good for one year . It 's a toothless system that is n't well-regulated .\nWhy are some of the people who petition for legalizing marijuana so passionate about it ? Because when you smoke pot , you get loaded . You fry your brain . That 's why the patients I see in my treatment center call it `` getting baked .
