    "content": "For nearly fifteen hours between Wednesday morning and early Thursday , Senator Chris Murphy ( D-CT ) , along with his Connecticut colleague Senator Richard Blumenthal ( D ) and Senator Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) , led a filibuster on the floor of the Senate aimed at addressing gun control issues in the aftermath of last weekend \u2019 s mass shooting in Orlando . Other than learning that Wednesday is pizza night in the Murphy household , what else should we take away from this Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\u00ad-style exercise ? Here are three lessons :\n1 .

Indeed , 38 of Murphy \u2019 s 45 Democratic colleagues ( as well as two Republicans , Senators Ben Sasse ( R-NE ) and Pat Toomey ( R-PA ) ) , came to the chamber yesterday to ask \u201c questions. \u201d In many cases , these were lengthy speeches\u2014Senator Tammy Baldwin ( D-WI ) , for example , read brief biographies of all 49 Orlando victims\u2014in which the speaker satisfied the question requirement with a conclusion that asked Murphy for his reactions to their statement .\nThis kind of teamwork on extended speech-making is not unusual . When Senator Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) took the floor to talk for 21 hours about the Affordable Care Act in 2013 , he took questions from nine fellow Republicans ( as well as two Democrats ) . Last May , Senator Rand Paul ( R-KY ) got an assist from ten colleagues , including seven Democrats , during his filibuster of a bill extending the PATRIOT Act . The depth of Murphy \u2019 s bench not only reduced the energy he had to expend speaking , but also helped guarantee that the entire discussion was on-message and focused on the topic at hand ; Murphy did not have to resort to reading the phone book to fill the hours .\n2 . In policy terms , it \u2019 s hard to know if the filibuster was a success\u2026\nWhen Murphy left the floor early Thursday morning , it was reported that Senate leaders had agreed to consider two gun control amendments : one that would address the ability of suspected terrorists to purchase guns and a second that would expand background checks for gun purchases .
