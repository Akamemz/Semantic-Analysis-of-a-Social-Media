    "content": "Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said Friday that he voted to give President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate foreign trade deals because it would increase exports from both the United States and his home state and would `` ensure that the president 's trade negotiations occur in a transparent manner . `` `` Trade promotion authority is a valuable economic tool , but it is important for Congress to retain oversight of the administration 's negotiations , '' the first-term Republican said . `` This legislation allows for both . `` Most importantly , it ensures that products produced or grown in Arkansas have increased access to world markets , '' Cotton said.But Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions slammed the bill because it would further destroy U.S. jobs and lacks strong provisions to hold foreign companies accountable for violating international trade law . `` Stubbornly , our political elites have treated trade as a matter of religion , '' Sessions said . `` To them , there is no such thing as a bad deal . They know American workers lose jobs when we allow trading partners to cheat . But they insist it is all for the greater good . `` We have allowed state-dominated and mercantilist trading partners to maintain their varied and elaborate non-tariff barriers , exporting their unemployment to our shores . `` This is why the American worker keeps ending up on the losing end , '' Sessions said.These differences among the two Republican senators illustrate the tense debate over two weeks surrounding the trade authority legislation that the Senate passed 62-37 late Friday as the chamber neared the start of its Memorial Day recess.The vote cleared the way for a highly unpredictable summer showdown in the House . The lower chamber has not yet debated the bill.The legislation would allow President Barack Obama to complete trade deals that Congress could approve or reject but not change . The White House would have to publish details of any agreement at least 60 days before any congressional vote.Obama is seeking to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) agreement with Japan and 10 other Pacific nations \u2014 and the legislation , known as Trade Promotion Authority ( TPA ) , was considered critical to his second-term agenda . Forty-eight Republicans joined Cotton in supporting the legislation . They included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sens . Orrin Hatch of Utah , John McCain of Arizona , Chuck Grassley of Iowa , and Tim Scott of South Carolina . `` This has been a long time coming , '' Hatch said as the bill headed to a final vote . The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , he co-sponsored the bill with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon . `` I 've been working on this bill for the past four years . `` This is an important bill , '' Hatch added . `` It shows that when the president 's right , we will support him . `` Two announced GOP presidential candidates supported the bill : Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio . Another declared candidate , Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul , opposed the legislation.Other Republicans siding against the bill were Sens . Susan Collins of Maine , Mike Lee of Utah , and Richard Shelby of Alabama . GOP Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming did not vote.Only 14 of 44 Democrats backed the bill \u2014 and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren led the charge , openly warring with the White House and exposing raw wounds between her and Obama.They also argued that the bill would send jobs overseas and does not address minimum-wage issues or guard against foreign sweatshops.To mollify Democrats , however , the legislation included $ 1.8 billion in retraining funds for U.S. workers who lose their jobs because of exports . Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake argued that the funds duplicated other federal efforts , but his attempt to strip out the funds was defeated , 53-35.In addition , an amendment that would have punished countries for manipulating their currency failed narrowly , 51-48 , several hours before the bill cleared.Republican Sen . Rob Portman of Ohio , who backed the trade bill , and Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow , who opposed it , had proposed the amendment.They sought to make allegations of currency manipulation subject to the same `` dispute settlement procedures '' as other obligations under any trade deal.Before leaving for the holiday recess , the Senate was also expected to vote early Saturday on whether to renew the Patriot Act , which was signed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and authorized the National Security Agency 's controversial metadata collection programs.The Senate trade bill must be debated by the House , where many conservative Republicans and Democrats are expected to oppose it for many of the same reasons as those in the upper chamber.Still , House Speaker John Boehner praised the Senate for its work . `` Trade helps create good-paying American jobs , so it 's good news that the Senate has put us one step closer to eliminating trade barriers , '' he said . `` These reforms have the support of farmers , manufacturers , small-business owners , and Americans from all walks of life , and it \u2019 s not hard to figure out why . It is a no-brainer . `` The House will take up this measure , and Republicans will do our part , but ultimately success will require Democrats putting politics aside and doing what 's best for the country , '' Boehner said . `` Let 's seize this opportunity to open new doors for the things Americans make and the people who make them . `` McConnell said the vote proved that `` Republicans and Democrats can stand strong , together , for the middle class . It 's yet another example of a new Congress that 's back to work on behalf of the American people . `` Georgia Sen. David Perdue cited the legislation 's strong oversight provisions . `` This trade tool adds more transparency and accountability than ever before , '' he said . `` It guarantees that Congress has all the information needed to make an informed up-or-down vote on any trade agreement with strong oversight measures . `` If President Obama does not follow the strict procedures put in place , Congress can completely strip his negotiating authority , '' Perdue added . `` Ultimately , TPA keeps Congress in control of all trade deals and holds the Obama administration accountable every step of the way . `` But Sessions argued that the bill left Congress with no ability to change any agreements negotiated by the White House . `` Under fast-track , Congress transfers its most basic legislative powers to the executive branch for six years , '' he said . `` Any yet-unseen global pacts , no matter how sweeping , are guaranteed a 'fast-track ' to congressional adoption . `` No amendments . No ability to strike any offending provision , and no chance to apply either the 60- or 67-vote thresholds used for important legislation and treaties . `` During the two weeks leading up to Friday 's vote , Sessions said he asked Obama specific questions about how the fast-track authority would affect U.S. jobs , wages and trade deficits . `` He would not answer , '' the senator said . `` The bill 's promoters also refused to answer when asked whether their proposal would reduce net manufacturing jobs in the United States . That is because they know it will . `` Citing the 2011 trade deal the United States signed with South Korea , `` which doubled the our trade deficit after promises of a trade renaissance , '' Sessions charged that `` this proposal will further widen our trade deficits and eliminate jobs . `` `` The Trans-Pacific Partnership opens our markets to foreign imports but allows foreign countries to continue closing their market to ours .
