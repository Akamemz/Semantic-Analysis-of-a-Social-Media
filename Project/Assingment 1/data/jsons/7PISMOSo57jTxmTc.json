How he ended up captive remains a bit of a mystery . U.S. officials have declined to go into detail , but soldiers in his platoon say he was pulling guard duty when he put down his weapons and walked off base . He reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing U.S. activities in Afghanistan , according to 2012 reporting by late Rolling Stone reporter Michael Hastings .\nBluntly , they resent any talk of Bergdahl as a hero . They say he 's a deserter who should be put on trial , especially in light of the deaths of at least six U.S. soldiers killed while looking for him .\n`` I was pissed off then and I am even more so now with everything going on , '' said Matt Vierkant , who was in the same platoon as Bergdahl . `` Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him . ''\n`` I do n't understand why we 're trading prisoners at Gitmo for somebody who deserted during a time of war , which is an act of treason , '' Vierkant said .\nU.S. officials are n't saying that , at least not directly . When asked about the issue Sunday , Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sidestepped the question . `` Our first priority is assuring his well-being and his health and getting him reunited with his family , '' Hagel said . `` Other circumstances that may develop and questions , those will be dealt with later . ''\nOn Monday , Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby said U.S. officials `` still do n't have a complete picture of what caused him to leave his base that night . ''\n`` But let 's not forget , he was held captive as a prisoner for five years . Five years by himself , '' Kirby said . `` That 's a pretty high price to pay for whatever impelled him to walk off that base . ''\nHe 's at an American military hospital in Germany being evaluated by doctors and facing a lengthy repatriation and reintegration process .\nHe 's in stable condition `` receiving treatment for conditions that require hospitalization , '' Landstuhl Regional Medical Center said in a statement . Beyond saying he requires attention to `` dietary and nutrition needs , '' the hospital did n't elaborate , citing medical privacy requirements .\n`` The Landstuhl staff is sensitive to what Sgt . Bergdahl has been through and will proceed with his reintegration at a pace with which he is comfortable , '' the hospital said .\nThose in charge of treating Bergdahl are working to build up his confidence in them , a senior Defense Department official said , noting that Bergdahl has n't been able to trust anyone for five years .\nDoctors in Germany are evaluating his health and whether he 's ready to be transported , said Arwen Consaul , a spokeswoman for U.S. Army South .\nOnce doctors give the OK , a receiving team will travel there to facilitate his transport to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio , Texas . From there , he 'll head to the San Antonio Military Medical Center , where a room is already ready for Bergdahl and a support team is standing by , Consaul said .\n`` That will obviously occur , but it wo n't occur until I think everybody believes it 's the right time , '' he said .\nThe first meeting between Bergdahl and his parents may only last minutes , Consaul said , depending on what psychologists recommend .\nOnce in the United States , she said , Bergdahl 's daily routine will focus on four key areas : medical care , psychological support , debriefings and family support .\n`` This is to help a person who has had no control of their own life for years now regain that control step by step , '' she said .\nYes , according to a senior Defense Department official , but the reasons for it are n't clear .\nIt may be that he has n't used English since he was captured , instead speaking to his captors in Pashtun , the local language .\nRoy Hallums , a private contractor held by Iraqi insurgents for 10 months , said he did n't have trouble readjusting to English , but said he could n't talk for a while because he had been forced to stay silent under threat of death .\n`` It 's like your vocal chords are like your muscles in your arms . If they do n't get any use , they get out of shape , '' he told CNN 's `` New Day . ''\nWhat about these detainees the U.S. let go ? Should we worry about them ?\nAccording to senior U.S. officials , they 're mid- to high-level officials from the Taliban regime that ruled Afghanistan when the United States invaded the country . They include figures said to be linked to the late terror leader Osama bin Laden , his al Qaeda terror network and to abuses inside Afghanistan during the Taliban 's rule .\nBut Kirby said Monday that U.S. officials have received assurances from Qatari officials that the men `` were not going to pose a direct threat to the national security of the United States . ''\nHe declined to go into detail , but according to a senior defense official , they will be subject to Qatari supervision and a one-year travel ban .\nThere are n't any other U.S. military personnel being held , so there wo n't be any more swaps involving troops , at least . But it 's possible that Bergdahl 's release presages a broader release of Afghan citizens from Guantanamo Bay , said CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen .\n`` At the end of hostilities , both sides typically swap prisoners , and we 're coming to the end of conventional hostilities between these two groups , '' he said .\n`` We look at each case differently , '' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters .\nBergdahl `` is a member of the military who was detained during an armed conflict .
