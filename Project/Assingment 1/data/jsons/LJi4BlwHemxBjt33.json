We \u2019 re making real progress on a spending deal that would increase the caps for both military and middle-class priorities on the domestic side that my colleagues have been fighting for . \u201d\nSchumer said some \u201c outstanding issues \u201d remain , but stressed he is \u201c very hopeful \u201d for a deal .\nSchumer won \u2019 t sign off on a final deal unless Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Health Care : Trump officials making changes to drug pricing proposal | House panel advances flavored e-cig ban | Senators press FDA tobacco chief on vaping ban Speaker Pelosi , it 's time to throw American innovators a lifeline Why Americans must tune in to the Trump impeachment hearings MORE ( D-Calif. ) supports it , and the legislation will need the backing of House Democrats to get through that chamber , according to Democratic aides .\nPelosi is under pressure from members of her caucus to get a commitment from Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis Ryan Retirees should say 'no thanks ' to Romney 's Social Security plan California Governor Newsom and family dress as 2020 Democrats for Halloween DC 's liaison to rock ' n ' roll MORE ( R-Wis. ) on a House vote to protect immigrants brought to the United States as children who could face deportation beginning next month .\nIn the Senate , McConnell has agreed to a floor debate meant to produce immigration legislation .\nRep.

We had one Trump shutdown , nobody wants another , maybe except him , \u201d Schumer said .\nIt appears lawmakers in both parties would rather avoid more shutdowns after the three-day government stoppage in January . While Democrats were seen as getting the worst of that one , both parties are tired of the stopgap funding measures and see risks in the perpetual shutdowns .\nOne Republican lawmaker attending the White House meeting pushed back at Trump .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t need a government shutdown on this , \u201d Rep.
