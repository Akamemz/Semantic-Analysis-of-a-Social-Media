    "content": "My Yale Law School colleague Bruce Ackerman has proposed a theory of constitutional change that he calls \u201c constitutional moments. \u201d The idea was spelled out in a series of lectures , later published in the Yale Law Journal and in Ackerman \u2019 s multi-volume history of the Constitution , We the People ; it is impossible to do it justice in a sentence or two . For our purposes it will suffice to say that the essence of Ackerman \u2019 s theory is that constitutions are changed not only by the formal amendment process but also when prominent political actors act contrary to the existing constitution but the people accept and validate their actions , thereby establishing a new constitutional norm .\nAckerman \u2019 s theory does not appeal to originalists , who believe the only legitimate way to change our written Constitution is through the Article V process of amendments passed by supermajorities in the House and Senate and ratified by three-fourths of the states . Leaving aside its constitutional pedigree , Ackerman \u2019 s theory does describe accurately how the meaning of constitutions may sometimes change in practice not only in the U.S. but also around the world . Political power ultimately resides in The People , and what they are willing to accept becomes the new normal .\nWe are currently in the midst of a constitutional moment in Ackerman \u2019 s sense . The stakes were defined by Harvard Law School constitutional law professor Noah Feldman in a perceptive op-ed titled \u201c Trump \u2019 s firing of Comey is a crisis of American rule of law . \u201d\nFeldman begins by acknowledging that \u201c Technically , President Donald Trump was within his constitutional rights \u2026 when he fired FBI Director James Comey. \u201d Ah , what a wonderful word \u201c technically \u201d is ; it is used to dismiss the old law that is about to be consigned to the dustbin of history . The real law , according to Feldman , is not the words written on ancient parchment but the law in action that has developed under our living constitution : \u201c The erosion of the independence of law enforcement is thus a blow to the unwritten constitutional norm of political neutrality . It doesn \u2019 t violate the separation of powers . But it violates a norm that in its own way is almost as important . \u201d\nFeldman is correct that an unwritten norm has developed that certain aspects of government are too important to be monkeyed with by mere democratically elected politicians .
