It \u2019 s just a matter of will , \u201d says Nicola Draoli , an Italian nurse .\nHospitals and clinics are also ramping up telemedicine , out of necessity , amid a pandemic that requires social distancing and has put huge strain on health care resources . This pivot has drawn attention to telemedicine as a longer-term solution that could help overcome , at least in some aspects of medicine , the shortfalls in medical staff in rich aging societies like Italy and Germany .\nLong before COVID-19 hit the headlines , health care systems across Europe and the U.S. had been struggling to plug recruitment gaps , particularly in their nursing ranks . Now that shortfall has become a crisis , leading to a call-up of recent retirees and new graduates to support front-line staff treating patients .\nVeteran Seattle nurse Carolyn Grant had just finished kicking off her retirement with a trip to Hawaii when she got a text from her old boss : Would Ms. Grant come out of retirement to help the medical center \u2019 s COVID-19 testing program ? That night , she said yes .\nIn Germany , where \u201c not a single hospital has enough staff , \u201d says a Berlin ICU nurse , the government is calling medical students to action , and dissolving bureaucratic hurdles so hospitals can mobilize more medical workers .\nIn Italy , which has seen the world \u2019 s highest coronavirus death toll , the government has asked recently retired doctors to come back to work , and allocated funding to hire 20,000 more health professionals .\nChronic worker shortages can be patchworked during normal times , but as the COVID-19 pandemic slams medical systems around the globe , having the right personnel can mean the difference between life and death . Administrators are rehiring retired professionals , tapping medical students before they even graduate , and turning to the military and volunteers to supplement a stretched workforce that even before the current crisis was coming up short .\n\u201c It is like we have a blanket that is too short and everyone is trying to pull it to his side , \u201d says Nicola Draoli , an Italian nurse .\nFrom Berlin to Seattle , hospitals and clinics are also ramping up telehealth options , which in a few weeks have been overcoming medical , bureaucratic , and consumer resistance that had stymied advocates for years . As COVID-19 brings waves of patients through hospital and clinic doors , health care systems are turning to solutions that might become increasingly attractive going forward .\n\u201c If there is one positive aspect , this crisis is proving that reforming health care doesn \u2019 t necessarily take decades . It \u2019 s just a matter of will , \u201d says Mr. Draoli , a member of the central committee of Italy \u2019 s national federation of nursing .\nIn Berlin , a nurse in an intensive care unit who prefers to be called Nico because he \u2019 s not authorized to speak to the news media loves working with patients , and the undersupply of nurses means ironclad job stability . \u201c I think I could work at any hospital or any ICU in Germany , \u201d he says .\nBut the shortage has downsides : The hospital had closed a quarter of its ICU beds over the last two years due to lack of staff . Nico was constantly on call to pick up extra shifts , and also needed to clean patient rooms and tidy pharmacies due to a shortage of assistants . Over the years , Nico has seen colleagues vote with their feet . \u201c The workload is so heavy , \u201d he says .\nToday , Nico \u2019 s hospital is prepping for the COVID-19 crisis by adding ICU beds and training non-ICU staff . Administrators are also preparing to hire medical students , who now have government-mandated flexibility for education , training , and licensing requirements .\n\u201c We \u2019 re waiting for the big wave of patients , expecting it to hit in late April , \u201d says Nico .\nGermany is currently facing a shortage of 70,000 nurses in hospitals alone , according to Verdi , a German trade union . \u201c We \u2019 ve lost 300,000 health care workers each year to retirement , \u201d says Stefan Sell , a professor of economics and social policy at the University of Koblenz . \u201c And the younger generation is very small , and young people go into other jobs . \u201d\nThe situation is no better in other developed countries . Italy is currently short about 53,000 nurses , estimates Mr. Draoli of the nursing federation . The United Kingdom \u2019 s National Health Service is missing about 100,000 health care workers of all kinds , and the United States needs to recruit at least 200,000 more registered nurses each year . All have aging populations that need more elder and long-term care .\nThe main reasons are high turnover and not enough new nursing graduates entering the workforce in wealthy countries . Sociocultural factors also come into play ; most health care workers are women , who are more likely to take part-time shifts because of child care requirements , says Dr. Sell , meaning you need more hires to provide full-time coverage .\nPut simply , the job isn \u2019 t attractive enough , as pay for nursing and medical assistant work hasn \u2019 t remained competitive . In Italy , for example , health care salaries have declined from roughly 40 % of the country \u2019 s annual public health budget two decades ago , to less than a third today .\n\u201c In the U.K. , we have a lot of vacancies that remain unfilled , \u201d says Dr. Rocco Friebel , a London School of Economics health policy professor . \u201c Working conditions are poor . It \u2019 s a very high-pressure job . \u201d\nStaffing projections worldwide are sobering . By 2030 , countries in North , Central and South America are expected to face a combined shortage of roughly 2.5 million doctors , nurses , and other workers , with Europe \u2019 s shortfall at around 1.4 million , according to a 2017 study by medical researchers .\nGovernments in the U.S. and Europe have attempted to tackle shortages by shifting workloads , digitizing services , providing funding to create elder care positions , and looking at worker wage increases , among other initiatives .\n\u201c In the U.K. , we \u2019 ve seen a push to employ clinical assistants , who can do bookkeeping and a lot of the day-to-day tasks , which then frees up fully qualified nurses to take care of the most severe cases , \u201d says Dr. Friebel .\nBut the main strategy in wealthy nations is to fill their ranks with foreign nurses and health care workers . The German government is working with Kosovo , Mexico , and the Philippines to integrate workers into its health care system . In the U.K. , the National Health Service has long tapped European Union nationals , especially those from Poland and other Eastern European countries , to fill jobs .\nThat \u2019 s only a partial solution , says Dr. Sell , the German economist , in part because of the competition . \u201c A lot of other countries such as the Netherlands , France , and Switzerland are also trying to get people from Russia , Ukraine , and other countries , \u201d he says . Also , he points out , many potential migrants don \u2019 t speak the adopted country \u2019 s language .\n\u201c Ultimately , we have to get additional staff from our [ home ] labor force , \u201d says Dr. Sell . \u201c That will require a multidimensional strategy such as improving working conditions and education \u201d for workers .\nA shortage that will take decades to solve feels acute in the face of a pandemic .\nIn the U.S. , top officials are crying out for medical volunteers of all stripes . In New York , more than 50,000 health care workers have answered Gov . Andrew Cuomo \u2019 s pleas . In California , a newly created health corps to expand the workforce has garnered more than 70,000 registrations from \u201c underemployed \u201d medical professionals of all stripes .\nIn Washington state , Gov . Jay Inslee last week told recent medical retirees and qualified students , \u201c Like Uncle Sam , we want you ! \u201d\nAnother infusion of medical manpower is coming from the U.S. military . Three hundred soldiers from an Army unit in Fort Carson , Colorado , arrived in Seattle last week to set up a 250-bed hospital inside the Seattle Seahawks \u2019 football stadium , and a Navy hospital ship has docked in New York City . By caring for patients without COVID-19 , they can free up local hospital beds for those who have the virus .\nHealth care workers are also being asked to shift gears , as they \u2019 re redeployed to other units , such as from transplant ICUs to respiratory care .\nItaly \u2019 s worst-hit regions like Lombardy are also tapping another strategy : emphasizing primary-care monitoring and home care rather than hospital admissions . \u201c Hospitals have always seen too many people that don \u2019 t belong in the hospital , \u201d says Dr. Friebel , the analyst .\nAs Italian doctors have discovered by necessity , initial screenings of suspected COVID-19 patients can be done without a physical visit .\n\u201c It turns out that a lot of both screening and follow-up of [ COVID-19 ] patients \u2013 the mild cases \u2013 is about asking questions about symptoms , \u201d says Joseph Kvedar , a Harvard Medical School professor and incoming president of the American Telemedicine Association . \u201c It \u2019 s a perfect setup for [ telehealth ] technology . \u201d\nAdvocates of telemedicine say many health care needs can , in fact , be serviced without stepping foot into an office , clinic , or hospital .\nInquiries from U.S. clinicians about telehealth have skyrocketed , Dr. Kvedar says , at the same time that states and the federal government are loosening requirements for licensing across state borders and privacy issues around technology . They \u2019 re also reexamining what \u2019 s defined as a \u201c visit \u201d for insurance purposes .\n\u201c There \u2019 s been a staggering amount of creativity and collaboration , \u201d says Dr. Charlotte Wu , a physician and founder of Harness Health Partners , a Boston-based consultancy . \u201c We \u2019 re seeing an increased acceptance of virtual medicine , leveraging the skills of diverse team members , and collaborating across institutions \u2013 who were traditionally competitors . \u201d\nAt Asian Counseling and Referral Service in Seattle , counselors are now offering mental health care by phone and video apps such as Zoom and Doxy.me . \u201c We can accept consent via telephone versus in writing \u201d in treating substance use disorders , says Michael Byun , who runs the nonprofit .\nCOVID-19 is spurring innovations that might eventually pave the way for routine remote-monitoring of chronic illnesses . The possibilities are legion . Seventy percent of U.S. health care costs go to treating health conditions like high blood pressure or high cholesterol that are attributed to or worsened by smoking , lack of exercise , or poor eating habits ; they can be followed by a virtual-care quick check-in , says Dr. Kvedar .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t have enough people to deliver service one-to-one in a room at a time , \u201d says Dr. Kvedar . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of inefficiency in the way we deliver care . When the dust settles , I hope we don \u2019 t go back to doing every single thing in the office . \u201d\nNew technologies are also helping tackle staffing shortages . Germany recently called on the public to suggest COVID-19 related innovations , and among the entries was a \u201c digital waiting room \u201d that vets a patient \u2019 s symptoms , and an app that rotates nurses more effectively . Practitioners and researchers are also using artificial intelligence to help forecast disease spread , implement rapid-testing technologies , and develop new approaches to contact tracing .\nBack in Seattle , the veteran nurse Ms. Grant has bid her short-lived retirement goodbye ; she \u2019 s now working 10- to 12-hour days , six days a week , managing COVID-19 testing sites . Her day begins early to ensure adequate supplies for the testers , as she leads a team of nurses at the University of Washington Medical Center \u2013 Northwest who were displaced from outpatient surgery centers and clinics .\nMs. Grant was part of a wave of nurses who entered the workforce during a severe nursing shortage in the U.S. during the 1980s . \u201c Many people in that age bracket are exiting the workforce , \u201d she says , so it \u2019 s no surprise they \u2019 re being called back to fill the gaps they \u2019 ve left . Ms. Grant feels a \u201c loyalty \u201d and a call to duty . \u201c I am able to help this community at a difficult time . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
