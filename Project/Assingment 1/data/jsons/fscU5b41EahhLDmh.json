    "content": "After watching protests erupt around the country against police shootings , tougher immigration laws , and the Trump administration , Arizona state Sen. John Kavanagh reportedly came to a conclusion : \u201c This stuff is all planned \u201d by \u201c ideologues \u201d and \u201c anarchists , \u201d he told the Arizona Capitol Times .\nIn response , Senator Kavanagh sponsored a bill patterned on the kind of racketeering laws usually reserved for the Mafia : Anyone involved in a protest could be guilty of a felony if things get out of control , \u201c whether or not such person knows [ the ] identity \u201d of the person actually breaking a law .\nSenate Republicans in Arizona voted in favor of Kavanagh \u2019 s proposal , joining conservative lawmakers in some 18 states in moving forward tough new bills intended to curb what they see as lawlessness during a new age of demonstrations and street mobilization .\nFor their part , opponents of those bills don \u2019 t see efforts to keep the peace \u2013 they see police state tactics . Civil rights activists say such bills violate the First Amendment and have more to do with chilling free expression than law and order , given that several of the proposals could open up peaceful protesters to serious criminal liability .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s a coincidence that we are seeing [ antiprotest bills ] filed at a time when more and more Americans are taking to the streets to practice their constitutional right , \u201d says Mike Meno , an American Civil Liberties Union staffer in Raleigh , N.C .\nThe new bills come during a time of large-scale protests not seen since the civil rights era , as well as an emerging strategy to use economic pressure , through boycotts or more immediate actions , to force change . At a time of extreme political polarization \u2013 when half of Americans say they are \u201c afraid \u201d of the other side \u2013 Republican-led statehouses are probing the boundaries of what constitutes constitutionally-protected protest versus what makes a mob .\nA strong-arm response to protesters pushing new bounds \u201c isn \u2019 t new \u2026 but I \u2019 ve also never seen anything quite like \u201d this spate of legislation , says Doug McAdam , a Stanford University sociologist and co-author of a forthcoming book \u201c The Origins of Our Fractured Society. \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s more evidence that we are really in a different period . The fact is , we haven \u2019 t really seen this kind of sustained political tension and popular mobilization since the early 1970s . As we speak , the dynamics of social movements are being transformed or significantly altered . \u201d\nThe wave of new demonstration-related bills have come in response to pipeline protests in North Dakota , train blockades in Washington State , and interstates crawling to a standstill in places such as Baltimore and Charlotte , N.C . Meanwhile , some Republican lawmakers facing stiff opposition to the repeal of Affordable Care Act in their home districts have begged off in-person town halls , citing as did Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R ) of Texas , \u201c the threat of violence \u201d from outside agitators .\n\u201c I think these bills are indicative of the fact that , particularly on the left , you \u2019 ve seen the willingness to use protests to impede economic freedom , \u201d says Andrew Taylor , a political scientist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh . Given the corporate boycotts against the so-called \u201c bathroom law \u201d in North Carolina , for example , \u201c there \u2019 s a sense that the left is trying to coerce people into doing things by threatening their economic situation , and I think [ these bills ] are an outgrowth of that . \u201d\nThe tension comes as Pew finds that about half of Democrats and half of Republicans are \u201c afraid \u201d of the other side . Among highly politically active Americans , just over 6 in 10 say the other side scares them , a recent Pew survey reports .\nUnder that mantle of distrust , many of the so-called \u201c economic terrorism \u201d bills are built around a similar idea : That much of the dissent at protests and town halls is not only fake , but paid \u2013 intended not to debate but disrupt . The Pulitzer Prize-winning Politifact says there is no evidence that protesters are being paid ( just as there wasn \u2019 t when Democrats made similar claims about the tea party ) .\nThe vast majority of those involved , political scientists say , are everyday Americans invoking their constitutional right to free assembly .\nThe impulse to paint protesters as stooges \u201c goes back to the antiwar movement where politicians railed against Communist plants trying to undermine democracy , \u201d says Professor McAdam. \u201d \u201c And it \u2019 s the same thing as the left arguing in the wake of the tea party that it was AstroTurf , not real [ grass roots ] . There might be an exception here or there , but all of these are legitimate , popular forms of mobilization . \u201d\nNevertheless , Minnesota lawmakers have proposed a bill that would allow authorities to sue protesters for costs related to policing a protest . An \u201c economic terrorism \u201d bill in North Carolina would make blocking a street , currently a misdemeanor , a felony punishable by up to 25 months in prison .\nOther bills would ban the use of masks and seize assets of those whose protests later turn violent .\nAfter filing an \u201c economic terrorism \u201d bill late last year , state Sen. Doug Ericksen of Washington State pointed to antifracking protests in Olympia where groups have blocked trains by setting up camps on tracks as the impetus for a bill .\n\u201c I completely support your First Amendment right to protest , \u201d Senator Ericksen told reporters . But \u201c you do not have the First Amendment right to block a train . \u201d\nThe problem for his bill is that he \u2019 s right : It \u2019 s already against the law to block streets or rail tracks . In fact , dozens of demonstrators have been arrested in recent weeks on misdemeanor trespass charges for blocking freight and passenger trains in Vancouver and Bellingham , Wash . Moreover , it \u2019 s illegal everywhere in the US to start a riot .\nThe bills are facing strong headwinds . If their penalties are redundant , the argument goes , why pass them unless the attempt is to chill free speech ? Citing concerns about perceptions of undermining First Amendment rights , Arizona 's Republican House speaker refused to hear Kavanagh 's bill , effectively killing it .\nBut there are some forms of protest that \u201c should be chilled , \u201d according to University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds . Ordinarily a promoter of free speech and expression on his libertarian-leaning Instapundit blog , found himself on the other side of the issue after the police shooting of Keith Scott in Charlotte , N.C .\nDuring the second night of protests , Reynolds watched TV coverage of angry people spilling onto Interstate 85 and Interstate 277 , stopping traffic , looting , and , in one case , attacking a driver . After documenting those events in a series of tweets , Reynolds launched three words : \u201c Run them down. \u201d He quickly and publicly apologized for seeming to advocate the targeting of protesters , which he says he did not .\nIn an email to the Monitor , Reynolds notes that his tweet \u201c referred to legitimate self-defense against violent rioters who were smashing windshields , looting trucks , and beating people unconscious , \u201d adding that \u201c violent assaults on motorists are never \u2018 legitimate dissent ' ... [ and ] should be chilled. \u201d The fact is , he writes , \u201c even nonviolent blocking of roads is quite dangerous , drastically raising the risk that protesters will be accidentally run over , or that stopped motorists will be rear-ended , as well as the danger of impeding emergency services , ambulances , etc. , which has happened already in some cases . \u201d\nA handful of states have now proposed relieving motorists of liability should they hurt someone while trying to escape from a highway protest .\nWhat \u2019 s also fueling concerns among conservatives is that social media mobilization has enabled protesters to get out ahead of authorities as protests develop , sometimes leaving police anxious and unprepared . That dynamic only heightens tensions .\n\u201c Authorities are feeling caught off guard by the increased dexterity that comes with social media , \u201d says Michael Heaney , a political sociologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . He notes , however , that social media organization also can act as a balm , creating \u201c a kind of organization to what might otherwise be a riot . \u201d\nIf any of the laws pass , federal courts will take a hard look at whether they infringe First Amendment rights .\nThe Supreme Court has , in the name of public safety , afforded authorities leeway to crack down on protests where life and property may be affected .
