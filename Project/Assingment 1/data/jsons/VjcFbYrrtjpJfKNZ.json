But for students , it could well affect where and if they are counted \u2013 and that could have big implications .\nThe rapid spread of the virus has meant that most colleges have by now closed their classrooms .

Either a university official completes a single form for all students in the dormitory based on administrative data \u2014 the Census Bureau estimates that around 55 % of on-campus students will be counted this way \u2014 or students answer the census questions themselves by filling in forms or , in rarer cases , via face-to-face interviews with census workers on April 1 .\nSo how will the coronavirus impact the collection of census data for college students ?\nJust over half of those listed as living in \u201c group quarters \u201d do not need to be present when university administrators fill in the forms , so are less likely to be affected .
