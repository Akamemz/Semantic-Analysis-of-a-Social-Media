And the world can not say it wasn \u2019 t warned .\n\u201c We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city , in every foreign capital , and in every hall of power , \u201d President Donald Trump declared in his inaugural speech Friday . \u201c From this day forward , a new vision will govern our land . From this day forward it \u2019 s going to be only America first .

Sometimes they have done so brutally and selfishly . But as a general rule over the past seven decades , Washington has been guided by enlightened self interest in world affairs . That is now in doubt .\nThe US-led order has rested on many foundations \u2013 a complex web of norms , treaties , and institutions ranging from the United Nations and the World Bank to nuclear non-proliferation , international accounting standards , and the Geneva Conventions .\nChief among them is an open , rules-based free trade system governed by the World Trade Organization and regional trade treaties . On Monday , Trump pulled the US out of the brand new Trans Pacific Partnership , an Asian trade deal , and he says he is considering scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada .\nOn the military front , the order is underpinned by military alliances such as NATO , which Trump has described as \u201c obsolete , \u201d and by pledges to defend Asian allies such as Japan and South Korea .

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump appear to share a worldview based on narrow national interests and spheres of interest .\nThat marks a radical shift from the attitude that US presidents from Harry Truman onward have taken , seeking out common interests they shared with allies and with rivals , from trade to arms control treaties . A policy \u2013 whether it be aimed at slowing climate change or strengthening democratic government in developing nations \u2013 could be good for America and good for the world .\nThe view was that a free and prosperous world helped bolster a free and prosperous America .\nBut to many outside the United States , on the strength of his inaugural speech , Trump seems to be offering a zero-sum game .
