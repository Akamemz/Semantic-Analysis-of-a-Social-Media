Yellen would never say it out loud , but the purpose of a rate hike would be in part to tap the brakes on the economy and slow job creation so it does not lead to faster inflation .\nThat means that instead of gathering steam as Clinton attempts next year to replace President Barack Obama , the economy could be slowing , undercutting one of the Democratic front-runner \u2019 s main electoral advantages .\n\u201c Today \u2019 s number certainly paves the way for higher rates later this month , \u201d said Jack Ablin , chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank . \u201c At least for now , investors are taking the glass-half-full approach that the economy is strong enough to sustain those higher rates and that we have turned a corner and can put the crisis chapter behind us . \u201d\nBut other analysts and many liberal Democrats believe the Fed may still be moving too early while wage gains remain soft and economic growth is still struggling to stay above 2 percent .

' We 've seen what that looks like and this is n't it . ''\nThe White House nonetheless lauded the report on Friday . `` The strong pace of job growth continued in November as the unemployment rate held at its lowest level since April 2008 and labor force participation ticked up , '' Council of Economic Advisers Chair Jason Furman said in a blog post . `` We have added more jobs over the past three years than in any three-year period since 2000 , and wages are continuing to rise . ''\nThe stock market also celebrated the news in early trading rather than focusing on problems associated with a rate-hiking campaign . The Dow rose more than 200 points in early trading Friday .\nBut there are other less encouraging signs for the economy that could be trouble for Democrats and boost Republicans promising faster growth and more jobs .\nThe U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in November , according to the latest data , hitting its worst levels since June of 2009 . The services sector , which is much larger , expanded last month but at a slower place than in October , and the employment index in the sector fell more than expected .\nNovember \u2019 s jobs numbers were down slightly from October 's revised 298,000 , the Labor Department reported Friday . But November \u2019 s numbers have been revised upward by an average of 73,000 over the past five years , so Friday \u2019 s number could end up being closer to 300,000 . And Yellen told Congress Thursday that even less-than-torrid job growth would show an economy with ample room to accommodate new workers .\n`` To simply provide jobs for those who are newly entering the labor force probably requires under 100,000 jobs per month , \u201d Yellen said during an appearance before the Joint Economic Committee . Observers read that as a signal that any increase above 100,000 jobs would be sufficient to justify raising interest rates this month . The Fed \u2019 s Open Market Committee is set to make its rate decision when it meets Dec. 15-16 .\nThe November jobs report contained mostly positive news . September and October \u2019 s numbers were revised upward by a combined 35,000 . But average hourly private-sector earnings were up just 4 cents .

The Commerce Department 's next attempt to estimate third-quarter growth will be released Dec. 22 .\nA lingering sour note for the economy is that labor force participation remained low at 62.5 percent , up slightly from September and October 's 62.4 percent and the 62.6 percent rate for June , July and August . These figures put labor participation at the lowest level since the 1970s . But Yellen told Congress Thursday that those numbers may stay low for a while .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think we should expect to see labor-force participation move up a great deal over time \u201d because baby boomers are retiring , she said .",
