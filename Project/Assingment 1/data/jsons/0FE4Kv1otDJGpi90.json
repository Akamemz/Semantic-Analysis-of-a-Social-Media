Time\nCorrections & Clarifications : An earlier version of this report mis-attributed a quote to the White House press secretary .\nThe White House released a list Monday night of 78 terrorist attacks `` executed or inspired '' by the Islamic State that it claims supports President Trump 's assertion that media organizations are deliberately failing to adequately report on terror attacks .\n`` You \u2019 ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice . All over Europe it \u2019 s happening . It \u2019 s gotten to a point where it \u2019 s not even being reported , '' Trump told military leaders and troops during his first visit as president to U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa .\n`` And in many cases , the very , very dishonest press doesn \u2019 t want to report it . They have their reasons and you understand that . ''\nTrump did not explain what he meant by `` their reasons . '' White House press secretary Sean Spicer subsequently clarified Trump 's remarks by telling reporters that it was n't that there was no reporting on terrorist attacks , but that there was insufficient reporting .\n`` Protests will get blown out of the water , and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn \u2019 t necessarily get the same coverage . ''\nThe list of attacks distributed by the White House included high-profile incidents in Paris ; Nice , France ; Orlando ; and San Bernardino , Calif. , that received widespread media coverage \u2014 including from \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2014 as well as more obscure incidents in which police officers and security guards were injured but nobody was killed .\nThe 78 domestic and international attacks cited took place between September 2014 and December 2016 , although there was no explanation as to what merited inclusion on the list . There was no mention , for example , of terrorist attacks in Israel .\nThe document contains errors . `` Attacker '' is misspelled more than two dozen times .\nDuring the period in question , \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported on the vast majority of the incidents cited on the list . Many of the stories about the major attacks at home and abroad appeared on the front page of \u2588\u2588\u2588 print and digital editions .\n`` The real point here is that these terrorist attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did , '' White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters later said to explain Trump 's comments .\n`` If you look back just a few years ago , any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet , and now they \u2019 re happening so often \u2014 at a rate of more than once every two weeks , according to the list we sent around \u2014 that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did . ''\nMike Jensen , a researcher at the Global Terrorism Database , said there was little-to-no available data about how widely terrorism as a topic has been covered in the news . He said most western media provided blanket coverage of attacks against western targets .\n`` Even the smaller attacks get mass coverage and can hang around in the news for days , although that is not the case for attacks in , say , Iraq , which disappear pretty quickly . ''\nPew Research Center has not published research about press coverage of terrorism since 2007 , when it emerged as the topic media gave the most attention to that year .\nLast week , Trump 's adviser Kellyanne Conway issued a correction to her use of the phrase `` Bowling Green massacre , '' an incident that never happened but which Conway said the news media did not cover . She later said she meant to say `` Bowling Green terrorists , '' a reference to two Iraqi men indicted in 2011 and serving life sentences for using improvised explosive devices against U.S. soldiers in Iraq . The men were living in Bowling Green , Ky. , when detained .\nTrump has signed an executive order to ban for a 120 days refugees entering the U.S. and a 90-day ban for most citizens of Libya , Iraq , Iran , Somalia , Sudan and Yemen . The order also indefinitely bars Syrians from entering the United States . Trump said his goal was to improve background checks to make sure terrorists are not admitted inadvertently .\nA court battle between state and federal lawyers defending and challenging Trump 's order was expected to take weeks to resolve .\nHere is the full list from the White House as released , and links to stories \u2588\u2588\u2588 posted on each event .\nTARGET : One soldier killed and one wounded in vehicle attack\nTerror attacks in Canada warn of things to come : Column\nTARGET : One soldier killed at war memorial ;
