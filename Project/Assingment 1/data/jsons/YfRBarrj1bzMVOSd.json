It would be healthy for them and our democracy .\nAs a college student , I experience the consequences of our polarized nation every day . I attend a university that is more socioeconomically diverse than many , but 57 % of my fellow students have family incomes in the top 20 % . More than half the students in my class of 2022 are from the blue states of Massachusetts , New York , California , New Jersey and Connecticut . I \u2019 ve yet to meet a publicly pro-Trump student on campus .\nIt \u2019 s hard for me and my fellow students to understand our country \u2019 s problems and its sources if we don \u2019 t meet people with different views and experiences than our own . If we are to truly overcome our divides and understand each other better , we need to figure out ways to get citizens to move out of their \u201c bubbles \u201d and interact regularly with a wider variety of their fellow citizens .\nThis is the motivation behind \u201c national service \u201d programs , famously called for by President John F. Kennedy with his Peace Corps proposal . They are now a staple for politicians , including in the 2020 presidential race . Democrat Pete Buttigieg , for example , proposes a `` New Call to Service '' plan that says national service is `` essential to fashioning a common character . ''\nThese programs hold promise but would require a large budget and a new bureaucracy .\nFortunately , there is an existing program that has proved enormously successful and could fairly easily be repurposed for this problem : study abroad .\nOver the past generation , the number of American college students studying abroad has increased dramatically . Currently , about 16 % of those earning bachelor \u2019 s degrees spend part of their time in college abroad . Studying abroad is seen as a way for students to expand their worldviews , learn about other cultures and lifestyles , and gain skills like learning a language that are necessary to thrive in our globalized world .\nThese are , of course , important and worthwhile goals . But so is learning more about our own country , and encouraging study \u201c at home \u201d rather than just study \u201c abroad \u201d could help accomplish that . Programs that allow students to spend time at different universities in the United States do exist , but they \u2019 re quite small . Given increasing partisanship and geographic sorting , these programs ought to be scaled up significantly , in order to ensure that students learn about the different types of people and lifestyles that make America so great .\nIt 's not impossible : Cruz and Ocasio-Cortez found common ground . Americans craving civility want more of this .\nColleges bill themselves as bastions of diversity , and with regards to race , they \u2019 ve improved greatly over the past generation . However , many universities , particularly elite ones , remain socioeconomically , geographically and politically homogeneous . For example , many top universities enroll more students from the top 1 % than from the bottom 60 % of the income distribution . In a survey of college freshmen , more than a third reported attending college within 50 miles of where they live , and most attend college either in their state or a neighboring one .\nImagine if colleges set up programs to encourage students to spend a semester at a campus very different from theirs . If students from Hillsdale College and Harvard University , or State University of New York at Albany and The University of Alabama , or Brigham Young University and Brandeis University , switched places and spent a semester learning and living together ?\nWhen people have one-off encounters with someone different from them , they \u2019 re not likely to deeply connect with and empathize with that person . But when they spend significant amounts of time with them , doing a wide variety of activities \u2014 sports , social events , volunteering , campus jobs \u2014 they \u2019 re more likely to relate to and perhaps even befriend them .\nWhere kindness rules : Reader 's Digest is looking for 'nicest places .
