    "content": "Two years ago , when President Donald Trump moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , I said , \u201c I \u2019 ll see you in court , Mr. President. \u201d Now , the case that bears my name , McAleenan v. Vidal , is one of three consolidated cases that has reached the highest court in the land . On Tuesday , the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on which my future hangs .\nAs a person who depends on DACA to remain in this country , I vividly remember that September day in 2017 when former Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the administration \u2019 s decision to terminate the program that protects undocumented immigrants like myself from deportation . I was at the rehabilitation center where I work , helping a therapist with a patient . My phone wouldn \u2019 t stop buzzing from text messages and calls from my friends \u2014 the news broke , what were we going to do ? My stomach tightened , my body felt weak , tears welled in my eyes . My best friend sent me a message , \u201c That \u2019 s it . It \u2019 s over . \u201d\nBut it was not over . As scary as that moment was , I didn \u2019 t let fear consume me . The immigration story of my family has centered on our resilience \u2014 to cross the border , to make it to New York , and to make it in New York \u2014 and no presidential decree could take that away from me . DACA has changed my life and protected my family : It has allowed me to go back to school , start my career , and feel safe with my family knowing I wouldn \u2019 t be separated from them . And I knew that , with hundreds of thousands of undocumented youth across the country and our allies , we would fight to keep it .\nFight it we have , with immigrant youth , immigrant rights organizations , and many states challenging the administration \u2019 s reckless decision to end DACA . Thousands of us have taken to the streets and proudly come out as undocumented across the country . We have marched , protested , taken over congressional offices , and even put our bodies on the line to demand dignity and respect for all of our communities . And , because of this persistence , we have won in the courts . The program remains in place for now .\nBut today the Supreme Court is considering President Trump \u2019 s unlawful termination of the DACA program . Courts across the country have repeatedly agreed that the Trump \u2019 s administration termination of DACA was arbitrary and capricious , and now the question lies with the highest court .\nIf the Court sides with Trump , the consequences would be devastating for me , my family , and communities across the country . For the past seven years , over 700,000 young undocumented immigrants , who came to the United States as children , have been able to work at the jobs of their choosing , graduate from schools around the country , contribute billions of dollars to the economy , and support their families and communities \u2014 all because of DACA .\nWe are business owners , artists , school teachers , lawyers , mothers , fathers , and nurses like me . Even though the program \u2019 s structure has meant that I have been living my life in two-year increments ( recipients must reapply every two years ) , DACA provides me with critical immigration relief , allowing me to work and remain in the United States with my family .\nWith DACA , I have been able to grow up with my siblings . Together , we have been able to celebrate our birthdays and christenings . I have been able to help them with their homework , see them graduate from middle school and high school , and even help them get over their first heartbreak .\nDACA has allowed me to find myself and build a future . I am now back in college and have a chance to pursue a career as an occupational therapist . Plus , I have been able to become an economic support for my mother and my younger brothers . My mother has worked immensely hard to always provide a home where we can sleep peacefully and fill our bellies with her delicious cooking . As the Supreme Court arguments grow near , my mother constantly wonders what is going to happen to me . My eyes fill up with tears as I try to stay strong . I hold my mother and tell her : \u201c Ma , don \u2019 t worry , we will win. \u201d My fight is as much for her as it is for me .\nJust as importantly , the security of having DACA helped me to be able to proudly come out as gay and unafraid . I no longer live in fear . I will fight until the very end to not be ripped away from my mother , my community , and the place I have called home for over 20 years .\nThat \u2019 s why I have also joined immigrant youth from all over the country in a historic march that started in New York City and ended in Washington , DC this weekend . Over a hundred DACA recipients , community leaders , and allies with Make the Road New York , NAKASEC , and the Home Is Here campaign marched 230 miles to the steps of the US Supreme Court . Our message is clear : The termination of DACA was unlawful and we will continue to show our resilience as we fight for our futures . We aren \u2019 t going back into hiding . We \u2019 re standing up as a community , stronger than ever \u2014 ready to fight .\nSince the day the Trump administration unlawfully terminated DACA , we have repeatedly been used as pawns , like our lives are pieces that could be easily moved to negotiate whatever policy seems most convenient at the moment . But my life , and the lives of immigrant youth , are not bargaining chips in any political game . We demand that this country recognize our full humanity , period .\nThe law and the overwhelming majority of the country are on our side . Now it \u2019 s time for the US Supreme Court to uphold the rule of law , affirm the lower court injunctions , and leave DACA in place .\nImmigrant youth will win , Mr. President .
