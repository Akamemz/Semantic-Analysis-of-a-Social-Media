So women ca n't be charged more than men for their insurance \u2014 being a woman is not a pre-existing condition . ''\nBut the health law has been one thing on which Romney has been consistent .\n`` What the court did not do on its last day in session , I will do on my first day if elected president of the U.S. , '' he said just after the Supreme Court 's decision in June that found the law largely constitutional . `` And that is I will act to repeal Obamacare . ''\nNow Romney ca n't actually repeal the law on his first day in office . He 'll need Congress to do that . It might take a while , but it 's likely he can slow or stall implementation .\nStill , the big question is what , if anything , he 'd try to replace the law with .\nHere 's how he answered that question at the first presidential debate in Denver :\n`` It 's a lengthy description , but No . 1 , pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan . No . 2 , young people are able to stay on their family plan . That 's already offered in the private marketplace ; you do n't have \u2014 have the government mandate that for that to occur . ''\nIn fact , Romney 's staff had to step in after the debate to clarify that , no , pre-existing conditions would n't be covered for most people . Only those who have maintained continuous coverage .\nThere also would n't be any guarantee for young adults to stay on their parents ' plans ; Romney says it would happen because the private sector is already doing it , albeit with a push from the law .\n`` The right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America , telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have , '' Romney said at the Denver debate . `` That 's the wrong way to go . The private market and individual responsibility always work best . ''\nNow this sounds curious to people like Jonathan Gruber , an economist from MIT who worked on both the Massachusetts plan that passed when Romney was governor in 2006 and the federal law passed two years ago . Gruber says he is stunned at how Romney can still profess support for his state 's law but opposition to the federal law , since the two are such close cousins .\n`` This is an unprecedented case of a major national policy where we ran an experiment first , '' he said .\n`` We wanted to cover the uninsured and we 've covered two-thirds of our uninsured residents , '' Gruber said . `` Our uninsurance rate is now down to 3 percent , compared to an 18 percent national rate . And we wanted to fix what was a broken non-group insurance market . And we did ; we lowered premiums in that market by 50 percent .
