Bush 's former senior adviser points out . `` Not surprisingly , the number of hourly employees working 30-34 hours a week dropped by an average of 146,500 a month over the past year , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , '' Rove says . `` The number working 25-29 hours rose by 119,000 a month . `` The lack of hours can particularly hurt single working mothers and younger workers , Rove says.Meanwhile , the 50-employee threshold will serve to keep businesses from growing beyond that size , he says . `` Here the U.S. is following in the footsteps of France and other countries with sclerotic economies , '' Rove writes.Obamacare also will damage businesses with self-funded health plans , he claims . These companies serve as their own insurer , gathering premiums and paying claims filed by their workers . A total of 61 percent of workers are in self-funded plans , according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey `` More companies have an incentive to choose self-funding because the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) governs self-funded plans , not the Affordable Care Act , '' Rove states . `` ERISA allows self-funded plans to charge premiums based on risk ( unlike under Obamacare ) , allows these plans to offer a wider menu of options and lets them avoid such expensive provisions as Obamacare 's new tax on insurance policies . `` But Obamacare supporters do n't like the success of these programs in curbing premium increases and managing costs , Rove says . Delaware , New York , and Oregon already forbid small- and mid-size companies from using self-insurance plans , he says . `` Administrators of self-funded plans also worry that new Labor Secretary Thomas Perez will ignore ERISA and issue regulations that erode the attractiveness of self-funded plans and push more companies ' health policies into Obamacare 's morass . `` In addition to all these problems , the amount of uninsured Americans wo n't drop below 30 million in the next 10 years , according to the Congressional Budget Office , Rove says . `` So much for Obamacare 's promise of 'universal ' coverage .
