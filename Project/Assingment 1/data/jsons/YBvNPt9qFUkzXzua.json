    "content": "President Obama on Sunday night pledged the remainder of his presidency to taking steps to end the string of spree shootings that have scarred the nation \u2019 s consciousness in recent years .\nAddressing both the grief-stricken Newtown , Conn. , residents packed into a crowded high school auditorium and an outraged nation watching the televised speech at home , the president said tragedies like the shooting that claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults inside Sandy Hook Elementary must end .\n\u201c I \u2019 ll use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens , \u201d the president said , \u201c in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this . Because , what choice do we have ?\n\u201c Are we really prepared to say that we \u2019 re powerless in the face of such carnage ? \u201d he said . \u201c That the politics are too hard ? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited upon our children year after year is simply the price of our freedom ? \u201d\nThe president stopped short of describing specific legislation , but new gun-control measures are already coming together on Capitol Hill , where Democrats are promising action in the wake of the Friday massacre in Newtown , in which a 20-year-old man armed with three semiautomatic weapons broke into a school and executed two classrooms full of children and the adults who tried to protect them .\nSen. Dianne Feinstein said Sunday that she would introduce a bill to reinstate the federal ban on assault weapons on the first day of the next Congress in January as gun-control advocates pressure Mr. Obama to tackle the issue in the wake of the school massacre Friday .\nThe shooting deaths could force the president to tackle an issue that was largely on the sidelines during his first term in office as he dealt with an anemic economy , perpetual overseas tumult and a bruising battle to push his health care overhaul through Congress .\n\u201c It will ban the sale , the transfer , the importation and the possession , not retroactively , but prospectively , \u201d Mrs. Feinstein , California Democrat , said of her bill on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c We exempt over 900 specific weapons that will not fall under the bill . But the purpose of this bill is to get \u2026 weapons of war off the streets .\n\u201c I think America is ready , \u201d she said , adding that she thinks Mr. Obama will support the bill .\nThe president said in his weekly address Saturday that \u201c we have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this . Regardless of the politics . \u201d\nRep. Jerrold Nadler , New York Democrat and a staunch gun-control advocate , said if now isn \u2019 t the time to have a serious discussion about gun control , he doesn \u2019 t know when that time is .\n\u201c How many more Columbines and Newtowns must we live through ? \u201d he said . \u201c I am challenging President Obama , the Congress and the American public to act on our outrage and , finally , do something about this . \u201d\nSen. Joe Lieberman , Connecticut independent , and Sen. Richard J. Durbin , Illinois Democrat , said on \u201c Fox News Sunday \u201d that they support reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons , which took effect in 1994 and lapsed in 2004 . Other Connecticut Democrats , such as Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen.-elect Christopher S. Murphy , said action must be taken soon , but they were focused on the victims \u2019 families in the immediate future .\nGun-control advocacy groups are pushing Mr. Obama hard to pursue specific policy .\nLadd Everitt , a spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence , said Sunday that the group is \u201c tremendously disturbed \u201d by the incident and \u201c our feeling is that we never should have allowed our country to reach this point . \u201d\nHe said the reaction to this massacre is markedly different from what he saw after mass shootings in Columbine , Colo. , and Virginia Tech ; the attack on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona ; and the recent killings in Aurora , Colo .\n\u201c The response to those shootings was significant , but I have never seen the outrage to what we \u2019 ve seen in the past 48 hours , \u201d he said . \u201c The tone of the commentary has shifted from \u2018 Do we do something ? \u2019 to \u2018 What do we do ? \u2019 The will is there right now . \u201d\nMayors Against Illegal Guns , the group co-chaired by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , has launched an online petition to \u201c demand a plan \u201d from Mr. Obama and Congress to end gun violence .\nMr. Bloomberg said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d that the issue should be Mr. Obama \u2019 s \u201c No . 1 agenda . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s the president of the United States , and if he does nothing during his second term , something like 48,000 Americans will be killed with illegal guns , \u201d Mr. Bloomberg said . \u201c That is roughly the number of Americans killed in the whole Vietnam War . \u201d\nA petition on the White House website to \u201c immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress \u201d has received more than 120,000 signatures since Friday . The White House must respond within 30 days to petitions that acquire at least 25,000 signatures .\nRep.
