But the anti-Trump media did their best to paint the outcome of the voting as bad news for the president .\nJournalists worked hard to spin a pro-Democratic narrative before the voting . For example , CNN anchor Don Lemon said Republicans are \u201c people who will lie , steal , and cheat , lie to their mother , lie to themselves about what 's right of this country , about truth and facts. \u201d Neutral objective journalism , right ?\nJournalists also talked a lot about a \u201c blue wave \u201d and \u201c a major sign of trouble for Republicans \u201d before the votes were counted . Politico wrote of \u201c Democrats surging. \u201d Sort of like what they predicted back in 2016 when they said President Hillary Clinton would be occupying the Oval Office in January 2017 .\nThat didn \u2019 t stop the typical spin . CNBC \u2019 s John Harwood used Twitter to say winning was a sign the GOP was going to lose in November . He retweeted a comment saying , \u201c it \u2019 s hard to remember when so many victories were such a bad omen going into November. \u201d Harwood even claimed the \u201c GOP has a corruption problem in mid-term elections . \u201d\nElection season makes people say stupid things . That \u2019 s why Democratic socialist media darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez compared a request that she debate to \u201c catcalling. \u201d The Daily Wire \u2019 s Ben Shapiro made the invitation and even offered to pay $ 10,000 to her campaign or a charity of her choosing .\nThe result was just the latest public relations disaster for the lefty candidate . ( You know it \u2019 s a bad move when even The New York Times makes you look bad for your comment . )\nIncredibly , Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan gave a one word support of Ocasio-Cortez , writing simply : \u201c Preach. \u201d Apparently , even asking a liberal millennial woman to debate is now a # MeToo moment .\nOne final point about the media \u2019 s post-election distortions . It \u2019 s widely known and little reported ( now ) that midterms are typically bad for the party in power . Here \u2019 s NPR back in 2014 explaining : \u201c History tells us that midterm elections are bad \u2013 sometimes very bad \u2013 for the party that controls the White House . \u201d\nSo , yes , the rules say the GOP is supposed to lose seats in Congress in November . But journalists want to treat the voting as a referendum on President Trump and not politics as usual . It \u2019 s almost like they \u2019 re whistling past the graveyard of their predictions . Maybe that \u2019 s why Don Lemon is now thanking politicians who even watch CNN .\n2 . Are They Press or Suppress ? Imagine the news coverage if the son of a popular evangelical pastor was arrested for training children to be school shooters in an underground desert compound . Imagine what would happen if the remains of a dead child were also found at the site .
