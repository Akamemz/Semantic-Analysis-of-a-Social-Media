    "content": "If there was one person who was not at all happy with Donald Trump \u2019 s speech in Phoenix , Arizona , it was Don Lemon . The CNN host said the rally was \u201c unhinged , \u201d \u201c embarrassing , \u201d and questioned the president \u2019 s fitness for office . Trump went after the media , went after Sens . Jeff Flake and John McCain , though didn \u2019 t mention them by name , and heavily insinuated that he would issue a pardon to Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who was convicted of violating a federal court order to end racial profiling of Hispanics . Folks , this isn \u2019 t anything we haven \u2019 t heard before , it wasn \u2019 t out of the ordinary than what we \u2019 ve seen at Trump rallies . Yes , maybe there were some areas where criticisms could be lobbed at the president , but as always\u2014the media overreached . The only thing that happened on that network last night was solidification of support among Trump \u2019 s base . The poll showing 60 percent of people who said they would never stop approving of Donald Trump probably went up a few notches if you saw what occurred on that network last night . If you thought Trump \u2019 s speech was unhinged , just imagine listening to non-medical professionals trying to diagnose whether Trump was insane or not , and then debating the semantics and appropriate situation in which the word \u201c insane \u201d should be used . CNN made the case for why the media \u2019 s credibility is in the toilet , and how the liberal media still can not get over the fact that Hillary Clinton lost the election .\nSo , let \u2019 s rundown the night \u2019 s greatest hits . First , Don Lemon \u2019 s prolonged commentary , where he described Trump \u2019 s speech as devoid of sanity ( via Real Clear Politics ) [ emphasis mine ] :\nDON LEMON , CNN : Well , what do you say to that ? I 'm just going to speak from the heart here . What we have witnessed is a total eclipse of the facts . Someone who came out on stage and lied directly the American people and left things out that he said in an attempt to rewrite history , especially when it comes to Charlottesville . He 's unhinged , it 's embarrassing and I do n't mean for us , the media because he went after us , but for the country . This is who we elected president of the United States . A man who is so petty that he has to go after people who he deems to be his enemy , like an imaginary friend of a 6-year-old . His speech was without thought , it was without reason , it was devoid of facts , it was devoid of wisdom . There was no gravitas . There was no sanity there . He was like a child blaming a sibling on something else . He did it , I did n't do it . He certainly opened up the race wound from Charlottesville . A man clearly wounded by the rational people who are abandoning him in droves , meaning those business people and the people in Washington now who are questioning his fitness for office and whether he is stable . A man backed into a corner it seems by circumstances beyond his control and beyond his understanding . That 's the truth . If you watch that speech as an American , you had to be thinking what in the world is going on ? This is the person we elected as president of the United States ? This petty , this small , a person who is supposed to pull the country together ? Certainly did n't happen there .\nOnly possible defensible explanation for Trump 's disgusting , unpresidential , narcissistic behavior , would be early-on-set dementia . Maybe . \u2014 Ana Navarro ( @ ananavarro ) August 23 , 2017\nCNN panel doing psychiatric analysis . Don Lemon speculating about `` early onset dementure . '' Maria Cardona says DJT `` psychotically demented . '' \u2014 Jonathan Swan ( @ jonathanvswan ) August 23 , 2017\nOh , it gets better , folks . During a panel discussion , Lemon accused the president of \u201c clearly trying to ignite a civil war. \u201d Oh , and he may have dementia , citing known mental health expert ( I \u2019 m joking of course ) Ana Navarro , who tweeted out that the president may be afflicted with this mental issue ( via Free Beacon ) :\n`` He has given oxygen to racists , '' Lemon said . `` He has n't really said anything [ to ] denounce the alt-right \u2026 He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country . He has not tamped down race . '' In what CNN described in its chyron as an `` angry , divisive speech , '' Trump lit into the media and also defended his criticized response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville , omitting in his remarks to the crowd that he once said `` both sides '' carried blame for violence there .\nOh , and Lemon also looped in former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , who said that he was disturbed by the rally , adding `` I really question his ability , his fitness to be in this office and I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it .

It \u2019 s these sorts of tantrums from the media that pushes moderates into the Trump camp and makes those already in it to dig in deeper . We went through a gauntlet of nonsense last night , with the discussions about his mental health from people who are explicitly anti-Trump . The talk about civil war was doubly insane . You want to talk crazy ; please discuss ways in which you know for sure that the president wants to cause a civil war . The overreach and hyperbole just kills any legitimate criticism there might have been during last night \u2019 s remarks .
