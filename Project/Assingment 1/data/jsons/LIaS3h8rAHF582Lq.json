    "content": "As of this morning GDP was announced as close to zero in the first quarter . Again .\nBarack Obama has created a never-ending financial nightmare . GDP is zero\u2026Obamacare costs are exploding\u2026retail sales are awful\u2026manufacturing numbers are awful\u2026job gains are only for low-wage menial jobs for the uneducated or illegal aliens . The media won \u2019 t report it , but this is a economic Armageddon . The middle class is being destroyed . I call it \u201c The Obama Great Depression . \u201d\nIn a nutshell , this is what explains the popularity of Donald Trump . Republicans and Democrats live in different worlds . Some might say we live on different planets .\nI live in the real world . I am a private sector businessman . I have \u201c boots on the ground. \u201d I understand that President Obama has wrecked the U.S. economy . It \u2019 s bad and it \u2019 s getting much worse . If Hillary or Bernie , or some other clueless liberal who wants to \u201c protect and expand Obama \u2019 s legacy \u201d is elected , America \u2019 s economy will smash to the ground like Humpty Dumpty- into a million pieces that we can never put back together again .\nI know this because I \u2019 m a small businessman with 15 different and diverse businesses and careers . And all 15 are in trouble . All 15 are sucking wind . All 15 are hurting like never before in my lifetime ( I \u2019 m 54 years old ) . And I will admit it- I \u2019 m scared .\nI \u2019 ve seen some really bad trends , up close and personal . Consumers don \u2019 t want to spend money any more . Investors don \u2019 t want to invest any more ( at least not in small business ) . No one wants to hire any more . No one wants to pay bills on time any more .\nPeople that I know and trust for many years are using home equity loans to pay their employee payrolls . They are using credit cards to pay taxes . No one has any idea how to pay for dramatically higher health insurance premiums caused by Obamacare . That \u2019 s before the massive increases proceed for 2017 . My friends and business associates are in trouble . Deep trouble .\nIt \u2019 s all going bad under Barack Obama . Today \u2019 s GDP report validates everything I \u2019 ve been saying and predicting for years . The chickens are coming home to roost .\nThen I saw the exit polls on Fox News on Tuesday night after five overwhelming , massive , YUUUUGE Republican primary landslides for Donald Trump . What was the number one issue for a large majority of Republican voters ? The economy and jobs .\nThere was no close second . Even Trump \u2019 s signature issue of immigration was at the bottom of their list . The voters are scared to death about this economy , jobs and the future of middle class America .\nBut not Democrat voters . It \u2019 s just Republican voters that are scared about this horrible economy .\nBecause like me , most Republican voters are in the private sector . We own our own small businesses . Or we work for private sector businesses . Or we \u2019 re independent contractors- real estate brokers , stockbrokers , car salesman , boat salesmen , insurance brokers , mortgage brokers , etc . In other words , we are \u201c boots on the ground. \u201d We are the first to know something is wrong with the economy . We are the ones who know when the politicians and media are lying through their teeth .\nWe know Obama , Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media are lying about \u201c economic recovery. \u201d There is no recovery . There never was one . We have been living in an 8-year-long Obama Great Depression . Yes , those living in New York ( Wall Street ) , San Francisco ( Silicon Valley ) and Washington D.C. ( government jobs and contracts ) are fat and happy . But everywhere else in-between , the people are in severe trouble . We are scared . We are hurting . We know this is getting worse . We know where this could end- with a complete economic collapse and the end of America and capitalism .\nThey don \u2019 t trust any politician to save us , or to change the situation . That includes even a pure conservative politician like Ted Cruz . Conservative , or not , Cruz has spent his entire life as a lawyer and government employee . For all intents and purposes , Ted Cruz- like 99 percent of politicians- might as well be Obama . They understand only a capitalist billionaire businessman can possibly turn this nightmare around . They know Trump has failed at a few businesses- and they don \u2019 t care . At least he failed with his own money , not the taxpayers ! What a refreshing change . And interestingly , maybe those failures make Trump the perfect guy to turnaround the U.S. economy . Sure Trump has failed- but he came back bigger and better than ever , each and every time . Failure doesn \u2019 t matter in business , it \u2019 s the art of the comeback that matters ! Maybe , just maybe , Trump can show America and the U.S. economy and the middle class how to recover , just like he did after almost losing it all .\nRepublican voters get all this . But Democrat voters haven \u2018 t a freaking clue there \u2019 s a problem . Have you noticed ?\nEvery Democrat I speak to swears the economy is fine . You know why there is such a disconnect ? Because Democrats almost never work in the private sector . They sign the back of paychecks , not the front . Huge difference .\nRepublicans work for a living , sell for a living , own for a living . We do it all with our own money , talent and wits . I \u2019 ve never taken a government check in my life .\nBut the vast majority of Obama , Hillary and Bernie supporters belong to one of four categories :\n# 1 ) They work for someone else . They collect a safe weekly paycheck , without ever having to worry where the money comes from .\n# 2 ) They work for government , or collect a pension from government for NOT working .\n# 3 ) They collect welfare , food stamps and free Obamacare from government .\n# 4 ) They are in school , or college , or broke and jobless living in mommy and daddy \u2019 s basement .
