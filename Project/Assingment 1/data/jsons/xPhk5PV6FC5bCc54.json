The details for the project , provided by Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) , are meant to serve as guidelines for contractors who will submit their proposals for the first phase of the structure on March 29 .\nThe requirements for the wall actually come in two sets ; the first includes guidelines for a solid concrete structure and the second set is for a wall with `` see-through '' components that would likely be more affordable or have other `` operationally advantageous '' components over its concrete counterpart .\n`` The wall design shall be physically imposing in height , '' the CBP outlines say , calling for a nominal height of 30 feet . However , the proposals also noted that designs as low as 18 feet would also be acceptable . The proposal also requires 25- and 50-foot automated gates in certain parts of the wall 's design to accommodate vehicles and pedestrians .\nIn addition to these height requirements , the CBP also states that the wall should continue about six feet underground to discourage tunneling , be designed in such a way so that climbing the structure without a ladder would be impossible , and be able to withstand at least an hour 's worth of attempts to break through from a `` sledgehammer , car jack , pick axe , chisel , battery operated impact tools , battery operated cutting tools , Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools . '' The requirements also note that `` The north side of wall ( i.e . US-facing side ) shall be aesthetically pleasing in color , anti-climb texture , etc. , to be consistent with general surrounding environment , '' though no aesthetic suggestions were put forward for side facing Mexico .\nThe contract for the wall will be awarded based on 30-foot-wide prototypes and 10-foot by 10-foot mockups that will be built in San Diego .\n`` It 's a way for the agency to identify designs , '' a CBP official told NPR . `` We 're looking for industry 's designs , to take a fresh look at the wall .
