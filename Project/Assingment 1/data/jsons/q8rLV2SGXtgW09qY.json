LIFE magazine's Larry Burrows photographed wounded Marine Gunnery Sgt. Jeremiah Purdie, center, reaching toward a stricken soldier after a firefight south of the Demilitarized Zone in Vietnam in 1966. Commonly known as Reaching Out, Burrows shows us tenderness and terror all in one frame. According to LIFE, the magazine did not publish the picture until five years later to commemorate Burrows, who was killed with AP photographer Henri Huet and three other photographers in Laos. Hide Caption 1 of 16 Photos: Iconic photos of the Vietnam War Associated Press photographer Nick Ut photographed terrified children running from the site of a Vietnam napalm attack in 1972. A South Vietnamese plane accidentally dropped napalm on its own troops and civilians. Nine-year-old Kim Phuc, center, ripped off her burning clothes while she ran. The image communicated the horrors of the war and contributed to growing U.S. anti-war sentiment. After taking the photograph, Ut took the children to a Saigon hospital. Hide Caption 2 of 16 Photos: Iconic photos of the Vietnam War Eddie Adams photographed South Vietnamese police chief Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan killing Viet Cong suspect Nguyen Van Lem in Saigon in 1968. Adams later regretted the impact of the Pulitzer Prize-winning image, apologizing to Gen. Nguyen and his family. \"I'm not saying what he did was right,\" Adams wrote in Time magazine , \"but you have to put yourself in his position.\" Hide Caption 3 of 16 Photos: Iconic photos of the Vietnam War A helicopter raises the body of an American paratrooper killed in action in the jungle near the Cambodian border in 1966. Henri Huet, a French war photographer covering the war for the Associated Press, captured some of the most influential images of the war. Huet died along with LIFE photographer Larry Burrows and three other photographers when their helicopter was shot down over Laos in 1971. Hide Caption 4 of 16 Photos: Iconic photos of the Vietnam War Legendary Welsh war photographer Philip Jones Griffiths captured the battle for Saigon in 1968. U.S. policy in Vietnam was based on the premise that peasants driven into the towns and cities by the carpet-bombing of the countryside would be safe. Furthermore, removed from their traditional value system, they could be prepared for imposition of consumerism. This \"restructuring\" of society suffered a setback when, in 1968, death rained down on the urban enclaves. In 1971 Griffiths published \"Vietnam Inc.\" and it became one of the most sought after photography books.

Hide Caption 10 of 16 Photos: Iconic photos of the Vietnam War Frenchman Marc Riboud captured one of the most well-known anti-war images in 1967. Jan Rose Kasmir confronts National Guard troops outside the Pentagon during a protest march. The photo helped turn public opinion against the war. \"She was just talking, trying to catch the eye of the soldiers, maybe try to have a dialogue with them,\" recalled Riboud in the April 2004 Smithsonian magazine, \"I had the feeling the soldiers were more afraid of her than she was of the bayonets.\" Hide Caption 11 of 16 Photos: Iconic photos of the Vietnam War In this 1965 Henri Huet photograph, Chaplain John McNamara administers last rites to photographer Dickey Chapelle in South Vietnam. Chapelle was covering a U.S. Marine unit near Chu Lai for the National Observer when a mine seriously wounded her and four Marines.
