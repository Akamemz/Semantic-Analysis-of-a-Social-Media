    "content": "President Obama said , `` College graduation has never been more valuable . ''\nBut economist Bryan Caplan says that most people should n't go .\n`` How many thousands of hours did you spend in classes studying subjects that you never thought about again ? '' he asks .\nLots , in my case . At Princeton , I learned to live with strangers , play cards and chase women , but I slept through boring lectures , which were most of them . At least tuition was only $ 2,000 . Now it 's almost $ 50,000 .\n`` People usually just want to talk about the tuition , which is a big deal , but there 's also all the years that people spend in school when they could have been doing something else , '' points out Caplan in my new YouTube video .\n`` If you just take a look at the faces of students , it 's obvious that they 're bored , '' he says . `` People are there primarily in order to get a good job . ''\nThat sounds like a good reason to go to college . But Caplan , in his new book , `` The Case Against Education , '' argues that there 's little connection between what we absorb in college and our ability to do a job .\n`` It 's totally true that when people get fancier degrees their income generally goes up , '' concedes Caplan , but `` the reason why this is happening is not that college pours tons of job skills into you . The reason is ... a diploma is a signaling device . ''\nIt tells employers that you were smart enough to get through college .\nBut when most everyone goes to college , says Caplan , `` You just raise the bar . Imagine you 're at a concert , and you want to see better . Stand up and of course you 'll see better . But if everyone stands up , you just block each other 's views . ''\nThat 's why today , he says , high-end waiters are expected to have college degrees .\n`` You are n't saying : you , individual , do n't go to college , '' I interjected . `` You 're saying we as a country are suckers to subsidize it . ''\n`` Exactly , '' replied Caplan . `` Just because it is lucrative for an individual does n't mean it 's a good idea for a country . ''\nCaplan says if students really want to learn , they can do it without incurring tuition debt .\n`` If you want to go to Princeton , you do n't have to apply , '' he points out . `` Just move to the town and start attending classes . ''\nThat 's generally true . At most schools you can crash college lectures for free . But almost no one does that .\n`` In people 's bones , they realize that what really counts is that diploma , '' concludes Caplan .\nBecause that diploma is now usually subsidized by taxpayers , college costs more . Tuition has risen at triple the rate of inflation .\nIt 's not clear students learn more for their extra tuition , but colleges ' facilities sure have gotten fancier . They compete by offering things like luxurious swimming pools and gourmet dining . That probably wo n't help you get a job .\n`` If you 're doing computer science or electrical engineering , then you probably are actually learning a bunch of useful skills , '' Caplan says . But students now often major in abstract topics like social justice , diversity studies , multicultural studies .\n`` But do n't the liberal arts expand people 's minds ? '' I asked . Philosophy ? Literature ? Is n't it all making our brains work better ?\n`` That 's the kind of thing you expect teachers to say , '' answered Caplan . `` There 's a whole field of people who have actually studied this ( and ) they generally come away after looking at a lot of evidence saying , 'Wow , actually it 's wishful thinking . ' ''\nA study found that a third of people have n't detectably learned anything after four years in college .\nAlthough Caplan thinks college is mostly a scam , he says there 's one type of person who definitely benefits -- professors like him .\n`` I 'm a tenured professor , '' he said . `` A tenured professor can not be fired . ... You got a nice income and there are almost no demands upon your time . ''\nProfessor Caplan is only expected to teach for five hours a week .",
