For a movement that \u2019 s virtually stalled since Columbine , anti-gun activists are trying to model after the success of the gay marriage movement , which has won repeatedly at the state-level and in the courts . After all , that seems to be the only option left for these folks since their candidates got shellacked in the 2014 elections ( via NYT ) :\nThe new focus on ballot initiatives comes after setbacks in Congress and in statehouses . After the 2012 mass shooting of schoolchildren in Newtown , Conn. , President Obama \u2019 s effort to pass a background-check measure never got out of the Democratic-controlled Senate . Although 10 states have passed major gun control legislation , not only in Connecticut and New York but also as far away as Colorado , more states have loosened gun restrictions . Candidates who backed gun control mostly lost in the midterm elections , even after groups spent millions on their behalf . The last setback came in December when Martha McSally , a Republican , prevailed in a razor-thin recount over Representative Ron Barber , Democrat of Arizona . Mr. Barber was wounded in the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords , and lost even though Ms. Giffords \u2019 s PAC , Americans for Responsible Solutions , spent more than $ 2 million in the race . Gun control groups say that although they are still dwarfed by the N.R.A. , they have more money and are involved in more grass-roots activism than ever before . The N.R.A . was even heavily outspent in the Washington State referendum . The advocacy groups have recast their cause as a public health and safety movement , and are homing in on areas where polling has shown voter support , like expanded background checks and keeping guns out of the hands of people with domestic violence convictions , restraining orders or mental illnesses . \u2026 The same-sex marriage movement has been a model for advocates of new gun restrictions . As with gay marriage , background-check expansions enjoy far broader public support in polls than among elected officials , and they affect state residents immediately . \u201c The arc of the marriage-equality movement started in the federal government , and got them the Defense of Marriage Act , \u201d said John Feinblatt , president of Everytown for Gun Safety , the gun control group backed by Michael R. Bloomberg , the former mayor of New York City . \u201c Then they went to the states and showed that if you can get the majority of the public on your side state by state , that will influence the courts and Congress in the end . \u201d\nYet , that \u201c arc \u201d that Mr. Feinblatt mentions is trending in the opposite direction on precisely every battlefield . The courts have mostly ruled in favor of Second Amendment rights , even in courts that aren \u2019 t historically known to be friendly to conservative causes . Public opinion is in our favor ; the majority of state legislatures are Republican . Republicans control two-thirds of all the governorships , with almost half the population living in states where the GOP is in total control at the state-level .\nData refutes the incredibly irritating narrative of a gun violence epidemic . Gun-related homicides are down , violent crime is down , mass shootings aren \u2019 t on the rise , and school shootings have n't risen past levels in the mid-1990s . This isn \u2019 t fertile ground for anti-gun advocacy .\nThe anti-gun crowd did have some victories . The two gun rights legislators that replaced the two pro-gun control state senators in Colorado \u2019 s 2013 recall election lost last November . But , let \u2019 s not forget that the coalition that booted these pro-gun control lawmakers in September of 2013 was comprised of Hispanics , women , and blue-collar workers . That \u2019 s not necessarily a deep-red conservative Republican voting bloc ; support for the Second Amendment has wide appeal across a multitude of demographics . You can \u2019 t say the same for the gun control movement , whose base of support is primarily urban , liberal , and in the Northeast .\nI guess that \u2019 s why the National Rifle Association had a 91.2 percent success rate regarding House and Senate races they participated in this past election cycle ( via Washington Examiner ) :\nIn its best election in over a decade , the National Rifle Association scored a 91.2 percent win rate in the House and Senate races it jumped into , and also found the bull \u2019 s-eye in state races , according to the Second Amendment group . \u201c Our members came out in droves and voted for their rights and their freedom , \u201d NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told Secrets . \u201c This was one of the most successful election cycles in a decade , \u201d he added . Overall , the Northern Virginia-based lobby and education group spent about $ 35 million , more than in many past elections , and saw 229 of 251 candidates endorsed by the NRA and its NRA-Political Victory Fund win .
