    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\nFinally , many are critical of Trump \u2019 s push to host the next G7 event at a Trump resort . \u201c While most presidents strive to avoid the perception of corruption and self-dealing , Mr. Trump takes obvious delight in flouting the usual constraints on his position . ( Two words : tax returns . ) As he sees it , such concerns are for suckers , and he has no intention of being bound by them \u2014 no matter how much his behavior erodes public faith in government . But at least the collapse of democratic norms will come with ample parking . \u201d Editorial Board , New York Times\n\u201c Trump says Crimea was \u2018 taken away from President Obama. \u2019 He says this even though Crimea was part of Ukraine , not the United States . The United States also had no duty to intervene , given Ukraine is not part of NATO and doesn \u2019 t benefit from its Article 5 ( or \u2018 collective defense \u2019 ) protections\u2026 kicking Russia out of what was then the G-8 is precisely the kind of step that is intended to discourage such incursions in the future . It \u2019 s meant to be a punishment , yet Trump tries to portray it as some kind of sour grapes from leaders who were outmaneuvered , and he suggests it \u2019 s now counterproductive to maintain the grudge . What Trump is essentially arguing for is to give Putin a pass \u2014 returning his seat at the table despite his illegal action. \u201d Aaron Blake , Washington Post\n\u201c On Friday , President Trump called President Xi Jinping of China an \u2018 enemy , \u2019 said \u2018 we don \u2019 t need China \u2019 and told U.S. companies they were \u2018 hereby ordered \u2019 to end their operations there . Over the next 72 hours , he cited a 1977 emergency powers law to back up his threat to end U.S. economic relations with Beijing ; announced he did not intend to invoke the law ; and , on Monday , declared Mr. Xi to be \u2018 a great leader \u2019 and \u2018 a brilliant man \u2019 with whom his administration would probably soon strike a trade deal . It was , all in all , a stunning display of incoherence \u2014 even by Mr. Trump \u2019 s standards \u2014 that encapsulated his performance at the Group of Seven summit. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c Global economic momentum is fading , not least due to Trump \u2019 s fondness for trade wars \u2014 and bear in mind that if a new recession is the result , central banks will lack the means to respond effectively . Global measures to combat climate change remain woefully insufficient . Global safety and security have been compromised by the rapid decay in conventions and institutions of international cooperation . What \u2019 s truly remarkable is that all of these challenges are the result of deliberate acts of U.S. policy . The summit couldn \u2019 t have put everything back together \u2014 that \u2019 s the work of years , starting with a different U.S. president \u2014 but it could have offered some respite . Instead , the planet \u2019 s most powerful politician has dug the world into an even deeper hole. \u201d Editorial Board , Bloomberg\n\u201c With Trump at odds with much of the free world , the free world seems to be moving on without him . At the G7 , leaders seemed to have given up on the prospect of forging a consensus with him on trade , climate , and even whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is friend or foe\u2026 French President Emmanuel Macron , acting independently , invited the Iranian foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , to the summit for private talks aimed at defusing tensions with the West . Trump didn \u2019 t talk to Zarif , but Macron did\u2026 Trump \u2019 s counterparts made clear that if he wasn \u2019 t willing to be a partner , they might go it alone. \u201d Peter Nicholas , The Atlantic\n\u201c For decades , the United States was at the center of the annual G7 gathering , using its financial might and convening power to address global problems , from the oil crisis and inflation in the 1970s to threats of recession in recent years . But since he took office in 2017 , Trump has separated America from its traditional allies and the institutions they established to advance their collective interests\u2026 The one concrete action that emerged from the weekend only underscored how little the group is able to accomplish without the U.S. at its core . France rallied countries to sign on to a modest $ 20 million fund for putting out fires in the Amazon and starting a long-term effort to protect rainforest. \u201d Brian Bennett and John Walcott , Time\nThe right sees the summit as a success for President Trump .\nThe right sees the summit as a success for President Trump .\n\u201c Macron , this year \u2019 s host , originally wanted the summit to center on climate change and inequality . But those are the very issues killing him with French voters , hence his shift to pretending to try to resurrect the Iran deal on the sidelines\u2026 Nearly retired German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2019 s coalition is on life support ; Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau is reeling from a corruption scandal . Italy \u2019 s Giuseppe Conte announced his resignation days before the summit opened ; Britain \u2019 s Boris Johnson just took over as prime minister and holds a paper-thin majority . Japan \u2019 s Shinzo Abe is the only G-7 leader whose grip on power back home might be stronger than Trump \u2019 s \u2014 and he announced a trade deal with Washington during the meetings . \u201d\n\u201c While blaming Trump for the lack of progress on climate change might make for a good headline , the broader story is more complex . Indeed , a look at the numbers shows that the U.S. has slashed its coal use and cut its total greenhouse emissions more than any country in the G-7 . It has also become a major supplier of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) \u2014 which emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal during combustion \u2014 to other members of the G-7\u2026\n\u201c Although the G-7 members say they want to slash their emissions , several members remain heavily reliant on coal . In the wake of the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant , Japan closed almost all of its nuclear plants . That , in turn , has forced it to rely more heavily on coal . Between 2016 and 2018 , Japan opened eight new coal-fired generation plants , and the country has plans to build about 30 more coal plants with a total capacity of about 17,000 megawatts . A similar situation is playing out in Germany . After Fukushima , the country \u2019 s environmental groups persuaded the government to shutter Germany \u2019 s nuclear reactors . That , in turn , has forced Germany to rely more heavily on coal . In 2017 , the country \u2019 s lignite-fired power plants had the same share in Germany \u2019 s electricity mix as they \u2019 d had in 2000 . \u201d\n\u201c Perhaps a President Hillary Clinton would have preserved more of the facade of unity and cooperation in Biarritz , and certainly , the United States would , in all likelihood , still be a party to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran , and so the arrival of the Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif on the sidelines of the G7 would not have raised tensions as it did with members of the Trump administration delegation . Yet to not recognize that strains have been building among the G7 members independent of who occupies the White House ( or the Elysee palace ) would be to ignore reality\u2026\n\u201c There may be a growing recognition that the West is dealing with the consequences of a major imbalance between its economic integration with Russia and China and the security risks this imposes given Russia \u2019 s and China \u2019 s interests in revising the current global order , but no agreement on which tools of compellence and deterrence should be used . The United States , despite whatever Trump \u2019 s personal feelings on the matter may be , is increasing sanctions pressure on Russia at a time when the consensus in Europe has shifted away from imposing new penalties on Moscow and is debating a prospective softening of existing sanctions and gradually restoring the pre-2014 relationship . \u201d\n\u201c What if G7 leaders lowered their lofty aims and instead took a unified stand on a few issues where they can actually exert some meaningful influence ? They could agree to push for free trade among themselves , and unify in support of embattled Hong Kongers pushing back against an authoritarian China for freedom and democracy . Supporting these millions of mostly-peaceful Hong Kong protesters should be a no-brainer for G7 leaders . The group \u2019 s membership constitutes the \u2018 who \u2019 s who \u2019 of Western democracies , founded at the height of the Cold War as a mechanism to increase economic freedom , promote global trade and investment , and coordinate action on shared security concerns\u2026 Focusing on one or two high-priority agenda items , such as free trade and Hong Kong , is the way to actually get something accomplished . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions\u2026 \u200d \u201c In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey \u2014 notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
