It is typical of the left , which owns almost all of the media , to demand \u201c civility \u201d of its opponents while granting itself limitless incivilities .\nIn the grip of government power , when they need to tame their opposition , liberals will pompously talk about the \u201c rules of decorum. \u201d But the moment they are out of power they immediately start breaking them . In the 1990s , the rattiest members of the Clinton administration famously called for a \u201c civility commission , \u201d which led to a sham group at the University of Pennsylvania , populated mainly by uncivil liberals , becoming upset at Rush Limbaugh and company for challenging their power .\nThe relativism underpinning liberalism makes it hopelessly willful . Its relationship to civility is determined not by any principle independent of human will but by pure political opportunism . Insofar as civility is useful to gaining or preserving power , liberals pretend to honor it .
