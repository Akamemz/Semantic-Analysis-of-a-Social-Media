That could have a calamitous effect -- a top GOP pollster warned last month that Fox \u2019 s coverage was making the party \u2019 s base more likely to dismiss the virus and skip the steps needed to combat it .\nAnd one of those viewers is Trump , who is watching the network \u2019 s coverage and taking notes .
