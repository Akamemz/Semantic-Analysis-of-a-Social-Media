But he stressed that lawmakers and the White House do n't have to be in `` perpetual conflict '' and `` have an obligation to work together . ''\nMcConnell said Wednesday marks the start of \u201c the race to turn this country around . \u201d\nDifferent flanks of the Republican Party have different ideas of how that effort would play out .\nSome plan to use the perks of majority-hood to put renewed pressure on the Obama administration . With Republicans gaining at least 7 seats in the Senate , the party will chair key committees and have the power to launch investigations and hold hearings from both chambers . Plus they \u2019 ll be able to more easily hold up political and judicial appointments .\nAt the same time , the Republicans clearly will be short of a 60-seat , filibuster-proof majority , meaning they \u2019 ll have to draw at least some Democratic support to pass favored legislation . And they \u2019 d need to either work with Obama , or corral an even bigger coalition to override presidential vetoes . Some warn that passing bills just to make a point would merely give new meaning to the \u201c party of no \u201d and say they should concentrate on working with the president and Democratic leaders \u2013 and vice-versa -- to get something done in the next two years . Republicans so far have reached a 52-seat majority , with three races yet to be decided .\nAnalysts urged the party to start early on charting their agenda .\n\u201c This is the point where they need to show leadership ahead of the politics , \u201d said columnist and \u2588\u2588\u2588 contributor Charles Krauthammer . \u201c Republicans should have an agenda where they pass a bill a week \u2013 start small , start now . \u201d\n\u201c Now that we have won the election it is incumbent on Republicans to stand up and lead , \u201d Cruz said . \u201c It is incumbent on us to deliver with bold , positive , optimistic agenda , focusing on jobs \u2026 economic growth and opportunity and focused on defending our constitutional rights . \u201d\nRepealing ObamaCare is a priority , he said , but if that doesn \u2019 t work he said lawmakers should go after smaller provisions of the bill . He also called for \u201c meaningful oversight of the administration in the Senate , \u201d with \u201c serious , sober , systematic hearings \u201d on issues ranging from Benghazi to the IRS .\nThe Republicans pulled off major victories in key states Tuesday , gaining 7 new Senate seats so far ; they claimed the majority in the Senate and built their majority in the House . Louisiana 's Senate race is heading to a run-off , but polls have shown Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in trouble in a head-to-head race against Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy . In Virginia , Democratic Sen. Mark Warner was clinging to a narrow , 1 percentage point lead over Republican Ed Gillespie with most precincts reporting . Ballots are still being counted in Alaska , but Republican Dan Sullivan is holding a few point lead over Democratic Sen. Mark Begich .\nAside from health care , also on the radar is whether Republicans will try to scale back any executive action taken by Obama to prevent millions of illegal immigrants from being deported .\nObama appears to be eager to get some sense on how things will go , already inviting top congressional leaders from both parties to meet with him Friday at the White House . For his part , outgoing Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid said he is willing to work across the aisle . \u201c I look forward to working with Senator McConnell to get things done for the middle class , '' he said in a statement Tuesday night .\nOn the issue of immigration , Republicans might have enough votes to use the appropriations process to defund any executive measures the president invokes to prevent illegal immigrants now in the country from being deported . They may also have the numbers now to push for tougher border enforcement legislation . But comprehensive immigration reform , which passed the Democrat-controlled Senate but failed in the House , may be less likely .\nFormer Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , speaking with \u2588\u2588\u2588 Tuesday night , believes there are areas of immigration reform \u2013 like better security on the border \u2013 that Republicans can probably pursue piecemeal , if they are willing . \u201c These issues will be raised \u2026 perhaps they will come to the president \u2019 s desk in bills , one by one , and hopefully the president will sign them . \u201d\nBut there are other areas where Republicans may work with the president directly to get favorable legislation through his last two years of office .

Up until now , Reid has blocked that authority . But with a new Senate majority leader , that could change .\nSensing that Obama might only need a little push \u2013 and maybe a few sweeteners -- Republicans could see their way to getting a long sought-after green light for the contentious Keystone Pipeline .
