    "content": "I think by now we have all had it with the endless rounds of opinion about the George Zimmerman case . Most recently , Jimmy Carter , of all people , basically said the jury reached the correct decision based on the law , while Hillary Clinton seemed less sure in a speech to a primarily African-American audience .\nWhile I have been a columnist for years now , I have also remained a practicing attorney . In my early days as a lawyer , through an unusual set of circumstances , I found myself serving as lead counsel for a 17-year-old boy against whom the state was seeking the death penalty . I 'm sure I was too young and inexperienced , but along with a slightly more experienced and brilliant co-counsel , we somehow managed to avoid the electric chair for our client .\nIt was considered a success from the standpoint of the seemingly insurmountable evidence we faced , but when it concluded I vowed never to get involved in another murder case as long as I lived . There are no winners in such matters , and I am far too soft-hearted when it comes to both victims and the arguments , when strong , for the accused .\nSo , having tried a case -- one in which , at the time , my client would have been the youngest to ever face death row in my state -- what words of wisdom do I offer on the Zimmerman verdict ? The answer is : none .\nThe laws that govern any case as serious as that which Zimmerman faced are so complex , and the impact of testimony and other evidence is impossible to truly comprehend outside of the courtroom . And to armchair second-guess the strategy of the prosecution or defense , much less how a jury ferreted through the facts and applied the law , is far too complicated .\nThere are certainly many legal analysts with much more experience in this type trial than I , and their opinions , while varied , are at least generally grounded in law and experience , if not sometimes tinged with a little emotion . But when it comes to politicians and political pundits somehow passing judgment on the decision of a jury , there is not much more to say but forgive them , for they know not of what they speak .\nAnd as to various positions on existing or potential new laws , well , there is n't much that I have heard that seems very relevant to either the evidence or the law as it applied to this case . There are politicians , preachers and pundits offering all sorts of opinions and proposals with respect the so-called `` stand your ground '' laws in Florida and other states . What seems to be a bit of a disconnect is that the defense in the Zimmerman case did not rely on that particular law as a means of arguing their case . That has n't stopped the arguments over their effectiveness or related to potential problems that might arise under such laws . Again , it 's an example of opinions arising from something not really central to what occurred in the actual courtroom .\nNow we have some members of Congress wanting stricter laws related to racial profiling . Certainly that might be practical with officials , government and law enforcement . But how in the world does Congress expect to determine if an individual private citizen in any given matter is `` racially profiling '' another with regard to the actions they might take ? And would new laws put in place apply to all races and how they are treated by others ?\nThere is one thing that we do know from this case . Trayvon Martin , regardless of what actions he did or did not take on the night of his death , is nevertheless deceased . His family and friends will never get over that fact , and it is understandable , even if one has the view that Zimmerman was not guilty of the charges that faced him .\nBut the other fact is that Zimmerman is not really a free man . He is the target of much hatred and both spoken and unspoken threats . For a man declared by a jury to be `` not guilty , '' Zimmerman will undoubtedly feel a sense of a `` sentence '' hanging over his head for years , if not forever .\nI 'm just not wise enough to second-guess prosecutors , defense attorneys and a jury selected by both sides in a case that I passingly followed from the comfort of my home on a television that just as easily could be switched to a news debate on Egypt or a rerun of `` Frazier . ''\nI would have to try a whole lot more murder cases to feel qualified to opine on the merits of this case .
