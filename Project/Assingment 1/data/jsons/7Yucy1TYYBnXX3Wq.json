    "content": "\u201c It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election , \u201d FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee less than two weeks ago . Hearing Comey supercilious testimony , made me , well , mildly nauseous .\nMr. Comey was speaking about his unilateral decision to publicly reopen the investigation of Hillary Clinton on October 29 , just ten days before the election . That pre-election announcement and the specter of evil Russians are why Hillary lost , we are told ( by Hillary ) . Let \u2019 s forget her lack of appeal , her disconnect with much of America , her inept campaign , especially her dissing of Michigan and Wisconsin .\n\u201c But honestly , it [ the alleged Comey effect on the election outcome ] wouldn \u2019 t change the decision [ I made ] , \u201d Comey added . Indeed , in his ultimate chutzpah-hubris , Comey also refused to recant his preposterous news conference of July 5 . At that time he had provided all the reasons why Hillary should be indicted and prosecuted and then , usurping the role of the Department of Justice , Comey violated historic protocols and , in a non-sequitur for the history books , gave her a get-out-of-jail-free card .\nThat was then , this is now . If you believe the media , Trump \u2019 s firing of Comey somehow threatens the rule of law , though Trump had the right to fire him . The same Democrats who repeatedly and strongly urged that Comey be fired , condemn Trump for \u201c the suspicious timing. \u201d The patronizing Adam Schiff , arguably the most pompous member of Congress , said the reason for the firing was Trump \u2019 s alleged ties to Russia . A former prosecutor who knows better , Schiff routinely makes charges without proof , but he does so with gravitas .\n\u201c Comey was fired because of the Russians , \u201d also observed Pocahontas , aka Sen. Elizabeth Warren , perennially self-righteous . Warren became a professor at Harvard Law School because she described herself as of Cherokee and Delaware Indian ancestry ; she is neither . Of dubious credibility , she joins the chorus : \u201c We need a special prosecutor ! \u201d Over more than four decades , \u201c special \u201d prosecutors have acted like IRS agents who , after an exhaustive taxpayer audit , find nothing . But to validate their time , the agents nonetheless pressure the taxpayer into a \u201c settlement. \u201d In other words , if a special prosecutor finds no crimes related to Trump and \u201c the Russians , \u201d he will ask for an expanded budget and prosecute someone connected to Trump\u2026 for something .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a showboat , a grandstander , \u201d Trump has said of Comey . Trump \u2019 s detractors would say , \u201c It takes one to know one. \u201d But Trump got it right . Comey became ( per Simon Cowell ) \u201c self-indulgent. \u201d His firing was overdue , yet with no expiration date .\nBut Trump \u2019 s dismissal of Comey was awkward ; let us count the ways .\nTrump \u2019 s senior staff remains dysfunctional , evidenced by self-serving leaks from rivals , not all of them Trump \u2019 s fiduciaries . Intent on discharging Comey , Trump thus feared premature ejaculation . Avoiding tactical if not strategic proofreading , Trump seemed to act not deliberatively ( i.e. , presidential ) , but impulsively ; then oddly , he seemed to be genuinely surprised at the uproar . He and his team would evolve a contradictory and implausible narrative . Even Vice President Mike Pence continually said President Trump \u201c showed leadership \u201d by acting quickly after reading Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein \u2019 s memorandum faulting Comey \u2019 s performance , but then President Trump said he had already made up his mind to fire Comey . Everyone should have been on the same page , from the outset , but no one knew the page number , much less what was on it .\nSpicer , President Trump more recently said , is \u201c doing a good job but he gets beat up. \u201d In reality , Spicer and his deputy Sarah Huckabee Sanders can not do their job if the storyline keeps changing , and especially if Spicer does not have access to Trump before airtime . Now Trump says he works so fast that White House briefings are obsolete . But in firing Comey , the dictum should have been , \u201c This is my story , and I \u2019 m sticking to it . \u201d\nDeputy AG Rod Rosenstein \u2019 s memorandum to AG Jeff Sessions made the case for Comey \u2019 s dismissal . But it was dated the same day that Sessions then ( immediately ? ) wrote to POTUS who then ( straightaway ? ) wrote Comey \u2019 s farewell , and ( without pausing ? ) dispatched his long-time personal aide to deliver that termination letter to Comey . Except that Comey had flown on the FBI jet to Los Angeles , the sanctuary city where you press \u201c 2 \u201d if you want to hear a city message in English ( just kidding ) . Here leaders are passing a municipal decree to implant the scarlet letter on any minor subcontractor on Trump \u2019 s wall ( not kidding ) . The politically correct Comey was at the Los Angeles FBI field office , speaking to agents not about such trivial matters as terrorism or cyber warfare , but the far more urgent matter of diversity . As Comey spoke , the agents saw the news of his firing on a television screen behind the needlessly humiliated Comey .\nLet \u2019 s now talk Russia . All we know ( so far ) suggests that Putin preferred Trump to Hillary , and that the Russians hacked Hillary \u2019 s campaign to hurt her . No evidence suggests collusion or complicity between Trump and his campaign\u2026 and Putin and his operatives , nor acts that are illegal . Yet , as one observer noted , \u201c Trump seems to act like he \u2019 s guilty. \u201d Meanwhile , the mainstream media has kept the Russia story alive , because its agenda is to question the legitimacy of Trump \u2019 s election . Major media outlets repeatedly relate gossip as fact . For example , Comey supposedly asked for more money to investigate Trump , who then sacked him . But this turned out to be fake news . The real news , the media reported last week , is that Trump is served two scoops of ice cream for dessert , while his White House guests get only one . CNN noted that Abby Grace , age 9 , who lives next door to Comey in McLean , Virginia baked him chocolate chip cookies to cheer him up .\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Trump \u2019 s dismissal of Comey was to \u201c obstruct \u201d the FBI investigation ; it continues , with no shortage of agents or budget . If Trump were trying to shut down the investigation , firing Comey guaranteed it will continue , robustly , and all eyes will focus on Comey \u2019 s successor , who will be under pressure , in confirmation hearings , and on the job , to insure an independent investigation .\nHere \u2019 s what probably happened . Trump has become increasingly agitated because : ( a ) Comey did not move the FBI \u201c Russia \u201d investigation toward closure , but made it open-ended ; ( b ) Comey is a loose cannon , which is different than being independent ; ( c ) Comey showed little inclination to investigate illegal leaks by government officials intent on subverting the Trump presidency ; and , most egregiously : ( d ) Comey implied that Trump \u2019 s reelection made Comey nauseous .\nThere was no good time to fire Comey , but there was a better way . Ask the respected Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein to prepare his memo ; wait at least a day for AG Jeff Sessions to react , then on the third day either give Comey a chance to resign , or fire him , but do so privately . Already have a list of possible replacements , then interview them , all within 72 hours of Comey \u2019 s firing , and appoint his successor a day after the last interview , to make the FBI Director the story and Comey \u201c old news . \u201d\nThe rationale for Comey \u2019 s firing should have been that Comey \u2019 s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee was unacceptable , especially his intransigent refusal to acknowledge his bad judgment last year . Therefore , the president , who has for a couple of weeks been pondering Mr. Comey \u2019 s future , now accepts the deputy attorney general conclusion , spurred by the testimony . And similarly , President Trump lacks confidence in Comey , so he can no longer serve as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Talking points should have been developed before Comey \u2019 s dismissal .\nIn this drama , some of the principals may be vulnerable to prosecution . From what we know , Gen. Mike Flynn may have violated some laws relating to disclosure to government agencies . But Mike Flynn is no longer with the administration . And by all accounts , Flynn also failed to disclose material information to candidate Trump and his campaign . Paul Manafort , whose foreign clients included Russian proxies , was asked by Trump to oversee the convention after Ted Cruz was using the rules to pick up delegates . But Manafort was dismissed soon after the convention . And Roger Stone , another alleged link to the Russians , has joyfully volunteered to testify publicly , without immunity . That \u2019 s not what guilty conspirators do .\nAll this raises the question of context . If President Donald Trump is the \u201c Manchurian candidate \u201d \u2014 then why was Donald Trump so obvious about it during the campaign ? That is , if Trump were a covert operative for Putin , why would he go public about it in his campaign , praising Putin and urging rapprochement with Russia ? In other words , if the Russians influenced or bribed Donald Trump and his sons , Donald Jr. and Eric , with loans and business deals , why not wait until after Trump becomes president to embrace Putin and Russia ? Why tip your hand throughout the campaign ?\nThe answer is not elusive , because we can observe the Trump Administration . President Trump \u2019 s principal foreign policy appointments have been unsympathetic to Putin . Hardliners in the U.S. Senate do not detect softness in U.S. policy toward Russia . Trump seems reassuring of our NATO allies that the U.S. will join NATO to resist regional Russian aggression . The U.S. is confronting Russian air incursions , especially near Alaska . And in Putin \u2019 s most dramatic foreign adventure \u2014 in Syria \u2014 President Trump ordered a symbolic air strike against Putin \u2019 s proxy , Bashar Assad . Is all this a head-fake ? I think not .\nBut at the end of the day , what counts is perception , not reality . Perhaps one-third of the nation sees Trump as some kind of savior . And maybe another third is comprised of unrepentant Trump haters . That leaves a likely third of the nation that is increasingly restless with drama , instead of policy . And the latest episode is the James Comey soap opera .\nPutin said something like , \u201c Once a KGB guy , always a KGB guy. \u201d The KGB has placed within the U.S. government over the years a number of home-grown operatives , via blackmail , or by providing sexual favors or money , or feeding their ego . Some of these moles have simply been dupes . What we know is that the KGB would not discredit them in advance . If President Trump was sympathetic toward better relations with Russia , not because he was complicit with Russia , but because he thought it was in the best interest of the U.S. , why would President Trump obsess about such a policy , if it would discredit that policy in advance ? He was quite transparent about his views .\nIndeed , the disposition of President Trump \u2019 s policy toward Russia is this : his campaign pronouncements have put him and his administration on the spot . If anything , he may now go overboard in demonstrating \u201c firmness \u201d and \u201c toughness \u201d against Putin and Russia . And similarly , given the sacking of Comey , what happens now with the FBI \u2014 can it be seen as \u201c soft \u201d on investigating \u201c Trump and Russia \u201d \u2014 whatever that means ?\nSooner than later , perhaps imminently , President Donald Trump will name a new FBI director . For his sake , and more importantly for the nation , let \u2019 s hope he avoids a partisan . If he chooses a man or woman of unquestionable integrity and demonstrated judgment who pledges to be independent of politics , President Trump will implicitly refute the challenge to his legitimacy .",
