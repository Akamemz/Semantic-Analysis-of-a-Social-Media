    "content": "The fight over the Keystone XL pipeline has been raging for so long it seems almost routine at this point . This month , Republicans in Congress passed a bill to approve the pipeline once and for all . On Tuesday , President Obama vetoed it , saying he still needed more time to decide . And on and on it goes ...\nSo this is a good moment to step back and appreciate just how truly and deeply unexpected it is that we 're even having this fight in the first place .\nthat Keystone is such a huge story tells us a lot about how energy politics has shifted\nThat is , it 's genuinely surprising that the Obama administration has now spent years and years agonizing over a single pipeline . It 's surprising that this one project has become such a political flashpoint that Senate Republicans decided to spend the first two months of their newly-won majority on a Keystone bill they knew would be vetoed .\nIndeed , the fact that Keystone XL is now one of the biggest stories in American politics tells us a lot about how the politics of energy and climate have shifted radically since 2008 . It 's the story of how President Obama became the locus of action on global warming , of how the White House developed an uneasy relationship with North America 's newfound oil boom , and of how greens have had to lower their expectations for what Washington can do to address climate change .\nKeystone XL only became a key issue after more ambitious climate efforts failed\nFew people could have seen this fight coming when Obama first took office . Back in 2008 , when TransCanada first applied for a permit to expand its existing Keystone oil pipeline system , virtually no one cared .\nThe company 's logic seemed banal enough . With global oil prices rising , more and more companies were mining crude from the oil sands of Alberta . But those companies needed a way to transport the crude to refineries that could turn it into gasoline and usable fuel . Pipelines were an obvious option .\nWhat 's more , TransCanada had already been building a network of pipelines from Canada down to Texas , starting in 2005 . The new Keystone XL system would simply expand that existing network , bringing 830,000 barrels of crude per day from Alberta down to Nebraska , where it would go on to refineries in the Gulf Coast . The company figured approval would be a slam-dunk .\nWhat TransCanada did n't count on was that the politics of global warming would change rapidly in just a few years . Back in 2008 , the biggest green groups were still mostly focused on persuading Congress to pass a sweeping bill to cut US greenhouse-gas emissions . But then the Senate killed the big cap-and-trade bill in 2010 , and , soon after , Republicans retook the House \u2014 with no intention of addressing climate change . Environmentalists were utterly defeated , and started casting about for a more winnable fight .\nThat 's how Keystone became a potent issue . Around 2011 , environmentalists like Bill McKibben began pointing out that oil-sands crude is worse for global warming than regular crude because of all the extra energy it takes to extract . NASA scientist James Hansen warned that burning every last drop of oil in Canada 's vast oil sands would mean `` game over '' for climate change .\nAnd greens did n't have to rely on Congress to do something about this . Because Keystone XL would cross international borders , the State Department had to approve it first . That meant Obama had final say . So the pipeline became a rallying point for greens \u2014 a clear goal they could achieve through pressure on a president who had vowed to tackle global warming .\nTrue , blocking Keystone XL would n't do nearly as much to curb greenhouse-gas emissions as broad climate legislation would have . But it was also far more straightforward . No longer did climate activists have to wait around for NGOs in Washington to lobby congressional committees over complicated , loophole-ridden bills . They could take to the streets with a simple demand \u2014 and engage a fight where it was clear what victory would entail .\nThe focus on Keystone also jibed with an evolution in how scientists and greens were thinking about global warming . Increasingly , they were noting that the world had delayed addressing emissions for so long that we were on pace to blow past the long-standing 2\u00b0C `` limit '' for global warming . The only way to stay below that threshold would be to leave much of our vast current reserves of oil , gas , and coal in the ground , unburned . As Hansen had noted , fully exploiting Alberta 's oil sands would make that task much , much harder .\nAnd so , increasingly , environmentalists were focused not just on policies to reduce emissions ( say , by bolstering solar and wind power or by taxing carbon ) , but also on efforts to curtail fossil-fuel production . They wanted to stop companies from digging up oil , gas , and coal in the first place .\nThis new movement put the White House in a bind . Obama has long said that he takes global warming seriously \u2014 during the 2008 campaign , he supported a sweeping proposal to cut US greenhouse-gas emissions 80 percent by 2050 .\nBut at the same time , the United States has been trying to claw its way out of a deep recession . And the recent oil boom in North America \u2014 which only began in the mid-2000s , and was driven by high global prices and new technologies like fracking and horizontal drilling \u2014 has been one of the few economic bright spots .\nFor much of his presidency , Obama has tried to balance these two concerns by touting an `` all-of-the-above '' approach to energy . On the one hand , he 'd push policies to boost clean energy ( the 2009 stimulus bill had $ 90 billion for things like solar , wind , and electric cars ) . He 'd also support regulations to chip away at America 's demand for oil , gas , and coal \u2014 like the fuel-economy standards for cars and light trucks , or the EPA 's forthcoming rules to crack down on carbon-dioxide emissions from coal plants .\nBut , at the same time , Obama was also committed to supporting oil and gas production in the US . After all , the fracking boom was helping to lift up the US economy . And , more recently , the glut of oil from North Dakota and Texas has driven prices back down and led to cheap gasoline at the pump . That 's been a huge political boon to Obama .\nKeystone XL was a way to confront Obama 's 'all-of-the-above ' energy policy\nWhat 's more , the administration reasoned , the real climate problem was humanity 's demand for fossil fuels . The best way to fight global warming was to curb our use of dirty energy \u2014 not to block individual projects that would have a small effect in the grand scheme of things . ( Back in 2013 , the State Department argued that blocking Keystone XL was mostly futile as a way to tackle climate change . So long as oil demand was high , Alberta 's crude would find a way to market , whether by pipeline or train or some other route . )\nBut environmentalists had long insisted that Obama could n't have it both ways . He could n't profess to care about global warming and support more oil and gas drilling . And , with Keystone XL , they found a way to pressure the White House on exactly this point . Either Obama could approve the pipeline or he could deny it . There was no middle ground , no way to fudge .\nUnable to choose , the administration dithered on a decision for years . And Republicans soon saw a perfect opportunity to pounce . For them , backing Keystone XL was a no-brainer \u2014 the pipeline would create ( some ) jobs and bolster the flow of oil from a friendly neighbor .
