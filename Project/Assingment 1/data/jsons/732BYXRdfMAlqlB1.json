This goes to the very center of Obama 's domestic program . This is not some parenthetical aside he lied about . This is the core of his whole program .

A June 2010 press release from the Department of Health and Human Services explicitly stated that some individuals would face changes to their plans :\nThe 17 million people who are covered in the individual health insurance market , where switching of plans and substantial changes in coverage are common , will receive the new protections of the Affordable Care Act sooner rather than later . Roughly 40 percent to two-thirds of people in individual market policies normally change plans within a year . In the short run , individuals whose plan changes and is no longer grandfathered will gain access to free preventive services , protections against restricted annual limits , and patient protections such as improved access to emergency rooms . [ U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , 6/14/10 ]\nIn June 2010 , Sec . Sebelius Explained The Conditions That Would Cause Plans To Change To Comply With ACA . On June 14 , 2010 , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced the conditions that would cause an individual insurance plan that was in existence by the date the law was enacted to change to comply with the ACA 's requirements : administration 's grandfathering regulations , saying \u201c if health plans significantly raise copayments or deductibles , or significantly reduce benefits , for example just stop covering treatments like HIV/AIDS or cystic fibrosis , they lose their grandfather status , and their customers then have the full set of consumer protections as new plans . Together , these rules mean exactly what President Obama told the American people would be done ; under the Affordable Care Act , if you like your doctor and your plan , you keep it. \u201d [ U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , 6/14/10 ]\nNY Times In 2010 : Administration Acknowledged That Some \u201c Might Face Significant Changes In The Terms Of Their Coverage. \u201d The New York Times reported in June 2010 that the administration acknowledged that some \u201c might face significant changes in the terms of their coverage \u201d :\nIn issuing the rules , the administration said this was just one goal of the legislation , allowing people to \u201c keep their current coverage if they like it. \u201d It acknowledged that some people , especially those who work at smaller businesses , might face significant changes in the terms of their coverage , and it said they should be able to \u201c reap the benefits of additional consumer protections. \u201d The law provides a partial exemption for certain health plans in existence on March 23 , when Mr. Obama signed the legislation . Under this provision , known as a grandfather clause , plans can lose the exemption if they make significant changes in deductibles , co-payments or benefits . About half of employer-sponsored health plans will see such changes by the end of 2013 , the administration says in an economic analysis of the rules . The rules allow employers and insurers to increase benefits . But , in a summary of the rules , the administration said , \u201c Plans will lose their grandfather status if they choose to make significant changes that reduce benefits or increase costs to consumers. \u201d [ The New York Times , 6/14/10 ]\nInsurance Companies Frequently Discontinue Policies , And Cancellations Do Not Mean Lost Coverage\nCHIR : \u201c Having An Insurance Company Discontinue An Insurance Policy Is Not Anything New. \u201d According to Georgetown University 's Center on Health Insurance Reforms ( CHIR ) , most consumers have year-long policies with health insurance companies that are often changed at the end of the policy year , and \u201c in most states insurers are allowed to increase premiums , increase cost-sharing , and/or reduce the scope of benefits covered. \u201d CHIR further clarifies :\nHaving an insurance company discontinue an insurance policy is not anything new . And actually , the term \u201c policy cancellation \u201d is a misnomer . Generally , an individual health insurance policy is sold via a 12-month contract between the insurer and the consumer . At the end of that contract period , the insurer has the option to discontinue or change that policy - nothing in federal law changes that . Current policyholders are not having their current policy cancelled - rather , the insurance company is exercising its option to discontinue the policy at the end of the contract year . The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) , a federal law passed in 1996 , provides that individual policies are \u201c guaranteed renewable \u201d at the end of the 12-month contract , but in most states insurers are allowed to increase premiums , increase cost-sharing , and/or reduce the scope of benefits covered . And , more often than not , insurance companies have done one or all of these things to policyholders . It is part of the reason individual health insurance is often called \u201c swiss cheese \u201d coverage compared to employer-based plans - because it 's full of holes . Under HIPAA , an insurer could also decide to discontinue a policy , but if it did so , the law said it must provide the policyholder with at least 90 days notice , must offer the policyholder another new policy as an alternative , and has to treat its policyholders the same , regardless of their health status . [ The Center on Health Insurance Reforms , 10/28/13 ]\nInterim Final Rule On ACA , June 2010 : Administration Estimates Some Plans Would Be Changed Due To Regular Turnover In Insurance Markets . The interim final rule published in the Federal Register in June 2010 shows that the Obama administration based their estimates on health care plan changes on research that showed the individual insurance market experiences heavy annual turnover :\nThe market for individual insurance is significantly different than that for group coverage . This affects estimates of the proportion of plans that will remain grandfathered until 2014 . As mentioned previously , the individual market is a residual market for those who need insurance but do not have group coverage available and do not qualify for public coverage . For many , the market is transitional , providing a bridge between other types of coverage . One study found a high percentage of individual insurance policies began and ended with employer-sponsored coverage . More importantly , coverage on particular policies tends to be for short periods of time . Reliable data are scant , but a variety of studies indicate that between 40 percent and 67 percent of policies are in effect for less than one year . Although data on changes in benefit packages comparable to that for the group market is not readily available , the high turnover rates described here would dominate benefit changes as the chief source of changes in grandfather status . While a substantial fraction of individual policies are in force for less than one year , a small group of individuals maintain their policies over longer time periods . One study found that 17 percent of individuals maintained their policies for more than two years , while another found that nearly 30 percent maintained policies for more than three years.Using these turnover estimates , a reasonable range for the percentage of individual policies that would terminate , and therefore relinquish their grandfather status , is 40 percent to 67 percent.These estimates assume that the policies that terminate are replaced by new individual policies , and that these new policies are not , by definition , grandfathered .
