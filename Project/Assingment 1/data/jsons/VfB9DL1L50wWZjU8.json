Robert Menendez ( D ) of New Jersey : According to an Associated Press investigation , the embattled New Jersey Democrat sponsored legislation that , if passed , would have aided one of his biggest donor 's investment in a natural gas vehicle conversion company .\nThe report , published Monday , stated that Senator Menendez sponsored a bill to give tax credits and grants to truck and heavy vehicle fleets that converted to natural gas . The bill could have benefited Salomon Melgen , the Florida eye doctor whose close relationship with Menendez has spurred a Senate ethics investigation . Dr. Melgen is an investor and member of the board of directors of Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. , which designs , manufactures , and sells products to convert diesel- and gas-fuel vehicles to natural gas .\nMenendez \u2019 s backing of the natural-gas bill marks another convergence of interest between the politician and a major donor and is a thorn for the senator . But political watchers in New Jersey say the bill sponsorship is one part of a larger clean-energy agenda from the senator , who has a history of supporting environmental causes .
