Neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump have laid out a detailed plan for how they would revise or replace the law or how they would navigate the toxic politics that surface in Washington whenever health care is on the agenda .\nTrump has proven better at condemning Obamacare -- his stump speech includes vows to repeal and replace it -- than saying how he would tackle the crisis over access and cost . He has n't made health reform a centerpiece of his campaign .\n`` My first day in office , I 'm going to ask Congress to put a bill on my desk getting rid of this disastrous law and replacing it with reforms that expand choice , freedom and affordability , '' Trump said Tuesday in Florida . `` Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare and make it even worse . She wants to put the government totally in charge of your health care . ''\nStill , Clinton has been far more up front about what she would try to accomplish .\n`` The President and I have talked about it , '' Clinton told WHCQ Radio in Florida on Tuesday . `` We 're going to get copays and premiums and deductibles down .
