It has n't survived for four years , with all the forces arrayed against it , without strong social roots , '' says Sergei Karaganov , a senior Russian foreign policy expert . `` It 's also clear that Russia will have to be a part of that solution . The old US approach of just getting together a bunch of like-minded 'friends of Syria ' to decide things is finished . \u201d\nThe terror attacks in Paris will add to the sense of urgency , at least for Europeans , who have already felt increasing pressures from the growing refugee crisis to move on a negotiated solution for Syria , experts say .\nTalks in Vienna on Syria have already made more progress in the past 10 days than in the previous four years , says Andrei Klimov , deputy chair of the international affairs committee of the Federation Council , Russia 's Senate .
