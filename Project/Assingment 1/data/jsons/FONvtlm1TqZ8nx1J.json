''\nThis was the kind of campaign Obama has always promised voters he would not run . The campaign of triangulation seeks to lessen the policy space between the two parties by minimizing many key differences and focusing voter attention on the personality and appeal of the candidate .\nJimmy Carter was one of the Democrats who mastered this strategy . In 1976 , he sidestepped some traditionally controversial issues such as civil rights and economic policy and instead depicted himself as a deficit-cutting moderate who was not like his elders in the Democratic Party .\nHe focused on his personality , his background in Georgia and the argument that voters in the post-Watergate age could trust him .\nIn 1996 , Clinton perfected this kind of campaign . After Republicans had retaken the House and Senate in 1994 , Clinton started the year of 1996 by saying the era of big government was over . He agreed to legislation that ended the existing welfare system and made deficit reduction his priority . In essence , he stole the mainstream part of the Republican agenda and made it his own .\nBy the time the campaign was fully under way , he could concentrate on his youth and charisma , particularly when he compared himself with the much older Republican Sen. Robert Dole and highlight the areas that made the GOP look extreme , like their push for dramatic cuts in the Medicare program .\nThe strong temptation for Obama will be to move closer toward the model of triangulation , especially given the stalling economy and after Republicans scored a major victory in Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker 's recall campaign .\nObama understands that the danger of a campaign of articulation is that he would not be able to capitalize on the issues that convince many moderates to go to or stick with the Republican Party .\nBut Obama needs to offer voters a choice . The danger of triangulation is that it dampens the enthusiasm of base supporters who are needed to help raise money and bring out the vote . They are the organizers , the mobilizers and the rank-and-file who can make sure that in a close election , more Democrats come out to vote .\nAnd a candidate who ca n't triangulate as skillfully as Clinton did could only end up legitimating the arguments of his opponent and leaving voters to wonder why they do n't just go for the `` real thing . ''\nThis does not mean Obama has to run as a `` left-wing '' Democrat , nor does he have to stick to attacks on Bain Capital , which do n't seem to be working . But he does need a message , and he does need a coherent theme that goes beyond slight differences with the GOP .\nObama 's best bet is to stick with a campaign in which he focuses on defining a Democratic set of principles and offering voters a reason why his party would be better over the next four years , especially on the economy .
