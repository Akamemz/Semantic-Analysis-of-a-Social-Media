    "content": "( CNN ) Republican lawmakers have finally unveiled a plan to repeal major portions of Obamacare , capping years of attacks against the health care law and a months-long debate that exposed deep rifts within the GOP .\nHouse Republican leaders must begin in earnest the tough task of selling the new plan to overhaul America 's health care system to colleagues in both chambers on Capitol Hill , where there is a myriad of clashing interests . And they will have to convince a skeptical public it 's worthwhile , just seven years after Congress passed the Affordable Care Act .\nThe political ramifications could n't be more significant . Perceptions that Republicans and President Donald Trump are not moving ahead with a wholesale Obamacare repeal would anger large swaths of the party 's base , while the possibility of millions of Americans losing coverage could emerge as a top liability for Republicans ahead of the 2018 midterm elections .\nTrump is expected to offer a more robust embrace of the House GOP health care plan Tuesday when he meets with the deputy whip team at the White House in the afternoon , an administration official told CNN Tuesday .\nWhether Trump is committed to the political challenge of repealing and replacing Obamacare remains a central question .\n`` He 'll work hard to get this done , '' the administration official said , including pushing reluctant conservatives by helping build support for this bill out in their districts .\nThat 's one of the reasons Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was invited to the White House for dinner Wednesday night . He 's among the skeptical conservatives who believe the new bill is essentially a new mandate .\nIn the coming days , key House committees will hold extended sessions to debate and revise a bill that until Monday night was closely guarded \u2014 including being held in a House office for lawmakers to view but not copy . These gatherings will provide plenty of opportunity for political grandstanding from Democrats as they look to cast Republicans as responsible for taking away people 's health insurance .\nThe legislation unveiled Monday would scrap the individual mandate , a major pillar of Obamacare , replacing it with refundable tax credits for individuals to purchase health insurance . It would also restructure Medicaid and defund Planned Parenthood .\nThe proposal -- dubbed the `` American Health Care Act '' -- seeks to maintain Obamacare 's protections for people with pre-existing conditions , but would allow insurers to charge higher premiums to individuals whose coverage has lapsed . The bill would also keep in place the so-called `` Cadillac tax '' on employers who provide generous health insurance plans .\nAmericans are virtually split on the individual mandate , with 48 % favoring removing the requirement to obtain coverage or pay a penalty and 50 % wanting to keep it , according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday morning .\nOther aspects of Obamacare are far more popular . A broad majority , 87 % , support maintaining the law 's protections for those with pre-existing conditions , and 61 % are opposed to a replacement bill that would curb funding for the expansion of the Medicaid program .\nHere are the political obstacles Republican leaders are about to confront as they attempt to get this bill through the House and Senate .\nThe real-world ramifications of repealing Obamacare are complicated to say the least .\nBut most health care experts agree on this much : Millions of Americans are likely to lose their coverage under the new GOP plan .\nIt will be a tough pill for many Americans to swallow seven years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act . The law has been highly controversial since its inception , but the reality is that some 20 million people gained coverage as a result of it -- particularly low-income Americans .\nThe most prominent Republican has already veered off-message on this front : Trump . While Trump wants to eliminate Obamacare , the President frustrated his colleagues when he promised earlier this year that the GOP plan would offer `` insurance for everybody . ''\nTevi Troy , deputy secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush , said the GOP 's top challenge is `` meeting the expectations '' on coverage .\n`` They need to maintain coverage levels so you wo n't have large numbers of people saying , ' I was covered under Obamacare and I 'm not covered now , ' '' Troy told CNN .\nThe changes that House Republicans are proposing to make to Medicaid are not sitting well -- among some fellow Republicans .\nThirty-one states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act , extending coverage to some 11 million low-income adults . Drastically restricting that program would leave many of those people without coverage -- an outcome that has plenty of GOP governors and lawmakers on edge .\nThe plan would overhaul the whole program , which covers more than 70 million people , by sending states a fixed amount of money per enrollee , known as a per-capita cap .\nGOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski said that her party must find a `` fair and humane '' way to treat those who gained coverage through Medicaid expansion .\n`` In Alaska , we 've got 27,000 people that are now eligible for coverage that did n't have it before . Really have no place else to turn , '' Murkowski said . `` And so I 'm trying to figure out a way that treats these people in a fair and humane manner . ''\nSen. Orrin Hatch , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , said the intra-party division over Medicaid was a `` problem . ''\n`` The Democrats are n't going to help us .
