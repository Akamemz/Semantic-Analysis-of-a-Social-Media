    "content": "The defeat of measles in the United States was one of the great good news stories of the turn of the millennium . Prior to 1963 , when a vaccine was developed , the highly contagious virus led each year to 48,000 hospitalizations and 400\u2013500 deaths , mostly among small children , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . But immunization campaigns steadily eroded the disease 's reach , and by 2000 it was declared eliminated from American shores .\nToday , the U.S. is grappling with the worst measles outbreak in a quarter-century . Some 981 cases were confirmed in 26 states between January 1 and May 31\u2014a 26-fold increase from the total in 2004 . The CDC anticipates one or two fatalities per 1,000 cases , so it looks like only a matter of time before the disease again starts claiming American lives .\nThe most tragic thing about the measles resurgence is how wholly unnecessary it is . Whether out of fear , out of ignorance , out of confusion , or out of religious conviction , parents choosing not to vaccinate their kids have allowed immunization rates to drop below the 95 percent threshold required to keep the virus at bay . In October , officials reported that the number of children who have n't received vaccines for preventable diseases had quadrupled since 2001 .\nAt the very moment we succeeded in banishing a deadly affliction from our country , in other words , people began eschewing the measures that made this medical miracle possible .\nSocialism , too , is having an American renaissance . As with measles , if it 's allowed to spread , the result will be needless human suffering .\nA generation after the fall of the Soviet Union , young Americans have forgotten , if they ever learned , what happens when a citizenry allows itself be enraptured by the promise of communal ownership of a national economy ( `` Socialism Is Back , and the Kids Are Loving It , '' page 55 ) . Such regimes have failed whenever and wherever they 've been tried , engendering misery , starvation , persecution , and wasted human potential on a massive scale . At this very moment , hyperinflation and desperate shortages of food , medicine , and power are ravaging Venezuela ( `` Man-Made Disaster in Venezuela , '' page 75 ) , a previously rich country that had every intention of forging a better , smarter socialist future for the 21st century .\nThe new wave of young American socialists are quick to insist they have a different , gentler vision\u2014as the Democratic Socialists of America 's website puts it , one in which `` working people '' run things `` democratically to meet human needs , not to make profits for a few . '' But that is a hoped-for end state , not an implementable program . The concrete policies most modern socialists propose\u2014high confiscatory taxes and aggressive wealth redistribution , free college , publicly provided universal health care ( and , often , the abolition of private alternatives ) \u2014are far more likely to wreak devastation on the well-being of Americans than they are to finally achieve utopia .\nEach of these policies does violence to the market-based system of free exchange and private property rights that has underpinned the greatest expansion of human flourishing in human history . Whatever its faults , that system has brought us everything from air conditioning and aspirin to cheap flights and Netflix , all while lifting billions out of abject poverty around the world .\nIf people can not keep the fruits of their own labor , Pope Leo XIII wrote in 1891 , `` the sources of wealth themselves would run dry , for no one would have any interest in exerting his talents or his industry . '' Socialist policies , by giving government rather than individuals control over an ever-larger share of life , move us toward that eventuality . And the ensuing social collapse , like the current measles outbreak , would constitute a man-made disaster\u2014one rendered all the more infuriatingly tragic by the fact that we should know better by now .\nBut if the American left has failed to immunize its youngsters against the perils of bad ideology , the right is not faring much better . Even as America prepares to weather the coming socialist storm , a second thunderhead is forming . As Daniel McCarthy put it at First Things in March , Donald Trump 's 2016 campaign , `` whether consciously or not , drew upon what has been the clear policy alternative to the elite consensus in favor of global liberalism since the early 1990s : economic nationalism , and nationalism more generally .

'' Shortly after Trump 's inauguration , National Review 's Ramesh Ponnuru and Rich Lowry proposed `` a benign nationalism '' mostly featuring `` loyalty to one 's country '' and `` solidarity with one 's countrymen .
