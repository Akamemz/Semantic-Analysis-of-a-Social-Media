Grindler told us that he was relying on the FBI to investigate the homicide and that would include investigation of the weapons in question . We found that Grindler \u2019 s reliance on the FBI was misplaced given that it did not have the responsibility to determine whether errors in ATF \u2019 s investigation led to the weapons ending up at the murder scene or why ATF failed to take law enforcement action against Avila for nearly one year and did so only after Agent Terry \u2019 s murder .
