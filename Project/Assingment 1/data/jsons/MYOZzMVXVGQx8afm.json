    "content": "When it comes to problems in the public schools , my conservative friends are right on target with their critique . These schools often do a poor or mediocre job performing an important function . That 's because they lack competition and are funded by political priorities rather than customers . Teachers ' unions have undue sway over the entire process . They make it nearly impossible to fire even grossly incompetent teachers and that small percentage harms many students . Those same unions drive up unsustainable benefit costs .\nLike everyone else , conservatives appreciate teachers\u2014but they realize that the current taxpayer-funded system needs many reforms and more competition . There 's nothing wrong with pointing this out , which is a reality in any government-funded , union-controlled monopoly anywhere in the world .\nYet when it comes to another type of taxpayer-funded , union-controlled monopoly , conservatives lose their sense of perspective . I 'm referring , of course , to local and state police agencies . The same dynamic described above works there , too . Police agencies are bureaucratic . Unions protect the bad apples and make it nearly impossible to fire anyone\u2014even officers caught on video misbehaving or being abusive to the public . The agencies hand out unsustainable benefits and have some bizarre spending priorities ( tank-like vehicles , etc. ) . They are secretive and insular . They use asset forfeiture to grab the property of people never convicted or even accused of a crime .\nMost of us appreciate police officers , recognizing that they perform an important and tough task . But whenever there 's a questionable shooting or bill to increase accountability and expand the public 's access to police records , most conservatives instinctively side with the police . Their kneejerk defense of these agencies ( although they sometimes criticize their pensions ) defies their stated belief in limited , accountable government . Maybe it 's because of their dislike of Black Lives Matter and other leftist protesters or their fear of crime , but this is reality .
