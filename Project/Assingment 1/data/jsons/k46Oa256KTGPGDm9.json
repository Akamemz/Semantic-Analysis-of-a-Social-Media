House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-CA ) detailed this in his interview with Fox News \u2019 Laura Ingraham on Monday :\nWhat a scam\u2014Speaker Pelosi held up the vote on coronavirus funding so that her campaign team could run ads against Republicans for Super Tuesday .\nInstead of putting America first , she is putting politics first . pic.twitter.com/ws0nn0hUXP \u2014 Kevin McCarthy ( @ GOPLeader ) March 3 , 2020\nSpeaking with Fox News \u2019 Laura Ingraham on Monday night , House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said , \u201c Look how much politics they want to play . The dirty little secret . We have the coronavirus . We need to fund this . You know what Nancy Pelosi , the Speaker , did ? She withheld the bill last week . You know why ? So the DCCC could run ads against seven Republicans. \u201d Ingraham asked , \u201c How many people ran ads on the coronavirus , fundraising appeals ? \u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t know how many ran , but they actually took the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , spent money , went into these seven Republican seats to campaign against them about the coronavirus when she \u2019 s the Speaker of the House .

It \u2019 s par for the course as this virus has become another avenue from which the Left can attack this White House . The coronavirus has infected some 100,000 people and killed 3,000 . In the U.S. , around a dozen people have died . Is it tragic ? Yes . Is it worth the hysteria that has ensued ? No . Not by a long shot .

There is nothing wrong with taking common-sense precautions , but we have the governor of Washington State saying people should avoid large crowds . The NBA is telling its players to avoid high-fiving and signing autographs for fans . Most of the deaths in the U.S. are due to the virus infecting a nursing home facility in Washington , a hub where those most susceptible to being killed by the virus are cloistered .
