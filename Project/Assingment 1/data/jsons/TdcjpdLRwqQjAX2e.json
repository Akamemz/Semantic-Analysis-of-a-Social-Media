Jeb Bush is said to have taken a slight lead in New Hampshire, where the first nominating primary will be held early next year. That will likely change in the coming months as voters start to focus on the larger field of nearly a dozen potential candidates and the agendas they\u2019ll be promoting to get America back on track and back to work.\n\nBut there\u2019s also reason to believe the field will winnow out rather quickly over the ensuing year and the race will come down to three or so of the better-known and better-funded candidates in the homestretch.\n\nIn the end, this election cycle is going to be known as the year of the governors, candidates who will be touting their hands-on executive experience and a track record for running a state government and getting things done.\n\nThe American people, to their regret, experimented with the idea of putting an inexperienced, flashy orator in the White House simply on the basis of empty promises and soaring rhetoric.\n\nThe result has been the longest, weakest economic recovery since the 1930s, a mountain of deficits, debt and added taxes, unending bureaucratic scandals and a more dangerous world that threatens our national security.\n\nThere are some very promising freshmen senators who from the day they came to Washington decided they were ready to run the country, and someday they may be.
