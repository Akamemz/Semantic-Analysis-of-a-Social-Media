    "content": "In the first presidential debate of 2016 , the apprentice beat the master .\nFor years , Marco Rubio stood in Jeb Bush \u2019 s shadow . Student to teacher . Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to mentor . Rising state representative to established governor . Now the friends are rivals , essentially co-equals as they run for president .\nSooner or later , this relationship would become a focal point for the moderators of Fox \u2019 s Thursday night debate and the 24 million watching at home . One of the Floridians would have to come out on top \u2014 and it turned out to be Rubio , according to nearly al l accounts .\n\u201c Luke Skywalker beat Obi Wan-Kenobi , \u201d said Enrique \u201c Rick \u201d Yabor , a Miami lawyer and Spanish-language TV and radio commentator . \u201c Not only did Marco win that but , when you look at it the next day , you can argue Jeb lost . Here \u2019 s why : No one is talking about him . \u201d\nAfter a summer in which he lost ground to Bush , Rubio suddenly created an opportunity to close the gap between them . In a rare convergence , many elite conservative and mainstream media analysts designated Rubio as the winner of the 10-candidate debate \u2014 or at least the clear victor over Bush .\nBy almost any measure , relative to the buzz he generated , Rubio was the most efficient . He spoke for a cumulative total of just 6:22 \u2014 putting him seventh in time used . Donald Trump spoke most , for 10:30 . And Bush was in second , 8:33 . But both of them generally received far poorer reviews than Rubio .\nThe contrast between the fresh and fast Rubio vs. the phlegmatic and lackluster Bush only added to the nagging questions about Bush \u2019 s ability to be the party \u2019 s torchbearer . Jeb \u2019 s supporters say this , too , shall pass .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a Jeb supporter , and I think Jeb did what he had to do last night . But when you look at all 10 candidates as far as where they were at the beginning of the night vs. where they were when they left , Rubio did the best , \u201d said Brian Hughes , a top Florida Republican consultant . \u201c Rubio had some tough recent weeks , but his performance on the national stage could enable him to reemerge as a top-tier candidate . \u201d\nIn the short term , many expect the Florida senator will likely remain in single digits and Bush will stay in the upper tier . No one \u2019 s sure about the least-predictable candidate , front-runner Donald Trump , who spent Friday fumbling explanations about whether he \u2019 d ultimately back the party nominee and whether he was sexist \u2014 especially after sharing a tweet calling Fox \u2019 s well-respected Megyn Kelly a \u201c bimbo . \u201d\nRubio followed his solid performance with an exclamation point : a contentious CNN interview Friday that had his campaign supporters high-fiving . The topic : abortion , which the staunch social conservative Rubio would love to talk about . The issue became newsworthy during the debate when Kelly said he \u201c favor [ ed ] a rape and incest exception . \u201d\n\u201c I have never said that , \u201d Rubio responded . \u201c And I have never advocated that . What I have advocated is that we pass a law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection . \u201d\nWhat Rubio didn \u2019 t say : He sponsored a federal abortion bill that had a rape-and-incest carve-out . The following morning , CNN \u2019 s Chris Cuomo pointed this out and said \u201c it seems that you had your own record wrong . Is that something you want to correct this morning ? \u201d\nRubio disputed the characterization : \u201c I said I \u2019 ve never \u2018 advocated \u2019 for that . \u2026 I never said that I will only support a bill that has an exception in it . But I will support bills that have exceptions in it because they prevent abortions . \u201d\nSoon the two were arguing about whether life begins at conception . And that , say Rubio advisers , is gold in a GOP primary .\n\u201c That CNN interview was almost as important for us as the debate , \u201d said one Rubio adviser .\nThere was less joy in Jebville , though the Bush campaign still found plenty to brag about . In an email to donors , the campaign pointed to Bush \u2019 s high point : \u201c knocking the question about Common Core out of the park [ and ] achieving the best response in our online metrics and earning praise even from his critics . \u201d\nThe email quoted conservative host Laura Ingraham : \u201c Jeb : Good Just Now On The Educational Standards Issue. \u201d It also pointed to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus survey of early state insiders that Republicans were evenly split on the question of who won , with 30 percent of GOP respondents percent picking Rubio and 30 percent selecting Bush .\n\u201c I think the donor community is going to look at Marco \u2019 s performance last night and be reminded of how good he is , \u201d said Rick Wilson , a Florida-based GOP consultant . \u201c As for Jeb , he did not have a great night last night and you just can \u2019 t spin it . He looked nervous and he looked off-kilter , and he \u2019 s had a lot of that lately . \u201d\nFollowing Thursday \u2019 s debate , Bush \u2019 s top early state strategist , David Kochel , gamely claimed he was content with his candidate \u2019 s overall performance .\nThe contrast between the fresh and fast Rubio vs. the phlegmatic and lackluster Bush only added to the nagging questions about Bush \u2019 s ability to be the party \u2019 s torch bearer . | M. Scott Mahaskey/\u2588\u2588\u2588\nBut Bush tacitly acknowledged his limitations in his post-debate fundraising email . \u201c Look , I \u2019 m not running to be your talker-in-chief . I \u2019 m running to be commander-in-chief and to lead the greatest country in the world . Tonight , I proved that , \u201d he wrote .\nAt a New Hampshire stop Friday , Bush expressed some peevishness over the direction of the debate \u2014 his first in more than a decade . \u201c There were a lot of gotcha questions , \u201d he said . \u201c They weren \u2019 t bigger , broader questions \u2026 they were trying to create conflict inside of the 10 . \u201d\nBut the difference between the two was that Rubio , as he did at the start of the debate , parlayed conflict-driven questions he didn \u2019 t want to answer into statements about his candidacy . Judging by the applause , he inspired . Bush didn \u2019 t .\nAnd many longtime Jeb fans , friends and former employees were disappointed , particularly in Florida , where they remember the former two-term governor as the Florida GOP \u2019 s alpha dog , the center of attention and deference . For a decade , he was the tallest or smartest or most powerful man in the room \u2014 if not all three . Comfortable in his own skin , self-assured of what he believed and how he could persuade , Bush could make a convincing case by stuffing hard data in an argument packed with sound logic .\nThat man was hard to discern Thursday night , except during a brief moment where he cogently defended Common Core .\n\u201c Yesterday \u2019 s Jeb Bush was Marco Rubio last night , \u201d said one Bush backer who worked in state government under the former governor . \u201c That kills me . And it \u2019 s got ta kill Jeb . \u201d\nA number of donors \u2014 already tapped for a record $ 120 million haul by the Bush camp \u2014 were alarmed .\n\u201c Aside from Rand Paul , he was the dullest candidate on the stage last night . He \u2019 s just not good in those forums , \u201d said one Bush donor , who spoke privately about conversations taking place Friday morning among some supporters . \u201c We like him so much ; we thought he was better than he is . He may not be that good . We still believe he \u2019 ll probably be the nominee in the end , but there \u2019 s a reason Trump is getting the support \u2014 because our \u2018 front-runner \u2019 isn \u2019 t a front-runner . \u201d\nSeveral Republican operatives said that the best thing for Bush was that this was his first debate and not the last . \u201c If he performed like this in the fifth or sixth debate , I think there would be severe concern that he could actually win , \u201d said one veteran Republican consultant , who has advised presidential candidates . \u201c He needs to be more nimble on stage and be ready to improvise and not just rely on the rehearsal and talking points that he \u2019 s done in the past . \u201d\nNext week , Bush heads to Los Angeles for a speech on the threat of radical Islam at the Ronald Reagan Library , a follow-up of sorts to his first big policy-focused speech last month in Tallahassee on lobbying reform .\nBut it \u2019 s unlikely much will dramatically change at least until the next debate on Sept. 16 or until Trump shows signs of fading .
