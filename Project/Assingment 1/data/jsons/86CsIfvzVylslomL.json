''\nSen. Marco Rubio is similarly flummoxed . `` The truth is , '' he said , `` that the greatest tool to lift people ... from poverty is one that decreases child poverty by 82 percent . But it is n't a government program . It 's called marriage . Fifty years ago today , when the War on Poverty was launched , 93 percent of children in the United States were born to married parents . By 2010 , that number had plummeted to 60 percent . It should n't surprise us that 71 percent of poor families with children are families that are not headed by a married couple . ''\nConservative pundits , for their part , are falling in line , with the Washington Post \u2019 s Kathleen Parker claiming that \u201c marriage creates a tiny economy fueled by a magical concoction of love , selflessness and permanent commitment that holds spirits aloft during tough times. \u201d The New York Times \u2019 Ross Douthat takes for granted that marriage leads to economic stability , and David Brooks has simply thrown up his hands : `` It would be great if we knew how to boost marriage rates , but we do n't , '' he writes .\nSo why do n't poor women take that simple step , get married and end their poverty ? The answer , of course , is that things are not so simple , and that despite conservative ideology 's faith in it , marriage is not the cure for poverty .\nIt was the legendary sociologist William Julius Wilson who uncovered the real reason that poor women stopped marrying , when he posed the Rubio-Paul question in the 1980s . The difference is that , unlike Rubio and Paul , Wilson answered the question with research , not ideology .\nWilson began by noticing that the birth rate among poor urban teenagers was actually declining -- but that the rate of out of wedlock births among them was increasing . Fewer teens were having children , but those who did were no longer getting married . Why ?\nWilson noticed that these trends were occurring at the same time that other changes were blindsiding the cities : The first was the flight of the factories , and of good jobs for unskilled workers . The result was immediate : In 1970 , only five Chicago neighborhoods knew a rate of 15 percent unemployment or more . By 1980 , 25 neighborhoods were so afflicted .\nAs its working class became jobless , the neighborhood 's middle class -- the doctors , lawyers , store owners and so on who had served that working class -- joined the exodus . Left behind were what Wilson called `` the truly disadvantaged '' -- cut off from jobs , from interaction with a middle class , from decent schools . Gang activity and crime rates increased . In the nation 's five largest cities , the poverty population increased by a staggering 161 percent in extreme poverty areas ( those with a poverty rate of at least 40 percent ) . Poverty had not just increased , it was now concentrated and segregated .\nIn these neighborhoods -- lacking good schools , a middle class or jobs for unskilled workers , neighborhoods where so many young men died or were incarcerated -- the `` male marriageable pool index , '' the percentage of young men able to support a family , declined sharply . So did marriage rates .\nWilson 's discoveries have been reinforced by a substantial body of subsequent research . For example , a new study by a Harvard team featuring Emmanuel Saez ( a discoverer of the 1 percent 's recent engorgement ) and recent MacArthur `` genius '' grant winner Raj Chetty finds that segregation of the poor from good jobs , schools and neighborhoods remains one of the biggest impediments to upward mobility .\nWilson 's discovery that marriage is no panacea for poor women has also been reaffirmed by recent research .

In fact , however , the pool of potential marriage partners for single mothers in impoverished communities does not include many men with good prospects for becoming stable and helpful partners . '' In fact , a national study of more than 7,000 women found that 64 percent of single mothers who married were divorced by the time they reached 35-44 .
