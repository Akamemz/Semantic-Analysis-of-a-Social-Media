President-elect Donald Trump has not released tax documents, so the best clues about his privately held business interests come from a financial disclosure form he released in May.\n\nThe document covers scores of pages with small type, and suggests he is financially involved with hundreds of companies, including some that simply license his name.\n\nA sort through that disclosure form, submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, shows his largest sources of revenue are golf courses and office-tower rents. But his interests are far flung, and include media, retail, entertainment and much more.\n\nThose business interests are affected by government agencies and policies. Below is an overview of some of his business assets and operations (excluding debts) and the possible areas where conflicts may arise.\n\nTrump himself noted that there are ethical concerns about his dealings. He said in tweets that he would hold a \"major news conference\" on Dec. 15 with his children to address the issue. (Editor's note: The press conference was later canceled, just days before it was meant to take place, and rescheduled for January.)\n\n\"While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,\" Trump tweeted. He said \"legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations.\"\n\nBut at this time, he has not explained his plans.\n\nNOTE: All companies, locations and revenues listed below are as reported by the Trump Organization in his Office of Government Ethics filing. Revenues shown are for January 2015 through May 15, 2016. In most cases, the company reported revenues; in some, only ranges. We are excluding sources of investment income unrelated to Donald Trump's businesses or employment. We are including only revenue-generating assets and activities that discernibly fall into the categories below, based on the description reported on the form.\n\nInternational / Golf Courses / Hotels / Real Estate / Entertainment / Food And Beverage / Retail / Aircraft\n\nInternational\n\nTrump has business interests in at least 20 countries, primarily India, the Philippines and Indonesia and other developing nations.
