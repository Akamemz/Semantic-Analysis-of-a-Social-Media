At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus .

Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there \u2019 s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here .

It is about Yemen , of course , but it is also about the role of Congress .

The US helps the Saudi-led coalition , which also includes the United Arab Emirates and several other Gulf Arab and African countries , by providing them with intelligence , selling them arms and ammunition , and , until late last year , fueling warplanes . That means the US is partially culpable for the death and destruction\u2026 \u201c [ The resolution ] was a clear rebuke of Trump \u2019 s foreign policy toward Saudi Arabia\u2026 the result of progressive antiwar activism and a rare bipartisan coalition of progressive and conservative lawmakers to claw back war-approving authority from the president. \u201d Tara Golshan , Vox\n\u201c Successive White Houses have pledged to deeply reform America \u2019 s war on terror ; it 's the follow-through that \u2019 s underwhelmed . With Bernie Sanders and a resurgent left running strong in the Democratic primary , the president risks having the antiwar vote , such as it is , stolen out from underneath him\u2026 the strong-arming of Assange combined with Tuesday \u2019 s rare veto have some asking what exactly they voted for . \u201d\n\u201c Trump could have issued a much overdue correction by fully removing the U.S. from a conflict it had no business being involved with from the beginning . This is a man , after all , who campaigned on extricating the U.S. from endless wars with no strategic purpose . Signing the War Powers Resolution Tuesday would have been a win-win-win situation : a win for the president , for the country , and for the Yemeni people . \u201d\n\u201c The administration very much wants to have things both ways\u2026 Supporters of the war are desperate to claim at the same time that U.S. involvement is so meager that it doesn \u2019 t amount to hostilities but also so vitally important that it must not be ended\u2026 if the U.S. role were really as small as they sometimes claim , there would be no danger in ending it , and if it is as significant as they say at other times it is absolutely appropriate for Congress to shut it down because Congress never authorized it . \u201d\nSome argue that `` a declaration of war requires an affirmative act of Congress . A bipartisan majority \u2019 s rejection of American participation in the Yemeni conflict is anything but an affirmation .

It has destroyed not just schools but school buses , and prevented the delivery of humanitarian aid\u2026 it \u2019 s easy to see why members of Congress would want to end U.S. support for the Saudis \u2019 war in Yemen . Nonetheless , this approach is short-sighted . To focus solely on Saudi Arabia \u2019 s role in the Yemen conflict is to give Iran a pass for making it worse \u2014 by , for example , giving its Houthi clients missiles capable of reaching Riyadh . If the Houthis prevail , then Iran will have access to a port in the Red Sea , from which it can make more mischief in the Middle East\u2026\n\u201c It \u2019 s not only possible but necessary to criticize the Saudis and their depravities , while still recognizing that it \u2019 s better for the U.S. if they prevail in Yemen and help to contain Iran . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war .
