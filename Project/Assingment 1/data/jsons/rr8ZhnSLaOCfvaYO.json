But the Obama administration had insisted those targets be non binding , allowing the pact to avoid the Senate ratification requirement that doomed U.S. support for the 1997 Kyoto climate agreement .\nRegardless of the fate of the Paris agreement , Trump has already moved to shelve the entirety of Obama \u2019 s domestic climate agenda , ensuring that the U.S. will most likely miss Obama \u2019 s targets .",
