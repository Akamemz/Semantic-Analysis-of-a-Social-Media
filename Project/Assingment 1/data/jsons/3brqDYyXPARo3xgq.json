It comforts the persuaded while alienating the persuadable. \u201d David Leonhardt , New York Times\n\u201c His campaign really should be having an internal debate at this point about what can possibly be gained by railing against the elites of a party that he looks to be on the verge of conquering and which made a number of changes to its nominating system after 2016 at his express request . Remember : They might be the establishment in a few months . \u201d David Faris , The Week\nYet \u201c Unity is nowhere in sight . Sanders \u2019 s Friday tweet \u2014 \u2018 I \u2019 ve got news for the Republican establishment . I \u2019 ve got news for the Democratic establishment . They can \u2019 t stop us \u2019 \u2014 showed he \u2019 s in no mood to pull this fractured party together . This breach of party solidarity alarmed down-ticket Democrats hoping to keep control of the House and win the Senate \u2014 and must have delighted Trump , whose Saturday night tweet announced how he \u2019 ll exploit the opposition \u2019 s fractiousness , no matter what \u2019 s next . He congratulated \u2018 Crazy Bernie \u2019 on his Nevada victory , adding , \u2018 Don \u2019 t let them take it away from you ! \u2019 \u201d E.J . Dionne Jr. , Washington Post\n\u201c [ Mainstream Democrats ] worry at times that Sanders would simply prove too extreme to get things done as president . And , indeed , on occasion his campaign lapses into rhetoric that suggests an unreasonable aversion to compromise . But it \u2019 s worth remembering that Sanders is a 30-year veteran of the US Congress\u2026 \u201c Sanders has sometimes staked out lonely , courageous stands ( against the Iraq War or the Defense of Marriage Act , which barred same-sex couples from enjoying the same federal benefits as married couples ) \u2026 But he \u2019 s never pulled a Freedom Caucus-type stunt\u2026 He voted for President Barack Obama \u2019 s Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program reauthorization bill in 2009 , and again for the Affordable Care Act in 2010 . He voted for the Dodd-Frank bill and every other contentious piece of Obama-era legislation\u2026 there \u2019 s no reason to be worried that Sanders is a deluded radical who doesn \u2019 t understand how the government works. \u201d Matthew Yglesias , Vox\n\u201c What Bloomberg and his apologists fail to understand is that challenging political power brokers has significant appeal among grassroots Democrats and independents . Notably , in Nevada , of the 17 percent of caucus-goers who identified as independents , Sanders won 50 percent . The next-closest contender , Buttigieg , was at 13 percent , and no one else was in double digits\u2026 an antiestablishment message is electable . \u201d John Nichols , The Nation\n\u201c The New Deal was made possible with a new electorate . And just as the mass entry into politics of first- and second-generation Eastern European immigrants brought Roosevelt ( and the CIO ) to power , Latinos \u2014 who are solidly behind Sanders \u2014 could very well be the force that helps bring social democracy to America . Bernie \u2019 s staunch anti-establishment outsider appeal and his platform focused on workers \u2019 issues is winning non-partisans , new voters , young voters , and working-class immigrants . That \u2019 s not just a savvy coalition for winning the Nevada caucuses , it \u2019 s how Bernie Sanders becomes president . Face it , establishment Democrats \u2014 it \u2019 s his party now . \u201d Dustin Guastella and Connor Kilpatrick , Jacobin Magazine\n\u201c Sanders \u2019 Nevada victory definitively disproved one of the most enduring myths about his campaign : that it could attract left-leaning young white people , but was incapable of drawing in a diverse coalition . In fact , voters of color were a primary source of Sanders \u2019 strength in Nevada ; he received the majority of Latino votes . Entrance polls showed Sanders winning \u2018 men and women , whites and Latinos , voters 17-29 , 30-44 and 45-65 , those with college degrees and those without , liberal Democrats ( by a lot ) and moderate/conservatives ( narrowly ) , union and non-union households. \u2019 The poisonous concept of the white \u2018 Bernie Bro \u2019 as the \u2018 typical \u2019 Sanders supporter should be dead. \u201d Nathan Robinson , The Guardian\nThe right sees Sanders as the clear frontrunner and predicts negative consequences if the Democratic establishment denies him the nomination .\nThe right sees Sanders as the clear frontrunner and predicts negative consequences if the Democratic establishment denies him the nomination .\n\u201c Democrats are now one step closer to having an avowed socialist at the top of their ticket . At a time when unemployment is at a 50-year low , they \u2019 ll be running against a capitalist system that is responsible for spreading more freedom , ending more hunger , and lifting more people out of poverty than any other system in world history . If the time is ripe for Sanders \u2019 s socialist revolution , most American voters don \u2019 t know it yet\u2026 people in the United States currently have record-high confidence in their personal finances\u2026\n\u201c So great are the blessings of capitalism that it enabled Sanders to join the ranks of the top 1 % by having established himself as the country \u2019 s most famous socialist .

Democrats \u2019 chances of winning the Senate and holding the House would be solid ( assuming neither chamber changes hands sooner ) .

And all of this follows exactly what the center-left \u2019 s self-understanding is meant to be predicated upon : the belief that extreme views can \u2019 t win ( Sanders ) or will fail when turned into policy ( Trump ) .
