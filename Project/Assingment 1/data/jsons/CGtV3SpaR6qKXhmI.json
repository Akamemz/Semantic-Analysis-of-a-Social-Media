It is also testimony to the errors of Marxism, which maintained that workers would ultimately fight against and prevail over their capitalist bosses.\n\nFor today American labor unions are on the ropes, and the once-communist countries of eastern Europe and much of Asia are immersed in capitalist planning. Instead of working classes coming together on Labor Day, as Marxist strategists predicted, their counterparts (corporate workers, small business employees, self-employed consultants, professional people in general or what Marxism would dub the bourgeoisie) are coming together throughout the world. And not just today, but on any given day of the year.
