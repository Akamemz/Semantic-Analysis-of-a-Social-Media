    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs suspended a program that sent teams of doctors and monitors to try to improve its worst-performing facilities for approximately two years , according to a published report .\nThe Wall Street Journal , citing agency doctors and internal records , reported that the visits were `` paused '' beginning in early 2011 . Dr. Carolyn Clancy , the head of the agency 's quality and safety program , said the VA had begun to revive the program about a year ago .\nThe Journal report specifies seven VA hospitals that have consistently received a rating of one star out of a possible five from the VA since at least 2011 . Those hospitals are located in Augusta , Ga. ; Little Rock , Ark . ; Providence , R.I. ; Murfreesboro , Tenn. ; Oklahoma City ; Phoenix ; and Puget Sound ( Seattle ) , Wash . The star rating system measures hospitals according to key performance standards , including death rates among acute-care patients and among patients suffering from congestive heart failure and pneumonia . Length of stays and readmission rates are also taken into consideration .\nIt is not clear why the agency halted the visits , though the Journal report cites current and former VA doctors who claim that top managers of the agency played down the utility of basing the ratings system on specific medical outcomes .\nDr. Clancy claimed to the Journal that each of the hospitals with the poorest rating `` has gotten at least one visit in the last year or year and a half . ''\nThe report comes as a government report released Monday found that more than 57,000 veterans have been waiting 90 days or more for their first VA medical appointments , and an additional 64,000 appear to have never gotten appointments at all after enrolling .\n`` This behavior runs counter to our core values , '' the report said . `` The overarching environment and culture which allowed this state of practice to take root must be confronted head-on . ''\nRichard Griffin , the VA 's acting inspector general , said his office was investigating 69 VA medical facilities nationwide for possible wrongdoing , up from 42 two weeks ago . The investigations could result in criminal charges , which Griffin said may be needed to combat senior VA leaders who have allowed and even encouraged fraudulent scheduling practices often referred to as `` gaming '' the system .\n`` Once someone loses his job or gets criminally charged for doing this , it will no longer be a game . And that will be the shot heard around the system , '' Griffin said Monday night at a hearing of the House Veterans Affairs Committee .\nActing VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said earlier Monday that VA officials have contacted 50,000 veterans across the country to get them off waiting lists and into clinics and are in the process of contacting 40,000 more .\nThe controversy forced VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign May 30 . Shinseki took the blame for what he decried as a `` lack of integrity '' through the network . Legislation is being written in both the House and Senate to allow more veterans who ca n't get timely VA appointments to see doctors listed as providers under Medicare or the military 's TRICARE program .

The 2011 decision by senior VA officials to set the target , and then base bonuses on meeting it , was `` an organizational leadership failure , '' the report said .\nA previous inspector general 's investigation into the troubled Phoenix VA Health Care System found that about 1,700 veterans in need of care were `` at risk of being lost or forgotten '' after being kept off an official , electronic waiting list .\nThe report issued Monday offers a broader picture of the overall system .
