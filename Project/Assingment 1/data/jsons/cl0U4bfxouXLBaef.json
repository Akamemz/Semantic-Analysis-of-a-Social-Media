But emphasizing the \u201c pluribus \u201d while ignoring the \u201c unum , \u201d he says , is a sure way to tear at the country \u2019 s social fabric .\n\u201c We need to seek to find common ground and celebrate our unity , \u201d says Mr. Mazzella . \u201c When I was growing up , we disagreed about everything , but in the end you were an American first and everything else second , \u201d he says , noting that a statement like that could bring on a charge of bigotry .\nThere has long been a bipartisan consensus in the U.S that openness to different kinds of cultures is \u201c essential to who we are as a nation , \u201d according to Pew Research Center . In its 2018 survey , nearly 6 in 10 Americans expressed a positive view of the country \u2019 s racial and ethnic diversity , saying it makes the country a better place to live . Only 9 % said it made it worse . But last year , a growing number of people in both the U.S. and Europe began to express reservations , according to Pew .\n\u201c To just say diversity , pluralism will make us stronger is to say separating the strands of a rope will add to its strength , \u201d says Mr. Mazzella , now chief operating officer and editorial director of Information Strategies .\nDonald Mazzella , onetime publisher of Essence magazine , thinks something has been lost in America \u2019 s motto , \u201c e pluribus unum , \u201d or \u201c out of many , one . \u201d\nJonette and Ken Christian have become a bit uneasy with the emphasis people place on the idea of diversity .\nIt \u2019 s a fraught subject to criticize , they say . As liberal Democrats living in Holden , Maine , they \u2019 ve sometimes been frustrated that even raising concerns about the scope of immigration policy , say , is often met with charges of xenophobia or , even worse , racism .\n\u201c It seems that we \u2019 ve been so pummeled with the \u2018 inclusivity \u2019 narrative , we can \u2019 t set any limits on diversity , or defend our own values , \u201d says Mrs. Christian , who last month retired after decades as a child and family therapist . \u201c Of course we have the values of America as an open , generous , inclusive , and diverse nation . But anyone questioning how diverse , or how open , or how generous , is looked at with suspicion \u2014 or as a heretic . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s exasperating , she feels , especially since their family has a decidedly international flavor . She chatters in Spanish with her sisters-in-law , one from Honduras and the other from Mexico . Her brother-in-law is from Poland , and her niece is Japanese .\n\u201c But diversity in isolation , without universally agreed upon and unifying values such as individual rights , freedom of speech , religion , and the press , risks deteriorating into tribalism and factions , \u201d says her husband , a retired emergency room physician who works part time at an opiate addiction treatment clinic .\nEven aside from legitimate policy disputes and the rough and tumble political process , the fundamental idea of diversity , they say , has become nearly impossible to critique in this era of toxic polarization , in which they feel only those on the furthest political extremes have a say .\n\u201c Not all diversity deserves celebration , \u201d continues Dr. Christian , who notes he \u2019 s voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election from George McGovern to Hillary Clinton . \u201c We obviously should not celebrate the presence of neo-Nazis , those who practice female genital mutilation , homophobes , terrorists , etc . And while diversity can enrich our culture , there can be too much of a good thing . Sheer numbers can inspire fear and misunderstanding . \u201d\nStill , there has long been a general bipartisan consensus in the United States that openness to different kinds of people and different kinds of cultures is \u201c essential to who we are as a nation , \u201d according to Pew Research Center . In its 2018 survey , nearly 6 in 10 Americans expressed a positive view of the country \u2019 s fast-growing racial and ethnic diversity , saying it makes the country a better place to live . Only 9 % said it made it a worse place to live .\nBut last year , a growing number of people in both the U.S. and Europe began to express reservations , according to Pew . Most of the spike in the U.S. last year has come from Republican-leaning voters , the survey found , as well as older generations , but some Democrats and liberals have similar worries .\nIt \u2019 s been even more pronounced in countries such as Sweden , the United Kingdom , and Spain , where only about a third of their populations describe their growing diversity in positive terms . In countries such as Greece and Italy , solid majorities now describe such growth as making their countries a worse place to live .\n\u201c Diversity really can be a challenge , and people actually find it very difficult , \u201d says Sally Scholz , professor and chair of the philosophy department at Villanova University in Pennsylvania .\n\u201c But I think part of what the call for diversity and the valuing of pluralism in our culture is , is a call for recognition , \u201d continues Dr. Scholz , who studies political solidarity and coalitions of those with diverse cultural and ideological perspectives . \u201c And recognition is really fundamental to other liberal values , like freedom , like equality . If we can \u2019 t be equal , if we \u2019 re not recognized as equal , we can \u2019 t be recognized as rights holders . \u201d\nMany who want to tap the brakes on diversity in the U.S. point to the nation \u2019 s seeming growing unrest , including acts of violence in places of worship , or the attacks on Hasidic Jews in New York over the holidays .\nAnd with the U.S. in what seems to be a perfect storm of political polarization \u2013 including the challenges of algorithm-driven news feeds that foster myopic echo chambers \u2013 more people say they are starting to see the idea of diversity as one of the possible causes of the country \u2019 s dysfunction .\nDonald Mazzella thinks something has been lost in America \u2019 s motto , \u201c e pluribus unum , \u201d or \u201c out of many , one. \u201d A longtime media professional , he recalls his years as a publisher at Essence magazine , when the New Jersey native got a lot of smiles when he called everyone \u201c paisan . \u201d\n\u201c To just say diversity , pluralism will make us stronger is to say separating the strands of a rope will add to its strength , \u201d says Mr. Mazzella , now the chief operating officer and editorial director of Information Strategies , a business consultancy in New Jersey .\n\u201c No , we need to seek to find common ground and celebrate our unity , \u201d he says . \u201c When I was growing up , we disagreed about everything , but in the end you were an American first and everything else second , \u201d he says , noting that even a statement like that could bring a charge of bigotry .\nWhich is of course a thing , Mr. Mazzella says .

The human species , with its unusually long gestation and child-rearing periods , develops especially close interpersonal bonds . These begin at the family level and then extend to other closely-clustered groups , fostering an instinctive group altruism and willingness to sacrifice for others within groups .\nEven at six months , however , infants have an instinct to fear those they do not recognize , observers note , and there is a tendency to be wary of outsiders . In his book \u201c The Righteous Mind : Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion , \u201d the moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt explains how humans are not necessarily predisposed to valuing diversity and pluralism , since they make instinctive decisions about social life in a tenth of a second .\n\u201c Which is long before our reasoning portion of our brain \u2013 which may want to put our prejudgments aside and \u2018 listen to alternate sides \u2019 \u2013 can become engaged , \u201d says the Rev . Gregory Love , professor of Christian theology at the University of Redlands in California .\nNevertheless , humans do have the intellectual and even spiritual capacity to universalize the group instincts for altruism and direct them to all of humanity , scholars say .\n\u201c In their histories , the world \u2019 s religions have shown quite a mixed effect on this issue , \u201d says Dr. Love . \u201c We are to love all humanity , and consider all persons human , as we are . \u201d\n\u201c All the world religions , however , also display that deep human sentiment of rejecting difference , and privileging one \u2019 s group over others , \u201d continues Dr. Love . \u201c Frequently , religion has deepened the problem . \u201d\nSimilarly , the secular universalism at the heart of liberal democratic theory has also had mixed effects , some scholars say .\n\u201c I do believe that there is a thing called a culture , and certainly in a culture within a political sphere , \u201d says Charlie Copeland , president of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute , which promotes conservative values on college campuses . \u201c If the populace writ large does not share a certain set of components , it \u2019 s just hard to govern . \u201d\nMr. Copeland and others express concern that the \u201c identity politics \u201d of the left often dismisses the idea of foundational principles , focusing instead on their failures and hypocrisies , which he doesn \u2019 t deny are real .\n\u201c But sometimes you also need to hold up the examples of other countries across the globe and go , you know what ? Compared to how those citizens are allowed to live , we \u2019 ve done more right than wrong , and certainly more right when it comes to human flourishing than any other country in the world or in the history of the world , \u201d he says .\nPeople like Dr. and Mrs. Christian feel that the emphasis on identity politics and a focus on the nation \u2019 s obvious flaws misses the bigger picture .\n\u201c Expressing pride in America today is often met with endless reminders of our historic failures and hypocrisies , \u201d says Mrs. Christian , seeing a series of \u201c shamings and scoldings \u201d or accusations of \u201c privileging Western civilization. \u201d \u201c Yes , we did make some grievous mistakes , but we have also been more willing than almost any other country to tell the truth about our mistakes and make amends . \u201d\nIn many ways , with such a wide bipartisan consensus on the value of diversity , some of the debate is more a matter of emphasis and the scope of diversity .\n\u201c Political solidarity actually allows for , and really centralizes , diversity and pluralism , \u201d says Dr. Scholz . \u201c Because each of us is coming to our commitment in our own individual way , we \u2019 re able to see different facets of a problem , and we \u2019 re trying to address it together . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
