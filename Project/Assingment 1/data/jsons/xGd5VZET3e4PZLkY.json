It \u2019 s correct that many of our NATO allies aren \u2019 t paying their agreed-upon share of its costs \u2014 but what happens to the United States \u2019 overseas bases if we \u201c walk ? \u201d\nWhile trumpeting America \u2019 s role in winning World War II and the Cold War , Mr. Trump simultaneously pronounced that \u201c America First , \u201d the 1930s isolationist theme that he quoted without attribution , \u201c will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. \u201d He did not bother to square that with his vow not to \u201c hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. \u201d He condemned \u201c nation building , \u201d but said he aims to build \u201c regional stability , \u201d without explaining the difference .\nMr. Trump decried a shrinking American military and the deterioration of the nuclear arsenal . But he did not say how he would further build up the military \u2014 which has a budget this year of nearly $ 600 billion \u2014 while cutting government spending , which he also wants to do . And he seems to be ignorant of the sweeping $ 1 trillion effort to revitalize the nuclear force that is already underway .\nMr. Trump repeatedly states outright falsehoods , often based on wrong assumptions . He \u2019 s been refuted before on his claim that the Islamic State is making \u201c millions of dollars a week \u201d by selling Libyan oil . There is zero evidence of that .
