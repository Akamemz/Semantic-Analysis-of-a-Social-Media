Questions about when there will be interviews , or when she will make herself available to questions from reporters , are deflected with something along the lines of : all in good time .\nNow , this is n't to say the candidate has n't answered any questions . She 's answered plenty .

Questions about when there will be interviews, or when she will make herself available to questions from reporters, are deflected with something along the lines of: all in good time.\n\nNow, this isn't to say the candidate hasn't answered any questions. She's answered plenty. But they've been generally friendly questions on comfortable topics from people invited to participate in roundtable discussions with her.\n\nHer campaign spokesman, Nick Merrill, responds in an email:\n\nThe focus of our ramp-up period is to hear from voters about the issues they care about. She's enjoyed engaging in hours of public question and answers sessions and, as the campaign progresses, looks forward to more engagement with voters and the press as well.\n\nUntil then, here are the 13 reporter questions Clinton has answered:\n\n1. Strategy in Iowa\n\nNBC's Kristen Welker caught up with Clinton outside her very first campaign stop at an Iowa coffee shop:\n\n\"You lost Iowa in 2008. How do you win this time? What's your strategy?\" Welker asked.\n\nClinton's reply, as she walked toward an open van door: \"I'm having a great time. Can't look forward any more than I am.\"\n\n2.

More liking Iowa, and lessons learned\n\nClinton answered three other questions from reporters at the community college in Iowa.\n\nOne was, \"Is it good to be back out here again?\"\n\nHer response was: \"Welcome. It is, it's fabulous. We're having the best time.\"\n\nShe was also asked what she learned during her visit, to which she responded, in part: \"So much good information, so much great exchange about what works, what can work not just here in Iowa, but I think across the country.\"\n\nShe was also asked a question not caught in recordings of the event, and in response spoke about the start of the campaign and her visit to Iowa. \"We're off and running, and I had a great drive across the country.

The answers weren't substantive.\n\nAccording to the Post, she said, \"We do have a plan. We have a plan for my plan.\"\n\n9. Importance of Iowa\n\nBrent Roske, the host of the Iowa television show Roske on Politics, worked his sources to figure out where the candidate would be.\n\n\"I found myself basically the sixth car in the motorcade pulling into Mount Vernon, Iowa,\" he said.\n\nHe was in the right place at the right time and was able to ask a question.\n\n\"Secretary Clinton, what do you think the importance of the Iowa caucus will be in the upcoming election?\" Roske asked.\n\nClinton answered: \"I think it's important because it's the first contest and I look forward to getting prepared for it next February.\"\n\nRoske admits it was a softball question.
