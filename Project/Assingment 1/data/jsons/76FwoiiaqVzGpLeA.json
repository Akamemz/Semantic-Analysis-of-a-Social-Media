Who is the guy who imagines that Donald Trump really believes that the roly-poly mass murderer had nothing to do with the murder of Otto Warmbier ? But if you listen to the elite and their panting puppy media , you would get the distinct impression that Donald Trump actually considers this clown a pal .\nThis raises an important question \u2013 is the elite itself transcendently dumb , or does it imagine us Normal people are so unfathomably dense as to be unable to conceive that maybe Donald Trump \u2019 s flattery of a sketchy guy who has nuclear weapons hanging over the heads of 28,000 Americans ( not to mention over the noggins of tens of millions of our South Korean and Japanese allies ) might not have been totally sincere ? Could it be that , perhaps \u2013 and I \u2019 m just speculating here \u2013 that maybe a successful New York real estate developer , who these very same geniuses have been screeching about being a liar for nearly four years , might not be totally honest about his true feelings toward the pudgy freak he is negotiating with ?\nMight not that be it ? Nah . He \u2019 s got ta love KJU . Yeah , that \u2019 s the ticket .\nEither the elite is stupid , or it thinks we \u2019 re stupid .\nCall it the \u201c New Obtuseness , \u201d this willful refusal to attribute to a statement , position , or policy the most obvious and manifest intent and , instead , to deliberately fold , spindle , and mutilate it into something unreasonable , unlikely , and unrecognizable that nevertheless conforms to the liberal elite narrative .\nThe New Obtuseness is a tool to shut us up by removing the possibility of rational discussion , and thereby allow the ruling class narrative to exist unchallenged . You can not debate something if the other side consciously refuses to recognize your argument . Of course , eliminating rational debate is only a short-term solution to the elite \u2019 s problem , its problem being that its own manifest greed , power lust and incompetence has made us Normals hate it with a seething fury . In the long-term , that righteous fury will eventually explode \u2013 as I predict in my non-fiction book Militant Normals as well as my visionary novels People \u2019 s Republic , Indian Country and Wildfire \u2013 but that \u2019 s not the point here ( I \u2019 ve made it many times before ) . The point is how they try to silence us , and they all do it . Liberals do it , its slobberingly submissive media minions do it , and the Fredocons do it .\nThe New Obtuseness is everywhere , but Trump is its biggest target . And not only in the context of North Korea \u2013\u2013 in everything . How about Russians ? Could Donald Trump \u2019 s refusal to say nasty things in front of Putin be an indicator that he \u2019 s Putin \u2019 s puppet , or perhaps\u2026just maybe\u2026 that insulting the guy beside you at a Helsinki press conference might not be the best way to make diplomatic progress ?\nOf course , the questions directed at Trump at these conferences are intended to do just that \u2013 to make a scene . So , when Trump refuses to play along and take up the media \u2019 s agenda \u2013 let \u2019 s create an uncomfortable rift right there live on camera ! \u2013 instead of pursuing Trump \u2019 s own agenda \u2013 let \u2019 s make diplomatic progress \u2013 the New Obtuseness demands that Trump \u2019 s obvious refusal to play along be construed as siding with the dictators .\nLet \u2019 s be clear \u2013 Donald Trump has no moral obligation to torpedo the slow but steady and real progress he has made with North Korea towards avoiding a war that would send tens of thousands of American soldiers home in boxes simply because the media wants a gotcha moment on camera . Diplomacy is not pretty , and it must pain the Warmbier family , but there are tens of thousands of American lives at stake and if Trump is willing to swallow hard and say what he must to save them , then God bless him for it .\nThe New Obtuseness is not actually that new . We \u2019 ve seen it from Day One of the Trump campaign , when he came down that escalator and dared to speak heretical truths about illegal aliens . He stated the facts \u2013 our open borders let in hordes of illegal alien criminals who push drugs , rape people and kill American citizens . He did not say all illegal aliens are violent criminals ( though all of them are criminals , it being a crime to be here illegally ) , and no fair or reasonable interpretation of his remarks could come to that conclusion . But the New Obtuseness is not about being fair or reasonable . It is about creating and nurturing a bogus spin in the service of the liberal elite \u2019 s narrative .\nHere \u2019 s the thought process : \u201c Trump dared to point out obvious truths about the flood of illegal immigration that we whole-heartedly support as a means to replace the unruly American electorate , so let \u2019 s frame those truths as racist by misrepresenting his statement and then people will pay attention to that and not to the truths we can not allow to be spoken ! \u201d\nDonald Trump is only the most prominent victim of this rhetorical scam ; all conservatives out there in the arena get it too . Take Candace Owens , the young , black conservative activist who has upset so many people by being popular and effective . Envy is an ugly look , even within the conservative tent .
