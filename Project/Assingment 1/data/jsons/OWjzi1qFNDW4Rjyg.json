    "content": "Amid renewed hope Sunday that a summit next month between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will actually happen , South Korea \u2019 s president said that Mr. Kim committed over the weekend to a denuclearization of the peninsula and said he wants to work toward peace .\nA U.S. delegation arrived in North Korea on Sunday as preparations for the talks continue . Mr. Trump announced last week he was ending them over North Korean hostilities but now says negotiations have picked back up and he spoke Sunday as if the summit was a \u201c go . \u201d\n\u201c Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong-un and myself . I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day . Kim Jong-un agrees with me on this . It will happen ! \u201d Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon .\nU.S. lawmakers said that while renewed discussions about the Trump-Kim summit are a positive step , the U.S. can \u2019 t give away too much and should be wary of any supposed commitments coming from Mr. Kim .\nBut South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Sunday that the reclusive North Korean leader is indeed committed to a full denuclearization of the peninsula , after the two leaders gathered in an impromptu meeting Saturday in hopes of jump-starting diplomatic talks once more .\nMr . Moon told reporters Sunday that Mr. Kim at a meeting at the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas \u201c again made clear his commitment to a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. \u201d According to Mr . Moon , the North Korean leader said he \u2019 s willing to cooperate to end confrontation and work toward peace for the sake of a successful North Korea-U.S. summit .\nMr . Moon said he told Mr. Kim in return that Mr. Trump has a \u201c firm resolve \u201d to end hostile relations with North Korea and initiate economic cooperation if Pyongyang implements \u201c complete denuclearization . \u201d\nAccording to the State Department , the U.S. team met with North Korean officials at the same DMZ site , the village of Panmunjom . The U.S. delegation reportedly included Sung Kim , U.S. ambassador to the Philippines and a former U.S. special representative for North Korea policy .\n\u201c We \u2019 re looking at June 12 in Singapore . That hasn \u2019 t changed , \u201d Mr. Trump told reporters earlier the weekend .\nMr. Trump called off the summit Thursday following threats of nuclear war from North Korea , only to give fresh hope Friday that negotiations to stage the summit were in the works .\n\u201c I think people want to see if we can get the meeting and get something done , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c We get that done and we can be successful in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula , that would be a great thing for North Korea , it would be a great thing for South Korea , it would be great for Japan , it would be great for the world , it would be great for the United States , it would be great for China . \u201d\nBut Mr . Moon also made clear that any steps to dial back Mr. Kim \u2019 s nuclear capabilities could come with strings attached .\n\u201c What Kim is unclear about is that he has concerns about whether his country can surely trust the United States over its promise to end hostile relations ( with North Korea ) and provide a security guarantee if they do denuclearization , \u201d Mr . Moon said .\nThe North has previously used the term \u201c denuclearization \u201d to demand the United States pull out its 28,500 troops in South Korea and withdraw its so-called \u201c nuclear umbrella \u201d security commitment to South Korea and Japan . The North hasn \u2019 t specified those demands during Mr. Kim \u2019 s sudden outreach to Seoul and Washington in recent months .\nMr . Moon has insisted Mr. Kim can be persuaded to abandon his nuclear facilities , materials and bombs in a verifiable and irreversible way in exchange for credible security and economic guarantees . Mr . Moon said Sunday that the North \u2019 s disarmament could be still be a difficult process even if Pyongyang , Washington and Seoul don \u2019 t differ over what \u201c complete denuclearization \u201d of the peninsula means .\nMembers of Congress said the devil , as is always the case with North Korea , will be in the details .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got the South Korean president , I believe , providing a great benefit in this discussion , unless we are not all communicating in the same way , \u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt , Missouri Republican , on \u201c Fox News Sunday . \u201d\n\u201c You know , what does denuclearization mean ? What do they expect to see happen ? And I think these talks can produce results . But we need results and they need to be very visible before the United States creates any benefits , \u201d he said .\nSen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , said he \u2019 s skeptical that Mr. Kim will agree to completely give up his country \u2019 s nuclear capabilities , saying the leader has an almost emotional attachment to them and that they make him feel prestigious and powerful .\n\u201c Ultimately , I remain convinced that he does not want to denuclearize \u2014 in fact , he will not denuclearize . But he wants to give off this perception that he \u2019 s this open leader , that he \u2019 s peaceful , that he \u2019 s reasonable , \u201d Mr. Rubio said on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week . \u201d\nSen. Chris Coons , Delaware Democrat , said even offering North Korea a summit with the U.S. president is a significant concession , while also saying it \u2019 s important that North Korea has freed several Americans the country was holding as a confidence-building measure .\n\u201c But let \u2019 s be clear \u2014 twice before North Korea under Kim Jong-un \u2019 s father committed to full denuclearization in six party talks in 2005 , in 2007 \u2026 only to then change their tune , \u201d Mr. Coons said on \u201c Fox News Sunday . \u201d\n\u201c So we \u2019 re going to have to be very focused , very engaged , \u201d Mr. Coons said . \u201c I am hopeful that Secretary [ of State Mike ] Pompeo will brief and engage Congress .
