    "content": "Of the four special elections held to replace Republican Congressmen who have departed Capitol Hill to join the Trump administration , GA-06 was Democrats ' best shot at victory , and they knew it . First , they won a 'moral victory ' by over-performing in Mike Pompeo 's old Kansas district , but still lost . Next , they won another 'moral victory ' by ( arguably ) over-performing in Ryan Zinke 's old Montana district , but still lost . Then they surprised everyone with yet another 'moral victory ' by unexpectedly over-performing in Mick Mulvaney 's old South Carolina district ( more below ) but still lost . Georgia , however , was always the real prize . Sure , it 's a traditionally Republican district that the GOP 's House and Senate nominees won by roughly 20 points in November , but Donald Trump very narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton there , squeaking through by less than two points . So it 's by no means a 'Trumpy ' district .\nSprinkle in the ongoing Russia controversy , an allegedly toxic Republican healthcare bill , and a sagging presidential approval rating , and Democrats could smell political blood in the water . Finally , factor in the Left 's much-discussed intensity advantage , and the literally unprecedented sum of money they poured into the race , and the stage appeared set for that elusive , inspirational victory 'The Resistance ' has been pining for . Polls gave Democrat Jon Ossoff a modest lead down the home stretch of the campaign , with late movement to Republican Karen Handel . It was going to be tight as a tick , it seemed , with enthusiasm and energy being Ossoff 's potential secret sauce . And then this happened :\n99 % in & Handel won by five points . pic.twitter.com/ziDrOYjqLJ \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) June 21 , 2017\nPerhaps the networks ought to start projecting moral victories for Democrats . A few thoughts on Handel 's victory :\n( 1 ) The gloating GOP take : Democrats wanted this one badly , and they hyped it like crazy . They spent somewhere in the ballpark of $ 30 million to make a statement , and they face-planted . Their inexperienced , liberal , Pelosi-backed , pro-Obamacare candidate did n't even live in the district , keeping his campaign afloat via donations from non-Georgians . With a proverbial `` perfect storm '' brewing in precisely the type of district ( affluent , well-educated , suburban ) that Democrats are going to need to turn blue in order to have a chance to win back the House next year , the GOP base also got fired up and turned out in force . In a high-stakes , high-intensity , high-attention , high-dollar , high-expectations , high-turnout battle , Democrats again fell short . With the brightest lights were burning , and both bases fired up , conservatives prevailed . Liberals ' perfunctory Twitter spin soon gave way to angry recriminations , highlighting how demoralizing the loss really was .\n( 2 ) The Democratic counterpoint take : Yes , Trump struggled in the district a few months ago , but GA-06 has been a GOP stronghold for decades . The fact that the party needed to pump tens of millions into a red district just to retain it against a 30-year-old neophyte candidate shows that there 's potential trouble brewing ahead of the midterms . Also , do n't forget that Democrats chirped about a big Pennsylvania special election hold back in 2010 , which some analysts said took the air out of the `` GOP wave '' balloon . A few months later , Republicans won 63 House seats :\nRepublicans breathe huge sigh of relief .
