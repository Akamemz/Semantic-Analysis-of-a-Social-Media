Another well will be drilled and completed in 2013 .\nBP , whose overall interest in the three Galapagos fields amounts to 56 % , expects to see its share of the fields ' production initially average 15,000 barrels of oil per day in the near term , with longer-term net production of 26,000 barrels of oil per day .
