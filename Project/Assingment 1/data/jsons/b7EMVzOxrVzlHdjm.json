Sometimes called \u201c the end-of-life rally , \u201d this phenomenon involves temporary bursts of physical and mental activity in terminally ill patients immediately prior to death . It can cruelly mislead family members , who unrealistically take the apparent improvement as a sign that there is hope after all . This is how the left has responded to Democratic gains in the recent midterms . But such episodes rarely indicate any real change in the patient \u2019 s underlying condition , and the Democratic Party remains infected by fatal strains of Trump Derangement Syndrome ( TDS ) , utopian socialist fantasies , and identity politics .\nThe party \u2019 s TDS infection was on display over the weekend in a column published by USA Today titled , \u201c Now is the time to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump. \u201d That this loony effusion was written by a congresswoman who has been a member of the House for one week , and appeared in a national \u201c news \u201d outlet indicates that many Democrats and members of the media are hopelessly out of touch with the voters . Articles of impeachment were introduced in the House last week by a Democrat to much fanfare in the media , yet the left-leaning Brookings Institution just published a summary of recent surveys and concludes that this isn \u2019 t what the voters want from their representatives :\nMemo to Democrats : unless Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation delivers a smoking gun , don \u2019 t rush to impeach President Trump.\u2026 Of 21 possible priorities for the new Congress , impeaching the president was tied for last , with only 38 percent of Americans deeming it \u201c extremely important. \u201d Republicans are united against it ; no surprise there . But tellingly , it receives less support among Independents than does any other option , and Democrats rank it only 14th on their priority list .\nAnd yet the USA Today column , which was written by Rashida \u201c impeach the motherf * * * er \u201d Tlaib , explicitly states that her party need not \u2014 and should not \u2014 wait for Mueller to finish his $ 40 million snipe hunt before going ahead with the impeachment of President Trump :\nThose who say we must wait for Mueller to complete his criminal investigation before Congress can start any impeachment proceedings ignore this crucial distinction . There is no requirement whatsoever that a president be charged with or be convicted of a crime before Congress can impeach him . They also ignore the fact that many of the impeachable offenses committed by this president are beyond the scope of the special counsel \u2019 s investigation .\nRepresentative Tlaib is evidently unaware that \u201c those who say we must wait for Mueller \u201d are the voters . Like many Democrats , Tlaib has mistaken her party \u2019 s terminal lucidity for a national mandate . This error is particularly common among her fellow first-termers . Just as she demands President Trump \u2019 s head on a stake without regard to the wishes of the electorate , another newly minted representative has been pitching a package of utopian socialist programs that is conspicuously absent from the list of top voter priorities for Congress . Even worse , the primary proponent of this package of pie-in-the-sky proposals seems to regard questions about its $ 40 Trillion cost to be impertinent .\nOn Sunday , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared on 60 Minutes and discussed some of the proposals she has vocally advocated , such as universal healthcare ( i.e .

Predictably , the self-styled \u201c girl from the Bronx \u201d received the obsequious treatment the media always reserves for Democrats in general and avowed socialists in particular . But , inevitably , even Anderson Cooper was obligated to ask how the nation was going to come up with all the money to pay for the goodies . Ocasio-Cortez responded by becoming \u201c snippy , \u201d as Al Gore might put it :\nNo one asks how we \u2019 re gon na pay for this Space Force . No one asked how we paid for a $ 2 trillion tax cut . We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing , healthcare and education . How do we pay for it ? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases.\u2026 I think that there \u2019 s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely , factually , and semantically correct than about being morally right .\nLike Representative Tlaib , Ocasio-Cortez doesn \u2019 t seem to realize that the people who seem so inexplicably concerned about being factually correct rather than morally right are those of us who pay her salary \u2014 the taxpayers . She does , however , admit that it will involve raising taxes and then embarks on an ill-advised attempt to explain how the progressive tax system works : \u201c Your tax rate , you know , let \u2019 s say , from zero to $ 75,000 may be ten percent or 15 percent , et cetera . But once you get to , like , the tippy tops \u2014on your 10 millionth dollar \u2014 sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. \u201d At the mention of \u201c tippy tops , \u201d Cooper decided it was time to change the subject to racism .\nAnd this brings us to the Democratic Party \u2019 s increasing reliance on identity politics ( the art formerly known as race-baiting ) to win elections . This art was perfected by Barack Obama at the presidential level , but it decimated the party at the state and local strata . In fact , the Democrats incurred so much damage during Obama \u2019 s White House tenure that despite their relatively successful 2018 midterm performance , the Republicans retain the majority of governorships , state legislatures , and an expanded majority in the United States Senate . Finally , as Victor Davis Hanson has pointed out , Obama \u2019 s successful exploitation of race almost certainly constituted the apogee of identity politics :\nThe 2016 election marked an earthquake in the diversity industry . It is increasingly difficult to judge who we are merely by our appearances , which means that identity politics may lose its influence .
