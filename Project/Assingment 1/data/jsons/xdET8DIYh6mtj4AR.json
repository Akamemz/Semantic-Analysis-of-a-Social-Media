Assuming the role of party standard-bearer has been a struggle for him , and even now , as he tries to follow a new script , he has not abandoned the caustic tone that has defined his candidacy .\nHis evolving language on immigration reflects his conflicting desires : In the space of a few hours on Tuesday , he said he was open to \u201c softening \u201d his hard-line policies toward some people who had entered the country illegally and then whipped up a rally in Austin , Tex. , with promises to make Mexico pay for a border wall .\nHis new pleas for support from black voters have also carried a hard edge , including last week in Wisconsin , when he questioned why they would not vote for him . Describing blacks as besieged by crime and bereft of economic opportunity , he asked , \u201c What the hell do you have to lose ? \u201d In Ohio on Monday , he described American cities as more dangerous than war zones , and in Mississippi on Wednesday night , he called Mrs. Clinton a \u201c bigot \u201d who courted minorities only for their votes .\nAnd at a rally in Tampa , Fla. , on Wednesday , Mr. Trump still showed a penchant for going off script , reading the word \u201c premeditation \u201d as \u201c premedication \u201d during an attack on Mrs. Clinton \u2014 and then , after a pause , saying he preferred \u201c premedication , \u201d an apparent nod to conspiracy theories that his allies have spread about her health .\nSeveral Republican leaders and strategists , including those critical of Mr. Trump , said they had noticed adjustments in his performance since Ms. Conway became his campaign manager last week . Where previous advisers have sought to recraft the basics of his message , the new team around him appears intent mainly on arranging his favorite themes in a more consistent , linear format .\nStill , with early voting set to begin in many states in late September and October , and given Mr. Trump \u2019 s history of popping off on Twitter , at rallies or in cable interviews at any moment , they said it was impossible to say whether his current message would endure and help turn the focus to Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s character .\n\u201c Is what he \u2019 s doing enough for him to win ?
