The lights were on at a place called the Brick House Grill , and if you were out on South Main Street on a Friday night in February , chances are , that \u2019 s where you were going . So I went in , too .\nI took a seat at the bar . A man two stools over from me struck up a conversation . I told him I was a journalist from Chicago and asked him to tell me about this town . \u201c You know how this town is called Anna ? \u201d he started . \u201c That \u2019 s for \u2018 Ain \u2019 t No Niggers Allowed. \u2019 \u201d He laughed , shook his head and took a sip of his beer .\nThe man was white . I am white . Everyone else in that restaurant in Anna was white .\nLater that night , I realized what shook me most about our conversation : He didn \u2019 t pause before he said what he said . He didn \u2019 t look around the room to see whether anyone could hear us . He didn \u2019 t lower his voice . He just said it .\nEmail Updates Sign up to get \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois \u2019 investigations delivered to your inbox .

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply .\nI first learned about Anna in a book called \u201c Sundown Towns : A Hidden Dimension of American Racism , \u201d about the thousands of communities across the country that , for much of the 20th century , kept themselves white . The term \u201c sundown town \u201d applies to places that , via policy , violence or both , barred black people from town after dark ; as the book explains , the phrase is derived from \u201c the signs that many of [ these places ] formerly sported at their corporate limits \u2014 signs that usually said \u2018 Nigger , Don \u2019 t Let the Sun Go Down on You in __ . \u2019 \u201d\nI picked up the book in part because its author , James W. Loewen , a sociologist who taught at the University of Vermont and at Tougaloo College in Mississippi , is from Decatur , Illinois . Much of his research on sundown towns led him back to his home state , where I now live and which I wanted to better understand .\nWhen Loewen began his research in 1999 , he thought he \u2019 d find just a handful of sundown towns and \u201c recovering \u201d sundown towns , as he calls them , in Illinois . Instead , he found hundreds , from neighborhoods on Chicago \u2019 s North Shore to suburbs in the center of the state to small towns in southern Illinois , such as Anna .\nThe city of Anna , in southern Illinois , has lost some of its industry , but small businesses line many of its streets . It \u2019 s now home to a little more than 4,000 people . ( Whitney Curtis , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nBut the stories of how these communities became or stayed mostly white are often unknown , ignored or not fully told . Loewen said sundown towns sprang up all around the country from 1890 to 1940 , a period he calls the \u201c nadir \u201d of race relations in America . \u201c For the small , independent towns all around the state that are still all white or almost all white , it \u2019 s like the civil rights movement never happened , \u201d he told me .\nAnna \u2019 s historical resistance to black people is , and has long been , well known in the region . Even though it may never have been codified , I found references to the fact that black people weren \u2019 t allowed to live in Anna in newspaper articles from as early as 1903 . In that particular reference , a woman from Anna who worked as a hotel maid in Indianapolis was quoted as saying , \u201c I never saw more than 10 negroes in all my life until I was 18 \u2026 as a negro is not allowed to stop in our little village of Anna . \u201d\nOver the past two years , I visited the town several times to try to understand where Anna \u2019 s history had left the town today . I talked with people going about their lives \u2014 in the library , the Farm Fresh milk store , the Blue Boar restaurant , the city \u2019 s park , the Walmart parking lot and other pockets of Anna . I talked with public officials , historians and longtime residents . I visited a grave in the Anna cemetery that belongs to the man deemed by a local newspaper in 1916 to be \u201c the only colored man who has ever lived in this city \u201d and I spent some time with one of the few black families ( if not the only one ) living in Anna today .\nStill , I \u2019 m not going to claim I know Anna \u2019 s full story \u2014 I \u2019 m an outsider . But after hearing A-N-N-A said aloud that night , I realized my race made me a sort of insider , too . Would the man who first recited A-N-N-A have done so if I weren \u2019 t white ? Nearly everyone I met knew what Anna stands for \u2014 whether they heard it first as a \u201c joke \u201d at school or from their grandparents or just from living here long enough . Most people said they wished the A-N-N-A reputation would just go away and were quick to say Anna wasn \u2019 t \u201c like that \u201d anymore .\nThe Cairo Bulletin , Nov. 15 , 1909 ( University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library via The Library of Congress )\nAnna is a city of a little more than 4,000 people located in the middle of Union County , where soybean fields and flatlands to the north give way to the forests and sandstone canyons of southern Illinois . Here , \u201c Illinois is no longer \u2018 the Prairie state , \u2019 \u201d a correspondent for New York \u2019 s Evening Post wrote in 1858 while covering the third Lincoln-Douglas debate , which was held in Jonesboro , a small town that shares a border with Anna .\nIn fact , many of Anna \u2019 s earliest residents were from Tennessee , North Carolina and Virginia . In the years leading up to the Civil War , \u201c family lines in the South still existed with these people of the new Midwest , \u201d wrote the late Anna resident George E. Parks in 1983 in \u201c History of Union County , \u201d and some residents remained sympathetic to their southern home states . Even today , southern Illinois has more in common culturally with Kentucky and Missouri than with its other neighbors ; for years , Confederate battle flags were draped on a storefront on Anna \u2019 s Main Street without much objection .\nLisa Page and Joy Horn , the owners of Wild Sister \u2019 s Outpost , on South Main Street in Anna , wave to passing floats during the city \u2019 s homecoming parade in September 2018 . ( Whitney Curtis , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nFor much of the 20th century , Anna was almost entirely white , except for a handful of black residents at different times . Around 1980 , Anna \u2019 s black population grew to about a few dozen residents . Today , Anna is one of the whitest municipalities in southern Illinois \u2014 according to the 2010 census , 95.7 % of its citizens are white \u2014 and its black population hasn \u2019 t changed much since that modest uptick nearly 40 years ago , according to census data .\nSome residents of Anna describe their town as safe , family-centric and quaint , and contrast these features with the \u201c problems \u201d they perceive in bigger , less-white neighbors such as Carbondale , a city about 20 miles north of Anna that is home to Southern Illinois University , and Cairo , about 35 miles south of Anna , located at the state \u2019 s southernmost tip .\nCairo has long been emblematic of a future that Anna fears : the decline of a once-thriving town . Cairo \u2019 s population , roughly 2,500 , is now about half of what it was in 1990 , though people began leaving earlier . Some of the white people who left Cairo blamed changes in the city \u2014 its population loss , the flight of business , episodes of violence during the civil rights era \u2014 on black people . Some people still do .\nLike many other small towns , Anna has lost industry . The makers of Bunny Bread \u2014 \u201c That \u2019 s what I said , Bunny Bread , \u201d as an old jingle went \u2014 and Florsheim shoes both closed factories in the early 1990s . But the city is still commercially alive . A Walmart and fast-food chains now cluster in Anna \u2019 s east end , near U.S. Highway 51 . Independent businesses run up and down Main Street .\nAnna , Illinois , is located in far southern Illinois , not far from borders with Missouri and Kentucky . ( Source : Mapbox .

Credit : \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nThe Union County Museum sits about five miles north of Anna in Cobden , a community known for its apple and peach orchards . Patrick Brumleve , who oversees the museum as the president of the Union County Historical and Genealogical Society , said Anna was named after Anna Davie , the wife of the man who founded the town in 1854 . But he said he gets asked every so often about A-N-N-A by outsiders like me .\nAs he told me about Anna \u2019 s origins , he pointed me to a book of letters published in the Jonesboro Gazette , written by the newspaper \u2019 s editor , James Evans , who left his job in 1862 to join the 109th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment for the Union Army \u2014 but who , along with seven other officers from the 109th , was discharged from the Union Army for disloyalty .\nThough Brumleve said many residents supported the preservation of the Union , Evans \u2019 support was contingent on the continuation of slavery , and his letters show his increasing contempt for the war as the Lincoln administration took steps toward emancipation . He calls black people animals . He complains that black soldiers are treated better than white soldiers . He warns that freed black men will take jobs away from white men . When he returned home and resumed his role as editor , he wrote that he and the other officers were \u201c perfectly satisfied of the fact that fighting to free the nigger is no wise [ or ] desirable task . \u201d\nStories of intimidation and violence against black people \u2014 and against white people who tried to employ them \u2014 in Anna continued for decades after the war . While the details of each incident are often vague or contradictory , newspaper accounts , oral history archives and other documents chronicle a narrative of Anna \u2019 s emerging reputation as A-N-N-A .\nIn 1865 , a black man walking toward Anna along railroad tracks outside town was shot and killed in what the Chicago Tribune said was \u201c supposed to have been done by some Copperhead wretch \u201d \u2014 \u201c Copperhead \u201d being slang for Northerners sympathetic to the Confederacy \u2014 \u201c as the disposition of the tribe here is to kill or drive off all niggers . \u201d\nA story from the Chicago Tribune on Sept. 29 , 1865 . ( The Library of Congress )\nAs printed in the Chicago Tribune on Sept. 29 , 1865 . ( The Library of Congress )\nAnd in 1874 , during Reconstruction , white residents in Anna were met with demands from what the Cairo Bulletin called \u201c ku-klux demonstrations \u201d that they fire any black people employed in the area and \u201c send the negroes out of the county or suffer the consequences . \u201d\nA story from The Cairo Bulletin on Oct. 8 , 1874 . ( University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library via The Library of Congress )\nAs printed in The Cairo Bulletin on Oct. 8 , 1874 . ( University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library via The Library of Congress )\nBy the turn of the century , Anna \u2014 at least according to the Jonesboro Gazette \u2014 was grateful it wasn \u2019 t wrapped up in what the newspaper deemed a \u201c race problem \u201d in places where \u201c the negro forms a considerable population \u201d ; in Cairo , for example , about 40 % of residents were black , and many of them were formerly enslaved people who sought new lives in supposedly \u201c free \u201d states such as Illinois . \u201c How fortunate we are to have so little of \u2018 darkest Africa \u2019 among us , \u201d the Gazette wrote in January 1903 , adding that it would be \u201c presumptuous to place the negro in the places where only white men should fill as long as this is a white man \u2019 s country . \u201d\nA photograph of William James taken around 1907 . James was lynched in Cairo , Illinois , two years later . ( From \u201c Without Sanctuary : A History of Lynching Photography in America , \u201d courtesy of Twin Palms Publishers )\nThen , in a moment that would lodge itself in regional memory , a 23-year-old white woman from Anna was found dead in November 1909 in an alley in Cairo . Coincidentally , her name was Anna \u2014 Anna Pelley . Bloodhounds , after picking up the scent from a piece of cloth used to gag her , led Cairo police to arrest a black man named William James , an employee of the Cairo Ice and Coal Company , according to the Cairo Bulletin . Less than 72 hours later , without a trial and after the county sheriff unsuccessfully tried to spirit James out of town to safety , residents took the law into their own hands .\nThey led James to a pair of steel arches that spanned the intersection in the center of Cairo \u2019 s commercial district , which was crowded with thousands of onlookers , most of whom came as word spread about James \u2019 arrest . With a rope around his neck , the Bulletin reported , James confessed . The mob pulled him up to hang him , but the rope broke , so they shot him repeatedly instead . They then dragged his body through the streets , set it on fire and later cut off his head and stuck it on a hitching post .\nRuel Hindman , who lived in Anna , was 7 at the time . \u201c As I remember , in order to prove to the Anna people that he had been lynched , I think they brought one of his legs back to Anna , \u201d Hindman recalled in the 1970s , as part of an oral history project at southern Illinois \u2019 Shawnee Community College . ( Hindman died in 1998 . )\nA crowd gathered to watch the lynching of William James in downtown Cairo , in 1909 . James , who was black , was accused of murdering a white woman from Anna , which is nearby . ( From \u201c Without Sanctuary : A History of Lynching Photography in America , \u201d courtesy of Twin Palms Publishers )\nThe night after James was killed , a band of men from Anna headed for a nearby quarry , which employed a number of black men . About 10 workers fled to the woods . \u201c We \u2019 re much obliged to the managers of the [ quarry ] if they will confine their force to whites in the future , \u201d the Jonesboro Gazette wrote , in language and thinking typical of the paper at the time .\nHindman , in his interview , said any black people who worked or lived in Anna were \u201c driven out \u201d of town after the Anna Pelley incident in 1909 . There was one exception : the Sales family . John and Emily Sales had lived together in Anna for 50 years , in a small home on an alley . He worked \u201c odd jobs , \u201d according to the 1910 census , and she was a \u201c washerwoman , \u201d cleaning clothes . They were formerly enslaved , having fled Tennessee as the Civil War ended , and eventually settled in Anna in 1867 , according to Emily \u2019 s obituary in the Jonesboro Gazette .\nJohn Sales was in his mid 90s when he died in August 1916 . The Gazette wrote that \u201c the only colored man who has ever lived in this city , died at his home Sunday night. \u201d Emily Sales died in Anna in 1932 . ( Their niece , Nora , who lived in the same house , died about 30 years later . ) Today , Emily and John share a small tombstone in the Anna cemetery . About 100 steps away is the grave of Anna Pelley , marked by a sculpture of a woman on her knees , crying , with the inscription : \u201c A life sacrificed but remembered by friends . \u201d\nA memorial to Anna Pelley , left , was funded by hundreds of donations after her death and still stands in the Anna Cemetery . The graves of John and Emily Sales , right , have a small marker about 100 steps from Pelley \u2019 s grave . ( Whitney Curtis , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nMichael Hunter leaned forward in his camouflage-printed office chair . When I met him last year , Hunter was the chief of Anna \u2019 s Police Department , and I was curious whether the A-N-N-A reputation affected how local officials did their jobs . \u201c I was born here and lived in the south for many years , so I don \u2019 t see skin color , \u201d said Hunter , who retired in May after nearly two decades on the force . Hunter told me that when he \u2019 d pull over black motorists , they would sometimes tell him during traffic stops that they knew what Anna stood for and why he \u2019 d stopped them . He didn \u2019 t like it when people assumed he was racist .\n\u201c I worked nights for 13 years . I can \u2019 t tell what color anybody is at night , \u201d Hunter said . \u201c So that always bothered me , that that was their perception. \u201d Racism is not a problem in Anna , he said , at least no more than it is in the rest of the country .\nAnna \u2019 s mayor , Steve Hartline , agreed . \u201c It \u2019 s a shame that wording is even out there when it comes to Anna , \u201d Hartline said . \u201c It \u2019 s really sad . I \u2019 m just sorry we have to talk about that. \u201d He added : \u201c That is not the Anna I know . \u201d\nResidents line South Main Street during the Anna-Jonesboro High School homecoming parade in September 2018 . ( Whitney Curtis , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nHartline grew up in Cobden , the town just north of Anna . He \u2019 s been Anna \u2019 s mayor for nearly 20 years , and he served in its Police Department for 15 years before that . He said he can \u2019 t think of a single incident in Anna that had race at its center that had taken place in his years of public service .\nBut these incidents happened . In March 2013 , four young white men attacked a black 16-year-old in a parking lot behind a furniture store on Main Street . According to police reports , one of the suspects allegedly tried to sodomize the victim with either a tire iron or an ax handle . Although one of the young men told police they attacked the victim because he was black , the police did not charge the four men with a hate crime .\nIn 2017 , in the aftermath of the white supremacist \u201c Unite the Right \u201d rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , a white Anna resident named Tabitha Tripp said at a Union County board meeting that she was concerned about hate incidents in the county , and she asked the county commissioners to consider a resolution , identical to one that had recently passed the Illinois House , condemning hate groups .\nThe proposal was never brought up for a vote , in part because commissioners said they didn \u2019 t believe it was their job to address such concerns . \u201c The more you talk about it , it just creates that issue more , \u201d Max Miller , Union County \u2019 s board chairman , told me . \u201c I just didn \u2019 t think it was worth talking about . \u201d\nSome sundown towns in the Midwest have begun to confront their legacies . In March 2015 , the City Council of Goshen , Indiana , voted 6-0 to pass \u201c A Resolution Acknowledging the Racially Exclusionary Past of Goshen , Indiana , as a \u2018 Sundown Town. \u2019 \u201d In late 2016 , the mayor of La Crosse , Wisconsin , formally apologized for the city \u2019 s history of racial exclusion and signed a proclamation to work toward racial equality . \u201c We \u2019 ve got issues and are not shirking away from those issues , \u201d Mayor Tim Kabat , who is white , told the La Crosse Tribune . \u201c We recognize this is a problem and need to do something about it . \u201d\nThe Union County Board of Commissioners is all white . So is the Anna City Council , the Anna Police Department and every teacher at Anna-Jonesboro High School , the public high school serving Anna . \u201c I wish we had more diversity on our staff , \u201d said Brett Detering , the school \u2019 s principal .\nDarrel Dexter , a local historian who lives in Jonesboro and teaches high school social studies in nearby Tamms , said that many of his black students see Anna as a \u201c racist place. \u201d If people in Anna want their town to shed that reputation , he said , they \u2019 ll have to reckon with the history of A-N-N-A . \u201c What people need to do is to say : \u2018 Yes , this happened . We \u2019 re sorry it happened . \u2026 It \u2019 s a part of our heritage , but we \u2019 re changing that , \u2019 \u201d Dexter said . \u201c And until people are willing to at least acknowledge that it \u2019 s there , there \u2019 s not going to be any change . \u201d\nAn Anna resident named Randy Miller , who is white , said that most people in town , including him , don \u2019 t know of any specific incident that led Anna to become known as A-N-N-A . But , he said , it \u2019 s not something people there are proud of . \u201c Our forefathers have gone through and made decisions that weren \u2019 t the greatest things in the world , \u201d Miller said . \u201c But at what point do we move on from that , you know ? I mean , at what point do we heal instead of coming back and going , \u2018 Let \u2019 s rip this wound open again ? \u2019 \u2026 There \u2019 s got to be a solution , not just a revisiting of the problem. \u201d When he said this , he meant that everyone \u2014 white people , black people , outsiders such as myself \u2014 should focus on how to move forward .\nGavin Tripp , 18 , said Anna \u2019 s reputation makes people his age in surrounding counties not want to come to town . He said he is not sure he wants to stay in Anna after college . ( Whitney Curtis , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nTripp \u2019 s 18-year-old son , Gavin , graduated from Anna-Jonesboro High in the spring . He said people his age in the surrounding counties know about the lore of A-N-N-A and consider Anna to be \u201c just a bad place for people that are different . \u201d\n\u201c They don \u2019 t want to come here , \u201d Gavin added . \u201c So that doesn \u2019 t allow us to be exposed to different people or different ethnicities. \u201d Given this , he \u2019 s not sure he \u2019 ll stay in Anna after college .\nHe recalled an incident in 2016 , when he was leaving the Farm Fresh milk store after school . \u201c Somebody just drove by and yelled out the window , \u2018 You \u2019 re a nigger lover , \u2019 \u201d Gavin said . At the time , he was dating a girl who was biracial . He said he hadn \u2019 t witnessed that kind of public racism in Anna before . \u201c I didn \u2019 t think it would come out of somebody \u2019 s mouth , straight to my face , \u201d he said .\nOne afternoon in Anna \u2014 during my second visit , in May 2018 \u2014 I approached two postal workers , both of them white , loading mail trucks behind the town \u2019 s post office and asked them where I could find someone who wasn \u2019 t white . \u201c You \u2019 ve come to the wrong town , \u201d one of them said . \u201c For whatever reason it \u2019 s just one of those towns , I guess , \u201d his co-worker added .\nBut there are some black people here , and more , it seems , during the workday . One woman who works in the area and who is black told me she hates it when she \u2019 s assigned a shift in the town . She fills up her car \u2019 s gas tank before going to work so that she spends as little time in Anna as possible . She knows what A-N-N-A stands for , and she doesn \u2019 t want to take any chances . ( She asked me not to publish her name , out of concern for her safety . )\nBlack people also work at Choate Developmental Center , a state mental health facility in Anna . Ralph Smith , 30 , has been employed there for two years . I met him while he was playing basketball with his young son in the park . People around the area , not just in Anna , have called him derogatory names based on his race , he said . One time it happened while he was pumping gas . \u201c But all of that stuff don \u2019 t get me down . \u2026 People just don \u2019 t have enough education or just haven \u2019 t been around a lot , \u201d said Smith , who lives about 30 minutes outside Anna .\nRalph Smith , 30 , sometimes plays basketball in Anna after work . People in the area , not just in Anna , have called him derogatory names , \u201c but all of that stuff don \u2019 t get me down , \u201d he said . ( Whitney Curtis , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nWhen friends of Smith \u2019 s learn he works in Anna , sometimes he gets questions and warnings . They ask him what he \u2019 s doing out there ; doesn \u2019 t he know Anna is a sundown town ? \u201c You \u2019 d better be safe , \u201d they tell him . Smith shrugs it off . \u201c I think it needs more flavor around here for sure , but everything needs to be more mixed , \u201d he said . \u201c I think the whole world needs to change \u2014 not just Anna . The whole world . \u201d\nAnna \u2019 s Walmart draws a more diverse crowd . James Taylor , a 61-year-old known as \u201c Big T \u201d in Cairo , where he lives , was shopping there on a Saturday afternoon when I met him . \u201c In my younger days \u2026 you weren \u2019 t allowed up here after dark , period , \u201d Taylor said in the parking lot as he loaded grocery bags into his car . He added , \u201c It was just a racist town . \u201d\nFor years , he avoided Anna . He now comes to town to go to Walmart and to get his car washed . Taylor said he \u2019 s noticed more black people in Anna in the past 10 years \u2014 \u201c I take my hat off to that \u201d \u2014 but , he said , changing Anna \u2019 s reputation is going to take a while . \u201c Old heads ain \u2019 t died off yet , \u201d he explained .\nWhen Easter Smith opened the door , her house smelled like dinner . Smith , 38 , moved to Anna in 2016 with her six children : Arieh , 19 ; Atarah , 18 ; Amiyah , 16 ; Arojae , 15 ; Asaiah , 12 ; and Aseana , 11 . Smith thought hers was the only black family in Anna when she arrived , though she thinks a few more families have moved in since .\nSmith never thought she would live here . Years before , when she was new to Illinois and living in Murphysboro , about 25 miles north , she got lost driving somewhere on U.S. Highway 51 after dark and called her husband for directions . She described what she saw and he knew she was in Anna . \u201c Bae , drive fast and keep going , \u201d she remembers him saying .\nBut after a series of incidents that made her feel unsafe in Murphysboro , Smith said , she wanted out . Her eldest son , Arieh Hart , had an idea . He had a friend who lived in Anna and had spent weekends there . He \u2019 d grown to like it . The high school was good and it had a strong sports program . He felt he and his brothers and sisters would thrive .\nEaster Smith cheers for the Anna-Jonesboro High School football team during the homecoming game in September 2018 . Smith moved to Anna in 2016 . ( Whitney Curtis , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nYet when Smith ran the idea by friends and school guidance counselors , just about everyone asked her the same thing : Don \u2019 t you know what A-N-N-A stands for ? \u201c The look on their faces was terror , \u201d Smith said .\nShe prayed . She trusted God and she trusted her son . She told her husband that Anna was the place they needed to be . He disagreed . He didn \u2019 t go with her . He declined to be interviewed for this story . \u201c I have to do what women and mothers have to do , \u201d Smith said . \u201c And that \u2019 s make a better situation for your kids . \u201d\nBefore the family moved to Anna , Smith sat her kids down and discussed how to respond if someone called them the N-word , if they were discriminated against at school or if they didn \u2019 t feel comfortable . They were not to lash out or fight .\nIn the family \u2019 s first few months in Anna , Atarah and Amiyah received some naive questions from their white classmates . Is that your real hair ? Can I touch it ? How do you run so fast ? How do you dance like that ? For the most part , it was what they expected . But it hurt . When Atarah made the high school basketball team , someone sent her a screenshot of a message telling her teammates to be nice to her because she is black . That made her feel like her blackness was seen as a threat .\nThe sisters have a slew of similar stories . And when they recounted some of those stories to me , they talked over one another and finished one another \u2019 s sentences . They laughed about how , sometimes , white people in Anna can be overly nice to them . When I went to church with the family one morning , I watched a white woman touch Atarah \u2019 s hair and tell her she was beautiful , \u201c like Beyonc\u00e9 . \u201d\nEaster Smith helps her daughter , Amiyah Hart , get ready for Anna-Jonesboro High School \u2019 s homecoming dance in September 2018 . ( Whitney Curtis , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nArieh pointed out that , since they \u2019 ve lived in Anna , his white friends here have taught him how to do things like catch fish , drive ATVs and shoot guns . \u201c We just learn from each other , \u201d Arieh said . \u201c And that \u2019 s what I love . \u201d\nIn 2018 , Arieh won Illinois \u2019 high school state wrestling championship for his weight class . As his mother followed the van carrying him and other members of the Anna-Jonesboro wrestling team back into town after the finals , people lined up on Main Street to wave and clap and cheer . Some held signs : \u201c We \u2764\ufe0f You , Arieh , \u201d read one . \u201c State Champ # 1 , \u201d read another . Smith still tears up thinking about it .\nThis is the kind of thing that makes her wish she had moved to Anna sooner . And it is the kind of thing some older white people in Anna thought they \u2019 d never see : a young black man welcomed back to town with a public celebration . Smith got Facebook messages from people she \u2019 d never met . \u201c I don \u2019 t know you or your son personally , \u201d one message read . \u201c And I think it has to be said that what your son has done is nothing short of a miracle . \u2026 What I \u2019 m talking about is seeing him bring that community together . Anyone who knows the history of Anna-Jonesboro would never in a million years imagine something like this would ever happen . \u2026 Seeing this honestly gives me hope that people can and do change . \u201d\nNevertheless , three years after Smith moved to Anna , her family still has to deal with racist comments . On the first day of Amiyah \u2019 s senior year at Anna-Jonesboro High , students gathered before class outside the school for impromptu group photos . One boy , Amiyah told Smith , yelled to her , \u201c Come on , blackie , and get in the photo. \u201d Amiyah looked at him , turned around and walked away .\nSmith hopes her family is changing Anna \u2019 s A-N-N-A reputation , as well as the minds of some of its residents , even if it is hardly the family \u2019 s job to . Growing up near Phoenix , Smith said her family \u2019 s friends called them \u201c the Huxtables , \u201d a reference to the upper-middle class black family of \u201c The Cosby Show. \u201d She feels her parents , and the high standards they set , prepared her well for her current life : \u201c If anybody was going to come to Anna , God picked somebody that had the right credentials to be able to come here , \u201d she said .\nArieh Hart laughs with a classmate at the 2018 homecoming coronation at Anna-Jonesboro High . He was elected homecoming king the previous year , and crowned his successor at the ceremony . ( Whitney Curtis , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nAngela Hargrave , a 46-year-old resident of Anna who is white and a close friend of Smith \u2019 s , said Smith \u2019 s family has set in motion \u201c a completely different image for our town and our area. \u201d \u201c I think it takes a lot more families like Easter \u2019 s coming in , \u201d Hargrave said . \u201c But I also feel like it takes all of us that don \u2019 t feel that way to step forward and to be brave enough to say , \u2018 No , that is not what we \u2019 re about . \u2019 \u201d\nStill , Smith often thinks twice about simple decisions white people seldom give much thought to \u2014 for example , which black friends she can invite to town , because she \u2019 s not sure they \u2019 ll all be received well . There are some she \u2019 s decided not to have over : \u201c I \u2019 m not that uppity friend that I \u2019 m too good for them now , but I \u2019 m not introducing them to my friends here . \u2026 I \u2019 m scared that I will be looked at different for entertaining them. \u201d These kinds of calculations , she said , can be exhausting .\nSmith told me her family feels pressure to always be on its best behavior . \u201c I mean , that \u2019 s just how we were taught , \u201d she said . \u201c Act like the camera \u2019 s on , act like somebody is following you , act like somebody is watching you , because nine times out of 10 , they are . \u201d\nA road near Anna , at sundown ( Whitney Curtis , special to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois )\nOn a visit to southern Illinois this spring , I went to the spot in Cairo where William James was lynched 110 years earlier . There , children glided on bicycles from the levee road along the Ohio River , down through the intersection where the steel arches stood . Patches of tiled sidewalk that once led into storefronts now faded into dirt .\nWhen I called James Taylor , the man I had met at the Anna Walmart months before , he told me there was someone in Cairo I should meet . I hopped into the backseat of Taylor \u2019 s blue station wagon , and a man named Gregory Walker , 69 , sat in the passenger seat . Walker told me about a sign he said used to be posted near Anna \u2019 s city limits . \u201c It said , No Niggers Allowed , \u201d Walker remembered .\n\u201c Have you ever seen the population signs ? \u201d he asked me . The green ones with white letters . \u201c [ It looked ] just like that , \u201d he added . \u201c And it was sitting right next to the population sign. \u201d I \u2019 ve heard about some version of this sign from a few people in Anna , but I have yet to find physical proof of it \u2014 a document , a photo , anything . In a way , though , it doesn \u2019 t matter . Because whether or not that sign really existed , it exists in the minds of many black southern Illinoisans who know what the name of the town stands for .\nI told Walker about Easter Smith and Arieh Hart . \u201c Out of 5,000 people up there , you come up with one family ? \u201d he said , laughing . \u201c That should tell you something right there. \u201d As I drove back into Anna later that day , I passed the sign marking its border and population . \u201c ANNA , \u201d it reads . \u201c 4500. \u201d And under it is another sign that looks just like it , a green sign with white letters . It was new since the last time I had been in town . \u201c HOME OF ARIEH HART , \u201d it reads . \u201c 2018 IHSA 1A 152 LB WRESTLING CHAMPION . \u201d",

So I went in, too.\n\nI took a seat at the bar. A man two stools over from me struck up a conversation. I told him I was a journalist from Chicago and asked him to tell me about this town. \u201cYou know how this town is called Anna?\u201d he started. \u201cThat\u2019s for \u2018Ain\u2019t No Niggers Allowed.\u2019\u201d He laughed, shook his head and took a sip of his beer.\n\nThe man was white. I am white. Everyone else in that restaurant in Anna was white.\n\nLater that night, I realized what shook me most about our conversation: He didn\u2019t pause before he said what he said. He didn\u2019t look around the room to see whether anyone could hear us. He didn\u2019t lower his voice. He just said it.\n\nEmail Updates Sign up to get ProPublica Illinois\u2019 investigations delivered to your inbox. Sign up to get ProPublica Illinois\u2019 investigations delivered to your inbox.

The term \u201csundown town\u201d applies to places that, via policy, violence or both, barred black people from town after dark; as the book explains, the phrase is derived from \u201cthe signs that many of [these places] formerly sported at their corporate limits \u2014 signs that usually said \u2018Nigger, Don\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on You in __.\u2019\u201d\n\nI picked up the book in part because its author, James W. Loewen, a sociologist who taught at the University of Vermont and at Tougaloo College in Mississippi, is from Decatur, Illinois. Much of his research on sundown towns led him back to his home state, where I now live and which I wanted to better understand.\n\nWhen Loewen began his research in 1999, he thought he\u2019d find just a handful of sundown towns and \u201crecovering\u201d sundown towns, as he calls them, in Illinois. Instead, he found hundreds, from neighborhoods on Chicago\u2019s North Shore to suburbs in the center of the state to small towns in southern Illinois, such as Anna.\n\nThe city of Anna, in southern Illinois, has lost some of its industry, but small businesses line many of its streets. It\u2019s now home to a little more than 4,000 people. (Whitney Curtis, special to ProPublica Illinois)\n\nBut the stories of how these communities became or stayed mostly white are often unknown, ignored or not fully told. Loewen said sundown towns sprang up all around the country from 1890 to 1940, a period he calls the \u201cnadir\u201d of race relations in America. \u201cFor the small, independent towns all around the state that are still all white or almost all white, it\u2019s like the civil rights movement never happened,\u201d he told me.\n\nAnna\u2019s historical resistance to black people is, and has long been, well known in the region. Even though it may never have been codified, I found references to the fact that black people weren\u2019t allowed to live in Anna in newspaper articles from as early as 1903. In that particular reference, a woman from Anna who worked as a hotel maid in Indianapolis was quoted as saying, \u201cI never saw more than 10 negroes in all my life until I was 18 \u2026 as a negro is not allowed to stop in our little village of Anna.\u201d\n\nOver the past two years, I visited the town several times to try to understand where Anna\u2019s history had left the town today. I talked with people going about their lives \u2014 in the library, the Farm Fresh milk store, the Blue Boar restaurant, the city\u2019s park, the Walmart parking lot and other pockets of Anna. I talked with public officials, historians and longtime residents. I visited a grave in the Anna cemetery that belongs to the man deemed by a local newspaper in 1916 to be \u201cthe only colored man who has ever lived in this city\u201d and I spent some time with one of the few black families (if not the only one) living in Anna today.\n\nStill, I\u2019m not going to claim I know Anna\u2019s full story \u2014 I\u2019m an outsider. But after hearing A-N-N-A said aloud that night, I realized my race made me a sort of insider, too. Would the man who first recited A-N-N-A have done so if I weren\u2019t white? Nearly everyone I met knew what Anna stands for \u2014 whether they heard it first as a \u201cjoke\u201d at school or from their grandparents or just from living here long enough. Most people said they wished the A-N-N-A reputation would just go away and were quick to say Anna wasn\u2019t \u201clike that\u201d anymore.\n\nLike what? I\u2019d ask. If Anna has changed, how?\n\nThe Cairo Bulletin, Nov. 15, 1909 (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library via The Library of Congress)\n\nAnna is a city of a little more than 4,000 people located in the middle of Union County, where soybean fields and flatlands to the north give way to the forests and sandstone canyons of southern Illinois. Here, \u201cIllinois is no longer \u2018the Prairie state,\u2019\u201d a correspondent for New York\u2019s Evening Post wrote in 1858 while covering the third Lincoln-Douglas debate, which was held in Jonesboro, a small town that shares a border with Anna.\n\nIn fact, many of Anna\u2019s earliest residents were from Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. In the years leading up to the Civil War, \u201cfamily lines in the South still existed with these people of the new Midwest,\u201d wrote the late Anna resident George E. Parks in 1983 in \u201cHistory of Union County,\u201d and some residents remained sympathetic to their southern home states. Even today, southern Illinois has more in common culturally with Kentucky and Missouri than with its other neighbors; for years, Confederate battle flags were draped on a storefront on Anna\u2019s Main Street without much objection.\n\nLisa Page and Joy Horn, the owners of Wild Sister\u2019s Outpost, on South Main Street in Anna, wave to passing floats during the city\u2019s homecoming parade in September 2018. (Whitney Curtis, special to ProPublica Illinois)\n\nFor much of the 20th century, Anna was almost entirely white, except for a handful of black residents at different times. Around 1980, Anna\u2019s black population grew to about a few dozen residents. Today, Anna is one of the whitest municipalities in southern Illinois \u2014 according to the 2010 census, 95.7% of its citizens are white \u2014 and its black population hasn\u2019t changed much since that modest uptick nearly 40 years ago, according to census data.\n\nSome residents of Anna describe their town as safe, family-centric and quaint, and contrast these features with the \u201cproblems\u201d they perceive in bigger, less-white neighbors such as Carbondale, a city about 20 miles north of Anna that is home to Southern Illinois University, and Cairo, about 35 miles south of Anna, located at the state\u2019s southernmost tip.\n\nCairo has long been emblematic of a future that Anna fears: the decline of a once-thriving town. Cairo\u2019s population, roughly 2,500, is now about half of what it was in 1990, though people began leaving earlier. Some of the white people who left Cairo blamed changes in the city \u2014 its population loss, the flight of business, episodes of violence during the civil rights era \u2014 on black people. Some people still do.\n\nLike many other small towns, Anna has lost industry. The makers of Bunny Bread \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s what I said, Bunny Bread,\u201d as an old jingle went \u2014 and Florsheim shoes both closed factories in the early 1990s. But the city is still commercially alive. A Walmart and fast-food chains now cluster in Anna\u2019s east end, near U.S. Highway 51. Independent businesses run up and down Main Street.\n\nAnna, Illinois, is located in far southern Illinois, not far from borders with Missouri and Kentucky. (Source: Mapbox.

Credit: ProPublica Illinois)\n\nThe Union County Museum sits about five miles north of Anna in Cobden, a community known for its apple and peach orchards. Patrick Brumleve, who oversees the museum as the president of the Union County Historical and Genealogical Society, said Anna was named after Anna Davie, the wife of the man who founded the town in 1854. But he said he gets asked every so often about A-N-N-A by outsiders like me.\n\nAs he told me about Anna\u2019s origins, he pointed me to a book of letters published in the Jonesboro Gazette, written by the newspaper\u2019s editor, James Evans, who left his job in 1862 to join the 109th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment for the Union Army \u2014 but who, along with seven other officers from the 109th, was discharged from the Union Army for disloyalty.\n\nThough Brumleve said many residents supported the preservation of the Union, Evans\u2019 support was contingent on the continuation of slavery, and his letters show his increasing contempt for the war as the Lincoln administration took steps toward emancipation. He calls black people animals. He complains that black soldiers are treated better than white soldiers. He warns that freed black men will take jobs away from white men. When he returned home and resumed his role as editor, he wrote that he and the other officers were \u201cperfectly satisfied of the fact that fighting to free the nigger is no wise [or] desirable task.\u201d\n\nStories of intimidation and violence against black people \u2014 and against white people who tried to employ them \u2014 in Anna continued for decades after the war. While the details of each incident are often vague or contradictory, newspaper accounts, oral history archives and other documents chronicle a narrative of Anna\u2019s emerging reputation as A-N-N-A.\n\nIn 1865, a black man walking toward Anna along railroad tracks outside town was shot and killed in what the Chicago Tribune said was \u201csupposed to have been done by some Copperhead wretch\u201d \u2014 \u201cCopperhead\u201d being slang for Northerners sympathetic to the Confederacy \u2014 \u201cas the disposition of the tribe here is to kill or drive off all niggers.\u201d\n\nA story from the Chicago Tribune on Sept. 29, 1865. (The Library of Congress)\n\nAs printed in the Chicago Tribune on Sept. 29, 1865. (The Library of Congress)\n\nAnd in 1874, during Reconstruction, white residents in Anna were met with demands from what the Cairo Bulletin called \u201cku-klux demonstrations\u201d that they fire any black people employed in the area and \u201csend the negroes out of the county or suffer the consequences.\u201d\n\nA story from The Cairo Bulletin on Oct. 8, 1874. (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library via The Library of Congress)\n\nAs printed in The Cairo Bulletin on Oct. 8, 1874. (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library via The Library of Congress)\n\nBy the turn of the century, Anna \u2014 at least according to the Jonesboro Gazette \u2014 was grateful it wasn\u2019t wrapped up in what the newspaper deemed a \u201crace problem\u201d in places where \u201cthe negro forms a considerable population\u201d; in Cairo, for example, about 40% of residents were black, and many of them were formerly enslaved people who sought new lives in supposedly \u201cfree\u201d states such as Illinois. \u201cHow fortunate we are to have so little of \u2018darkest Africa\u2019 among us,\u201d the Gazette wrote in January 1903, adding that it would be \u201cpresumptuous to place the negro in the places where only white men should fill as long as this is a white man\u2019s country.\u201d\n\nA photograph of William James taken around 1907. James was lynched in Cairo, Illinois, two years later. (From \u201cWithout Sanctuary: A History of Lynching Photography in America,\u201d courtesy of Twin Palms Publishers)\n\nThen, in a moment that would lodge itself in regional memory, a 23-year-old white woman from Anna was found dead in November 1909 in an alley in Cairo. Coincidentally, her name was Anna \u2014 Anna Pelley. Bloodhounds, after picking up the scent from a piece of cloth used to gag her, led Cairo police to arrest a black man named William James, an employee of the Cairo Ice and Coal Company, according to the Cairo Bulletin. Less than 72 hours later, without a trial and after the county sheriff unsuccessfully tried to spirit James out of town to safety, residents took the law into their own hands.\n\nThey led James to a pair of steel arches that spanned the intersection in the center of Cairo\u2019s commercial district, which was crowded with thousands of onlookers, most of whom came as word spread about James\u2019 arrest. With a rope around his neck, the Bulletin reported, James confessed. The mob pulled him up to hang him, but the rope broke, so they shot him repeatedly instead. They then dragged his body through the streets, set it on fire and later cut off his head and stuck it on a hitching post.\n\nRuel Hindman, who lived in Anna, was 7 at the time. \u201cAs I remember, in order to prove to the Anna people that he had been lynched, I think they brought one of his legs back to Anna,\u201d Hindman recalled in the 1970s, as part of an oral history project at southern Illinois\u2019 Shawnee Community College. (Hindman died in 1998.)\n\nA crowd gathered to watch the lynching of William James in downtown Cairo, in 1909. James, who was black, was accused of murdering a white woman from Anna, which is nearby. (From \u201cWithout Sanctuary: A History of Lynching Photography in America,\u201d courtesy of Twin Palms Publishers)\n\nThe night after James was killed, a band of men from Anna headed for a nearby quarry, which employed a number of black men. About 10 workers fled to the woods. \u201cWe\u2019re much obliged to the managers of the [quarry] if they will confine their force to whites in the future,\u201d the Jonesboro Gazette wrote, in language and thinking typical of the paper at the time.\n\nHindman, in his interview, said any black people who worked or lived in Anna were \u201cdriven out\u201d of town after the Anna Pelley incident in 1909. There was one exception: the Sales family. John and Emily Sales had lived together in Anna for 50 years, in a small home on an alley. He worked \u201codd jobs,\u201d according to the 1910 census, and she was a \u201cwasherwoman,\u201d cleaning clothes. They were formerly enslaved, having fled Tennessee as the Civil War ended, and eventually settled in Anna in 1867, according to Emily\u2019s obituary in the Jonesboro Gazette.\n\nJohn Sales was in his mid 90s when he died in August 1916. The Gazette wrote that \u201cthe only colored man who has ever lived in this city, died at his home Sunday night.\u201d Emily Sales died in Anna in 1932. (Their niece, Nora, who lived in the same house, died about 30 years later.) Today, Emily and John share a small tombstone in the Anna cemetery. About 100 steps away is the grave of Anna Pelley, marked by a sculpture of a woman on her knees, crying, with the inscription: \u201cA life sacrificed but remembered by friends.\u201d\n\nA memorial to Anna Pelley, left, was funded by hundreds of donations after her death and still stands in the Anna Cemetery. The graves of John and Emily Sales, right, have a small marker about 100 steps from Pelley\u2019s grave. (Whitney Curtis, special to ProPublica Illinois)\n\nMichael Hunter leaned forward in his camouflage-printed office chair. When I met him last year, Hunter was the chief of Anna\u2019s Police Department, and I was curious whether the A-N-N-A reputation affected how local officials did their jobs. \u201cI was born here and lived in the south for many years, so I don\u2019t see skin color,\u201d said Hunter, who retired in May after nearly two decades on the force. Hunter told me that when he\u2019d pull over black motorists, they would sometimes tell him during traffic stops that they knew what Anna stood for and why he\u2019d stopped them. He didn\u2019t like it when people assumed he was racist.\n\n\u201cI worked nights for 13 years. I can\u2019t tell what color anybody is at night,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cSo that always bothered me, that that was their perception.\u201d Racism is not a problem in Anna, he said, at least no more than it is in the rest of the country.\n\nAnna\u2019s mayor, Steve Hartline, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that wording is even out there when it comes to Anna,\u201d Hartline said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad. I\u2019m just sorry we have to talk about that.\u201d He added: \u201cThat is not the Anna I know.\u201d\n\nResidents line South Main Street during the Anna-Jonesboro High School homecoming parade in September 2018. (Whitney Curtis, special to ProPublica Illinois)\n\nHartline grew up in Cobden, the town just north of Anna. He\u2019s been Anna\u2019s mayor for nearly 20 years, and he served in its Police Department for 15 years before that. He said he can\u2019t think of a single incident in Anna that had race at its center that had taken place in his years of public service.\n\nBut these incidents happened. In March 2013, four young white men attacked a black 16-year-old in a parking lot behind a furniture store on Main Street. According to police reports, one of the suspects allegedly tried to sodomize the victim with either a tire iron or an ax handle. Although one of the young men told police they attacked the victim because he was black, the police did not charge the four men with a hate crime.\n\nIn 2017, in the aftermath of the white supremacist \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, a white Anna resident named Tabitha Tripp said at a Union County board meeting that she was concerned about hate incidents in the county, and she asked the county commissioners to consider a resolution, identical to one that had recently passed the Illinois House, condemning hate groups.\n\nThe proposal was never brought up for a vote, in part because commissioners said they didn\u2019t believe it was their job to address such concerns. \u201cThe more you talk about it, it just creates that issue more,\u201d Max Miller, Union County\u2019s board chairman, told me. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was worth talking about.\u201d\n\nSome sundown towns in the Midwest have begun to confront their legacies. In March 2015, the City Council of Goshen, Indiana, voted 6-0 to pass \u201cA Resolution Acknowledging the Racially Exclusionary Past of Goshen, Indiana, as a \u2018Sundown Town.\u2019\u201d In late 2016, the mayor of La Crosse, Wisconsin, formally apologized for the city\u2019s history of racial exclusion and signed a proclamation to work toward racial equality. \u201cWe\u2019ve got issues and are not shirking away from those issues,\u201d Mayor Tim Kabat, who is white, told the La Crosse Tribune. \u201cWe recognize this is a problem and need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nThe Union County Board of Commissioners is all white. So is the Anna City Council, the Anna Police Department and every teacher at Anna-Jonesboro High School, the public high school serving Anna. \u201cI wish we had more diversity on our staff,\u201d said Brett Detering, the school\u2019s principal.\n\nDarrel Dexter, a local historian who lives in Jonesboro and teaches high school social studies in nearby Tamms, said that many of his black students see Anna as a \u201cracist place.\u201d If people in Anna want their town to shed that reputation, he said, they\u2019ll have to reckon with the history of A-N-N-A. \u201cWhat people need to do is to say: \u2018Yes, this happened. We\u2019re sorry it happened. \u2026 It\u2019s a part of our heritage, but we\u2019re changing that,\u2019\u201d Dexter said. \u201cAnd until people are willing to at least acknowledge that it\u2019s there, there\u2019s not going to be any change.\u201d\n\nAn Anna resident named Randy Miller, who is white, said that most people in town, including him, don\u2019t know of any specific incident that led Anna to become known as A-N-N-A. But, he said, it\u2019s not something people there are proud of. \u201cOur forefathers have gone through and made decisions that weren\u2019t the greatest things in the world,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut at what point do we move on from that, you know? I mean, at what point do we heal instead of coming back and going, \u2018Let\u2019s rip this wound open again?\u2019 \u2026 There\u2019s got to be a solution, not just a revisiting of the problem.\u201d When he said this, he meant that everyone \u2014 white people, black people, outsiders such as myself \u2014 should focus on how to move forward.\n\nGavin Tripp, 18, said Anna\u2019s reputation makes people his age in surrounding counties not want to come to town. He said he is not sure he wants to stay in Anna after college. (Whitney Curtis, special to ProPublica Illinois)\n\nTripp\u2019s 18-year-old son, Gavin, graduated from Anna-Jonesboro High in the spring. He said people his age in the surrounding counties know about the lore of A-N-N-A and consider Anna to be \u201cjust a bad place for people that are different.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to come here,\u201d Gavin added. \u201cSo that doesn\u2019t allow us to be exposed to different people or different ethnicities.\u201d Given this, he\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll stay in Anna after college.\n\nHe recalled an incident in 2016, when he was leaving the Farm Fresh milk store after school. \u201cSomebody just drove by and yelled out the window, \u2018You\u2019re a nigger lover,\u2019\u201d Gavin said. At the time, he was dating a girl who was biracial. He said he hadn\u2019t witnessed that kind of public racism in Anna before. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would come out of somebody\u2019s mouth, straight to my face,\u201d he said.\n\nOne afternoon in Anna \u2014 during my second visit, in May 2018 \u2014 I approached two postal workers, both of them white, loading mail trucks behind the town\u2019s post office and asked them where I could find someone who wasn\u2019t white. \u201cYou\u2019ve come to the wrong town,\u201d one of them said. \u201cFor whatever reason it\u2019s just one of those towns, I guess,\u201d his co-worker added.\n\nBut there are some black people here, and more, it seems, during the workday. One woman who works in the area and who is black told me she hates it when she\u2019s assigned a shift in the town. She fills up her car\u2019s gas tank before going to work so that she spends as little time in Anna as possible. She knows what A-N-N-A stands for, and she doesn\u2019t want to take any chances. (She asked me not to publish her name, out of concern for her safety.)\n\nBlack people also work at Choate Developmental Center, a state mental health facility in Anna. Ralph Smith, 30, has been employed there for two years. I met him while he was playing basketball with his young son in the park. People around the area, not just in Anna, have called him derogatory names based on his race, he said. One time it happened while he was pumping gas. \u201cBut all of that stuff don\u2019t get me down. \u2026 People just don\u2019t have enough education or just haven\u2019t been around a lot,\u201d said Smith, who lives about 30 minutes outside Anna.\n\nRalph Smith, 30, sometimes plays basketball in Anna after work. People in the area, not just in Anna, have called him derogatory names, \u201cbut all of that stuff don\u2019t get me down,\u201d he said. (Whitney Curtis, special to ProPublica Illinois)\n\nWhen friends of Smith\u2019s learn he works in Anna, sometimes he gets questions and warnings. They ask him what he\u2019s doing out there; doesn\u2019t he know Anna is a sundown town? \u201cYou\u2019d better be safe,\u201d they tell him. Smith shrugs it off. \u201cI think it needs more flavor around here for sure, but everything needs to be more mixed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the whole world needs to change \u2014 not just Anna. The whole world.\u201d\n\nAnna\u2019s Walmart draws a more diverse crowd. James Taylor, a 61-year-old known as \u201cBig T\u201d in Cairo, where he lives, was shopping there on a Saturday afternoon when I met him. \u201cIn my younger days \u2026 you weren\u2019t allowed up here after dark, period,\u201d Taylor said in the parking lot as he loaded grocery bags into his car. He added, \u201cIt was just a racist town.\u201d\n\nFor years, he avoided Anna. He now comes to town to go to Walmart and to get his car washed. Taylor said he\u2019s noticed more black people in Anna in the past 10 years \u2014 \u201cI take my hat off to that\u201d \u2014 but, he said, changing Anna\u2019s reputation is going to take a while. \u201cOld heads ain\u2019t died off yet,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhen Easter Smith opened the door, her house smelled like dinner. Smith, 38, moved to Anna in 2016 with her six children: Arieh, 19; Atarah, 18; Amiyah, 16; Arojae, 15; Asaiah, 12; and Aseana, 11. Smith thought hers was the only black family in Anna when she arrived, though she thinks a few more families have moved in since.\n\nSmith never thought she would live here. Years before, when she was new to Illinois and living in Murphysboro, about 25 miles north, she got lost driving somewhere on U.S. Highway 51 after dark and called her husband for directions. She described what she saw and he knew she was in Anna. \u201cBae, drive fast and keep going,\u201d she remembers him saying.\n\nBut after a series of incidents that made her feel unsafe in Murphysboro, Smith said, she wanted out. Her eldest son, Arieh Hart, had an idea. He had a friend who lived in Anna and had spent weekends there. He\u2019d grown to like it. The high school was good and it had a strong sports program. He felt he and his brothers and sisters would thrive.\n\nEaster Smith cheers for the Anna-Jonesboro High School football team during the homecoming game in September 2018. Smith moved to Anna in 2016. (Whitney Curtis, special to ProPublica Illinois)\n\nYet when Smith ran the idea by friends and school guidance counselors, just about everyone asked her the same thing: Don\u2019t you know what A-N-N-A stands for? \u201cThe look on their faces was terror,\u201d Smith said.\n\nShe prayed. She trusted God and she trusted her son. She told her husband that Anna was the place they needed to be. He disagreed. He didn\u2019t go with her. He declined to be interviewed for this story. \u201cI have to do what women and mothers have to do,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s make a better situation for your kids.\u201d\n\nBefore the family moved to Anna, Smith sat her kids down and discussed how to respond if someone called them the N-word, if they were discriminated against at school or if they didn\u2019t feel comfortable. They were not to lash out or fight.\n\nIn the family\u2019s first few months in Anna, Atarah and Amiyah received some naive questions from their white classmates. Is that your real hair? Can I touch it? How do you run so fast? How do you dance like that? For the most part, it was what they expected. But it hurt. When Atarah made the high school basketball team, someone sent her a screenshot of a message telling her teammates to be nice to her because she is black. That made her feel like her blackness was seen as a threat.\n\nThe sisters have a slew of similar stories. And when they recounted some of those stories to me, they talked over one another and finished one another\u2019s sentences. They laughed about how, sometimes, white people in Anna can be overly nice to them. When I went to church with the family one morning, I watched a white woman touch Atarah\u2019s hair and tell her she was beautiful, \u201clike Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d\n\nEaster Smith helps her daughter, Amiyah Hart, get ready for Anna-Jonesboro High School\u2019s homecoming dance in September 2018. (Whitney Curtis, special to ProPublica Illinois)\n\nArieh pointed out that, since they\u2019ve lived in Anna, his white friends here have taught him how to do things like catch fish, drive ATVs and shoot guns. \u201cWe just learn from each other,\u201d Arieh said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I love.\u201d\n\nArieh said he was called the N-word once during a football game against nearby Du Quoin High School. He kept his composure. Some time later, a few students at Anna-Jonesboro High made an Instagram account and anonymously made fun of classmates by posting photos of them along with derogatory captions, Smith said. They posted a photo of Arieh and wrote a caption calling him the N-word and Anna\u2019s \u201cJackie Robinson.\u201d The school disciplined the students behind the account. Some white parents, particularly upset about the post featuring Arieh, spoke to administrators about it, Smith said. That meant a lot to her.\n\nIn 2018, Arieh won Illinois\u2019 high school state wrestling championship for his weight class. As his mother followed the van carrying him and other members of the Anna-Jonesboro wrestling team back into town after the finals, people lined up on Main Street to wave and clap and cheer. Some held signs: \u201cWe \u2764\ufe0f You, Arieh,\u201d read one. \u201cState Champ #1,\u201d read another. Smith still tears up thinking about it.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that makes her wish she had moved to Anna sooner. And it is the kind of thing some older white people in Anna thought they\u2019d never see: a young black man welcomed back to town with a public celebration. Smith got Facebook messages from people she\u2019d never met. \u201cI don\u2019t know you or your son personally,\u201d one message read. \u201cAnd I think it has to be said that what your son has done is nothing short of a miracle. \u2026 What I\u2019m talking about is seeing him bring that community together. Anyone who knows the history of Anna-Jonesboro would never in a million years imagine something like this would ever happen. \u2026 Seeing this honestly gives me hope that people can and do change.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, three years after Smith moved to Anna, her family still has to deal with racist comments. On the first day of Amiyah\u2019s senior year at Anna-Jonesboro High, students gathered before class outside the school for impromptu group photos. One boy, Amiyah told Smith, yelled to her, \u201cCome on, blackie, and get in the photo.\u201d Amiyah looked at him, turned around and walked away.\n\nSmith hopes her family is changing Anna\u2019s A-N-N-A reputation, as well as the minds of some of its residents, even if it is hardly the family\u2019s job to. Growing up near Phoenix, Smith said her family\u2019s friends called them \u201cthe Huxtables,\u201d a reference to the upper-middle class black family of \u201cThe Cosby Show.\u201d She feels her parents, and the high standards they set, prepared her well for her current life: \u201cIf anybody was going to come to Anna, God picked somebody that had the right credentials to be able to come here,\u201d she said.\n\nArieh Hart laughs with a classmate at the 2018 homecoming coronation at Anna-Jonesboro High. He was elected homecoming king the previous year, and crowned his successor at the ceremony. (Whitney Curtis, special to ProPublica Illinois)\n\nAngela Hargrave, a 46-year-old resident of Anna who is white and a close friend of Smith\u2019s, said Smith\u2019s family has set in motion \u201ca completely different image for our town and our area.\u201d \u201cI think it takes a lot more families like Easter\u2019s coming in,\u201d Hargrave said. \u201cBut I also feel like it takes all of us that don\u2019t feel that way to step forward and to be brave enough to say, \u2018No, that is not what we\u2019re about.\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, Smith often thinks twice about simple decisions white people seldom give much thought to \u2014 for example, which black friends she can invite to town, because she\u2019s not sure they\u2019ll all be received well. There are some she\u2019s decided not to have over: \u201cI\u2019m not that uppity friend that I\u2019m too good for them now, but I\u2019m not introducing them to my friends here. \u2026 I\u2019m scared that I will be looked at different for entertaining them.\u201d These kinds of calculations, she said, can be exhausting.\n\nSmith told me her family feels pressure to always be on its best behavior. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s just how we were taught,\u201d she said. \u201cAct like the camera\u2019s on, act like somebody is following you, act like somebody is watching you, because nine times out of 10, they are.\u201d\n\nA road near Anna, at sundown (Whitney Curtis, special to ProPublica Illinois)\n\nOn a visit to southern Illinois this spring, I went to the spot in Cairo where William James was lynched 110 years earlier. There, children glided on bicycles from the levee road along the Ohio River, down through the intersection where the steel arches stood. Patches of tiled sidewalk that once led into storefronts now faded into dirt.\n\nWhen I called James Taylor, the man I had met at the Anna Walmart months before, he told me there was someone in Cairo I should meet. I hopped into the backseat of Taylor\u2019s blue station wagon, and a man named Gregory Walker, 69, sat in the passenger seat. Walker told me about a sign he said used to be posted near Anna\u2019s city limits. \u201cIt said, No Niggers Allowed,\u201d Walker remembered.\n\n\u201cHave you ever seen the population signs?\u201d he asked me. The green ones with white letters. \u201c[It looked] just like that,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it was sitting right next to the population sign.\u201d I\u2019ve heard about some version of this sign from a few people in Anna, but I have yet to find physical proof of it \u2014 a document, a photo, anything. In a way, though, it doesn\u2019t matter. Because whether or not that sign really existed, it exists in the minds of many black southern Illinoisans who know what the name of the town stands for.\n\nI told Walker about Easter Smith and Arieh Hart. \u201cOut of 5,000 people up there, you come up with one family?\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThat should tell you something right there.\u201d As I drove back into Anna later that day, I passed the sign marking its border and population. \u201cANNA,\u201d it reads. \u201c4500.\u201d And under it is another sign that looks just like it, a green sign with white letters. It was new since the last time I had been in town. \u201cHOME OF ARIEH HART,\u201d it reads. \u201c2018 IHSA 1A 152 LB WRESTLING CHAMPION.\u201d",
