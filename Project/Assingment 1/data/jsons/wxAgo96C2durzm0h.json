    "content": "With a five-meter-wide , 57-meter-tall rocket waiting to blast off from China \u2019 s southern island of Hainan , the nation is quietly making final preparations for its first independent trip to Mars . When the launch window opens in mid-July , Chinese scientists will strive to send a probe to a planet that confused their ancestors with its constantly changing brightness and position in the sky .\nThe spacecraft , called Tianwen-1 , or the \u201c Quest for Heavenly Truth , \u201d will carry 13 scientific instruments to examine the Red Planet from orbit and on its surface . Tianwen-1 will examine how water ice is distributed on Mars , as well as the planet \u2019 s physical evolution and its habitability over time . The mission\u2014consisting of an orbiter , lander , and rover\u2014is \u201c the most ambitious thing one could do on a first attempt , \u201d says John Logsdon , a space policy expert at George Washington University .\nThe odds of a flawless mission are daunting : Of humanity \u2019 s dozens of attempts to orbit or land on Mars to date , only about half have succeeded . After some high-profile setbacks , NASA has deployed five landers , four rovers and multiple orbiters that have brought the world to life for scientists and the public alike . But China \u2019 s spacefaring experience beyond Earth orbit has been limited to several robotic moon missions and an orbiter that piggybacked on a failed Russian mission to the Martian moon Phobos in 2011 .\nTwo major risks confront the five-metric-ton Tianwen-1 , Logsdon says . First , China \u2019 s most powerful heavy-lift rocket , Long March 5 , has only launched three times\u2014including a major failure in 2017 , when the rocket started to malfunction shortly after takeoff . It took more than two years for scientists to fix Long March 5 \u2019 s core-stage-engine problem and score a successful flight in late 2019 . Its track record makes observers nervous , however .\nSecond , Tianwen-1 \u2019 s lander must navigate the challenging Martian atmosphere , which is thick enough to overheat the probe but too thin to decelerate it sufficiently . The spacecraft \u2019 s entry , descent and landing technology uses a heat shield , a parachute and a retro-engine to slow its descent , an arrangement resembling that of earlier U.S. missions . Yet when the vessel is just 100 meters above the surface , it will pause , take snapshots of the area and quickly calculate the best landing spot . Then it will shift horizontally to center above that spot and carefully touch down with the lander \u2019 s four legs .\nIn November 2019 China tested this part of the landing procedure , which the nation had previously used successfully in its moon landings , in the province of Hebei . Foreign officials were invited to watch the test on-site . It was the last major public event for Tianwen-1 , however . Since then , the China National Space Administration ( CNSA ) has kept a low profile , and mission scientists have declined or ignored nearly all interview requests .\nShould Tianwen-1 land successfully , its research could illuminate new aspects of Mars . For instance , both the orbiter and the rover are equipped with a ground-penetrating radar to chart geologic layers under the surface . The radar on the orbiter can \u201c see \u201d as deep as a few thousand meters , whereas the instrument on the rover has a shallower view but sharp centimeter-level resolution . \u201c China \u2019 s main goal [ with these radars ] is to explore the water-ice layer \u201d under the planet \u2019 s surface , says Wlodek Kofman of the Institute for Planetary Sciences and Astrophysics of Grenoble in France .\nTianwen-1 \u2019 s ability to measure Mars \u2019 s magnetic field excites Jim Bell of Arizona State University , principal investigator of the main camera on NASA \u2019 s Perseverance rover . One prevailing hypothesis is that the Red Planet used to have a global magnetic field like Earth 's , he says . When its smaller molten iron core cooled down , however , Mars gradually lost this shield , exposing the world to solar wind and radiation , thinning its atmosphere and dooming any water that might have flowed on its surface . Since 2014 NASA \u2019 s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution ( MAVEN ) mission has found ample evidence to support this scenario , but scientists crave a fuller picture . \u201c Tianwen-1 will be very useful in providing more evidence from a different orbit and from the ground , \u201d Bell says . He hopes the Chinese team will share data with the international community piecing together the environmental evolution of Mars .\nTianwen-1 will aim to land in the southern part of Utopia Planitia , a largely flat area between 25 and 30 degrees north of the Martian equator . Geologists have long suspected that this region is covered with ancient mudflows , pointing to stores of bygone water . \u201c It \u2019 s an interesting place to investigate potential past subsurface habitability , \u201d says Alfred McEwen , a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona .\nThe rover \u2019 s chance of finding water beneath Mars might be limited by its latitude , McEwen notes . Because it draws its power from solar panels , it must stay near the equator . Today water ice below the planet \u2019 s surface , most researchers believe , remains mainly at higher and cooler latitudes .\nTianwen-1 \u2019 s reliance on the sun compelled its team to design hardy instruments , says Rong Shu of the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences . \u201c Since our rover does not have radioisotope power , all the instruments need to endure temperatures as low as \u201390 degrees Celsius while at rest , and they operate in the temperature range of \u201340 to \u201330 degrees C , \u201d he adds .\nThe rover 's payload includes the Martian Surface Component Detector ( MarSCoDe ) , whose design was led by Shu .
