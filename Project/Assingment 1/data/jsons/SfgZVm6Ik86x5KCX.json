And they \u2019 re offering a mixed message on Jeff Sessions \u2019 s selections to lead the Department of Justice .\n7 . Only 17 Democrats are publicly opposing Sessions , who could n't get confirmed as a federal judge because of his history of racism \u2014 Judd Legum ( @ JuddLegum ) January 25 , 2017\nMeanwhile , even as congressional Democrats mobilize to stymie Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act , they say they are trying to call Trump \u2019 s bluff on infrastructure spending by introducing their own plan for $ 1 trillion in direct spending , a political tactic Jonathan Chait denounces as \u201c delusional \u201d on the grounds that anything that gives Trump bipartisan cover on anything will boost his popularity .\nIn the pungent words of the New Republic \u2019 s Clio Chang , \u201c Democrats are already screwing this up \u201d \u2014 citing Democrats \u2019 selective willingness to vote yes on some of Trump \u2019 s Cabinet nominees .\nLurking in the background is the accurate perception that Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell orchestrated an unprecedented and successful years-long campaign of obstruction to Barack Obama \u2019 s agenda , a campaign aimed in part at policy victories but largely at delegitimizing the new president and denying him the halo of bipartisanship . Is it really possible that Democrats have learned so little from the success of McConnell \u2019 s \u201c just say nothing \u201d approach ?\nThe reality , however , is that while McConnell certainly did break precedent and certainly did have this kind of strategy , GOP opposition was less across-the-board than it \u2019 s remembered in liberal folk history . Obama passed a number of significant bills with Republican support in his first two years in office , and Democrats have , thus far , been drastically less cooperative with Trump \u2019 s Cabinet nominees than Republicans were with Obama \u2019 s .\nMcConnell \u2019 s success wasn \u2019 t that he literally held his caucus together in unanimous opposition to everything . It \u2019 s that he made sure the political agenda was dominated by the things he was choosing to oppose \u2014 most of all the Affordable Care Act \u2014 rather than the things that divided his caucus . Democrats \u2019 core strategy at the moment is to paint Trump as a closet plutocrat , and to focus on aspects of his agenda that point to tax cuts , financial deregulation , school privatization , and health care cutbacks . And their votes have been consistent with that .\nObama was inaugurated on January 20 , standing in front of a record crowd despite the freezing cold weather . The very next day the Senate confirmed six of his Cabinet secretaries \u2014 Hillary Clinton , Ken Salazar , Tom Vilsack , Steven Chu , Arne Duncan , and Janet Napolitano . Clinton received two no votes , Duncan and Napolitano received so little opposition that Senate only did unrecorded voice votes , and the other three were literally unanimous . The very next day , the Senate unanimously confirmed Obama \u2019 s nominees for HUD , Transportation , Environmental Protection Agency , United Nations ambassador , Securities and Exchange Commission chair , and the Council on Environmental Qualities .\nOther Obama nominees were more controversial but still had plenty of Republican support . Eric Holder , not exactly a conservative favorite , got 19 Republican votes . Hilda Solis got 24 . Ron Kirk got 38 . Tim Geithner got 10 . Kathleen Sebelius ended up being the most contentious nomination , since anti-abortion groups decided to go hard at her , but she still got nine Republican votes .\nAt the time , there were only 40 Republican senators , so that meant about a quarter of the GOP caucus was voting for even the most controversial nominees .\nTrump \u2019 s nominees have received much less support than Obama \u2019 s . Even his least controversial nominees like Defense Secretary James Mattis and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have drawn token opposition from someone looking to make a point .\nObama \u2019 s legislative agenda , of course , met with considerably more resistance . But though his signature creation of a new health care program \u2014 paired with a consequential overhaul of student loans \u2014 was famously passed on a strict party line vote , basically nothing else he did was .\nThat includes a stimulus bill that was backed by three Republicans ( one of whom was later run out of the party as a result and became a Democrat ) and the Dodd-Frank financial regulation overhaul ( backed , like the stimulus , by the two Maine Republicans , this time joined by Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown ) .\nBut there was also a whole raft of less controversial \u2014 but still consequential \u2014 bills that passed with bipartisan majorities :\nBeyond those seven measures , the 111th Congress also passed a series of lower-profile economic stimulus measures \u2014 an employment benefits extension , a payroll tax holiday , the \u201c cash for clunkers \u201d program \u2014 outside of the main stimulus bill , all of which garnered at least a handful of Republican votes .\nTo be clear , Democrats who say that Obama faced an unprecedented level of partisan opposition are not misremembering .\nGeorge W. Bush came into office with a much weaker electoral mandate than Obama , but nonetheless ended up getting a dozen Senate Democrats to vote for his tax cut plan . After the GOP gained seats in the 2002 midterms , Democrats simply chose to allow the GOP to pass a Medicare reform plan without filibustering it , even though the Republicans didn \u2019 t have 60 votes to pass the bill .\nDemocrats were surprised to see that they received no comparable deference on anything . They were also surprised by the GOP leadership \u2019 s determination to simply throw as much sand in the gears as possible of many of these bills \u2014 using extensive delaying tactics even when they didn \u2019 t have the votes to block legislation \u2014 in order to chew up floor time and limit the amount Democrats could accomplish . Republicans also used their filibustering prerogatives to delay or block the confirmation of many sub-Cabinet appointees , often for trivial reasons .\nMost of all , McConnell ensured that the dominant narrative of Obama \u2019 s first year in office was one of highly partisan conflict . The stimulus passed with some GOP votes and was honestly not that substantively different from the Republican alternative . But as the economy continued to deteriorate , Republicans excoriated it as a blunder and a failure . They lured Democrats into a trap on health care , where Chuck Grassley and others maintained a protracted facade of bipartisan negotiations even while party leaders endlessly slagged the reform process . It \u2019 s not that nothing else got done so much as nobody heard about anything else .\nAnd \u2014 with a not-so-trivial helping hand from objectively bleak background economic conditions \u2014 it paid off in the 2010 midterms .\nRepublicans would counter , of course , that this was all merely retaliation for unprecedented Democratic obstruction during the Bush administration . Democrats counter-charge that Bill Clinton faced unprecedented obstruction . Republicans say the real problem was the tactics Democrats used to block Robert Bork \u2019 s Supreme Court confirmation back in the 1980s .\nThe truth is that this is a ratchet that has been shifting for a long time .\nIn the middle of the 20th century , the two political parties did not offer clearly contrasting ideologies . That meant members of Congress generally felt cross-pressured between partisan and ideological imperatives , and it fostered a broadly cooperative atmosphere . For decades now that has been changing , as both parties have become more ideological and thus members of Congress from both parties face more pressure from their respective activist bases to \u201c stand up to \u201d the other side . This means each new president is greeted by a level of uncooperativeness from the opposition party that is genuinely unprecedented .\nThe \u201c Reagan Revolution \u201d of 1981- \u2019 82 was undertaken even though Democrats held a majority in the House of Representatives because Speaker Tip O \u2019 Neil was willing to repeatedly bring Republican bills to the floor that would then pass with the support of a small number of conservative Democrats \u2014 a scenario that is totally unthinkable under today \u2019 s legislative norms .\nDemocrats are responding to the Trump administration by offering \u2014 so far \u2014 an unprecedentedly low level of support for his Cabinet nominees . They are signaling potential willingness to pass an infrastructure spending program that , if it comes together , would essentially amount to Trump coming around to a view Democrats have espoused for years . Meanwhile , there is zero indication of any Democratic support for any Republican Party legislative initiatives to reduce taxes or federal spending .\nGiven the combination of rising polarization , Trump \u2019 s unprecedentedly low approval ratings , and Trump \u2019 s unique personal attributes , an unprecedented lack of cross-party support is probably to be expected . But the ratchet of activist expectations has moved even faster than the ratchet of legislative reality , and consequently Democrats currently find themselves disappointing their own supporters , who want them to adopt a posture of root-and-branch opposition that they mistakenly believe McConnell took eight years ago .",
