The officials said the effort is getting under way as operators try a range of attacks to see what works and what does n't .

Officials said he told commanders that beefing up cyberwarfare against Islamic State was a test for them , and that they should have both the capability and the will to wage the online war .\nBut the military cyber fight is limited by concerns within the intelligence agencies that blocking the group 's Internet access could hurt intelligence gathering .\nOfficials said Carter told commanders that he wanted creative options that would allow the U.S. to impact Islamic State without diminishing the indications or warnings intelligence officers can glean about what the group is doing .\nOn Jan. 27 , Carter and Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , went to Fort Meade for an update .\nOfficials familiar with Carter 's meetings said the secretary was frustrated that as Cyber Command has grown and developed over the past several years , it was still focused on the cyberthreats from nations , such as Iran , Russia and China , rather than building a force to block the communications and propaganda campaigns of Internet-savvy insurgents .\n`` He was right to say they could be more forward leaning about what they could possibly do against ISIS , '' said James Lewis , a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . `` You could disrupt their support networks , their business networks , their propaganda and recruitment networks .
