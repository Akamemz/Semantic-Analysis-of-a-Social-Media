    "content": "The Republican race for the presidential nomination is down to just one man and one number : Donald Trump and 1,237 \u2014 the number of delegates required to clinch the nomination . Can Trump win 1,237 delegates by the end of the primary season on June 7 ? Will he be forced to plunder among the more than 100 unbound or currently uncommitted delegates who will make the trip to Cleveland in order to win on a first ballot at the Republican National Convention ? Or are we all but assured of a multi-ballot convention ?\nAny pundit giving confident answers to these questions is full of it , so \u2588\u2588\u2588 surveyed some of the best delegate obsessives and political experts we know on how many delegates they expect Trump to win in the remaining contests . Trump has 695 delegates now , and , on average , our respondents estimate he will still be just a little bit short of 1,237 on June 7 , when California wraps up the primary calendar . He might be close enough , though , that he could clinch the nomination in the six weeks between California and Cleveland .\nIf that \u2019 s the baseline case , however , it wouldn \u2019 t take much for Trump to deviate from it in either direction . Outperform these estimates in California , for instance , and Trump could reach or surpass 1,237 delegates on June 7 . Lose a winner-take-all or winner-take-most state where these estimates have him favored , however , and Trump could be well short of a majority .\nThere are few truly proportional states left on the GOP \u2019 s primary calendar , so small shifts in any state can have major consequences in the delegate count . That \u2019 s why we surveyed this group . My own personal delegate projection took a beating Tuesday because I thought Ted Cruz would win Missouri by a small amount instead of losing it by a small amount .\nIn addition to Nate Silver \u2019 s and my estimates , we tried to include a diverse set of opinions from across the political spectrum . We also focused on analysts who have been following the delegate race closely and know the intricacies of the GOP \u2019 s delegate rules . Our panel included these people :\nAdam Geller : founder and CEO of National Research Inc. and the lead pollster for Chris Christie \u2019 s presidential campaign\nDaniel Nichanian : contributing editor to Daily Kos Elections and PhD candidate in political science at the University of Chicago .\nHenry Olsen : senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center\nPatrick Ruffini : co-founder and partner at Echelon Insights and chairman and founder of Engage\nDavid Wasserman : House editor at the Cook Political Report and \u2588\u2588\u2588 contributor\nTo best reflect the group consensus , we used an \u201c olympic average \u201d in which we discarded the highest and lowest estimates in each state and averaged the remainder . Because of this averaging process \u2014 and because we told panelists they could list probabilistic forecasts instead of deterministic ones \u2014 in some cases the average reflects a number of delegates that it would be mathematically impossible for Trump to achieve . For instance , our average has Trump with 15 delegates in winner-take-all Delaware , which has 16 delegates at stake . This is equivalent to saying that Trump is highly likely but not quite certain to win Delaware , according to the panel .\nOverall , our average response suggests that Trump will win 513 delegates the rest of the way . When combined with the 695 he \u2019 s won so far , that means he \u2019 d fall 29 delegates short of the 1,237 needed to win on the first ballot . Here is the olympic average for each upcoming contest ( we \u2019 ve left out some contests with only unbound delegates ; see the footnotes for more detail ) :\nDELEGATES DATE CONTEST AVAILABLE PROJECTED FOR TRUMP 3/22 Arizona 58 58 Utah 40 4 American Samoa 9 2 4/5 Wisconsin 42 25 4/9 Colorado 34 7 4/16 Wyoming 14 1 4/19 New York 95 71 4/26 Maryland 38 31 Connecticut 28 19 Rhode Island 19 10 Pennsylvania 17 16 Delaware 16 15 5/3 Indiana 57 37 5/10 Nebraska 36 1 West Virginia 34 33 5/17 Oregon 28 12 5/24 Washington 44 17 6/7 California 172 93 New Jersey 51 51 South Dakota 29 0 Montana 27 0 New Mexico 24 10 New Trump delegates 513 Delegates to date 695 Total 1,208 How many more delegates will Donald Trump win ? Trump projections based on an olympic average of estimates from Nate Silver , Harry Enten , Adam Geller ( National Research Inc. ) , Daniel Nichanian ( Daily Kos ) , Henry Olsen ( Ethics and Public Policy Center ) , Margie Omero ( Purple Insights ) , Patrick\nIf Trump does , in fact , get 1,208 delegates , he still might win on a first ballot . He would need only a fraction of the delegates that are currently unbound ( or will be unbound ) to reach 1,237 .\nWho exactly are these unbound or uncommitted delegates ? Some , like the six from the Virgin Islands , were elected by voters to be \u201c uncommitted , \u201d but they may commit to a candidate closer to the convention . Others , like the 54 Pennsylvania district delegates , are automatically unbound and have been elected as unbound for decades ( see : when Gerald Ford beat Ronald Reagan in the 1976 primary ) . These delegates are free to choose whichever candidate they want on all ballots . In addition , some delegates from candidates who have withdrawn from the race may become available to Trump , depending on the state \u2019 s rules . Although it \u2019 s hard to know Trump \u2019 s exact chance of getting 29 delegates from this group , Trump probably would have a decent shot at reaching 1,237 .\nAll of the respondents agree that Trump is not likely to get close to 1,237 delegates before June 7 , when California and four other states vote . The closest Trump came was 1,088 delegates . And even the most optimistic Trump projection has him hitting 1,244 after all the states have voted . That leaves Trump with very little room for error to reach a majority of delegates without at least some of the currently unpledged or uncommitted delegates coming to his aid .\nPart of the reason we \u2019 ll have to wait so long is how the rest of the calendar breaks down . The month of April , which includes a lot of primaries in the Northeast , should be good for Trump . May has far fewer contests , and Trump is expected to do poorly in Nebraska , Oregon and Washington .\nNot surprisingly , our respondents \u2019 estimates differed greatly in a number of states . If you \u2019 re looking for the states that could be make-or-break for Trump , then look to Wisconsin , New York , Indiana and California . In all four , Trump \u2019 s expected number of delegates won differed by at least 36 among the respondents .\nWisconsin ( April 5 ) : Forty-two delegates are at stake , and it \u2019 s winner-take-all on the congressional district and state level . Trump led in the most recent poll , but with only 30 percent , and he had a very high unfavorable rating .\n( April 5 ) : Forty-two delegates are at stake , and it \u2019 s winner-take-all on the congressional district and state level .
