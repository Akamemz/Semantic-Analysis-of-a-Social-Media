    "content": "For years , tensions had been boiling between the hard right of the Republican Party and the House leadership , a battle that effectively pushed Speaker John Boehner out of office and ended the bid of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to succeed him .\nBut Ryan , facing skepticism from hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus , spoke bluntly to the conservatives , telling them that he was more ideologically in line with them than with moderates in the so-called Tuesday Group . He said he was not the type of leader who is out to seek retribution , unlike past leaders .\nThe 45-year-old Wisconsin congressman said he would only push important bills such as immigration that have a majority of support from Republicans -- abiding by the `` Hastert Rule . '' He promised bold policy ideas on the House floor like welfare reform , health care legislation and a tax overhaul -- and that the chamber would stand firm on those policy proposals with Senate Republicans and the White House . He softened his demand to roll back a procedure allowing lawmakers to overthrow a sitting speaker .\nAnd perhaps the most disarming pitch : He said he was ready to walk away if they said 'no ' to him .\nWhat he achieved was a truce between disgruntled conservatives and a GOP leadership desperate to get the House back on track . It 's a ceasefire in a long-running intra-party war that has cost the Republicans Senate seats , bottled up legislation in Congress and weakened their hand against President Barack Obama .\nWith his national profile and bona fides with the right , Ryan was perhaps the only Republican who could make that pitch , showcasing strength that will immediately be put to the test when he 's expected to be elected speaker next week .\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio , the chairman of the Freedom Caucus , said a Ryan pitch that won him over was : `` Go early and be firm '' -- the idea that the House would stand on its principles in fights with the other body .\n`` Find a policy , take a position as a conference and make the Senate do something to stand firm , '' Jordan said , paraphrasing Ryan .\nAfter the conservative caucus announced it would support him -- but not endorse him -- Ryan later won over the two other coalitions in the House : The Tuesday Group and the Republican Study Committee , another conservative faction . By Thursday evening , Ryan made it official : He was running for speaker , telling his colleagues in a letter he was `` eager '' to do the job .\n`` I never thought I 'd be speaker , '' Ryan said in a statement . `` But I pledged to you that if I could be a unifying figure , then I would serve -- I would go all in . After talking with so many of you , and hearing your words of encouragement , I believe we are ready to move forward as one , united team . And I am ready and eager to be our speaker . ''\nIt 's a dramatic political twist for Ryan , the GOP 's vice presidential nominee in 2012 and someone who thoroughly enjoys his policy-heavy role as the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee .\nIn the immediate aftermath of McCarthy 's sudden decision earlier this month to drop out of the speaker race , Ryan appeared to be doing everything he could not to run . Moments after McCarthy dropped out during a meeting in the ornate Ways and Means Committee Room earlier this month , Ryan grabbed Rep. John Kline of Minnesota and told him to take the top job instead .\n`` He spun around and almost choked me and said , 'Kline you got ta do this , ' '' Kline recalled Thursday . `` I knew then , and I think Paul knew then , he really had to be the guy . ''\nRyan knew his life would change moments before McCarthy made his bombshell announcement . He was slated to give the nominating speech to McCarthy in the conference , but instead got a heads-up that those remarks would n't be necessary . The majority leader instead urged Ryan to consider a bid .\nMcCarthy knew Ryan was reluctant , but he immediately began to figure out what he could do to help , according to people familiar with the matter .\nThere was discussion about divvying up responsibilities , but also about redefining the role of the speaker . Ryan envisioned being a more prominent face for the party -- someone willing to deliver the message in the media , and spreading out some of the fundraising and operational duties to other members of the leadership team .\nMcCarthy served as a counselor to Ryan throughout the process . He had a partial playbook already in hand since he had previously met with House GOP members , especially the conservatives in the Freedom Caucus , and had a good read on their concerns about shifting to a more `` bottom-up '' process .\nAnd since Ryan did n't want the job , many conservatives in the caucus seemed to believe him that he would n't try to make the speakership more powerful . Conservatives had long complained too much power resided in the leadership office , and it would be a non-starter for a candidate who wanted to centralize more power . It remains , of course , to be seen how Ryan operates over the long-term .\n`` My question is who in their right mind would ever want that job ? '' said Rep. Barry Loudermilk , R-Georgia , a member of the Freedom Caucus . `` We ca n't survive another eight years like the ones we just had . We wo n't recover from that . He 's willing to put his own self on the line . ''\nAfter the Freedom Caucus voted Wednesday to support Ryan , but not officially endorse him -- which was one of his preconditions for taking the job -- there was little option for Ryan to walk away . While they left themselves some room to say they still had issues with Ryan 's conditions , they were also aware in their internal discussions that if they blocked yet another candidate - and one who had majority support - they would be overplaying their hand .\nAsked why he was confident Ryan would be elected speaker next week , McCarthy told reporters flatly , `` when I ran , 80 % of the Freedom Caucus was against me . Now they 're not . ''\nRyan 's problems , however , are bound to grow with the right as soon as he takes the gavel -- namely on two matters : Fiscal issues and his desire to make it harder to overthrow a sitting speaker .\nOn the latter , there 's no agreement between him and the Freedom Caucus . But he clarified his demand by saying he only wants to `` change '' the rule -- not eliminate it . And he agreed to consider the matter later as part of other rules changes the caucus has sought to enact in order to give the rank-and-file a bigger say .\n`` We are not changing this fundamental right that members have relative to the 'motion to vacate , ' '' Jordan told CNN . `` We 're not for that . We made that very clear . ''\nRyan was not pressed on many policy matters , but will have to weigh in on the contentious issue of raising the national debt ceiling as early as next week -- and extending government funding past Dec. 11 . But he promised that immigration reform , an idea he has been warm to in the past , would not be a measure he would pursue in a Ryan speakership .\nAs he continued to dither about taking the speakership , Republicans began looking for alternatives -- and a growing number looked at Kline , a back-slapping pol who likes to smoke cigars .\n`` I 'd be able to drink and smoke in the speaker 's office for another year , '' Cole said , referring to Boehner 's penchant for puffing cigarettes .\nAfter next Thursday , he will likely have to ask Paul Ryan .",
