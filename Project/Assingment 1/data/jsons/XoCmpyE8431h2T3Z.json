Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Mary Burke receiving the support of 46 percent of registered voters , while 6 percent are undecided or say they do not know whom they would support .

Walker split this crucial demographic down the middle ( 48/48 ) . Now , he 's underwater by an alarming margin ( 49/41 ) .

Now it \u2019 s true that he \u2019 s expanded his lead ( 49/42 ) among voters 45 and older , but at some point he \u2019 ll need to tap into the youth vote if he wants to win re-election this fall .\nName Recognition : The last time Marquette 's pollsters surveyed this race most respondents didn \u2019 t even know who Mary Burke was .
