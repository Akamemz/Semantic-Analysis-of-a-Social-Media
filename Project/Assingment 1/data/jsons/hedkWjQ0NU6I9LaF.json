    "content": "In a landmark decision , the US Supreme Court on Friday ruled that gay men and lesbians enjoy a fundamental right to marry and that none of the 50 states has the power to defy that constitutional guarantee of freedom and equal protection .\nIn a 5-to-4 decision , the high court issued the constitutional equivalent of a grand-slam homerun for same-sex couples across the United States .\n\u201c The right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person , and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty , \u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion .\n\u201c The court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry , \u201d he declared . \u201c No longer may this liberty be denied to them . \u201d\nThe high court also ruled that in addition to issuing licenses to same-sex couples , all 50 states must recognize the legitimacy of same-sex marriages performed in any other state .\nCurrently , 37 states recognize same-sex marriages , while 13 states had maintained the traditional definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman .\nThe high court decision represents a major advance for civil and equal rights for the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) community . It marks the continued emergence of that community from its closeted , second-class existence for much of human history . And it establishes a firm legal foundation upon which gay rights advocates will push for broader freedoms , equality , and protections .\nAt the same time , Justice Kennedy \u2019 s majority opinion marks a significant setback for conservatives seeking to maintain the federalist structure of government . Rather than allowing the contentious social issue of marriage to be decided by the people and their elected representatives on a state-by-state basis , the high court decided instead to constitutionalize the issue of same-sex marriage and answer the question itself .\nThe dissenting justices predict that that court \u2019 s actions in cutting off democratic debate over the issue will inflame opposition , rather than lead to national healing and greater tolerance . In addition , the decision sets the stage for more contentious battles ahead between gay rights activists and religious and social conservatives , they warn .\n\u201c When decisions are reached through democratic means , some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results . But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say , and accordingly are \u2013 in the tradition of our political culture \u2013 reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate , \u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a dissenting opinion .\nThat democratic dynamic was cut short by the majority decision , the chief justice said .\n\u201c By deciding this question under the Constitution , the court removes it from the realm of democratic decision , \u201d Roberts said . \u201c There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound significance . Closing debate tends to close minds . \u201d\nKennedy dismissed such concerns . \u201c Of course , the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change , \u201d he said , \u201c so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rights . \u201d\nWhen fundamental rights are at stake , he said , the court has a duty to address the issue .\nKennedy said that marriage was a keystone of the social order in America and that it was intolerable to exclude gay men and lesbians from full participation in that order .\n\u201c It demeans gays and lesbians for the state to lock them out of a central institution of the nation \u2019 s society , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just , but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is not manifest , \u201d Kennedy said . \u201c With that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding same-sex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charter . \u201d\nIn his dissent , Chief Justice Roberts called the majority decision \u201c an act of will , not legal judgment . \u201d\n\u201c The right it announces has no basis in the Constitution or this court \u2019 s precedent , \u201d he said .\n\u201c If you are among the many Americans \u2013 of whatever sexual orientation \u2013 who favor expanding same-sex marriage , by all means celebrate today \u2019 s decision , \u201d the chief justice said .\n\u201c Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal . Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner . Celebrate the availability of new benefits , \u201d Roberts said .\n\u201c But do not celebrate the Constitution , \u201d he said . \u201c It had nothing to with it . \u201d\nThe chief justice said the Constitution leaves to the people and their elected representatives the authority to define marriage .\n\u201c The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a state change its definition of marriage . And a state \u2019 s decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational , \u201d Roberts said .\n\u201c In short , our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage .
