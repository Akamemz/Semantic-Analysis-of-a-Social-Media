But many report having health care problems .\nAbout a third of immigrant respondents ( 31 percent ) said they 'd had a serious problem with being able to pay for health insurance in the past 12 months . And more than 1 in 4 had a serious problem affording doctor and hospital bills and prescription medicines .\nBut the health issue that Latinos said is most concerning for them and their families \u2014 whether they were born in the U.S. or immigrated here \u2014 is diabetes . Last year , in another poll , Latinos said cancer was the biggest problem facing the country .\nHispanic populations have a high prevalence of Type 2 diabetes . About 10 percent of Latino adults have been diagnosed with it or have `` prediabetes , '' a stage of the disease that often goes undetected .\nOne important factor : Latinos may be genetically predisposed to the disease \u2014 a risk that can be aggravated by environment and diet .\nTake the example of East Los Angeles , an area heavily populated by Mexican-Americans .\nLike many of her friends and family members , Rebecca Martinez-Rocha says she struggles with her weight . At one point , she weighed more than 320 pounds .\n`` I do n't think I realized it at the time , whether it was denial or I stopped getting on a scale , '' she says , `` but I was morbidly obese . ''\nAnd , as it turns out , Martinez-Rocha was prediabetic , a diagnosis she received at a local health clinic .\n`` I was n't aware of the fact that I was ill ; I figured that I was relatively young , in my 20s and early 30s , '' she says . `` It was kind of one of those 'aha ' moments in life , where you look at it and put it all together and you think , 'How did I get here ? ' ``\nThe doctor who diagnosed Martinez-Rocha 's condition is Anne Peters , a diabetes specialist and professor at University of Southern California 's Keck School of Medicine . She 's also the director of a diabetes program at Roybal Comprehensive Health Center .\nPeters says Type 2 diabetes is the `` plague '' of the Latino community she treats : `` Individuals here are getting diabetes at rates we 've not seen before . ''\nAbout 12 percent of the Latino population she sees has diabetes . Peters projects that number will climb to nearly 30 percent over the next few decades if nothing changes in the environment or diet of local residents .\nPeters told Martinez-Rocha she was on her way to getting insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes . Martinez-Rocha says she got very scared and made major changes . She lost 160 pounds .\nBut many patients do n't do that , in large part because prediabetes is often `` silent . '' Unless people go to a doctor and get their blood sugar measured , they 'll never know they have it .\nAnd that 's a shame , Peters says , because prediabetes can be turned around . `` If somebody has prediabetes , they need to lose weight \u2014 not a lot of weight , maybe only 10 to 15 pounds , '' she says .\nThey `` do n't have to become skinny '' to benefit , she adds . Studies show that moderate weight loss can reduce diabetes risk by half .\nLosing weight is hard for many people . But Martinez-Rocha says it 's even harder when you live in a neighborhood that offers lots of high-fat , high-salt and high-sugar food .\n`` If you drive around my neighborhood , every corner you 'll see a taco stand , a fast-food restaurant , a sweet-bread store , places selling tamales or fried food , '' Martinez-Rocha says .\nIn NPR 's poll with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health , 1 in 5 Mexican-Americans rated the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in their neighborhoods as fair or poor .\nAlex Ortega , a public health researcher and professor of public health at UCLA , calls neighborhoods like this , where healthy food is hard to come by , `` food swamps . ''\nWalk into the typical corner market , he says , and the first things you 'll see are signs for liquor and lottery tickets , cigarettes , soda and chips . `` They might sell some fruits and vegetables , but they 're typically in the back of the store and in very poor quality , '' Ortega says .\nOur survey found that Latino immigrants generally do not perceive their diets as less healthy in the U.S. : 38 percent see their diet as healthier in the United States , and about the same number ( 39 percent ) say it 's about as healthy . One in 5 ( 21 percent ) see their diet as less healthy .\nPrevious studies have shown that obesity rates among immigrants increase as their duration of residence in the U.S. increases . They suggest this might be attributable in part to changes in lifestyle , including an unhealthy diet .\nOrtega is committed to turning the Latino diet around . As director of the UCLA-USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities , Ortega is heading a project to convert corner stores in low-income neighborhoods .\nAbout a month ago , Ortega , along with community activists , local high school students and store owner Maria Avila , transformed the Euclid Market in the Boyle Heights section of East Los Angeles . They added windows and a new paint job , and rearranged and organized shelving .
