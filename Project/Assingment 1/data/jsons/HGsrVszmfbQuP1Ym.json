In 2015 , the GOP held a 21-point lead with them . But among whites with a college degree , the numbers have moved sharply in the other direction . Democrats and Republicans drew equal support among that group in 2015 , 47 percent identified with each party . But in the latest data whites with a college degree leaned Democratic by 12 points .\nMany of those college-educated voters are the \u201c suburban white women \u201d you keep hearing about , who voted overwhelmingly for Democrats in 2018 . That gender gap has widened into a canyon . ( In 2015 , Democrats had a 12-point advantage with women ; now Democrats have a 18-point lead . ) Simply put , the anti-science , white grievance , bully-boy politics of the Republican Party under President Trump turns off people who do not want to be viewed as uneducated , racist or mean . It turns out that is a very broad coalition .\nThe policy shift also favors Democrats . For the first time , you have a significant majority of white Americans who think there is a need for systemic change . Coupled with the preference of most Americans for more government ( spurred in part by the need for government action to battle the coronavirus and the ensuing economic recession ) , the party that is aligned with addressing racial inequity and that believes government can be a force for good has a huge advantage . Republicans anti-government ethos is entirely ill-suited to the time .\nDemocrats may have the voters and the ideological consensus not only to win big in November ( a sweep of the House and Senate majorities and the White House is a distinct possibility ) but also to drive a progressive agenda on criminal justice , health care , economic opportunity and education . Democrats will need to address several issues if they are to not only win big but also govern boldly .\nFirst , I suspect the Senate filibuster is on thinner ice than ever before . If Democrats win big ( claiming the White House and the Senate majority ) , they will be in no mood to see an entire agenda stymied by a minority of senators from red states . I personally have grave reservations about doing away with the filibuster , but concern about minority rights is likely to be subsumed by enthusiasm for an aggressive agenda , one that might include some systemic changes in voting rights ( automatic registration , voting by mail available in all 50 states , an end to voter ID laws , etc . ) that would help Democrats down the road .\nSecond , if Democrats want to pass their proposals and lock in Democratic majorities for decades ( as Franklin D. Roosevelt did ) , they will need to hold to the center-left where , not coincidentally , former vice president Joe Biden put himself . The public wants reform and change , but it is far from clear whether they want a radical agenda . Expanding Obamacare rather than doing away with it , creating a tax reform bill that undoes the excesses of the Trump era and equalizes the rates for capital gains and salary income , offering free community college tuition and advocating significant reforms in policing , sentencing and pot legalization would gain broad support . The Democrats will run into trouble if they put their energies into items such as single-payer health care .
