It hadn \u2019 t been two months since the hyper-public , tabloid-tawdry revelation that his philandering had shattered his marriage to the mother of his first three children . He and his executives were grappling with the flawed , frantic opening of the newest , gaudiest , most expensive and most debt-bloated of his three casinos in Atlantic City .

Even in Trump \u2019 s perma-perilous presidency , this is a juncture that pulses with risk . Newly empowered Democrats in Congress are ramping up multiple investigations , and talk of impeachment is impossible to avoid . Looming largest over this tumultuous battlefield , though , is the report special counsel Robert Mueller appears poised to submit to Attorney General William Barr\u2014the culmination of nearly two years of labor and the subject of immeasurable speculation . While Trump often awards himself and his administration \u201c A-plus \u201d grades , many others question whether he will be able to sustain his rosy self-assessment once the details of Mueller \u2019 s findings become public .\nEvery flurry of tweets from the president\u2014and last weekend \u2019 s two-day grievance bender against late-night comedy and cable news shows was a particularly strong example\u2014begets new pronouncements that Trump is coming unglued from the strain .

Armed with extraordinary audacity , constitutional sangfroid , a stomach for tumult , an acumen for recasting obvious losses into strange sorts of wins , and the prodigious safety net bequeathed by his wealthy , wily father , he has plowed past myriad hazards . And he did it by tying himself tightly to his bankers and lenders in New York and to gaming industry regulators in New Jersey\u2014who let him live large until they couldn \u2019 t let him die without fatally wounding themselves . He effectively inhabited hosts , using them to get bigger and bigger in the \u2019 80s until he was practically perversely invincible by the \u2019 90s\u2014not only \u201c too big to fail , \u201d as the late Wayne Barrett once told Susan Glasser and me , but \u201c too big to jail . \u201d\nPerhaps his past escapes are the reason he appears oddly calm as most of the country leans forward , awaiting word of bombshells from Mueller .

But if he does fail , pinned to account by the weight of evidence uncovered by Mueller , one thing is certain : It will be the first time .\nThose who believe in the power of Trump \u2019 s survival skills to protect him from even this unprecedented threat draw an analogy between the Republican Party\u2014its members of Congress and especially the Senate\u2014and the institutions that have enabled him in the past .\n\u201c The banks were heavily invested in Trump , and they couldn \u2019 t have him go down , \u201d former Trump campaign staffer Sam Nunberg told me , \u201c and the Republican Party can \u2019 t have him go down . \u201d\n\u201c I think he believes that the presidency is too big to fail , too powerful to be taken down , \u201d O \u2019 Donnell added . \u201c And I think that this is kind of something that he learned in the \u2018 90s , where the banks basically said to him , \u2018 You \u2019 re too big to fail , we have to back you. \u2019 And they did it , time and time again , in Atlantic City . \u201d\nTo be determined in the coming weeks and months : how well those lessons will hold up .\n\u201c This is a man who has lived dangerously for decades by flirting with the boundaries of propriety , legality and civility , \u201d Trump biographer Tim O \u2019 Brien told me . \u201c And he is now faced , after years and years of getting away with it , with consequences that are far beyond anything he \u2019 s encountered before . \u2026 The things that I think have allowed him to survive in the past will be of practical , personal use here in terms of him maintaining a stiff upper lip , if he \u2019 s able to. \u201d But the more material applicability of the Machiavellian takeaways from his \u2018 90s scrapes ? \u201c I think they \u2019 re going to be absolutely of no use if the legal consequences are realized at their full magnitude . \u201d\n\u201c No matter what they do , he survives . No matter what they try , he survives , \u201d longtime New York Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf told me . \u201c Can Trump survive this ? He absolutely can . \u201d\nIn the middle of 1990 , after all , he was more than $ 3 billion in the red . He had for years spent too much to buy too much , all with mostly borrowed money . The yacht , the airline , Manhattan \u2019 s Plaza Hotel . \u201c Trophies , \u201d he called them . And his casinos , first two , now three with the lurching launch of the Trump Taj Mahal , cannibalized each other . Even record rakes of cash weren \u2019 t enough to simply service all of Trump \u2019 s debt . On the horizon was the first of his six corporate bankruptcies .\n\u201c Trump is on his way down\u2014and probably out , \u201d business journalist Allan Sloan wrote that June in Newsday .\nPeople didn \u2019 t stop at mere predictions . They also poked fun .\n\u201c I envision Donald Trump a year from now doing the ads for stomach-flatteners or ginsu knives on late-night TV . Or as a Worldwide Wrestling Federation commentator , \u201d Gail Collins , then a columnist for the New York Daily News , told David Von Drehle , then a reporter for the Miami Herald .\nVanity Fair editor Tina Brown likened Trump to late-in-life Elvis . \u201c He probably will wind up in that sort of Graceland , you know , wearing a diaper , \u201d she told Steve Kroft of CBS News .\nSpy , the puckish satirical magazine and inveterate needler of Trump , in its August 1990 issue took a tongue-in-cheek look at what they foresaw as a sad , middling future for a balding , paunchy Trump . Their crystal ball , though , was not all wrong . They anticipated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing , and a rough version of reality television , too\u2014and a public offering that would permit Trump to use money from shareholders to make money of his own ( \u201c Now YOU can own a piece of the Trump ! \u201d ) .\nBut beyond the smart set \u2019 s schadenfreude were Trump \u2019 s real-life results .\nAfter weeks of negotiations , the cluster of 70-some-odd banks that had loaned him billions of dollars gave him an additional $ 65 million loan . It was the first in a yearslong sequence of bailouts and extensions and breathing-room reprieves . They had loaned him so much money , it was no longer only his problem\u2014it was theirs . He all but dared them to take him down . \u201c He has a good bit of leverage over the institutions , \u201d a Harvard Business School finance professor told the Boston Globe at the time . \u201c His adjusted net worth is minus several hundred million dollars , by my estimate , and he is alive only because his bankers are too red-faced to pull the plug on his life-support system , \u201d the chairman of a money management firm wrote in the New York Post . \u201c The most important thing , \u201d an official in the office of one of his lenders said in The American Banker , \u201c is to make Trump survive . \u201d\nThe banks over time clawed back a passel of Trump \u2019 s possessions ( the yacht , the planes , the Plaza ) , but they didn \u2019 t take his casinos\u2014because they didn \u2019 t want them . \u201c The last thing they want to do is manage casinos , \u201d an analyst from Moody \u2019 s Investors explained to the Associated Press . And the last thing the gaming officials and city leaders in New Jersey wanted was to have them close . The relationship was the same as with the banks back in New York . Desperate to prop up the flagging gaming industry , looking continually to the casinos to inject into the struggling seaside town at least the appearance of vitality and prosperity , they needed Trump as much as Trump needed them . A prerequisite to owning a casino in Atlantic City , understandably , was financial stability , and regulators could have stripped Trump of his\u2014repeatedly\u2014but of course didn \u2019 t . Trump \u2019 s casinos amounted to roughly a third of the market . \u201c The whole economic development of the town , \u201d said O \u2019 Donnell , \u201c it was dependent on this . And so they just\u2014they caved . \u201d\nTrump had managed to turn an apparent weakness into a significant advantage . The banks put him on an allowance \u2026 of $ 450,000 a month . The Trump Tower triplex was safe .\n\u201c The man is a Sherman tank in a Brioni suit , \u201d New York Post gossip columnist and Trump pal Cindy Adams told USA Today .\n\u201c Hey , look , I had a cold spell from 1990 to \u2019 91 , \u201d he said in 1994 in New York . \u201c I was beat up in business and in my personal life . \u2026 But you learn that you \u2019 re either the toughest , meanest piece of shit in the world , or you just crawl into a corner , put your finger in your mouth , and say , \u2018 I want to go home. \u2019 \u201d And Trump didn \u2019 t want to go home .\nHe wasn \u2019 t entirely in the clear , though , until 1995 and \u2019 96 , when his need for money finally superseded his desire for absolute control and he took his casinos public . He sat in his office and looked at O \u2019 Brien , then a reporter for the Wall Street Journal . He was \u201c back , \u201d he said . People bought stock in Trump and lost money in droves . Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts proved to be a good investment for just one person\u2014Trump . \u201c It was to get other people to get him out of that debt , \u201d a former member of the Trump Organization told me . In addition to his selling of his stake in his foundation-laying Grand Hyatt and tens of millions of dollars of wrangled , well-timed loans from family trusts , it \u2019 s what saved Trump\u2014along with a partnership with Hong Kong investors that turned his long-held plot of land on the Upper West Side that always cost him money into one that began to actually make him money . Construction on what would have been Trump City and now would be called Trump Place ( and then wouldn \u2019 t ) started in 1997 . And two years later , in front of some of the buildings , Trump let the magician David Blaine get \u201c buried alive \u201d for a week in a plexiglass coffin . It was , said Blaine , a stunt famed illusionist Harry Houdini always wanted to do . For Trump , the publicity ploy made for an apt ode to the art of escape .\nTrumpologists and culture critics frequently cite showman P.T . Barnum as Trump \u2019 s preeminent antecedent , but another , less noted inspiration was Houdini , the author of a forthcoming Houdini biography told me . \u201c He always found\u2014especially when it just seemed like it was over for him\u2014he found some new chapter , and some new way to sort of get his success going again , \u201d Joe Posnanski said . \u201c He created this handcuff act , and the handcuff act becomes huge , and then that sort of runs its course . And then he comes up with the milk can , and the milk can sort of runs its course . And he comes up with the Chinese water torture cell , and that runs his course . And he starts hanging upside down and escaping from straitjackets . \u201d\n\u201c With Trump , you just think , \u2018 OK , this is it . This is totally it , you know ? \u2019 \u201d he said . \u201c He \u2019 s bankrupt , people are laughing at him , he \u2019 s this , he \u2019 s that\u2014but it \u2019 s never over for him . \u201d\n\u201c Trump , \u201d said Sheinkopf , the Democratic strategist , \u201c is incessantly pulling Houdini acts . \u201d\nRecall all the \u201c gaffes \u201d that were to have torpedoed his indelicate , unorthodox 2016 presidential bid\u2014peaking , of course , with the \u201c Access Hollywood \u201d tape revealed in early October in which he swaggered about sexual assault .\nThose who predict Trump will ultimately fall don \u2019 t disagree that he has benefited from well-placed safety nets before . This time is different , they insist , because his high-wire act is being performed at unprecedented heights .\n\u201c Significantly higher , \u201d O \u2019 Brien said . \u201c He \u2019 s been on a financial tightrope , and a familial tightrope , but he \u2019 s never been on a legal tightrope like this one . Not even close . This is fundamentally new because of the legal consequences , and those legal consequences don \u2019 t end with the filing of the Mueller report . He still has issues that are still very serious in the Southern District of New York ; in some ways , they may be more serious than the Mueller investigation in terms of potential consequences and how far they dig into his world . \u201d\nBandy Lee is worried . The forensic psychiatrist from Yale has studied thousands of people with the mental disorders she perceives Trump has . Their behavior , untreated , had predictable and unpleasant results . She foresees a similar unraveling for Trump , albeit with a wild card she has never encountered in any of her patients : the awesome power of the commander in chief .\n\u201c Under stress , we can see the limits of one \u2019 s ability to cope , and we can see that the president has reached his limits fairly rapidly , in terms of not being able to sit with the advancing special counsel \u2019 s investigation . You can see there is a heightening of activity and creation of crises , distractions , if you will , in order to distract both themselves as well as the public away from the bad news he is continuing to receive , \u201d Lee said .\n\u201c He has very poor coping mechanisms when he is criticized or when he feels humiliated , \u201d she continued , \u201c and at these points , he generally goes into attack mode , and he threatens others or tries to get revenge . \u201d\nOur conversation took place before Trump resurrected his feud with the late John McCain , but I couldn \u2019 t help thinking of Lee \u2019 s warning as I listened to the president on Wednesday belabor his grudge before a crowd of workers who were expecting some good news on the economy , not a hit job on a war hero . Maybe this , just like the days of name-calling with George Conway , really are the signs of a mind in turmoil .\nAnd yet\u2014and this is just the reality of the record\u2014Trump shrewdly , bullheadedly , even blithely pushed past crises in the \u2018 90s that would have felled almost anybody else . And then , perhaps convinced of his own invincibility , he blew through a litany of accepted social and political checkpoints on his way to the Oval Office and his high-backed chair behind the Resolute desk .\n\u201c Pressure , \u201d Trump said in an extended interview in Playboy in 1990 , \u201c doesn \u2019 t upset my sleep . \u2026 I like throwing balls into the air\u2014and I dream like a baby . \u201d\nThat same year , on June 14 , he turned 44 . The next day , he missed about $ 45 million in debt payments for his casino called Trump Castle . \u201c He is absolutely on knife \u2019 s edge , \u201d James Grant , the editor of Grant \u2019 s Interest Rate Observer , told Newsday . The day after that , Trump had a party . More than a thousand employees in Atlantic City showed up at the bash on the boardwalk , according to news reports . \u201c We love you , Donald ! \u201d they cried . He was presented with a chocolate cupcake , a 12-page birthday card and an 8-foot-by-10-foot portrait of himself .\n\u201c Nobody wants to write the positives , \u201d Trump told the cheering crowd . \u201c Over the years , I \u2019 ve surprised a lot of people . The largest surprise is yet to come . \u201d",

The back-and-forth with Zahn is an instructive (and comforting?) reminder about overstating Trump\u2019s fragility. The Trump campaign in 2015 and \u201916 careened from kill shot to kill shot, of course, and just kept going, right to the White House\u2014and that was not the first time he flashed his ability to mitigate calamity and deftly skirt what might have seemed like an inevitable comeuppance. Whether or not Trump could remain not only financially solvent but reputationally intact was an open question for the entirety of the first half of the 1990s. So many times, he could have been snuffed, stopped, rendered a relative footnote, his place in the history of this country limited to status as a gauche totem of a regrettable epoch of greed. That, needless to say, is not how the tale played out. Trump is many things. A developer. A promoter. A master media manipulator. A grown-old rich kid. The president of the United States. Above all else, though, he is a survivor.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate survivor,\u201d former Trump casino executive Jack O\u2019Donnell told me recently.\n\nTrump\u2019s Trophies: Trump had a tendency to spend on things he couldn\u2019t afford\u2014like his Manhattan Plaza Hotel, left, a luxury yacht, top right, and his 1989 airline Trump Shuttle, bottom left\u2014mostly with borrowed money. | AP Images, AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler, JetPix/Wikimedia Commons\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that Trump has survived that\u2019s important to consider at this moment\u2014it\u2019s how he has done it. Armed with extraordinary audacity, constitutional sangfroid, a stomach for tumult, an acumen for recasting obvious losses into strange sorts of wins, and the prodigious safety net bequeathed by his wealthy, wily father, he has plowed past myriad hazards. And he did it by tying himself tightly to his bankers and lenders in New York and to gaming industry regulators in New Jersey\u2014who let him live large until they couldn\u2019t let him die without fatally wounding themselves. He effectively inhabited hosts, using them to get bigger and bigger in the \u201980s until he was practically perversely invincible by the \u201990s\u2014not only \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d as the late Wayne Barrett once told Susan Glasser and me, but \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d\n\nPerhaps his past escapes are the reason he appears oddly calm as most of the country leans forward, awaiting word of bombshells from Mueller.

On the horizon was the first of his six corporate bankruptcies.\n\n\u201cTrump is on his way down\u2014and probably out,\u201d business journalist Allan Sloan wrote that June in Newsday.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t stop at mere predictions. They also poked fun.\n\n\u201cI envision Donald Trump a year from now doing the ads for stomach-flatteners or ginsu knives on late-night TV. Or as a Worldwide Wrestling Federation commentator,\u201d Gail Collins, then a columnist for the New York Daily News, told David Von Drehle, then a reporter for the Miami Herald.\n\nVanity Fair editor Tina Brown likened Trump to late-in-life Elvis. \u201cHe probably will wind up in that sort of Graceland, you know, wearing a diaper,\u201d she told Steve Kroft of CBS News.\n\nSpy, the puckish satirical magazine and inveterate needler of Trump, in its August 1990 issue took a tongue-in-cheek look at what they foresaw as a sad, middling future for a balding, paunchy Trump. Their crystal ball, though, was not all wrong. They anticipated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, and a rough version of reality television, too\u2014and a public offering that would permit Trump to use money from shareholders to make money of his own (\u201cNow YOU can own a piece of the Trump!\u201d).\n\nBut beyond the smart set\u2019s schadenfreude were Trump\u2019s real-life results.\n\nAfter weeks of negotiations, the cluster of 70-some-odd banks that had loaned him billions of dollars gave him an additional $65 million loan. It was the first in a yearslong sequence of bailouts and extensions and breathing-room reprieves. They had loaned him so much money, it was no longer only his problem\u2014it was theirs. He all but dared them to take him down. \u201cHe has a good bit of leverage over the institutions,\u201d a Harvard Business School finance professor told the Boston Globe at the time. \u201cHis adjusted net worth is minus several hundred million dollars, by my estimate, and he is alive only because his bankers are too red-faced to pull the plug on his life-support system,\u201d the chairman of a money management firm wrote in the New York Post. \u201cThe most important thing,\u201d an official in the office of one of his lenders said in The American Banker, \u201cis to make Trump survive.\u201d\n\nTrump the Candidate: Despite a number of incidents that might have taken any other candidate down\u2014including the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, pictured above, in which he swaggered about sexual assault\u2014Trump was elected president on Nov. 8, 2016 and delivered his acceptance speech, pictured below, in the early hours of the following morning. | YouTube, Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe banks over time clawed back a passel of Trump\u2019s possessions (the yacht, the planes, the Plaza), but they didn\u2019t take his casinos\u2014because they didn\u2019t want them. \u201cThe last thing they want to do is manage casinos,\u201d an analyst from Moody\u2019s Investors explained to the Associated Press. And the last thing the gaming officials and city leaders in New Jersey wanted was to have them close. The relationship was the same as with the banks back in New York. Desperate to prop up the flagging gaming industry, looking continually to the casinos to inject into the struggling seaside town at least the appearance of vitality and prosperity, they needed Trump as much as Trump needed them. A prerequisite to owning a casino in Atlantic City, understandably, was financial stability, and regulators could have stripped Trump of his\u2014repeatedly\u2014but of course didn\u2019t. Trump\u2019s casinos amounted to roughly a third of the market. \u201cThe whole economic development of the town,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell, \u201cit was dependent on this. And so they just\u2014they caved.\u201d\n\nTrump had managed to turn an apparent weakness into a significant advantage. The banks put him on an allowance \u2026 of $450,000 a month. The Trump Tower triplex was safe.\n\n\u201cThe man is a Sherman tank in a Brioni suit,\u201d New York Post gossip columnist and Trump pal Cindy Adams told USA Today.\n\n\u201cHey, look, I had a cold spell from 1990 to \u201991,\u201d he said in 1994 in New York. \u201cI was beat up in business and in my personal life. \u2026 But you learn that you\u2019re either the toughest, meanest piece of shit in the world, or you just crawl into a corner, put your finger in your mouth, and say, \u2018I want to go home.\u2019\u201d And Trump didn\u2019t want to go home.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t entirely in the clear, though, until 1995 and \u201996, when his need for money finally superseded his desire for absolute control and he took his casinos public. He sat in his office and looked at O\u2019Brien, then a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. He was \u201cback,\u201d he said. People bought stock in Trump and lost money in droves. Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts proved to be a good investment for just one person\u2014Trump. \u201cIt was to get other people to get him out of that debt,\u201d a former member of the Trump Organization told me. In addition to his selling of his stake in his foundation-laying Grand Hyatt and tens of millions of dollars of wrangled, well-timed loans from family trusts, it\u2019s what saved Trump\u2014along with a partnership with Hong Kong investors that turned his long-held plot of land on the Upper West Side that always cost him money into one that began to actually make him money. Construction on what would have been Trump City and now would be called Trump Place (and then wouldn\u2019t) started in 1997. And two years later, in front of some of the buildings, Trump let the magician David Blaine get \u201cburied alive\u201d for a week in a plexiglass coffin. It was, said Blaine, a stunt famed illusionist Harry Houdini always wanted to do. For Trump, the publicity ploy made for an apt ode to the art of escape.\n\nTrumpologists and culture critics frequently cite showman P.T. Barnum as Trump\u2019s preeminent antecedent, but another, less noted inspiration was Houdini, the author of a forthcoming Houdini biography told me. \u201cHe always found\u2014especially when it just seemed like it was over for him\u2014he found some new chapter, and some new way to sort of get his success going again,\u201d Joe Posnanski said. \u201cHe created this handcuff act, and the handcuff act becomes huge, and then that sort of runs its course. And then he comes up with the milk can, and the milk can sort of runs its course. And he comes up with the Chinese water torture cell, and that runs his course. And he starts hanging upside down and escaping from straitjackets.\u201d\n\nIt makes Posnanski think of Trump.\n\n\u201cWith Trump, you just think, \u2018OK, this is it. This is totally it, you know?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s bankrupt, people are laughing at him, he\u2019s this, he\u2019s that\u2014but it\u2019s never over for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump,\u201d said Sheinkopf, the Democratic strategist, \u201cis incessantly pulling Houdini acts.\u201d\n\nRecall all the \u201cgaffes\u201d that were to have torpedoed his indelicate, unorthodox 2016 presidential bid\u2014peaking, of course, with the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape revealed in early October in which he swaggered about sexual assault.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThose who predict Trump will ultimately fall don\u2019t disagree that he has benefited from well-placed safety nets before. This time is different, they insist, because his high-wire act is being performed at unprecedented heights.\n\nUnder Investigation: An investigation run by Robert Mueller, left, has hung over Trump\u2019s presidency for nearly two years and led to the arrest of multiple of the president\u2019s associates, including his former attorney Michael Cohen, top right, and his long-time advisor Roger Stone, bottom right. | Zach Gibson/Bloomberg via Getty Images, Alex Wong/Getty Images, ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cSignificantly higher,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019s been on a financial tightrope, and a familial tightrope, but he\u2019s never been on a legal tightrope like this one. Not even close. This is fundamentally new because of the legal consequences, and those legal consequences don\u2019t end with the filing of the Mueller report. He still has issues that are still very serious in the Southern District of New York; in some ways, they may be more serious than the Mueller investigation in terms of potential consequences and how far they dig into his world.\u201d\n\nBandy Lee is worried. The forensic psychiatrist from Yale has studied thousands of people with the mental disorders she perceives Trump has. Their behavior, untreated, had predictable and unpleasant results. She foresees a similar unraveling for Trump, albeit with a wild card she has never encountered in any of her patients: the awesome power of the commander in chief.\n\n\u201cUnder stress, we can see the limits of one\u2019s ability to cope, and we can see that the president has reached his limits fairly rapidly, in terms of not being able to sit with the advancing special counsel\u2019s investigation. You can see there is a heightening of activity and creation of crises, distractions, if you will, in order to distract both themselves as well as the public away from the bad news he is continuing to receive,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cHe has very poor coping mechanisms when he is criticized or when he feels humiliated,\u201d she continued, \u201cand at these points, he generally goes into attack mode, and he threatens others or tries to get revenge.\u201d\n\nOur conversation took place before Trump resurrected his feud with the late John McCain, but I couldn\u2019t help thinking of Lee\u2019s warning as I listened to the president on Wednesday belabor his grudge before a crowd of workers who were expecting some good news on the economy, not a hit job on a war hero. Maybe this, just like the days of name-calling with George Conway, really are the signs of a mind in turmoil.\n\nTrump the Survivor: President Trump departs the White House earlier this year, while talk of his impeachment by a newly-Democratic House is impossible to avoid. He\u2019s teetered on the brink before and never succumbed. Will he be able to do it again? | Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nAnd yet\u2014and this is just the reality of the record\u2014Trump shrewdly, bullheadedly, even blithely pushed past crises in the \u201890s that would have felled almost anybody else. And then, perhaps convinced of his own invincibility, he blew through a litany of accepted social and political checkpoints on his way to the Oval Office and his high-backed chair behind the Resolute desk.\n\n\u201cPressure,\u201d Trump said in an extended interview in Playboy in 1990, \u201cdoesn\u2019t upset my sleep. \u2026 I like throwing balls into the air\u2014and I dream like a baby.\u201d\n\nThat same year, on June 14, he turned 44. The next day, he missed about $45 million in debt payments for his casino called Trump Castle. \u201cHe is absolutely on knife\u2019s edge,\u201d James Grant, the editor of Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer, told Newsday. The day after that, Trump had a party. More than a thousand employees in Atlantic City showed up at the bash on the boardwalk, according to news reports. \u201cWe love you, Donald!\u201d they cried. He was presented with a chocolate cupcake, a 12-page birthday card and an 8-foot-by-10-foot portrait of himself.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to write the positives,\u201d Trump told the cheering crowd. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve surprised a lot of people. The largest surprise is yet to come.\u201d\n\nTrue.",
