Though deportations at the border reached record highs early in his tenure , most illegal immigrants living in the U.S. weren \u2019 t at risk of deportation unless they broke the law .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s actions flesh out the \u201c America First \u201d agenda he set forth in his inaugural address . In his vision , stricter border controls and immigration enforcement are needed to keep out undocumented workers who unfairly compete with Americans for jobs , as well as drug smugglers , criminals and terrorists who threaten their way of life .\nThursday \u2019 s expected orders would amplify that message by banning the entry of people from Middle Eastern and North African countries considered terror risks , suspending the country \u2019 s refugee program , and implementing \u201c extreme vetting \u201d for some visa applicants .\nWednesday \u2019 s first order directs federal officials to immediately begin planning , designing and constructing a \u201c physical wall \u201d on the border , though the document includes language suggesting something short of brick and mortar would qualify .\nIt also calls for quickly processing claims of asylum , which are often asserted by Central Americans fleeing their countries , and building more detention facilities to hold people while their cases are considered . And it says the government will consider local police agencies an extension of federal immigration enforcement .\nIn a companion order , Mr. Trump restored the controversial Secure Communities program , which directs local law enforcement agencies to detain undocumented immigrants until federal agents can pick them up . He greatly expanded the group of people targeted for deportation , and directed agencies to strip federal grant funding from so-called sanctuary cities that \u201c willfully refuse \u201d to assist federal immigration authorities .\n\u201c These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic , \u201d the order reads .\nMr. Trump also called for hiring 5,000 additional border agents and 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers , though he said this was subject to available appropriations . A White House official said the recently announced federal hiring freeze allowed agencies discretion to hire needed personnel .\nThe reaction in Mexico to the order for a barrier was angry , particularly since it came on the day top Mexican officials were to meet with White House officials to discuss the troubled bilateral relationship . Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is due to meet with Mr. Trump at the White House next week .\nIn an apparent reference to the trip , Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said in a message to Mexicans late Wednesday that he would take a decision on the \u201c next steps \u201d to follow after consulting with his cabinet , senate members and Mexican state governors .\n\u201c This is an insult to those Mexican officials , to the president of Mexico and to all Mexicans , \u201d said Jorge Casta\u00f1eda , an ex-foreign minister , in a televised interview . \u201c It \u2019 s a way of making them negotiate under threat , under insults and it should lead President Pe\u00f1a Nieto to cancel his trip next week . \u201d\nMr. Trump suggested relations with Mexico would improve , saying stricter border security would be good for both countries .\n\u201c I believe the steps we will take starting right now will improve the safety in both of our countries , going to be very , very good for Mexico , \u201d he said . \u201c I have deep admiration for the people of Mexico and I greatly look forward to meeting again with the president of Mexico . \u201d\nDemocrats derided the orders as undermining trust in local police . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) called them \u201c constitutionally suspect . \u201d\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R. , Calif. ) said the \u201c actions are the right start to enforcing our laws and protecting our citizens , \u201d\nMichael Matzke , president of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2554 in El Centro , California , supported the action .\n\u201c Regardless of what people say , walls work , \u201d he said , adding news of the wall and Mr. Trump \u2019 s plans to tighten security \u201c raises morale \u201d among border patrol agents . \u201c I think its just the general feeling that we \u2019 re the good guys again . \u201d\nWhile Mr. Trump \u2019 s plans for the border have received most attention , other components of his executive orders are likely to have a bigger impact on the day-in , day-out practice of immigration enforcement .\nMany cities and counties stopped cooperating with federal immigration authorities , considering the Obama administration \u2019 s immigration enforcement overly aggressive .
