Bush in 1988\nIt was late in the day with the House oversight hearing on Benghazi winding down . On social media and elsewhere , there was conservative grumbling that Hillary Clinton was getting off relatively unscathed .\nThen came conservative Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina 's second round of questions .\n`` If anyone wants to ask 'What difference does it make ? ' it always matters whether or not you can trust your government , '' Gowdy said , borrowing some words from the former secretary of state .\n`` And to the families , we 're going to find out what happened in Benghazi , and I do n't give a damn whose career is impacted , '' Gowdy continued . `` We 're going to find out what happened . ''\nTough legitimate congressional oversight or partisan politics ? Leading Republicans say the former ; most Democrats the latter .\nAnd as the Benghazi investigations continue , that presents both parties with challenges .\nFor Republicans , if they want public support for continued hearings and questions beyond the GOP 's conservative base , the challenge is to stress the legitimate questions about the Obama administration 's response to the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate -- and its conflicting explanations of why it believes the attacks happened .\nHouse Speaker John Boehner served notice on Thursday that GOP pressure would not subside .\nJUST WATCHED Benghazi officer : Man ran in , yelling Replay More Videos ...

The e-mail , Boehner said , refers to `` Islamic terrorists '' as carrying out the attack .\n`` A senior State Department official e-mailed her superiors that the Libyan ambassador , she had told the Libyan ambassador , the attack was conducted by Islamic terrorists . The State Department would not allow our committees to keep copies of this e-mail when it was reviewed , '' Boehner said .\nThe White House and its allies in Congress make the case that any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the attacks stemmed from the `` fog of war '' -- not any deliberate effort to mislead the American people about the source of the attacks .\nTraveling in Rome , the man who replaced Clinton , Secretary of State John Kerry , said he was as determined as the Republican House leadership to answer any legitimate questions .\n`` I have already made it crystal clear to the chairmen of the relevant committees that I have assigned my chief of staff , David Wade , to be responsible for liaising with them to answer any questions that they have , '' Kerry said . `` I am absolutely determined that this issue will be answered , will be put to bed . ''\n`` And if there is any culpability in any area that is appropriate to be handled in some way with some discipline it will be appropriately handled .

In turn , committee Democrats , including ranking member Elijah Cummings of Maryland , said Issa and other GOP members were to blame for a reckless campaign designed to `` smear public officials . ''\nSusan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , took the most direct heat because of her assertions in a Sunday television interview days after the attack that linked the attacks to a demonstration outside the Benghazi consulate .\nHicks said there was no demonstration and that top State Department officials had been told that , and he told the committee he was `` stunned '' and `` embarrassed '' by Rice 's televised account .\nThe administration concedes Rice spoke from flawed talking points , but insists the mistakes were born of understandable confusion .

And other longtime Clinton political loyalists were privately nudging reporters and media outlets about the tone of the Benghazi coverage .\nOne veteran Democratic strategist , who spoke only on condition of anonymity because Clinton chafes at those who publicly speculate about her 2016 interest , noted her overwhelming popularity among Democrats .\n`` She will have to deal with this , '' the strategist said , `` but it will not be central to the campaign . ''\nLongtime Clinton ally and Democratic strategist Paul Begala takes a similar view .\n`` Once more , the GOP runs the risk of appearing to be blinded by their partisanship , '' Begala said . `` I have no idea if Hillary will run .
