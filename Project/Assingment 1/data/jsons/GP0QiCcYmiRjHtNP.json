Now, she is facing life in prison. Chrystul Kizer was 17 years old when she allegedly shot Randy Volar twice before setting his body on fire and taking off in his BMW, police said, the Washington Post reports. She was charged with first-degree intentional homicide, auto theft and arson for killing Volar, who was a Kenosha, Wisconsin, resident, the Washington Post reports.\n\nKizer met Volar when she was 16 and he was 33, the Washington Post reports. Prior to Kizer allegedly killing Volar, he had sexually abused her multiple times and filmed it, the Washington Post reports. Kizer was among other victims Volar sexually abused.

A few days later, she confessed and District Attorney Michael Graveley charged her with arson and first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a mandatory life sentence in Wisconsin, the Washington Post reports. Graveley\u2019s office knew about the evidence against Volar, but waited to prosecute him, the Washington Post reports.\n\n\u201cIn many and most of the cases, we didn\u2019t know the age,\u201d Graveley said, the Washington Post reports. \u201cSo we literally did not know whether we had misdemeanors or felony.\u201d Graveley said charges were brought against Kizer, because he believed her crime was premeditated. He argued that Kizer planned to murder Volar so she could steal his BMW, the Washington Post reports. Shortly before she killed him, Kizer posted a photo on Facebook with the caption, \u201cMy mugshot,\u201d the Washington Post reports.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t intentionally try to do this,\u201d Kizer, who is now 19, told the Washington Post.
