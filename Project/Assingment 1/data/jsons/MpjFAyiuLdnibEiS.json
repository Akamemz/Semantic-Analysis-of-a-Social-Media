    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\n\u201c In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid , the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation . There is enough here to support impeachment . Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter. \u201d Noah Feldman , Bloomberg\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it \u2019 s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed \u2014 such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there \u2019 s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But\u2026 \u2018 even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. \u2019 \u2026\n\u201c Here is what a presidential president might have said : If there is one thing the past three years have shown , the only good answer to a foreign country offering dirt on your political opponent is to decline and immediately report the offer to the FBI . Our country is still enduring the fallout from Russian interference in 2016 . It has cast a pall on my presidency and led to the indictment of former senior government and campaign officials . The last thing any president should do is encourage foreign meddling in our next presidential election\u2026 \u201c It is important for me to be clear on this , because it is not only a question of me or my campaign potentially breaking the law . It is also a matter of principle . Our political differences matter less than our commitment to one another as citizens loyal to the same constitutional order and committed to defending it in a world in which other states , friendly or unfriendly , pursue their own national interests . As president , I will defend this principle from the same erosion of other norms we have seen as our politics have gotten sharper. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c Foreign dirt wouldn \u2019 t come from Norway or other stable democratic allies like Ireland , France , and England . It would come from corrupt authoritarian regimes that want to manipulate American democracy for their own ends . In 2016 , the Russian government favored Trump because he appeared open to relieving U.S. sanctions on the country . What if Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies try to repay Trump \u2019 s support as president by meddling in 2020 ? ... What if Chinese leaders try to push the election in his opponents \u2019 favor , in hopes of ending the trade war ? \u2026 Thanks to Trump \u2019 s actions , Americans risk inheriting a democracy where elections are playgrounds for foreign powers rather than an expression of citizens \u2019 wishes. \u201d Matt Ford , New Republic\nRegarding Christopher Steele , a foreign national hired by the Clinton campaign in 2016 , \u201c \u2018 You can pay a foreign national to provide you with services , so a campaign , for instance , could have a campaign attorney who is a Canadian citizen \u2019 \u2026 If this kind of seems like a loophole , experts pointed out that it would be really hard to run a campaign otherwise . It would mean having to worry if the campaign signs you printed came from a foreign company , or if the catering firm you hired had foreign workers . If a campaign is paying someone for work or services , they \u2019 re being compensated . But where that doesn \u2019 t happen , and a campaign is accepting a contribution \u2014 or \u2018 thing of value \u2019 \u2014 from a foreign government , the question then is what \u2019 s in it for them ? \u201d Jen Kirby , Vox\n\u201c When [ White House senior advisor Jared ] Kushner was asked whether he would call the FBI if he received an email offering the Trump campaign help from the Russian government , he refused to answer , saying it was a hypothetical question . Besides , he added , he never received the information he was promised the last time that offer was made . This is like asking someone who stole silverware from your house whether he would steal from you again and him responding it was a hypothetical question and , besides , the silverware he stole the first time turned out to be worthless . It 's unlikely you would invite him over again . However , Donald Trump is running for re-election in 2020. \u201d Larry Noble , CNN\n\u201c Mueller opted not to charge Trump Jr. for accepting a meeting in which he expected to receive opposition research on Clinton and the Democrats from a Russian lawyer in 2016 . But it was not because there was nothing potentially wrong with this ; it was because Mueller decided it was unlikely that it could be proven Trump Jr. knew that it was illegal and/or that the information was something \u2018 of value \u2019 ... [ but ] even if Trump Jr. was ignorant of the law , that defense doesn \u2019 t really fly with his father today \u2014 not after a two-year investigation probing exactly that issue. \u201d Aaron Blake , Washington Post\nThe right argues that the FBI should be notified , but accuses Democrats of double standards regarding foreign contributions to elections .\nThe right argues that the FBI should be notified , but accuses Democrats of double standards regarding foreign contributions to elections .\n\u201c The good thing you can say for President Trump in this interaction is\u2026 that President Trump is the most honest president that we 've ever had . He is . Call him honest Donald . You have Honest Abe and now you can have honest Donald . Why is he the most honest president ?

You do n't want to incentivize foreign governments to spy on American citizens\u2026 You do n't want it to seem like the President of the United States is encouraging you to do that or offering you something in return . That 's not a good idea .

It \u2019 s also completely acceptable for the DNC to seek out help from Ukraine to come up with dirt on Paul Manafort in order to hurt Trump . But Trump answers a hypothetical honestly instead of choosing to lie like every other politician and it \u2019 s time to clutch the pearls\u2026\n\u201c There \u2019 s no moral , nor legal imperative that if a German ( for example ) offers documented wrongdoing by your opponent , you must immediately turn it over to the FBI and not use it .

While it is possible that this could be nefarious , it is more likely that , like a good neighbor , Canada would be trying to warn the president about some peril to American interests\u2026\n\u201c In the 2016 election , Estonia did call President Obama \u2019 s administration to provide opposition research \u2014 specifically , to convey unverified intelligence that Russia might be channeling money into the Trump campaign .

In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .

In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war .
