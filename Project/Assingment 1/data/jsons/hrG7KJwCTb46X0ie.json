He is the author of the new book `` The Fierce Urgency of Now : Lyndon Johnson , Congress and the Battle for the Great Society . '' The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .\n( CNN ) Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will announce Monday that he is launching his campaign to become the 2016 Republican nominee for president . Cruz has been positioning for this nomination almost since he entered the upper chamber in 2012 . His announcement takes place at a bastion of conservatism , Liberty University , the institution founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell .\nCruz is going to run from the right . He has spent much of his short career in Washington blasting the `` mushy middle '' of his party ( which might be news to most Democrats ) , which he dismisses as a `` failed electoral strategy . ''\nDuring a recent visit to New Hampshire , where he vowed to eliminate the Department of Education and the Internal Revenue Service , Cruz said that `` I 'm pretty sure , here in New Hampshire , y'all define gun control like we do in Texas : Gun control is when you hit at what you aim at . ''\nFifty years ago , another Republican senator ran this kind of campaign , Arizona 's Barry Goldwater , who took on President Lyndon Johnson . Cruz will test the conventional wisdom that Goldwater 's strategy was and remains a failure .\nWhen Republicans voted to nominate him in 1964 , Goldwater told the delegates that `` extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice . And moderation in the pursuit of justice no virtue . '' When the icon of moderate Republicans , New York Gov . Nelson Rockefeller , spoke to the convention , the delegates hissed and booed .\nThe outcome was far from great for the GOP . Johnson defeated Goldwater in a landslide election that brought in huge liberal Democratic majorities that passed the exact programs that conservatives abhorred .\nAlthough Goldwater was clearly wrong when he ran in 1964 , Cruz thinks that the times have changed .\nRight now , the chances are not great . If Cruz really sticks to this strategy of extremism , he faces very long odds of making it to the White House . The strategy might help him to garner some primary votes against Jeb Bush in red states , but it is not an approach with a great track record .\nEven as the Republican Party has shifted to the right in recent decades , Republican candidates who have obtained the nomination , and those who have also won the presidency , always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes .\nRonald Reagan had anti-communism and tax cuts to attract voters into one big tent , and George H.W . Bush had a thousand points of light . His son George W. Bush emphasized policies tied to `` compassionate conservatism '' to prove that he was not an extreme zealot .\nEven Republicans who did n't win in the general elections , like John McCain and Mitt Romney , did not win the primary and caucus tallies by only playing to the base . Notwithstanding the conventional wisdom , even in primaries it seems that Republican voters understand the importance of finding someone who has the potential to win in November .\nThis coming election will be tough for Republicans . As all the experts have shown , the electoral college math does not favor the GOP . Some experts have predicted that Democrats have over an 80 % chance of winning the Electoral College . According to the Washington Post , if one looks at the states where the margin was narrow in the 2012 election , five currently favor Democrats ( Florida , Iowa , Minnesota , Ohio and Pennsylvania ) while in others , like Colorado , Democrats have a very good chance of winning as a result of demographic trends , namely growing minority populations that favor their party 's nominee . Barring any dramatic changes in the coming months , Democrats will also have a very strong and seasoned nominee in Hillary Clinton .\nCruz is also not just someone who defends extremism but a politician who can easily be tied to the congressional obstructionism that has turned off so much of the electorate . The Republican Party has been dragged down by the kind of politics that voters have observed in Washington . In 2014 , congressional approval ratings plummeted to 14 % . As the new year began , the approval ratings were only slightly better : just 16 % .\nThis is the congressional Republicanism where Cruz comes from . Many voters who like conservatism and the GOP do n't love what their representatives are doing on Capitol Hill . The kind of scorched earth , always say no to anything politics has not done well in terms of the favorability ratings . There have been few practitioners of this style of legislative politics as prominent as Cruz . During his campaign for the presidency , he might pay the price for the kind of politics that brought him great attention in Congress .\nWhen Goldwater squared off against Johnson in 1964 , the President predicted that there would be a `` frontlash '' of Republican and independent voters who would move way from the GOP just because Goldwater was at the top of the ticket . This was Johnson 's response to predictions of a backlash in the South from Democrats who were angry about civil rights . The frontlash , Johnson explained to Bill Moyers is `` liberals , independents , moderate Republicans . ''\nThe electorate is not as likely to experience any dramatic swings like we saw in Midwestern states in 1964 , where solidly Republican areas went Democratic because they were scared off by Goldwater , but a Cruz campaign could be exactly what Democrats need to cement victories in the swing states where the outcome is still uncertain .\nMonday , Cruz will bask in the spotlight of his announcement . But Republicans are going to have to really think hard about whether they want to put all of their electoral eggs in this volatile basket which , at least based on the history , has a very slim chance of winning .",
