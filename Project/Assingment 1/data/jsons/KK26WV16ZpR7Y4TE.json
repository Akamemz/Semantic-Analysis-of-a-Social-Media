Martin O \u2019 Malley wows the crowds in Iowa and other early-voting states , they say the likely presidential hopeful would make a good vice president .\nThat \u2019 s a powerful blow to a candidate who is trying to make his way to the top of the ticket and beat back naysaying political analysts who give him no chance of winning or who speculate that he \u2019 s actually running for the No . 2 spot or a Cabinet post under Hillary Rodham Clinton , the presumed front-runner for the Democratic nomination .\nAnd these days , Mr. O \u2019 Malley is quick to challenge the idea that Mrs. Clinton is \u201c unbeatable \u201d and her nomination is \u201c inevitable . \u201d\n\u201c Let \u2019 s be honest here , the presidency of the United States is not some crown to be passed between two families . It is an awesome and sacred trust that [ has ] to be earned and exercised on behalf of the American people , \u201d he said Sunday on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week . \u201d\nThe former governor , who has laid the groundwork for a challenge to Mrs. Clinton in 2016 , said he would announce his decision on the race \u201c this spring . \u201d\nMore than any other potential Democratic candidate , Mr. O \u2019 Malley has undertaken an aggressive travel schedule in Iowa and New Hampshire . He \u2019 s garnered standing ovations from party activists with his populist rhetoric and liberal agenda , which includes calls to raise the minimum wage and break up Wall Street banks .\nLarry Hodgden , Democratic Party Chairman for Iowa \u2019 s Cedar County , said he was impressed with Mr. O \u2019 Malley and believed he will do well in the state \u2019 s nominating caucuses , though he offered a major caveat .\n\u201c Even if he doesn \u2019 t rise to the top of the Democratic ticket , I do believe that he would make a very , very good vice presidential candidate down the road , \u201d said Mr. Hodgden , who met Mr. O \u2019 Malley earlier this month at an event in Cedar County .\nLike other party activists , Mr. Hodgden said he is waiting on Mrs. Clinton , who has been hunkered down in hopes that the scandal over her exclusive use of private email during her tenure as secretary of state will blow over .\n\u201c I \u2019 m holding back my judgment until she gets out here and begins to campaign , and then I \u2019 ll compare her to whoever else is in the race , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It depends how hard Hillary wants to campaign in Iowa and what her message is . And right now it \u2019 s secret . Nobody knows , \u201d said Mr. Hodgden . \u201c We know what she \u2019 s done in the past , but elections for president are about the future , and we need to know what Hillary Clinton wants to bring to the contest . \u201d\nMr. O \u2019 Malley \u2019 s supporters insist that Mrs. Clinton isn \u2019 t invincible despite her huge lead in the polls .\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t about Hillary .
