Be the first to hear about Nation Travels destinations , and explore the world with kindred spirits .\nIn Canada , there is an inescapable tendency to use another , more influential country \u2019 s politics to interpret one \u2019 s own . In the tense lead-up to the federal election on October 21 , a few Canadian leaders have tried to appropriate some of America \u2019 s far-right revanchist language\u2014so the same must be happening on the progressive end too , right ? Does Canada have a Bernie Sanders ? How about an AOC ? Ad Policy\nA former criminal defense lawyer and taker of countless selfies , 40-year-old Singh is the leader of Canada \u2019 s left-leaning New Democratic Party , and he \u2019 s racking up the firsts : He was the first politician to wear a turban in Ontario \u2019 s provincial parliament . ( Singh is an observant Sikh . ) He \u2019 s the first person of color to lead a major Canadian political party at the national level . And now\u2014after being tapped for the NDP leadership in 2017\u2014he \u2019 s running his first federal election campaign . Related Article Trudeau \u2019 s Blackface Is Appalling , and So Are His Policies Sophia Reuss\nThat means he \u2019 s probably also the first Canadian party leader to have been accused , at his own event , of trying to impose sharia law ; the first to be chastised on the street for not looking Canadian enough ; and the first whose party members may have begun to defect , in part , because they \u2019 re worried their constituents won \u2019 t vote for an NDP headed by a man in a turban .\nDespite these hurdles , Singh\u2014whose \u201c riding , \u201d or electoral district , is Burnaby South in Greater Vancouver\u2014has been praised in the past few weeks after standing out in the leader debates , in large part because of his relentlessly upbeat messaging . The NDP , a perennial also-ran that lost a lot of ground in the 2015 election , is unlikely to win the election this year either . But the 2019 campaign has been a sort of coming-out party for Singh , following over a year of lukewarm reception as the new NDP leader . And there \u2019 s a lot for him to capitalize on : The Liberals , under current prime minister Justin Trudeau , have left their progressive promises unfulfilled . The Conservatives , headed by racism apologist Andrew Scheer , are focused on attacking Trudeau \u2019 s record from the right . Singh , the lesser-known quantity , has used the national campaign to shape his own image as the candidate for working Canadians , while the others are busy glad-handing the 1-percent .\nSingh is not as seismic or beloved a figure as Bernie or AOC ( although he \u2019 s happy to align himself with the latter ) . His own colleagues have criticized him for being inexperienced . Some say he \u2019 s too in thrall to luxury to lead the working people \u2019 s party . And the entire NDP is dogged by Canada \u2019 s faulty electoral system , which could have progressives casting strategic votes for the Liberals instead . Nevertheless , Singh \u2019 s profile is rising\u2014and , recently , Canadians gave the NDP a bump in the polls .\nThe NDP bills itself as Canada \u2019 s social democrat party , with an emphasis on pushing for a real living wage , stronger workers \u2019 rights , more Medicare funding , universal child care , and a fully progressive agenda that looks out for visible minorities , LGBTQ communities , and indigenous peoples . It has deep connections to organized labor , and its first leader back in 1961 was the legendary Saskatchewan premier Tommy Douglas , credited with creating Canada \u2019 s universal Medicare system . Douglas is widely considered one of the greatest Canadians of all time , yet the party he founded is perennially in third place , as the centrist Liberals and the right-leaning Conservatives duke it out for the top position . Current Issue View our current issue\nHowever , as politics worldwide has become more polarized and more young voters have become interested in the left , Singh \u2019 s team is jockeying for advantage . Canadians are feeling squeezed right now : Housing prices skyrocketed in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver over the last decade , while wages lagged significantly behind inflation . Every party running candidates in this election is pitching its plan to help make life more affordable for ordinary , hard-working Canadian . And the NDP is offering to\u2014in classic populist language\u2014 \u201c un-rig \u201d a system it says favors the rich .\nThe party \u2019 s platform this year is called \u201c A New Deal for People \u201d : It proposes to spend billions of dollars on dozens of measures , including 500,000 new affordable housing units , a national pharmacare program ( prescriptions aren \u2019 t covered by Canada \u2019 s universal Medicare ) , affordable child care , clean water for all indigenous communities , and investment in green transit across the country . The NDP\u2014alongside their competitors on the left , the Green Party\u2014are also pushing for a wealth tax , albeit one much milder than those being proposed by Elizabeth Warren and Sanders south of the border , at a mere 1 percent of supersized incomes .\nSingh \u2019 s success in recent leader debates has NDP supporters hopeful that the party will get back the momentum it was starting to gain in the 2011 election , perhaps the most pivotal in NDP history . That year , the NDP \u2019 s then-leader Jack Layton led his party to win 103 seats\u2014a historic best\u2014and become the official opposition to long-entrenched Prime Minister Stephen Harper \u2019 s Conservatives . It was the first time the NDP had formed the opposition , and Layton brought it home while battling prostate cancer and a bad hip . ( He campaigned wielding a cane . ) The media called the NDP \u2019 s success the \u201c orange wave , \u201d after its official party color .\nBut shortly after the election , Layton \u2019 s cancer resurged . He took a leave of absence . Less than four months after the orange wave swept the country , he was dead . Without its famous leader , the NDP entered a fallow period . In an attempt to bring the party closer to center , a smooth-talking former Quebec Liberal named Thomas Mulcair was elected party leader in 2012 . The Liberals had lost badly in the previous election ; maybe , some thought , the NDP could maintain or even grow their newly attained standing by filling that centrist void , talking more about balancing the budget and fostering the private sector than about , say , hiking corporate taxes or cracking down on offshore tax havens .\nIt also gave a political heir named Justin Trudeau\u2014a man who has recently admitted he can \u2019 t remember how many times he \u2019 s worn blackface\u2014enough space to swoop in and become the progressive face of the 2015 election . The Liberals ended up winning a majority number of seats in the legislature , and Trudeau became prime minister . Meanwhile , the orange wave slowed to a trickle : the NDP won just 44 seats , less than half of what it won last time , and lost its official opposition status . In 2016 , party delegates handed Mulcair a harsh fate when they voted at the national NDP convention to hold another leadership race a year down the road .\nCanadians had clearly identified with Jack Layton \u2019 s happy-warrior style : He was a proven community organizer who looked like your friend \u2019 s dad but also someone who \u2019 d be fun to have a beer with at the local bar . Mulcair was a much less charismatic , more moderate campaigner with a professorial style that played well in Parliament , as he questioned and criticized Harper \u2019 s Conservatives on seemingly every policy . But his approach left voters cold .\nJagmeet Singh looks and sounds nothing like Layton or Mulcair . Born and raised in Scarborough , Ontario , he \u2019 s the oldest son of Punjabi immigrants . He talks with a millennial cadence ( \u201c I \u2019 m pumped ! \u201d ) and is probably the only person in Canadian politics getting attention for being a snappy dresser and biking around Toronto . Singh , a provincial lawmaker in Ontario when Mulcair got turfed in 2016 , emerged as a possible breath of fresh air . Young people identify with him . He seems fluent in fashion and pop culture . He speaks openly about having been bullied by classmates and sexually abused as a child . Plus , he has an unmistakably progressive track record at the grassroots level , including giving pro bono legal counsel to marginalized youth and organizing through the Sikh Activist Network .\nWhen Singh was elected NDP leader in 2017 , commentators on the left welcomed a new dawn for the ailing party .\nBut what followed wasn \u2019 t pretty . Singh didn \u2019 t seem to be growing into the job . He made widely mocked gaffes on big issues , from China to gun ownership . Singh had inherited a party that was struggling financially , and the new leader didn \u2019 t deliver much on fundraising . The NDP ended 2018 deeply in debt .\nHis own party began to second-guess him , giving him a hard time at a meeting last September for not cleaning up the party \u2019 s finances . After Singh ousted a Saskatchewan MP who was accused of sexual harassment , party vets in that province penned a letter accusing him of denying the MP due process . Singh has also had to deal with a number of prominent NDP lawmakers deciding , one after the other , to not run in this year \u2019 s election . In the Maritime province of New Brunswick this fall , both provincial and federal members of the NPD switched to the Green Party\u2014and one cited Singh \u2019 s race as a reason , claiming that it jeopardized the NDP \u2019 s chances . ( That same person is now suing the NDP , and Singh , for painting him as a racist . )\nThis year \u2019 s federal campaign has exposed Canada \u2019 s intolerant underside : Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has repeatedly criticized Trudeau \u2019 s \u201c soft \u201d border policies , even dredging up the specter of MS-13\u2014the Central American gang that Trump loves to talk about\u2014as a reason to further secure the US\u2013Canada border . Even further to the right is the People \u2019 s Party of Canada , led by former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier : he has vowed to stop \u201c mass immigration \u201d to Canada , so as to save it from multiculturalism and \u201c the cult of diversity . \u201d\nSingh\u2014who has spoken about the discrimination he experienced growing up\u2014has also faced widely reported racism since deciding to enter federal politics . And , ironically , it has sometimes given him an opportunity to shine . During his 2017 bid for the party leadership , a woman crashed one of his gatherings in Ontario to accuse Singh of being \u201c in bed \u201d with sharia law and the Muslim Brotherhood . \u201c We don \u2019 t want to be intimidated by hate , we don \u2019 t want hatred to ruin a positive event , \u201d Singh replied . \u201c So let \u2019 s show people how to treat someone with love : We welcome you . We love you , we support you. \u201d More recently , Singh gave a moving response when Trudeau \u2019 s brown- and blackface scandal broke . When approached by a French-Canadian man who told him to \u201c cut \u201d his turban to \u201c look more like a Canadian , \u201d Singh dispatched him with grace .\nStill , some have criticized Singh for not standing up enough for progressive causes since entering federal politics ; recently , prominent activist and journalist Desmond Cole said he felt let down by Singh not speaking up about police brutality since becoming NDP leader . And although Singh has carved out a prominent spot for himself in Canada \u2019 s political imagination during this campaign , his party has virtually no chance of beating the Liberals or Conservatives . If the Conservatives win the most seats and the NDP forms a coalition with the Liberals to counter them\u2014a possibility about which both Singh and Trudeau have been noncommittal\u2014then Singh may stay in the spotlight a little longer .\nSingh \u2019 s message has just begun to resonate with Canadians , and he \u2019 ll have to build on recent success by learning how to command respect from those within his party . Meanwhile , he \u2019 s stuck trying to talk Canadians out of voting strategically\u2014which , in this election , means not voting for the NDP . \u201c I feel like this idea of strategic voting has not allowed people to dream big , \u201d Singh said last weekend . \u201c I want people to dream big . \u201d",
