    "content": "The GOP could hold the House speaker 's gavel through 2020 . The Democrats ' lost decade ?\nDemocrats fell far short of winning the House in 2012 , an otherwise banner year for the party , and many are privately glum about taking back the chamber in 2014 .\nBut that grim immediate outlook raises a far more troubling longer-term prospect for Democrats : that the newly drawn congressional lines have tilted the electoral playing field so decisively in the GOP \u2019 s favor that the party could control the House through 2020 .\nThat this , in other words , could be the Democrats \u2019 Lost Decade .\nThree of the past four elections have produced partisan upheaval , so political forecasting must be approached with caution . Democrats say projecting beyond next year , let alone next month , is a fool \u2019 s errand .\nBut strategists in both parties say they are still reckoning with the long-term implications of Democrats \u2019 disastrous performance in 2010 . Not only did they lose the House that year , but setbacks in state capitals meant that Republicans controlled the once-a-decade process of line drawing in 213 districts \u2014 nearly five times the number of districts Democrats had oversight over . And Republicans used that power with a vengeance .\nThe GOP effectiveness in erecting a gerrymandered fortress has created a paradox : Even in a fast-changing electorate , with many demographic trends favoring Democrats , the part of the national government that the Founders imagined would be most responsive to shifts in public opinion and voter behavior may actually be the least responsive .\nThe possibility of a decade or more of GOP House dominance is something Democrats \u2013 and even some Republicans , who still need to hit up donors \u2013 are loathe to talk about publicly . But make no mistake : Even as they struggle in presidential and Senate races , Republicans have a structural advantage in the House that could last through the next four elections .\nKarl Rove , George W. Bush \u2019 s political architect , stopped short of predicting that the speaker \u2019 s gavel will remain in GOP hands through 2020 . But he said the dual factors of sharp Republican line drawing and population shifts provided a solid foundation for the party .\n\u201c The impact , \u201d he said , \u201c is certainly favorable to Republicans at the congressional level . \u201d\nOf the 435 districts that constitute the chamber , 242 tilt toward Republicans while 185 favor Democrats ( another eight are evenly divided ) . In November , Mitt Romney - despite getting shellacked nationally \u2013 won 21 more congressional districts than President Barack Obama .\nIt \u2019 s for that reason that Democrats , who are 17 seats shy of the majority , start out the midterm season at risk of losing ground . While there are 15 Democrats residing in GOP-tilting districts , only four Republicans are in Democratic-friendly ones . And the Cook Political Report lists 37 Democratic-held seats as being competitive , compared to just 28 Republican ones .\nRedistricting is the single biggest factor driving the GOP \u2019 s congressional power . When the process came to an end last year , 109 Republican seats were made safer as opposed to 67 Democratic seats . And 109 Democrat seats became more competitive , compared to just 96 Republicans .\nDemographics also play a role . While Democrats are benefiting from a booming Latino population \u2013 a dynamic that \u2019 s helping them in presidential and statewide races \u2014 the party \u2019 s supporters have clustered in densely-packed , ethnically diverse urban population centers . The result is that wide swaths of suburban , exurban , and rural districts have been left to Republicans .\nIf Democrats are discouraged , they \u2019 re putting on a brave public face . The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee frequently out-performs its GOP counterpart in monthly fundraising , and the party \u2019 s leaders maintain a sunny outlook about their prospects . In the final days leading up to the 2012 election , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told aides she was convinced her party could win control .\nBut for all the blood , sweat , and tears the party pours into the battle for the House , there is also a sense that larger forces are at work .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t worry about what \u2019 s out of our control . I can worry about what \u2019 s in our control , \u201d said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel ( D-N.Y. ) . \u201c If we play strong offense and strong defense [ in 2014 ] , there is a path \u2013 not an exceedingly wide path \u2013 but there is a path . \u201d\nIsrael argued that there are 52 Republican seats in play and 20 Democrats ones \u2013 in other words , a sufficiently wide enough field for his party to win the House .\nFor all the problems confronting Democrats , predicting flat-out that the party can \u2019 t return to power in the years is risky business .
