Ted Cruz has blasted President Barack Obama 's `` amnesty '' policy for illegal immigrant children that he says has resulted in thousands of them being physically and sexually assaulted by vicious drug cartel coyotes.The Texas Republican said in a commentary forthat the border crisis is the `` direct result '' of Obama 's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , while adding that it opened the door for minors to become easy targets for predatory criminal traffickers . `` If amnesty is granted to those who come as children , many more children will come , '' said Cruz . `` And those children are being victimized , many physically and sexually assaulted by violent drug cartel coyotes . `` It is not compassionate to act like the Democrats , who are doing nothing to stop tens of thousands of little girls and boys from being abused . We can not solve this crisis without ending the amnesty . `` Cruz said that the GOP would `` welcome '' a debate over how to secure the borders and reform the `` legal '' immigration system , but noted that Obama and his supporters are `` devoted to amnesty . `` `` They 're holding the safety and security of our nation hostage to get it , '' wrote Cruz . `` Although polling shows that 68 percent of Americans disapprove of Obama 's immigration policies , the president and his allies remain committed to an agenda that has created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis . `` As the son of a refugee from Cuba , I understand the plight of immigrants in a very personal way . And I 'm unwilling to follow the president 's course of spending billions on social services but maintaining the amnesty that will in perpetuity cause thousands more children to be victimized . `` Cruz wrote that the before the deferred action order was passed by Obama , `` without approval from Congress , '' only 6,000 unaccompanied children were seized at the border in 2011 .
