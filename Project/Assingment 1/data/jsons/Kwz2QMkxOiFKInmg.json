The idea was to make sure doctors kept participating in Medicaid \u2014 which typically has low reimbursement rates \u2014 even as the program expanded to cover millions more Americans this year .\nThat earlier Obamacare pay raise was big , averaging out to a 73 percent increase for primary care doctors across the country .
