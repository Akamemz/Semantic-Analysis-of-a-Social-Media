    "content_original": "A tentative deal between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to be finalized over the next two days at their summit in Vietnam has emerged \u2014 and while it may still change, the current agreement looks like a huge win for Kim.\n\nFor the US? Not so much.\n\nUnder the current iteration of the agreement, described to me by three people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, the US would agree to lift some sanctions on North Korea and improve ties between the two countries in exchange for a commitment from Kim Jong Un to close down a key nuclear facility.\n\nHere\u2019s the outline of the tentative deal as described to me:\n\nBoth countries will sign a peace declaration to symbolically end the Korean War. That conflict ended in an armistice (basically a truce), not an actual peace treaty, in 1953, which means the war is technically still ongoing. The agreement would effectively, although not officially, end hostilities between the two countries and dramatically improve their relations. North Korea will agree to return more remains of US troops who died during the Korean War, although it\u2019s unclear how many of the thousands will come home and when. Last year, following the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, North Korea returned the remains of 55 American service members. The US and North Korea will establish liaison offices \u2014 which are quasi-embassies with minimal authorities \u2014 in each other\u2019s nations. That will be the first concrete step toward normalizing diplomatic ties between the two longtime enemies. North Korea will agree to stop producing materials for nuclear bombs at its Yongbyon facility. In exchange, the US will push to lift some UN sanctions on Pyongyang so it can pursue joint economic projects with South Korea. It\u2019s also possible the deal will include some other nuclear facilities, one source said.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s entirely possible that this tentative deal will change \u2014 perhaps even dramatically \u2014 between now and when Trump and Kim meet on February 27 in Vietnam.

The problem, though, is that Trump may be giving more than he\u2019s getting.\n\nWhy this deal is both good and bad for Trump\n\nIf agreed to, the most controversial part of this deal will be the promise from Kim to shutter the Yongbyon facility in exchange for some modest sanctions relief.\n\nHere\u2019s why: The people familiar with the current deal say there are no specific details and no timetable for how North Korea will end nuclear fuel production at the Yongbyon facility. Instead, Trump and Kim will agree in principle to the closure and working-level staff will finalize the details in future talks.\n\nThat\u2019s likely to pique some North Korea experts.\n\nThe Yongbyon nuclear facility is \u201cthe heart of [North Korea\u2019s] nuclear program,\u201d a top expert told the Washington Post last week. It\u2019s the only place (that we know of) where the country can make plutonium for nuclear bombs. If it shuts down, Pyongyang\u2019s ability to make plutonium-fueled nuclear weapons will be severely curtailed.\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t mean the end of its nuclear program \u2014 not by a long shot \u2014 but it would be a concrete gesture that would help signal that Kim may actually be serious about dismantling the program eventually.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s one thing for Kim to say he\u2019ll close the facility, and another thing entirely for him to actually do so.\n\nRebecca Hersman, a nuclear expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me that for this to be a real concession, Kim would have to let international inspectors into the facility to verify that nuclear material production had really ended.

And even if he did so, he could always just restart the shuttered facility once the inspectors left \u2014 as his father, Kim Jong Il, did twice before, after deals with the US collapsed.\n\nThat, in part, is why experts want any deal on closing Yongbyon to be extremely detailed. \u201cAn agreement on the dismantlement of such a site has to be worded deliberately and concisely so technical experts can watch and verify each step in the process,\u201d said Grace Liu of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n\nBut if Trump moves to lift sanctions before Kim actually ends all production at Yongbyon, he will have offered a major concession without getting anything substantive in return.\n\nThe rest of the deal, however, looks pretty good.\n\nBy signing a peace declaration, both sides will reduce tensions with one another by saying they are no longer warring enemies. By establishing liaison offices, Washington and Pyongyang will take an important step toward normalizing their relations. And by returning more troop remains to the US \u2014 something people close to the negotiations tell me is personally very important to Trump \u2014 North Korea will show it\u2019s serious about staying in America\u2019s good graces.\n\nSo there\u2019s a lot to like in this potential deal.
