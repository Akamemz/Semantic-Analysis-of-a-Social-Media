The Democrats recently harvested enough votes to retake the House of Representatives , and she will again be elected Speaker of that body in January . But a lot has changed since 2011 , when she last held the gavel . She isn \u2019 t accustomed to being ambushed on live television by the President about border security , or having newly minted members of her own caucus demand the creation of select committees while encouraging activists to besiege her office . Pelosi no doubt feels nostalgic about Barack Obama and Joe Crowley when musing about Donald Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .\nThe latter , ironically , may well be more irritating to Pelosi than the President . Trump is a Republican after all , and is thus expected to have a somewhat adversarial relationship with the top Democrat in the House . Ocasio-Cortez , once she is actually sworn in , will be a mere novice congresswoman from Pelosi \u2019 s own party . Were she not so fuddled by her 15 minutes of fame , she would try to keep her head down and learn her trade . She would studiously avoid alienating senior members of the Democratic caucus , without whose support she can not hope to survive beyond one term . And , she would never \u2014 ever \u2014 consider twisting the dragon \u2019 s tail .\nAnd Pelosi is a dragon . No one becomes Speaker of the House without copious reserves of ruthlessness and guile . Pelosi has been cordial to Ocasio-Cortez , but won \u2019 t hesitate to incinerate her if she becomes a real nuisance . Utterly oblivious of this , the bumptious \u201c girl from the Bronx \u201d was so elated to find that her office is just two doors down from Pelosi \u2019 s lair , she sent a video to her Snapchat followers , to whom she breathlessly confided , \u201c We are here at our new office and I just realized it is two doors down from Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s . That \u2019 s her office. \u201d Had she any idea how far out of her depth she is , Ocasio-Cortez would be terrified by such close proximity .\nInstead , she and her fellow activists are keeping up the pressure on Pelosi and the Democratic leadership to get moving on the \u201c Select Committee for a Green New Deal. \u201d But what exactly will that august body accomplish and how will they accomplish it ? When you peruse the goals she and her brain trust expect to reach once they convene their select committee , it reads a lot like that old gag about solving world hunger and poverty before lunch , ending all racial and gender-based income inequalities by the afternoon coffee break , and achieving universal peace early enough to arrive on time for Happy Hour .

Nope :\nThe select committee shall have authority to develop a detailed national , industrial , economic mobilization plan ( hereinafter in this section referred to as the \u201c Plan for a Green New Deal \u201d or the \u201c Plan \u201d ) for the transition of the United States economy to become carbon neutral and to significantly draw down and capture greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and oceans and to promote economic and environmental justice and equality .\nOnce that minor part of the plan is fully fleshed out , and everyone gets back from lunch , it will be time to make sure that no one has overlooked the need to eliminate poverty in the U.S. :\nThe Plan for a Green New Deal ( and the draft legislation ) shall recognize that a national , industrial , economic mobilization of this scope and scale is a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity , wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation .\nAnd , if it has occurred to any reader that this project will be a little pricey , its architects are ready and willing to respond to anyone moved to ask : How the hell do we pay for all of this ?\nThe answer is : in the same ways that we paid for the 2008 bank bailout and extended quantitative easing programs , the same ways we paid for World War II and many other wars .
