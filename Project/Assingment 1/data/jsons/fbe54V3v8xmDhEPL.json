    "content": "Compared with others , the 145-year-old lobby group isn \u2019 t a vast spender \u2013 but the NRA has the power to mobilize a grassroots support and make Washington listen\nWhy is the National Rifle Association so powerful ? Here \u2019 s a clue : it \u2019 s not ( just ) about the money .\nThe vast majority of Americans support gun control , and yet Congress has failed to toughen laws even in the wake of a series of mass shootings . With the NRA pouring money into political races at record levels it is an easy argument to make that the gun lobby has bought Washington \u2013 but that fails to paint a full picture .\nIn 2017 , the NRA spent at least $ 4.1m on lobbying \u2013 more than the $ 3.1m it spent in all of 2016 . That \u2019 s real money , but for comparison , the dairy industry has spent $ 4.4m in the same period , according to the Center for Responsive Politics ( CRP ) . The National Association of Realtors , one of the biggest spenders , has paid out $ 32.2m lobbying on housing issues . The US Chamber of Commerce , the largest spender of all , has spent $ 104m .\nThe NRA \u2019 s influence does not stem solely from lobbying . Thanks to the supreme court \u2019 s Citizens United decision , the spigot is now wide open for \u201c independent expenditures \u201d allowing groups and individuals to back \u2013 or attack \u2013 candidates , as long as those campaigns are not made in cooperation with , or at the request of , a candidate .\nThe NRA bet big on 2016 \u2019 s presidential election , making independent expenditures worth $ 53.4m . And the cash seemed to have been well spent . The NRA poured $ 14.4m into supporting 44 candidates who won and $ 34.4m opposing 19 candidates who lost , according to CRP . Its only big loss was in Nevada , for the seat vacated by the Democratic minority leader , Harry Reid .\nNor does the power of the guns manufacturers fully explain the NRA \u2019 s power . Guns are big ( ish ) business . Gun and ammunition manufacturers will have revenues of $ 13.3bn and profits of $ 1bn in 2017 , according to IBISWorld . Gun and ammunition stores this year will have revenues of $ 85.bn and profits of $ 256m .\nBut there are far bigger industries . The auto industry ( which has spent $ 51.8m on lobbying so far in 2017 ) , is on course for revenues of $ 105.3bn and profits of $ 3.1bn in 2017 .\nThe NRA \u2019 s influence , too , is out of proportion to its financial firepower . This is a world with far bigger spenders in Washington \u2013 the billionaire Koch brothers spent $ 889m on the election . And far bigger industries : Apple \u2019 s revenues were a record $ 52bn in the last three months alone and their cash , along with the other tech giants , makes the gun industry look like a rounding error .\nDan Auble , a senior researcher at CRP , said NRA \u2019 s spending was at a record high but remained \u201c paltry \u201d in comparison to groups like the pharmaceutical industry .\nIf the gun lobby is to be successful , it needs to spend money in Washington , and it does . But the amount alone does not explain the NRA \u2019 s success .\n\u201c The NRA is not successful because of its money . To be sure , it is hard to be a force in American politics without money . The NRA has money that it uses to help its favored candidates get elected . But the real source of its power , I believe , comes from voters , \u201d said Adam Winkler , professor of constitutional law at the UCLA School of Law and author of Gunfight : The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America .\nBy choosing its battles wisely , the NRA has shown an ability to swing primary elections in favor of pro-gun candidates , Winkler said . \u201c That \u2019 s the real source of their strength , \u201d he said . That and its use of a relatively small number of highly motivated people to push an agenda that appears out of step with the general population , which , according to recent polling , is in favour of stricter gun laws .\nThe 145-year-old organization claims 5 million active members , although that number is disputed . But whatever its actual size , that membership is a powerful tool , said Robert Spitzer , professor of crime , law and policy and gun control at the State University of New York at Cortland and the author of five books on guns .\n\u201c They have a very powerful ability to mobilize a grassroots support and to engage in politics when most Americans can barely be bothered to vote , \u201d he said . \u201c I mean more than voting . I mean going to a meeting , writing a letter , contacting a friend , \u201d he said . \u201c And because so few Americans do those things , if you get a bunch of people in a locality who are all prepared to go out to a meeting they can have a big effect .\n\u201c Elected officials feel the impact of constituents when they hear their voices , \u201d said Spitzer . \u201c Politics is often about the squeaky wheel \u2013 who makes the loudest noise , who gets the most attention . \u201d\nThere are , however , problems on the horizon for the NRA . For one , the gun control lobby is growing . Billionaire Michael Bloomberg \u2019 s gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety is threatening to spend more than $ 25m in 2018 races . Americans for Responsible Solutions , a gun control political action committee set up by Gabrielle Giffords , a former Democratic congresswoman whose career was ended when she was shot along with 18 others in an Arizona suburb , spent $ 13.4m in 2016 .\nPlay Video 1:35 'This happens nowhere else ' : senator decries gun laws after Florida shooting \u2013 video\nThe issue for gun control advocates is that they have yet to develop as powerful a voice \u2013 or as deep contacts in Washington \u2013 as the gun lobby . \u201c I think it \u2019 s fair to say that so far they have been thwarted at the federal level , \u201d said Auble . \u201c They are just not as well funded , not as established , and don \u2019 t have the history the NRA has . \u201d\n1,516 mass shootings in 1,735 days : America 's gun crisis \u2013 in one chart Read more\nEven if the gun control groups gave the same amount of money to the same candidates , said Winkler , those candidates would not vote in favor of gun control . \u201c It \u2019 s not just money , \u201d he said . \u201c If Michael Bloomberg said he will give you $ 2 for every $ 1 the NRA gives you , it is not going to work . \u201d\nThe truth is that gun control is not an area where money is leading politics , he said . It \u2019 s an issue that some voters care a lot about and elected officials respond to those voters . \u201c Especially the intense , mobilized , minority of voters that support most vigorously the right to bear arms . \u201d\nBut putting the money and its current influence aside , the NRA faces existential issues in the years ahead as its opposition grows .\nThe election of Donald Trump was a major victory for the NRA . On the eve of his 100th day in office , Trump addressed the NRA \u2019 s annual conference , the first sitting president to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1983 . \u201c You came through for me , and I am going to come through for you , \u201d Trump told the cheering crowd .\n\u201c I am here to deliver you good news : the eight-year assault on your second amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end . \u201d\nThat cheering crowd \u2013 largely white , male and older \u2013 was a snapshot of the people who swung Trump \u2019 s victory . It \u2019 s also a picture of a demographic in decline .\nBy mid-century the US is expected to become a majority minority nation . The NRA \u2019 s core constituency is basically older white males . Younger people are not taking up gun ownership at the same rate as older people did , said Spitzer , and polls of minorities show they feel more strongly about gun control . Attempts by the NRA to broaden its appeal do not seem to have paid off . \u201c They are facing an existential demographic problem , \u201d said Spitzer .\nEven a Trump presidency may not be good for the NRA .
