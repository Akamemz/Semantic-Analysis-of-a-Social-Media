According to the organization 's press release :\nNew undercover footage shows Planned Parenthood Federation of America 's Senior Director of Medical Services , Dr. Deborah Nucatola , describing how Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of aborted fetuses , and admitting she uses partial-birth abortions to supply intact body parts .

As head of PPFA 's Medical Services department , Nucatola has overseen medical practice at all Planned Parenthood locations since 2009 .

Is there shipping involved , is somebody coming to pick it up -- so , I think everybody just wants to -- it 's really just about if anyone were ever to ask them , well what do you do for this $ 60 , how can you justify that ? Or are you basically just doing something completely egregious , that you should be doing for free . So it just needs to be justifiable . And , look , we have 67 affiliates . They all have different practice environments , very different staff , and so with that number -- ACTOR : Did you say 67 ? NUCATOLA : 67 . ACTOR : Okay . And so of that number , how much would personality of the personnel in there , would play into it as far as how we 're speaking to them -- NUCATOLA : I think for affiliates , at the end of the day , they 're a non-profit , they just do n't want to -- they want to break even . And if they can do a little better than break even , and do so in a way that seems reasonable , they 're happy to do that . Really their bottom line is , they just , they want to break even .
