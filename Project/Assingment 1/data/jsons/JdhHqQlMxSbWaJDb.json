Indeed , some of the loudest advocates for blocking the cuts \u2014 like Representative Howard P. McKeon of California , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , and Senator John McCain of Arizona , the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 voted to create them ; 28 Senate Republicans and 174 House Republicans voted for the Budget Control Act , overwhelming the opposition .\nBut the threat they created may be doing its job .

That means everything else \u2014 operations and maintenance , research and development , procurement , fuel , military construction \u2014 would face immediate cuts as deep as 13 percent , Mr. Harrison said .\nAnd under the law , the Defense Department could not do the kind of planning that would rationalize the cuts . Mr. Graham warned the citizens of Beaufort that the Marines would have to shut either their Parris Island or San Diego training camps , and would face the same choice between their airfields at Beaufort or Cherry Point , N.C . In fact , under the law , all bases face the same cuts because Congress has prohibited base closings .\nThe dire warnings are not coming from Mr. Graham alone .

Tack on $ 600 billion more and the impact will be debilitating , Pentagon officials say .\nBut those warnings have not gotten Mr. Panetta very far .
