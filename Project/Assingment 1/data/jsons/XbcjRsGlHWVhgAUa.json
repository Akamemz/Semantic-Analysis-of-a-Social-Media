It\u2019s behind the original expectations, but way ahead of the disaster scenarios that had looked possible during the worst months of the troubled rollout last fall.\n\n( WATCH: Obama: Employer-based health insurance system not going anywhere)\n\nThere are still reasons to be skeptical of the numbers, and health care experts warn that the administration still has a lot of work to do by the end of March \u2014 when enrollment ends for this year \u2014 to get the right mix of customers so there are enough healthy people to pay for the sicker ones.\n\nBut the new report is good enough that it might reset Washington\u2019s expectations: maybe Obamacare isn\u2019t going to be a train wreck after all. Maybe it\u2019ll be more like one of those Metro trains that runs kind of slowly, and sometimes stops in the middle of the tracks for no apparent reason, but eventually gets you where you need to go.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from the new numbers:\n\nThe meltdown has been avoided\n\nBack in October, it looked like Obamacare enrollment could end up as a total bust. Just 106,000 people had signed up, and it looked like a stretch to get even a few million by the end of March.\n\n( 20 quotes: More Obamacare, less work)\n\nNow, the disaster scenario is already off the table. By the end of January, 3.3 million Americans had selected a private health insurance plan. That\u2019s a 1.1 million increase over the December figures, and it shows that people were still signing up at a pretty fast pace, even though December was supposed to be one of the peak months as everyone rushed to sign up for January coverage.\n\nThe enrollment is now \u201clarge enough for the market to function,\u201d said Jonathan Gruber, the MIT health economist who consulted on Obamacare and the Massachusetts health reform law that preceded it.
