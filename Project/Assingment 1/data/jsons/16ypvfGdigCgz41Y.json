It has become a common refrain .\nThe views of this African-American pit master suggest that many Americans are curious about Trump not just because he brazenly breaks the rules of political rhetoric but also because the key to tackling America \u2019 s problems , they say , requires people to stop taking offense at the drop of a hat .\nIn that way , Trump is the symbol of a broader cultural tension . As many Millennials , in particular , become more militant in their desire to make public discourse inclusive , they are coming up against those tired of \u201c wars against Christmas \u201d or tentative talk about Islamic extremism .\nFor Millennials , who have grown up in the language of political correctness , speech is a weapon , and curtailing words that can be seen as offensive or hateful is a new civil-rights frontier . But Trump \u2019 s unfiltered speech encapsulates a potent backlash , with many conservative Americans trying to draw the line on how cautious and careful public conversation becomes .\n\u201c The big difference with Trump is , his language is not coded , \u201d says Henry Giroux , a political scientist at McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , and author of the upcoming book \u201c America At War With Itself , \u201d which largely focuses on the rise of Trump .\nTrump \u2019 s words \u201c tap into is a nation that really has been suffering , particularly since 9/11 , from a kind of national insecurity state , mobilized by a massive sense of fear , \u201d he adds . But Millennials see in such language a \u201c darkness lurking beneath the surface . \u201d\nOn Super Tuesday , Trump continued his trend of underperforming among voters age 18 to 29 . But he did well among New England suburbanites , Southern Evangelicals , small businessmen , and blue-collar workers , among others .\nAt least partly behind Trump \u2019 s success is the perception that political correctness has morphed into \u201c soft totalitarianism , \u201d wrote James Kalb wrote in Chronicles Magazine late last year .\n\u201c The domination of public life by PC elites has \u2026 made it impossible for ordinary people to assert their complaints publicly in an acceptable way , so their objections can easily be shrugged off as the outbursts of ignorant bigots who will , in any event , soon become demographically irrelevant . \u201d\nAntipathy toward political correctness spans a wide spectrum of Americans , many whom use the phrase as a pejorative .\nSeventy-one percent of Americans say political correctness is a problem in the United States , up 10 percentage points from 2014 , according to an August 2015 report by Rasmussen Reports .\nAt the Pawn Depot , situated on a lonely stretch of US 278 in Lithonia , Ga. , that concern is front-of-mind .\nElizabeth Langbecker , the owner , is a Trump fan because he \u201c refuses to tip-toe \u201d around immigration , the economy , and terrorism .\n\u201c We need someone who is not afraid to step up to the plate and say what a lot of us want to say , \u201d she adds .\nShe weighs the Obama administration 's efforts to downplay the phrase `` Islamic extremism \u201d against the San Bernardino , Calif. , shootings last year , where a Muslim couple killed 14 people and injured 22 others . \u201c How can we deal with all these problems if we can \u2019 t even have an honest conversation about the root cause , \u201d she says .\nIn the 2016 race , political correctness has played out in a number of ways .
