The Florida senator has recently picked up establishment backers, including Bob Dole and Tim Pawlenty, and important new donors, several of them availed from the wreckage of the Jeb Bush campaign.

Hypothetically, though, we can flesh out a case for how Rubio wins\u2014how he converts a strategy of second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-place finishes into political triumph. Here are three main factors to consider, from the ephemeral to the arithmetic.\n\nI. THE \u201cMODERATE\u201d CHARM\n\nNo one should deny that Rubio is a skilled politician who delivers good stump speeches and speaks clearly. There\u2019s also a sweetness to him that seems hard to fake (hard, I say, but not impossible). When Rubio refers to commercials making fun of his boots, or admits he \u201cdid not do well\u201d in the debate, or contrasts himself to a petulant Trump and Cruz by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019m not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me,\u201d he\u2019s hard to hate. His kids are adorable. Best of all, Rubio seems sincere even when telling a lie, while Cruz seems mendacious even when telling the truth. I\u2019ll note in passing that it\u2019s an unfair world to Ted Cruz, and yet Cruz deserves it. Mull that paradox, if you like.\n\nRubio\u2019s appealing manner has earned him the label of \u201cmoderate,\u201d which is mostly a benefit, because even primary voters who are tepid toward Rubio might be persuaded to vote for him, so the theory goes, if they think you might vote for him, too. (For what it\u2019s worth, the same great thinking went into nominating John Kerry.)\n\nTo be sure, however, Rubio isn\u2019t what most of us, Democrat or Republican, would call moderate. His core portfolio of policies\u2014more force abroad, more immigration at home, bigger tax cuts, less government-subsidized health care, lower Social Security payments\u2014has the support of, oh, maybe eight or nine ordinary voters. But G.O.P. Washington and K Street love it. Rubio is a fine new wrapping in which to present the same old butter cookies. If anyone can prevent the G.O.P. from having to offer anything other than a new face, it's him.\n\nII. MONEY HONEY INCONSISTENCY\n\nRubio\u2019s greatest strength may be a steady detachment from consistency, or words, as most of us understand them. He\u2019s not wedded to what most would call \u201ctruth,\u201d or even to what he said yesterday.\n\nLet us continue to be cynical, albeit not wrong, for a moment: candidates take in donations by signaling that they\u2019re partially\u2014just partially\u2014for sale. They usually have some core convictions (maybe on the place of faith in public life, or the importance of free enterprise, or universal health care) and put the rest up for auction\u2014views on ethanol subsidies, hedge-fund taxation, tort reform, etc. This isn\u2019t purely sleazy.
