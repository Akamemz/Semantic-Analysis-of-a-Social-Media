    "content": "Romney Goes On Offense , Pays For It In First Wave Of Fact Checks\nIn their first of three debates , President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney `` traded barbs '' and stretched some facts , say the nonpartisan watchdogs at PolitiFact.com .\nSimilarly , the researchers at the Annenberg Public Policy Center 's FactCheck.org found examples of truth-stretching by both men .\nOverall , it was a debate packed with facts , a wonk 's delight . From the very first remarks , with President Obama saying 5 million jobs have been created in the private sector over the last 30 months , the debate was very number focused . So there were some things to check . And because Romney made more factual assertions , he 's getting dinged more \u2014 at least in the early hours after the debate \u2014 by the fact checkers .\nHere is a sample of what 's being reported about the truthiness of what Obama and Romney had to say Wednesday night on stage at the University of Denver :\n-- One of the biggest disputes was over tax cuts . Obama argued that Romney 's plan to stimulate the economy includes a tax cut totaling $ 5 trillion that , Obama said , is n't possible because the Republican nominee is also promising to spend money in other places .\nRomney flatly disputed that number . `` First of all , I do n't have a $ 5 trillion tax cut , '' he said .\nWho 's right ? The Washington Post 's Fact Checker says the facts on this one are on Obama 's side . The New York Times notes that Romney `` has proposed cutting all marginal tax rates by 20 percent \u2014 which would in and of itself cut tax revenue by $ 5 trillion . ''\nFactCheck.org has weighed in too , tweeting during the debate that `` Romney says he will pay for $ 5T tax cut without raising deficit or raising taxes on middle class . Experts say that 's not possible . ''\nPolitiFact has given a `` mostly true '' rating to the charge that `` Romney is proposing a tax plan `` that would give millionaires another tax break and raise taxes on middle class families by up to $ 2,000 a year . ''\n-- Has the president put in place a plan that would cut Medicare benefits by $ 716 billion ? Romney says yes . The president says no . According to PolitiFact , Romney 's charge is `` half true . ''\n`` That amount \u2014 $ 716 billion \u2014 refers to Obamacare 's reductions in Medicare spending over 10 years , primarily paid to insurers and hospitals , '' says PolitiFact . So there is a basis for the number . But , it adds , `` the statement gives the impression that the law takes money already allocated to Medicare away from current recipients , '' which is why it gets only a `` half true '' rating .\nThe New York Times writes that Obama `` did not cut benefits by $ 716 billion over 10 years as part of his 2010 health care law ; rather , he reduced Medicare reimbursements to health care providers , chiefly insurance companies and drug manufacturers . And the law gave Medicare recipients more generous benefits for prescription drugs and free preventive care like mammograms . ''\nStill , as NPR 's Julie Rovner has reported , `` some of the money does indeed reduce future Medical spending , and the fact is , you ca n't reduce health care spending and preserve Medicare for 78 million baby boomers without slowing its growth . ''\n-- In listing his objections to the Affordable Care Act , Romney said it `` puts in place an unelected board that 's going to tell people , ultimately , what kind of treatments they can have . I do n't like that idea . ''\nBut the Times and National Journal have reported that the board in question would n't make treatment decisions , a point Obama made during the debate . National Journal called Romney 's characterization of what this board would do `` one of the biggest whoppers of the night . '' PolitiFact gave Romney 's claim a `` mostly false '' rating .\nUnder the law , the board 's job would be to keep Medicare spending within a particular target ( not a dollar figure , but as a factor of GDP ) but the board is prohibited from choosing the benefits to be restricted to achieve savings , so it can not make treatment decisions .\nFactCheck.org , which has likened the charge about this panel to the earlier claim from Republicans that Obama would create `` death panels , '' writes that `` the board , the Independent Payment Advisory Board , can not , by law , 'ration ' care or determine which treatments Medicare covers . In fact , the IPAB is limited in what it can do to curb the growth of Medicare spending . ''\n-- On cutting the federal deficit , PolitiFact writes , `` Romney claimed that Obama had said he would 'cut the deficit in half . ' That 's the case . ... Obama said he put forward ' a specific $ 4 trillion deficit reduction plan . ' That 's true if you combine the 10-year impact of his budget with the 10-year impact of cuts already approved . ( For that reason , we 've previously found his claim that his budget plan would 'cut our deficits by $ 4 trillion ' Half True . ) ''\n-- As for Obama 's claim that under his watch the economy has created 5 million jobs in the past 30 months , NPR 's John Ydstie says that 's true . But it also ignores an inconvenient truth ( for the president ) , that about the same number of jobs were lost during Obama 's first year in office .\n-- And on a lighter note , the debate opened with a tender moment and a fact that soon was disputed on Twitter . In acknowledging his wedding anniversary , Obama said that `` 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me .
