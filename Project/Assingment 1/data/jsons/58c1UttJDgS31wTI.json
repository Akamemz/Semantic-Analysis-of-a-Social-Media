We wo n't get another opportunity -- it will be too late , '' he said in a speech that recreated the vision of a dystopian , crime-riddled nation on the edge of an existential crisis that he deployed in his convention speech in Cleveland in July .\nHe vowed to create a `` deportation task force '' within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division `` focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens in America . '' He said he would boost the ranks of enforcement agents to enforce existing laws . He vowed that any undocumented immigrants who are caught crossing into the US will be `` detained until they are removed from our country '' and sent back to their country of origin . And he promised to repeal President Barack Obama 's executive orders shielding some younger undocumented people , including those born in the United States -- so called Dreamers , from deportation .\nTrump left the fate of most of the 11 million undocumented people who are not criminals in the country murky .\nHe did not commit to deporting every undocumented immigrant living in the US as he previously had , but vowed that immigrants living in the US illegally would never have a path to legal status under his presidency .\n`` For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status , they will have one route and only one route : to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system .
