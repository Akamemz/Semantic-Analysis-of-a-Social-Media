The Arabs could then play the role of Joseph Stalin from 1939 to 1941 , when he gleefully saw the western campaigns of his new partner of convenience , Hitler , as a win-win that would weaken both the double-dealing Nazis on his new Polish border and the hated capitalists of the Western democracies .\nA second reason for the Middle East \u2019 s realignment is that the U.S. is now the world \u2019 s largest producer \u2014 and soon exporter \u2014 of oil and gas , making it more or less immune to Arab strategic pressures . Even more important : While the U.S. can no longer be manipulated by the Arab world , the latter certainly can be by the U.S. , given that the exporting lifeblood of the Gulf requires free passage through the Straits of Hormuz , the guarantee of which is beyond all the collective naval and air resources of Arab nations .\nOnly the U.S. can keep the straits open for global commerce , for the viability of the Arab exporting regimes , and for the survival of oil importers such as Europe and China .

It is not just that Washington does not fret about an oil embargo of America ; it does not worry about an oil cutoff to Tel Aviv either .\nThird , in terms of strategic space , Israel \u2019 s most recent major enemies , Iran and Turkey , are distant , not on its immediate borders as in the past , and both are alienated from the U.S. More fundamentally , Iran and Turkey border a few Arab states , not Israel \u2014 a fact that reinforces the worry over Iranian nuclear weapons to come . In wars of the past , Israel prepared for a Syrian-Jordanian-Egyptian triplex assault . Now the first is an apostate failed state ; the second , a quiet supporter ; and the third , a de facto ally .

Recep Erdogan \u2019 s clumsy embrace of a new Ottomanism means one thing in the West and quite another in the Arab world once ruled by Istanbul for centuries .
