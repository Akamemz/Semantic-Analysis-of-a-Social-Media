    "content": "On consecutive days , President Obama and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have told the next generation of military leaders that sexual assault is threatening the dignity and effectiveness of the force .\nThough the war in Afghanistan continues , the Obama administration has , in many ways , already begun to turn the Pentagon toward a new set of challenges . Mr. Obama 's address to the National Defense University Thursday spoke to the strategic parts of that shift \u2013 from stricter rules for drone strikes to new rules for the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay .\nBut the president 's speech the next day to graduates of the US Naval Academy in Annapolis , Md. , stressed that stamping out an epidemic of sexual assault within the military must also be a primary goal . Secretary Hagel made the same point Saturday in a speech to graduates at the US Military Academy in West Point , N.Y .\nThere is ample evidence to suggest that no solution will be easy or quick . A survey released earlier this month suggests that 26,000 people in the military were sexually assaulted in the previous year \u2013 a rate of 70 a day . Moreover , only 3,400 incidents were reported , suggesting a widespread lack of confidence in the military justice system on the issue .\nDue to a lack of research , the trend line is unclear . The current number is up from the previous year ( 19,000 ) but down from 2006 ( 34,000 ) .\nMeanwhile , recent weeks have brought a flood of troubling allegations . This month , two members of military sexual-assault prevention units \u2013 one for the Air Force and one at the Army 's Fort Hood in Texas \u2013 have been accused of sexual assault .

Claire McCaskill ( D ) of Missouri has introduced a bill to ensure that \u201c never again will a victim have to salute an assaulter , '' according to NBC News . It would require a member of the military who has been found guilty of sexual assault to be dismissed or dishonorably discharged . While it would also prohibit a commander from nullifying or changing a sexual-assault conviction , it would not remove sexual-assault cases from the chain of command entirely .\nThat has been a point of contention for critics , who note that commanders often reduce or eliminate punishments resulting from sexual-assault investigations . To address this , a competing bill by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D ) of New York would create a separate procedure for dealing with sexual-assault cases .\nBut Pentagon officials strongly resist the idea of taking control out of the hands of commanders , saying such a move would undermine unit cohesiveness and discipline .
