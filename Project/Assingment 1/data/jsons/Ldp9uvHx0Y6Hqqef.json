    "content": "Obama 's water war Industries like agriculture , oil and home-building are lining up to attack a rule aimed at protecting wetlands and waterways .\nThe Obama administration announced new protections Wednesday for thousands of waterways and wetlands , pushing ahead despite a fierce counterattack from powerhouse industries like agriculture , oil and home-building \u2014 and their supporters in Congress .\nOn its face , the Waters of the United States rule is largely a technical document , defining which rivers , streams , lakes and marshes fall under the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers . But opponents condemn it as a massive power grab by Washington , saying it will give bureaucrats carte blanche to swoop in and penalize landowners every time a cow walks through a ditch . And it comes amid years of complaints from Republicans about President Barack Obama \u2019 s regulatory agenda , which has encompassed everything from power plants and health insurers to Internet providers and for-profit colleges .\nCritics are already fighting back : The House voted earlier this month to block the rule , with support from both Republicans and some farm- and energy-state Democrats , and similar legislation is moving through the Senate . Opponents are also preparing lawsuits that will add to an already long trail of litigation over the government \u2019 s powers to regulate water \u2014 an issue the Supreme Court has taken up twice , with confusing results , since 2001 .\nObama was quick to add his personal endorsement to the rule , saying the measure is needed to protect vulnerable waterways and drinking water and to keep the economy going .\n\u201c This rule will provide the clarity and certainty businesses and industry need about which waters are protected by the Clean Water Act , and it will ensure polluters who knowingly threaten our waters can be held accountable , \u201d Obama said in a statement after the EPA released a final version of the regulation . \u201c My administration has made historic commitments to clean water , from restoring iconic watersheds like the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes to preserving more than a thousand miles of rivers and other waters for future generations . With today \u2019 s rule , we take another step towards protecting the waters that belong to all of us . \u201d\nBut House Speaker John Boehner accused the president of delivering yet another devastating blow to the economy .\n\u201c The administration \u2019 s decree to unilaterally expand federal authority is a raw and tyrannical power grab that will crush jobs , \u201d the Ohio Republican said in a statement . \u201c [ T ] he rule is being shoved down the throats of hardworking people with no input , and places landowners , small businesses , farmers and manufacturers on the road to a regulatory and economic hell . \u201d\nThe agencies and their supporters say the safety of drinking water and stream health are threatened because of weak state and local regulation and a lack of enforcement . The rule is meant to make it clearer which waterways EPA and the Corps of Engineers can oversee under the 43-year-old Clean Water Act , which covers \u201c navigable waters \u201d such as the Mississippi River and Lake Erie but is vague on how far upstream protections must go to keep those water bodies clean .\nIn essence , the rule would establish whether antipollution laws are triggered if a farmer blocks a stream to make a pond for livestock , a developer fills in part of a wetland to put up a house or an oil pipeline has to cross a creek .\n\u201c The only people with reason to oppose the rule are polluters who threaten our clean water , \u201d senior White House adviser Brian Deese told reporters during a conference call . He added that the rule \u201c is based on common sense . \u2026 The status quo is rife with unsustainable confusion over what \u2019 s protected and what \u2019 s not . \u201d\nThe final rule ensures protections for tributaries that have physical signs of flowing water , even if they don \u2019 t run all year round , and ditches that \u201c look and act \u201d like tributaries , said Jo-Ellen Darcy , the assistant secretary of the Army for civil works . The rule also limits EPA regulatory oversight to any body of water within 1,500 feet of another water body already covered by the rule , unless they have a surface water connection .\nEPA and the corps also decided to extend protections to regional water features , like prairie potholes and coastal bays in the Delmarva peninsula and the Carolinas , on a case by case basis .\nEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the rule maintains long-held exemptions for agriculture and does not cover features like tile drainage systems , regular farm activities or the moving of livestock . The agency detailed many of the changes in a series of industry-specific fact sheets , also released Wednesday .\nDespite the changes , McCarthy added that the new rule would expand the reach of the Clean Water Act by only about 3 percent . The measure is expected to take effect 60 days after it \u2019 s published in the Federal Register .\nDefining where a navigable waterway begins and ends has long spurred disputes among the government , environmentalists and industry . Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 added to the confusion , imposing a less-than-clear requirement that upstream water must have a \u201c significant nexus \u201d to a navigable waterway to fall under the federal government \u2019 s jurisdiction .\nGroups that back the rule , such as the Natural Resources Defense Council , the Sierra Club , Environment America and fishing organizations , want the definition to be as broad as possible , saying you can \u2019 t protect major lakes and rivers unless you protect their sources upstream . And they say the federal government needs an oversight role , argued that states lack the financial resources and manpower to keep water from becoming polluted .\nSupporters of the rule were quick to herald Wednesday \u2019 s action .\n\u201c Small streams and wetlands provide drinking water to roughly 1 in 3 Americans and they must be protected from pollution at the source , \u201d said Sen. Barbara Boxer of California , the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee , in a statement .\nOn the other side are Republicans and some of the biggest spenders in Washington .\n\u201c The administration \u2019 s cavalier attitude toward expanding the federal government \u2019 s authority into our backyards is absolutely outrageous , \u201d said Sen. David Vitter ( R-La. ) . \u201c Not only were small businesses \u2014 who will be dramatically impacted by expanding of the definition of \u2018 waters of the United States \u2019 \u2014 inappropriately excluded from the rule-making process , but the federal government shouldn \u2019 t be regulating puddles on private property in the first place . \u201d\nThe Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers have joined the American Farm Bureau Federation , Dairy Farmers of America , pesticide manufacturers , mining companies , home builders , state and local governments , water utilities , flood control districts , the timber industry , railroads , real estate developers and even golf course operators among the more than 230 organizations and companies that have listed \u201c Waters of the United States \u201d on federal lobbying disclosures since the administration proposed the rule in March 2014 .\nMany food and beverage giants have pitched their thoughts to lawmakers on the measure , too , including Tyson Foods , Perdue Farms , Land O \u2019 Lakes , the potato giant J.R.

The 261-155 vote included yes votes from 24 Democrats , of whom eight sit on the House Agriculture Committee and two sit on Energy and Commerce . Four of the Democrats are from energy-heavy Texas .\nThe Senate is considering a similar measure from Sen. John Barrasso ( R-Wyo . ) that is awaiting a vote in the Environment and Public Works Committee and has the backing of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . Other supporters include three Democrats on the Agriculture Committee : Joe Donnelly of Indiana , Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia .\nBarrasso \u2019 s measure includes more detailed consultation requirements than the House version and sets a Dec. 31 , 2016 , goal for EPA to finish a revised rule .\nThe White House has threatened to veto Shuster \u2019 s bill , arguing that it would \u201c derail current efforts to clarify the scope of the CWA , hamstring future regulatory efforts and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water . \u201d\nHowever , that won \u2019 t stop the agriculture industry and other opponents from suing .
