The day after Parnas said he delivered the message , the State Department announced that Vice President Mike Pence would no longer be attending the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskiy .\nParnas alleged that Trump ordered Pence to stay away at the behest of Giuliani to send a clear message to the incoming Ukrainian administration that they needed to take seriously the demand for an investigation into Biden , a Democratic presidential candidate seen as a potential threat to Trump \u2019 s 2020 reelection .\nParnas said every communication he had with Zelenskiy \u2019 s team was at the direction of Giuliani , whom he regularly overheard briefing Trump about their progress by phone .\n\u201c I feel sorry for him , \u201d Giuliani said Wednesday in a text message to an AP reporter . \u201c I thought he was an honorable man . I was wrong . \u201d\nAsked directly if Parnas was lying , Trump \u2019 s lawyer replied , \u201c I \u2019 m not responding yet . \u201d\nParnas said he also heard Giuliani and another Trump-aligned defense lawyer , Victoria Toensing , briefing Attorney General William Barr by phone about their efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to announce the investigation into Biden and his son Hunter \u2019 s business dealings .\nThe Justice Department said in September that Trump had not spoken to Barr about having Ukraine investigate the Bidens and that the attorney general had not discussed Ukraine with Giuliani . Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Wednesday that Parnas \u2019 claims were \u201c 100 % false . \u201d\nThe new accusations came as House Democrats made public a trove of documents , text messages and photos from Parnas \u2019 smartphones that appear to verify parts of his account .\nThe documents , released just ahead of the start of the impeachment trial , could raise pressure on the Senate as it debates whether to hear witnesses .\nA federal judge earlier this month ruled that Parnas could provide the materials to Congress as part of the impeachment proceedings .

Hyde , a Republican candidate for Congress from Connecticut , disparaged Yovanovitch in messages to Parnas and gave him updates on her location and cellphone use .\nRep. Eliot Engel , D_N.Y. , who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee , said the messages are \u201c profoundly alarming \u201d and \u201c suggest a possible risk \u201d to Yovanovitch \u2019 s security in Kyiv before she was recalled from her post .\n\u201c These threats occurred at the same time that the two men were also discussing President Trump \u2019 s efforts , through Rudy Giuliani , to smear the ambassador \u2019 s reputation , \u201d Engel said .\nHe said the committee is seeking assurances that proper steps have been taken to ensure the security of Yovanovitch and committee staff .\nThe text and phone records show Parnas communicating with Giuliani multiple times a day before Yovanovitch \u2019 s removal , as well as a handwritten note that mentions asking Ukraine \u2019 s president to investigate \u201c the Biden case . \u201d\nAmong the documents is a screenshot of a previously undisclosed letter from Giuliani to Zelenskiy dated May 10 , 2019 , which was shortly after Zelenskiy was elected but before he took office .
