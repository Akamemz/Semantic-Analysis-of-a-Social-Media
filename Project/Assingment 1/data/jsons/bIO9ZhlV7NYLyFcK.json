    "content": "President-elect Donald Trump has picked retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to be his secretary of defense , tapping yet another outspoken ex-military leader who butted heads with the Obama administration to shape and carry out his national security strategy .\nIf confirmed , the highly decorated battlefield commander would be only the second retired general to become defense secretary \u2014 and would require a special waiver from Congress in the form of separate legislation .\n\u201c I will not tell you that one of our great , great generals \u2014 don \u2019 t let it outside of this room , \u201d Trump teased a rally in Cincinnati Thursday night , playing up the drama . \u201c We are going to appoint 'Mad Dog ' Mattis as our secretary of defense \u2026 but we are not announcing it until Monday , so don \u2019 t tell anyone . He \u2019 s great . \u201d\n`` They say he \u2019 s the closest thing to Gen. George Patton that we have and it \u2019 s about time , '' he added , referring to the impolitic and aggressive battlefield commander in World War II . `` It \u2019 s about time . \u201d\nHours earlier , Trump 's transition team had denied that he had settled on a defense secretary despite a report in The Washington Post that Mattis was the choice . `` No decision has been made yet with regard to Secretary of Defense , '' spokesman Jason Miller tweeted at 4:40 p.m .\nMattis , 66 , so nicknamed for his salty language and obsessive dedication to the military , was the top U.S. commander in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2010 to 2013 . He had earlier co-authored a counterinsurgency strategy manual credited with helping to halt some of the worst sectarian violence in Iraq before the U.S. military withdrawal in December 2011 .\nBut as head of the U.S. Central Command he also clashed with President Barack Obama 's National Security Council , particularly over Iran , which Mattis has called \u201c the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East . ''\nIt 's a view that aligns more closely with Trump and his pick for White House national security adviser , retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn , whom the Obama administration had removed as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 . Both Trump and Flynn have advocated pulling out of an agreement reached with Iran last year to curtail its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions and eventually removing the arms embargo .\nYet not all of Mattis ' views are so in sync with Trump and Flynn , who have made friendly gestures to Russian President Vladimir Putin . Mattis has expressed deep wariness of Russia 's intentions , saying it wants \u201c to break NATO apart . \u201d\nDuring the campaign Mattis did not hold back in criticizing Trump and some of his rhetoric , including the president-elect 's comments that NATO was obsolete and that its members do n't pay their fair share .\n\u201c Some of those allies have lost more troops per capita in Afghanistan than we have , \u2019 \u2019 Mattis , who also served as NATO \u2019 s supreme allied commander for transformation , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in July . \u201c Some of them are spending 20 percent of their national budget on defense . \u201d\nView Trump announces his pick for General 'Mad Dog ' Mattis as defense secretary At a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday , President-elect Donald Trump announced that he picked retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to be his secretary of defense .\nOn Trump \u2019 s call for a ban on Muslim immigrants , Mattis said that such talk prompts U.S. allies to think \u201c we have lost faith in reason . \u201d\n\u201c They think we \u2019 ve completely lost it , '' he said . `` This kind of thing is causing us great damage right now , and it \u2019 s sending shock waves through this international system . ''\nThe general has also espoused some views that break with the majority of his fellow military leaders . He has expressed reservations about allowing women to serve in combat , telling the Marines ' Memorial Club in San Francisco that `` the idea of putting women in there is not setting them up for success . '' He has also questioned whether the U.S. nuclear arsenal needs to consist of submarines , bombers and land-based missiles . `` Is it time to reduce the Triad to a Diad , removing the land\u2010based missiles ? '' he asked the Senate Armed Services Committee last year .\nThe pick was swiftly lauded by the GOP national security establishment .\n`` He brings a clear-eyed view to the potential adversaries our nation faces , including Russia , '' Tom Spoehr , director of the Center for National Defense at the conservative Heritage Foundation , said in a statement , calling the general `` an outstanding selection for this critically important position . ''\nMattis has key backers on Capitol Hill , including Sen. John McCain , the Arizona Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee , which would lead the confirmation process .\n`` General Mattis is one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops , '' McCain said in a recent statement . `` He is a forthright strategic thinker . His integrity is unshakable and unquestionable . And he has earned his knowledge and experience the old-fashioned way : in the crucible of our nation 's defense and the service of heroes .\n\u201c General Mattis has a clear understanding of the many challenges facing the Department of Defense , the U.S. military and our national security , '' McCain added .\nSince retiring from the Marine Corps , Mattis has served on the board of defense giant General Dynamics , as well as Theranos , a Silicon Valley biotech company that came under scrutiny for its business practices \u2014 and which Mattis reportedly advocated on behalf of before the military despite agreeing not to .\nHe 's also a fellow at the Hoover Institution , a conservative think tank at Stanford University in Palo Alto , Calif. , and has done some private consulting .\nMattis ' elevation to Trump 's Cabinet would make him a first among equals .\nApart from the president , only the defense secretary has the legal authority to order the military into action . And while the decision to launch a nuclear attack rests solely with the commander-in-chief , the procedures require secondary confirmation from the defense secretary , though he does not get a veto .\nView Photo gallery Politicians , moguls and even a few Democrats : Trump 's revolving door of post-election visitors Political observers have closely watched Donald Trump \u2019 s every move as he goes about the massive task of filling the thousands of political appointee jobs , with acute interest in the makeup of his Cabinet . Hundreds of people have called on Trump \u2019 s Manhattan office , rural New Jersey getaway and Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over the past two months ; here \u2019 s a day-by-day look at some of the people who have visited since Trump was elected .\nBut to get the job Mattis will need something highly unusual : a waiver . As a result , his selection is viewed by some as a major departure from tradition .\nMattis is technically ineligible to be Defense secretary because the law requires retired military officers to be out of uniform for seven years before they can become the military 's civilian leader . That 's in an effort to ensure that civilian control of the armed forces , a bedrock of the American democratic tradition , remains inviolate .\nUnless Congress votes and the president signs an exception , `` a person may not be appointed as secretary of defense within seven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force , '' the law says .\n`` It happened once , '' Harold Brown , who was defense secretary under President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981 , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` And that was George Marshall , '' the Army 's legendary chief of staff in World War II , who went to become both secretary of State and secretary of defense under President Harry Truman . `` Congress had to pass a separate law exempting him . ''\nIn 1994 , President Bill Clinton picked retired Adm. Bobby Inman to be Defense secretary , but he had been off of active duty for the required period and his nomination was ultimately withdrawn anyway .\nWhen Congress passed a waiver for Marshall in 1950 , it made clear it did not want to set a precedent .\n`` It is hereby expressed as the intent of the Congress that the authority granted by this Act is not to be construed as approval by the Congress of continuing appointments of military men to the office of Secretary of Defense in the future , '' its report accompanying the legislation said . `` It is hereby expressed as the sense of the Congress that after General Marshall leaves the office of secretary of defense , no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved . ''\nRetired Marine Gen. James Mattis was the top U.S. commander in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2010 to 2013 . | AP Photo\n`` The Congress ' report at the time said it is very unusual , '' Brown said , `` and should probably never happen again . This is a significant barrier , though it is not an insuperable one . The Trump administration would have to make a very compelling case . Mattis does n't have the standing of George Marshall . They 'd have to make the case he is another George Marshall . ''\nEarlier this year , a bloc of GOP hawks who opposed Trump 's candidacy tried to persuade Mattis to run for president as a third-party candidate , though he expressed no interest .\nCongressional aides say work is already underway to determine the legislative language needed to grant Mattis a waiver .\nArnold Punaro , a former staff member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who helped craft the current statute , said that while Mattis ' waiver would need to be approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the president , he does not see it as a major problem .\n`` He would not in any way undermine or erode civilian control of the military , and it would be hard to find someone who would be less likely to be pushed around by the military and he is now a civilian and would be firmly in charge , '' said Punaro , calling Mattis a `` stellar choice . ''\nOne of Mattis ' fellow retired generals also does n't anticipate it will pose much of a roadblock .\n`` Waivers are waivers , '' said retired Army Lt. Gen. Mick Bednarek , who until last year was the top U.S. military adviser in Iraq . `` In the case of Jim Mattis , that would not be too contentious . The real issue is his views and perspectives . ''\n\u201c While I deeply respect General Mattis \u2019 s service , I will oppose a waiver , \u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York , a senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee , \u201d said in a statement Thursday night . \u201c Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy , and I will not vote for an exception to this rule . \u201d\nOthers demanded that his views on torture and other human rights concerns be key to the Senate confirmation process .\n\u201c We have real concerns about human rights in a Trump Administration , and we will demand that the Senate press General Mattis about his specific views and positions , \u201d Naureen Shah , director of Amnesty International USA \u2019 s security with human rights program , said in a statement .\nMattis is known as one of the most blunt battlefield commanders of his generation . He is mostly revered \u2014 but also reviled by some \u2014 for his rough edges and controversial comments , traits that have gotten him into hot water .\n\u201c You go into Afghanistan , you got guys who slap around women for five years because they didn \u2019 t wear a veil , \u201d he said in in 2005 . \u201c You know guys like that ain \u2019 t got no manhood left anyway , so it \u2019 s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them . \u201d\nAlso in his rhetorical repertoire : \u201c The first time you blow someone away is not an insignificant event . That said , there are some a -- -- -- - in the world that just need to be shot . \u201d\nBut despite his candor , Mattis is also considered a \u201c warrior monk '' for the library of books he carried from post to post , ranging from Roman philosophy to Sun Tzu 's `` The Art of War . ''\n\u201c You are part of the world \u2019 s most feared and trusted force , '' he once told forces under his command . `` Engage your brain before you engage your weapon . \u201d\nMattis , who is unmarried , was also known as the rare commander who could be found visiting his troops in their fighting positions , or volunteering to be the watch officer on Christmas so one of his underlings could be with his family .\n`` His dedication is unparalleled . He is married to the the nation , '' Bednarek told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` He has a 100 percent focus on mission accomplishment . His forte is his leadership and his thoughtfulness . ''\nRetired Adm. William Fallon , who was Mattis ' boss early in the Iraq War , said he believes Mattis may be just the right person to run the Pentagon .\nWhile he has vast experience in war , he has also been outspoken in recent years about the need for clearer goals and policies to guide it .\n`` The most important thing is that Jim 's got a really good understanding that you need to have a good policy framework before digging foxholes , '' Fallon told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` He has been urging leadership to focus on coming up with policies before sending troops into action . ''\n`` That is what is really needed right now , '' Fallon added .",
