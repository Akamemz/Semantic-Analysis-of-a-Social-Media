Voter advocates and organizers see the primaries as a test run , with many assuming that the November general election will also need to adapt to COVID-19 . Since April , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield , a virologist , and epidemiologists have predicted that another , potentially worse , wave of the virus will hit communities this fall and winter .\nUniversal vote-by-mail is being promoted by secretaries of State and voter advocates alike as a clear solution to balancing voter access and public health concerns . In this area , the West leads the way . \u201c The crux of it is : Let \u2019 s make it as simple as possible for people to get a ballot , \u201d said Heather Smith , executive director for ACLU of Wyoming , South Dakota and North Dakota . \u201c Now is the time to be thinking about November and making sure that processes are in place for the least amount of disruption possible to the voting system . \u201d\nWhen it comes to Election Day , Western states might be more prepared to face pandemic-related election challenges than the rest of the US Most of the nation uses traditional in-person voting in a poll booth . But in 2018 , 69 percent of votes in the West were cast by mail , according to the Vote at Home Institute , a nonpartisan , vote-by-mail advocacy nonprofit . That compares to just 27 percent in the rest of the nation . Of the five states that vote entirely by mail pre-COVID-19 , four are in the West : Oregon has done so since 2000 , Washington , Colorado and Utah joining in the last decade . And Western states that don \u2019 t have statewide vote-by-mail still have high numbers of residents who use absentee ballots . The majority of voters in Arizona , Montana and California participate in their state \u2019 s elections from afar ( though California Gov . Gavin Newsom has already declared November \u2019 s election will be entirely vote-by-mail ) . Nevada and New Mexico also depart from tradition , with the majority casting their votes early , before Election Day .\nWhy is the region so different from the rest of the US ? In short , it \u2019 s geography and a history of electoral reform . Western states are much larger and , generally , their populations are more dispersed than the rest of the country . Vote-by-mail has historically been decided on a county-by-county basis , making it a local government decision . Phil Keisling , the former Oregon secretary of State who helped usher vote-by-mail in Oregon in the 1990s , says that it \u2019 s popular not only among voters , but also among local election officials\u2014a sign of its grassroots success . \u201c This has been one of the keys of its evolution in the West : Locally elected county clerks , some elected on a partisan basis , others on a nonpartisan basis , have been at the vanguard of this approach to elections . \u201d\n\u201c Locally elected county clerks , some elected on a partisan basis , others on a nonpartisan basis , have been at the vanguard of this approach to elections . \u201d\nThe history of vote-by-mail has had its heated partisan moments , just as it does today , selectively championed by both Democrats and Republicans . In 1981 in Oregon , Linn County Clerk Del Riley wondered if he could improve the county \u2019 s election process by moving entirely to vote-by-mail , since the county already mailed sample and absentee ballots . Working with Secretary of State Norma Paulus , a Republican and the first woman elected to statewide office , they got the Republican-controlled Oregon state Legislature to agree to a test of vote-by-mail after observing a mailed election in San Diego in 1981 . From there , it expanded ; by 1987 , all counties could conduct local elections by mail . Less than a decade later , Republican proponents decided to take vote-by-mail to back to the Legislature , this time to expand it to statewide elections . In 1995 , legislation to apply it to primary and general elections statewide passed the Republican House and Senate , but Democratic Gov . John Kitzhaber , listening to state and national Democrats , vetoed it .\n\u201c There \u2019 s really no evidence that vote-by-mail favors one party over the other . \u201d\nThe partisan views flipped , however , when Oregon held a special election for a US Senate seat using vote-by-mail in 1996 . A Democrat , Ron Wyden , won the race , and the next time vote-by-mail legislation came up , the roles had reversed ; now Democrats were the champions , and Republicans the detractors . Republican House Majority Rep. Lynn Snodgrass wrote in a 1997 op-ed that voting by mail would \u201c destroy the integrity of the principal of why we vote in the first place , \u201d arguing that coercion and fraud would take place . An aide to Republican House Speaker Bev Clarno ( who is currently secretary of State and supports vote-by-mail ) said it would help Democrats \u201c because there are more of them. \u201d Politics stymied the effort in the Legislature that year , but a volunteer-backed ballot initiative brought the question to voters in 1998 . By then , some Oregon residents had been voting in local elections by mail for 17 years already , and the majority of voters supported it statewide . It passed . \u201c The parties in Oregon argued back and forth about which party would get an edge from it , \u201d said Priscilla Southwell , professor of political science at University of Oregon . \u201c There \u2019 s really no evidence that vote-by-mail favors one party over the other . \u201d\nToday , there is bipartisan support in states that use vote-by-mail , and recent polls show the majority of Americans would support vote-by-mail elections . Because of the last two decades of successful elections in Oregon\u2014where voter turnout is among the nation \u2019 s highest\u2014vote-at-home advocates point to a ready-made model that other states can adapt . Still , advocates say transitioning states will need to work with tribal governments , Latino communities , rural areas and other historically disenfranchised voters to make sure there \u2019 s awareness of the changes , and that early voting and vote centers remain an option for those unable to vote-by-mail , with social distancing measures in place .\nThe key difference among the Western states lies in their use of either vote-by-mail or absentee voting . And the approaches vary widely :\nBefore COVID-19 : Roughly 75 percent of Arizona voters were already absentee voters .\nThe plan : Instead of vote-by-mail , Arizona election officials will send out forms to registered voters to apply for an absentee ballot .\nWill polls be open ? Yes , though it will vary county to county .\nBefore COVID-19 : Voters used absentee , early voting and Election Day voting . Idahoans must show their ID when voting at the polls .\nThe plan : Idaho will have its first statewide absentee voting election , and voters had to request an absentee ballot by May 8 . As of May 1 , more than 185,000 Idahoans had requested their ballots .\nWill polls be open ? No . According to the office of Idaho \u2019 s secretary of State , fewer than 2 percent of the normal number of poll workers in one of the state \u2019 s largest counties were willing to facilitate the primaries during the pandemic .\nBefore COVID-19 : In the 2018 primary election , less than 10 % of voters signed up for absentee ballots , because most either voted early or used day-of polling sites .\nThe plan : This spring , in response to COVID-19 , the state Legislature passed a new law for universal vote-by-mail , which will send ballots to all \u201c active \u201d registered voters .\nWill polls be open ? Not traditional polling sites , but every county will have at least one vote center .\nBefore COVID-19 : 90 percent of voters in Utah already use vote-by-mail .\nWill polls be open ? No in-person voting will be available , but some counties are opting for a drive-up voting option . According to Utah \u2019 s secretary of State office , with the removal of in-person voting , voters will not be able to register at the polls on Election Day , though that has been allowed in the past .\nVoting-access proponents say a universal vote-by-mail system is necessary , but note that accommodations such as increased educational campaigns are critical to make sure voters are not disenfranchised by the changes . \u201c This is particularly true for ethnic minority groups , \u201d said Sonja Diaz , founding director of UCLA \u2019 s Latino Policy & Politics Initiative . \u201c Young Latinos and Asian Americans in this country are the two fastest-growing demographic groups . And they are very young in age , especially in comparison to older white voters , and that means that you \u2019 re seeing a lot of first-time voters because they \u2019 re aging into the electorate . \u201d\nMost secretary of State offices are still closed because of COVID-19 , meaning that voter registration has moved online . That \u2019 s a problem for many rural areas without access to broadband , including over 90 percent of Indigenous communities on reservations . Other barriers to Indigenous voters involve inadequate mailing services and lack of language assistance . According to Jacqueline De Le\u00f3n ( Isleta Pueblo ) , an attorney for the Native American Rights Fund , it \u2019 s critical that state and county election officers work with tribal governments to identify and address those obstacles ahead of the primaries and the November election . \u201c Vote-by-mail has the potential to devastate the Native vote , \u201d De Le\u00f3n said , \u201c because if you don \u2019 t have residential mail delivery , you \u2019 re not getting the ballot at your house . \u201d\nThis week , US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) , and House Democrats unveiled the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act , the latest coronavirus relief package . The HEROES Act would provide $ 3.6 billion to assist states in election changes like vote-by-mail , expanded early in-person voting and same-day or online voter registration . Pelosi has cited the importance of not forcing voters to choose between exercising their right to vote and contracting COVID-19 . \u201c What country do we want to live in ? \u201d said Keisling , Oregon \u2019 s former secretary of State . \u201c I \u2019 d rather live in a country where a lot more people are voting even when my candidates lose , than winning because we \u2019 ve lowered the turnout . \u201d",
