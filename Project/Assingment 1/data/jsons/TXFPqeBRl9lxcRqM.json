    "content": "FAIRFAX , Va. \u2014 The Republican establishment has a message for John Kasich : get out , and get out of Marco Rubio 's way .\nA string of elected officials , GOP insiders and prominent donors officially threw their support behind Rubio on Monday , calling him their last chance to take down Donald Trump . Their statements had another common theme . Some explicitly called for Kasich to quit , while others sent the same message by saying the Ohio governor 's ongoing presence is holding Rubio back .\n\u201c If at some point John were to decide not to go forward with his campaign , Marco would be the primary beneficiary of that decision , \u201d former Minnesota Gov . Tim Pawlenty told \u2588\u2588\u2588 after his official Rubio endorsement . \u201c It \u2019 s not for me or anyone else to say when John should stay in or get out but \u2026 John \u2019 s decision to stay in or get out could have a marked impact on the race . \u201d\nThis is not what Kasich had in mind : He had hoped that if he could be the last governor standing , his record and experience would persuade party power brokers to unite behind him in a challenge to Trump and Ted Cruz . Pushing that point , Kasich 's campaign issued a statement after Jeb Bush dropped out declaring Kasich winner of the `` governor 's bracket . ''\nKasich 's theory proved true : Bush 's demise did precipitate a unifying push within the establishment \u2014 toward Rubio .\nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch on Monday threw his support behind Rubio , and he said it would be helpful to Rubio for Kasich to drop his bid . `` It would be , but that 's up to John and John 's got every right to stay in the race , '' Hatch said . `` But sooner or later , it 's got to come down to Marco if people really look at it carefully .
