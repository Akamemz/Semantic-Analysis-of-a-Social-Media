    "content": "Donald Trump is the front-runner in the 2016 Republican presidential primary race . He leads his closest rival , Ted Cruz , by a substantial margin . Trump \u2019 s proto-fascism , xenophobia and bigotry are not anomalies or outliers . These values are held by a large percentage of Republicans .\nDonald Trump validates these feelings . As such , it is now fundamentally clear that Donald Trump is a hero and leader for many conservatives in the Age of Obama .\nMost members of the pundit class have been befuddled by the ascendance of Donald Trump . But , there is one person who has solved this riddle .\nIn a little-discussed editorial written several weeks ago , Pat Buchanan offered the following analysis :\nEnter The Donald . His popularity is traceable to the fact that he rejects the moral authority of the media , breaks their commandments , and mocks their condemnations . His contempt for the norms of Political Correctness is daily on display . And that large slice of America that detests a media whose public approval now rivals that of Congress , relishes this defiance . The last thing these folks want Trump to do is to apologize to the press . And the media have played right into Trump \u2019 s hand . They constantly denounce him as grossly insensitive for what he has said about women , Mexicans , Muslims , McCain and a reporter with a disability . Such crimes against decency , says the press , disqualify Trump as a candidate for president . Yet , when they demand he apologize , Trump doubles down . And when they demand that Republicans repudiate him , the GOP base replies : \u201c Who are you to tell us whom we may nominate ? You are not friends . You are not going to vote for us . And the names you call Trump \u2014 bigot , racist , xenophobe , sexist \u2014 are the names you call us , nothing but cuss words that a corrupt establishment uses on those it most detests . \u201d\nPat Buchanan possesses gifted insight into powerful appeal of Donald Trump for the Republican base . Both men are nativist , xenophobic , right-wing populists who understand the allure of white alienation and racial resentment in the post civil rights era . Pat Buchanan is more of a \u201c culture warrior \u201d than Donald Trump . But like George Wallace in the 1960s , the Know-Nothings in the 19th century and the Black Legion in the 1930s , Buchanan and Trump are recent iterations in a long history of right-wing demagoguery and false populism in American politics .\nNevertheless , the essence of Buchanan \u2019 s claim remains correct : the \u201c political establishment \u201d and \u201c media \u201d are viewed as discredited by Republicans .\nOne does not need to read rigorous research by social scientists or mountains of polling data to prove this thesis . All one has to do is listen to Donald Trump \u2019 s supporters ( who are really none too different from the Republican base writ large ) and how they make sense of the political and social world .\nFor example , in recent focus groups conducted by CBS and CNN , Trump \u2019 s backers told interviewers such things as `` I do n't believe any one of ( the politicians ) . Not one . I believe Donald '' ; `` My president comes on TV and he lies to me \u2026 I believe Donald . I tell you , he says what I \u2019 m thinking ! `` ; and \u201c I think we \u2019 re all scared . I \u2019 m actually a little jumpy , I find Trump is the only one who would come out and say something like this , no one else would do it \u2026 You know what he says , he says something completely crazy and in inflammatory then he dials back ( and ) starts explaining it . \u201d\nThese people are divorced from reality . To listen to Donald Trump \u2019 s supporters is to peek into the mouth of political madness .\nOne of the main challenges that responsible members of the pundit classes are having in making sense of the Republican Party in the Age of Obama\u2014and movement conservatism in the post civil rights era , more generally\u2014is that they still possess some faith in the merits of political discourse as based on mutually agreed upon facts , proceeding in good faith , the Common Good , and a belief in some version of normal politics in the service of responsible governance .\nMoreover , the commentariat has still not effectively grappled with how today \u2019 s brand of conservatism exhibits pre-Enlightenment era thinking , and uses what I ( and others ) have described as \u201c the politics of disorientation \u201d to confuse the American people through a coordinated campaign of outright lying and seductive disinformation .\nIn short , they are using analytical tools and frameworks that are incapable of understanding the true nature of what Donald Trump and contemporary movement conservatism actually embodies .\nIt is clear that Trump is the leader of a cult of personality .\nDonald Trump is a proto-fascist . He buddies up with Russian President Vladimir Putin for credibility in his role as a new il-Duce , a petit Mussolini for 21st century American politics . Donald Trump is a classic \u201c strong man \u201d political figure . To that end , he encourages violence by his followers against political opponents and those identified as the Other or somehow weak . Nor does Donald Trump deny that he is a \u201c racist \u201d or \u201c neo-fascist . \u201d\nTrump also brags about his \u201c perfect health , \u201d \u201c high energy \u201d and vitality . Here , the fit body and Trump \u2019 s egomaniacal narcissism are essential for his crafting the charismatic leader persona .\nBut is Donald Trump actually something far worse ? Is he a type of political cult leader ?\nTo understand Donald Trump \u2019 s appeal , one must seriously consider the possibility that his followers specifically , and movement conservatives and the Republican Party more generally , are exhibiting signs of political psychopathology .\nA cult can take many forms . They can be oriented around religion , politics or other needs and goals . On this point , noted American psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton outlined some of the basic aspects of a cult as being :\nA charismatic leader , who increasingly becomes an object of worship as the general principles that may have originally sustained the group lose power . That is a living leader , who has no meaningful accountability and becomes the single most defining element of the group and its source of power and authority . A process [ of indoctrination or education is in use that can be seen as ] coercive persuasion or thought reform [ commonly called `` brainwashing '' ] .\nDonald Trump is using his campaign to garner more money and power . He is also promising his supporters that he will \u201c make American great again , \u201d and by doing so give them opportunities for economic uplift and other resources .\nI offer an important distinction and qualifier\u2014one that is perhaps even more troubling than the notion of a person being conditioned into a \u201c new \u201d identity that replaces the \u201c old \u201d one . Donald Trump \u2019 s -- and the Republican Party \u2019 s -- base of low information voters are not being grabbed off of the street by his agents . Trump is providing a safe space and outlet for conservatives to validate their preexisting racist , xenophobic and bigoted attitudes . Their true selves are being actualized and \u201c liberated . \u201d\nThe Republican 2016 presidential primary candidates are using a campaign of fear and anxiety about terrorism , \u201c illegal immigrants , \u201d changing racial demographics , \u201c black crime \u201d and \u201c Islam \u201d to gin up support among a frightened public . This is the Southern Strategy mixed with old-fashioned fear-mongering to win over the votes of scared , mostly older , white voters in a moment when a black man happens to be president of the United States . This tactic also leverages how the brain structures and political personal types of conservatives/authoritarians are much more responsive to anxiety , fear and feelings of disgust than those of liberals and progressives .\nDonald Trump is a master of manipulating the fears and anxieties of his public . This is a feature of the cult leader : he or she creates a sense of crisis and then offers a solution to it . Such a process was detailed in a New York Times story written at the height of the moral panic about cults in the United States during the 1980s :\nDr. Cath defined a cult as a group of people joined together by a common ideological system fostered by a charismatic leader , where , he said , `` the expectation is that they can transcend the imperfections and finitude of life . '' He said : `` Often they set up a we-they philosophy : We have the truth and you do not\u2026 '' At some point during the experience , he said , `` the mark is placed in a panicky , disoriented state , and an emotional crisis is manufactured by the recruiters . '' One response to this , Dr. Clark said , is that people can become psychotic ...\nContemporary conservatives exist within an echo chamber that has been created by Republican elites , Fox News , right-wing talk radio and other media . It has expanded to include online spaces . The worldview that is created there is one where basic facts about empirical reality are rejected , and the right-wing paranoid style of conspiracy theories and unfounded rumors have replaced substantive political discourse . Extreme political polarization and a broken American politics are the result of the epistemic closure that typifies the right wing in the United States .\nCults also isolate their members and give them new ways to understand the world around them on terms agreeable to the cult leader :\nThird , cutting off the outside information sources . Once entering cults , consciously or unconsciously , people will gradually block sources of outside information to form a separate space , which might make them lost the ability to think independently . Although the United States is abundant in information , the cult members are isolated from the outside world completely\u2026 One important way for converting is to contact and exchange information with the outside world , so people can think independently .\nBursting the information cocoon of those people in a traditional religious cult or who are immersed in the right-wing media echo chamber is not an easy task . They will resist . In political psychology , this phenomenon is called the \u201c backfire effect. \u201d It offers a chilling insight into the impact of extreme political ideology , polarization and the right-wing media on its followers .\nIf Trump \u2019 s supporters\u2014and movement conservatives en masse\u2014are in fact exhibiting signs of political psychopathology , then the backfire effect is a powerful lens for understanding their behavior .\nRecently , a few political scientists have begun to discover a human tendency deeply discouraging to anyone with faith in the power of information . It \u2019 s this : Facts don \u2019 t necessarily have the power to change our minds . In fact , quite the opposite . In a series of studies in 2005 and 2006 , researchers at the University of Michigan found that when misinformed people , particularly political partisans , were exposed to corrected facts in news stories , they rarely changed their minds . In fact , they often became even more strongly set in their beliefs . Facts , they found , were not curing misinformation . Like an underpowered antibiotic , facts could actually make misinformation even stronger\u2026 \u201c The general idea is that it \u2019 s absolutely threatening to admit you \u2019 re wrong , \u201d says political scientist Brendan Nyhan , the lead researcher on the Michigan study . The phenomenon \u2014 known as \u201c backfire \u201d \u2014 is \u201c a natural defense mechanism to avoid that cognitive dissonance . \u201d\nIf Donald Trump is the leader of a political cult , then his power exists relative to how the modern Republican Party and movement conservatism possess the traits of \u201c a fundamentalist-style political religion. \u201d In this worldview , compromise , negotiation and working together across party lines to serve the Common Good and create a vibrant democracy are unacceptable because to do so is to engage in an act of heresy .\nPreeminent historian Richard Hofstadter described how conservatives in the 1950s and 1960s were even then manifesting a belief in politics as a type of religious orthodoxy . His observations resonate even more strongly in the age of the Tea Party , an extreme and reactionary Republican Party and Donald Trump . Five decades ago Hofstadter wrote :\nHe does not see social conflict as something to be mediated and compromised , in the manner of the working politician . Since what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil , the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish . Nothing but complete victory will do . Since the enemy is thought of as being totally evil and totally unappeasable , he must be totally eliminated - if not from the world , at least from the theater of operations to which the paranoid directs his attention .\nPolitics as religious orthodoxy is a necessary precondition for the rise of Donald Trump as a type of political cult leader .\nIf contemporary conservatism is a type of religion where faith\u2014what is a belief in that which can not be proven by empirical means\u2014rules all things , then Trump is the head of an extremist cult , a group considered too \u201c radical \u201d even by the fundamentalist standards of the Republican Party .\nDonald Trump is not Jim Jones . He is also not Immortan Joe from the recent film `` Mad Max : Fury Road . '' Trump is something more mundane .
