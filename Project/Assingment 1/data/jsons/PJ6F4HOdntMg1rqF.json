    "content": "President Donald Trump has picked one of the military \u2019 s leading warrior-scholars to restore order to the National Security Council \u2014 but also one who has staked out a decidedly more hawkish position on Russia and gone out of his way to assert that the war against terrorism must not morph into a war against Islam .\nLt. Gen. H.R . McMaster , Trump 's newly named replacement for ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn , is considered one of the Army \u2019 s top intellectuals . When he was a young major he published a best-selling book about failed military leadership during the Vietnam War and later went on to help pioneer counterinsurgency operations in Iraq .\nThe first active-duty officer to hold the post since Colin Powell under President Ronald Reagan , he has also attained legendary status in military circles for his willingness to buck conventional wisdom .\nIt is a pedigree that might soon come in handy in his new post as the top national security policy official in the Trump White House .\nMcMaster is currently the director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center , where his job has been to figure out what the Army should look like in 2025 and beyond . He has placed particular emphasis on preparing to counter the kind of tactics and weapons that Russia , which he considers a rising threat to global stability , has used in its incursion in Ukraine .\nThis emphasis could put him at odds with Trump , who says he wants to improve relations with Russia and has expressed little concern about its aggressive behaviors in Eastern Europe and contends that Vladimir Putin can be bargained with .\nBut McMaster 's views will likely help build bridges with hawks in Congress who have been some of Trump \u2019 s fiercest Republican critics .\n\u201c I give President Trump great credit for this decision , as well as his national security cabinet choices , \u201d Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) said in a statement after the announcement . \u201c I have had the honor of knowing [ McMaster ] for many years , and he is a man of genuine intellect , character , and ability . He knows how to succeed . \u201d\nMcCain added that he \u201c could not imagine a better , more capable national security team than the one we have right now . \u201d\nTrump announced the selection Monday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida , flanked by McMaster and Keith Kellogg , a retired Army lieutenant general who was Flynn \u2019 s chief of staff and is set to stay on under McMaster .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience , \u201d Trump said of his new national security adviser . \u201c I watched and read a lot over the last two days . He is highly respected by everyone in the military , and we \u2019 re very honored to have him . \u201d\nMcMaster faces a daunting challenge trying to right the ship following the rocky tenure of Flynn , who departed after it became clear he misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his pre-inauguration contacts with Russia \u2019 s ambassador .\nTrump \u2019 s first pick to replace Flynn , retired Vice Adm. Bob Harward , turned down the job \u2014 in part , according to an individual familiar with his thinking , because he wasn \u2019 t given assurances he would be able to select his own staff and have autonomy from Trump 's close-knit political advisers \u2014 led by Steve Bannon , who Trump elevated to a permanent position on the National Security Council , and Trump 's son-in-law , Jared Kushner .\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that Trump had given McMaster \u201c full authority \u201d to hire \u201c whatever staff he sees fit . ''\nBut Philip Carter , a defense analyst at the Center for a New American Security , said McMaster will be tested to try to \u201c impose order and discipline on a White House national security structure and process that has seen neither since Election Day . \u201d\n\u201c This challenge will be particularly hard given the political winds within the White House , and the fact that McMaster comes to the White House as an outsider and relative political neophyte , \u201d Carter said .\nRetired Lt. Gen. Dave Barno , who has known McMaster for years , said the new national security adviser is a hard-charging and forceful personality who grasps the political challenges he will face in addition to the national security ones .\n\u201c He \u2019 s going to have to build a relationship with the boss , get in to see the boss , \u201d said Barno . \u201c There \u2019 s no question something he will do daily is tell the boss hard things that he doesn \u2019 t necessarily want to hear . And I think the president hired him with that expectation . \u201d\nMcMaster is already winning praise from GOP defense hawks on Capitol Hill .\n`` H.R McMaster is one of the finest combat leaders of our generation and also a great strategic mind , \u201d Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said in a statement . \u201c He is a true warrior scholar , and I 'm confident he will serve both the president and the country well .
