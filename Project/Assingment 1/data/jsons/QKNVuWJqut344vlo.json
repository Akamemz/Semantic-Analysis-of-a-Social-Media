They will only confirm Catholic nominees who reject authoritative Church teaching in favor of liberalism .\nIn the presumed pro-life conscientiousness of Amy Coney Barrett , the Democrats smell big trouble .

The bigotry of Dianne Feinstein \u2019 s remark was compounded by its cluelessness . She was chastising Barrett not for holding a traditional Catholic view but for deferring to a modern liberal one held by many churchmen . This is probably one of the reasons why liberal Catholic Tim Kaine ended up voting to confirm her to the federal appeals court .\nThe Democrats cast her as a carbon copy of Antonin Scalia , for whom she clerked .
