Not for giving up the innermost secrets of the CIA or the NSA.\n\nFor furnishing information about the oh-so-sensitive world of transportation.\n\nIt's been clear for some time that the Obama administration has a terrible record when it comes to transparency. (Never mind that candidate Barack Obama vowed his would be the most transparent administration ever.)\n\nBut a couple of panel discussions Wednesday at the joint convention of the American Society of News Editors and Associated Press Media Editors suggest things are worse than we knew and doing nothing but getting more awful.\n\nEqually alarming, Team Obama seems to have written a road map that others are eagerly following. The information spigot is increasingly being turned off by state and local governments, universities and sports teams, according to journalists who spoke Wednesday as well as ASNE legal counsel Kevin Goldberg, who says the problem goes all the way down to high schools. \"There is a concerted effort,\" he says.\n\nThis isn't simply inside baseball for frustrated journalists.

Bush was bad. Obama's worse.\"\n\nREM RIEDER: An important crusade for open government\n\nThe problems go far beyond gagged transportation sources. Buzbee has a long list of infractions, including: few opportunities to take photographs or video of Obama appearances (the administration likes to distribute its own); no photos or video of bombers taking off for sorties against the Islamic State and no embedded journalists on hand; a massive blackout on information about Guantanamo; unprecedented ferocity in prosecuting national security leaks designed to intimidate journalists and chill sources.\n\nAnd the get-tough approach is having an impact. \"It's harder to get sources to believe that we can protect them,\" says AP senior managing editor Mike Oreskes.\n\nBut the information crisis has spread far beyond the Beltway, says AP Managing Editor for U.S. News Brian Carovillano, infecting state and local governments and institutions of higher learning. \"It's the most difficult climate we've seen,\" he says.\n\nCarovillano points to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who also ran as a big transparency guy, then tried unsuccessfully to have his swearing-in closed to the press.
