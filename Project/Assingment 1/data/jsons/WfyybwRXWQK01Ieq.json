Thirteen other states are pausing their openings , while new cases nationwide could rise to 100,000 a day , Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress last week . The U.S. leads the world in cases as well as deaths from COVID-19 \u2013 with the nation \u2019 s death toll now at more than 130,000 , according to Johns Hopkins University .\nWith 40 million people , California is the most populous state and a microcosm of the nation . It has every kind of industry , ranging from tech to agriculture . It has extreme wealth and poverty . Its geography spans rural and urban , coastal and inland , and the state is home to an ethnically and racially diverse population . As such , many of the nation \u2019 s challenges with the virus are mirrored here .\nCalifornia has seen , for instance , numerous outbreaks in confined facilities such as nursing homes and jails . In Marin County , roughly a third of the inmates at San Quentin State Prison have tested positive since a May transfer of hundreds of inmates from another prison that had been battling the virus . Six people have died . The top medical officer for the state correction facilities was replaced on Monday .\nLast week , the state \u2019 s health secretary , Dr. Mark Ghaly , characterized some of the causes of the surge throughout the state . Family gatherings in Sacramento County , where guidelines were not followed , likely led to outbreaks in families , which led to a rise in cases and a more than 40 % rise in hospitalizations in three days , he said .\nRural Imperial County , which borders Mexico and Arizona , has the highest rate of positive tests in the state and has had to send hundreds of patients elsewhere because its health care facilities are overwhelmed . Some cases have been linked to cross-border traffic in a county where most of the population is Latino and many are migrant farmers . In California , as in the nation , the virus is disproportionately affecting people of color .\nIn Los Angeles County , the epicenter of the virus in California , public health officials found last month that of 3,700 restaurants and bars surveyed , more than 80 % were not complying with reopening guidelines \u2013 a big problem being lack of face coverings .\nAs a result , the governor on June 18 made face masks mandatory in most public settings , followed days later by the closing of bars on the state \u2019 s county \u201c watchlist , \u201d and then last week \u2019 s restrictions on indoor settings for watchlist counties . The governor said California became too fixated on when to reopen and not enough on how .\nCalifornia officials put together a \u201c really thoughtful road map \u201d on how to reopen , \u201c but we may have gone a little bit fast through these steps , \u201d agrees Jeanne Ringel , senior economist and director of the Rand Corp. \u2019 s health care access and delivery program . Livelihoods and mental health were at stake , putting tremendous pressure on officials to reopen . Because California had flattened the curve , cooped-up residents may have perceived the risk of socializing as low , she says .\nLike Dr. Wachter , she says the state has also gotten a lot of the response right : ramping up testing , using time gained during the lockdown to build contact tracing and hospital capacity and buy personal protective equipment , and putting in place a transparent monitoring system and triggers to pull back counties if they fail to meet benchmarks .\nWhile California \u2019 s leaders have been consistent about messaging \u2013 wear face coverings , wash hands , practice social distancing \u2013 it can be hard to communicate that message effectively to different cultures within the state , says Dr. Ringel . Residents in more liberal Los Angeles County might be more inclined to wear face masks , while less inclined next door in the more conservative Orange County .\nInterestingly , several Orange County oceanside communities voluntarily joined Los Angeles County in the temporary July Fourth beach closures \u2013 in contrast to strong resistance displayed at earlier forced closures . The COVID-19 surge in their county seemed to spur them on as did , in the case of Newport Beach , two lifeguards who tested positive and the subsequent quarantining of 23 lifeguards . At the same time , many national Republican leaders are now urging everyone to wear face coverings .\nPeople need to get back into \u201c a frame of mind that recognizes the magnitude of this moment , \u201d Governor Newsom said last week . If they don \u2019 t , he added , the state has $ 2.5 billion in funds it can withhold from county recalcitrants and a regulatory arm it can flex with businesses .\nThat \u2019 s all right with resident Melissa Longmire , who came to Santa Monica \u2019 s beach with two family members to celebrate a birthday on July 1 . \u201c I \u2019 m in total agreement with the governor , \u201d she says , emphasizing the need to social distance and wear masks .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
