The only upside of his move , which Trump did n't even have the cojones to announce himself , is that it might finally prod Congress to get off its derri\u00e8re and create a path for permanent legal status for Dreamers instead of leaving their fates to presidential whims . But it 's by no means certain that Congress can do this cleanly , if at all .\nCongress has given the president immense statutory discretion in enforcing immigration law . And just as Obama had the legal authority to create the DACA program , Trump has the authority to scrap it , regardless of Attorney General Jeff Sessions claims that the Obama action was illegal .\nObama gave qualified Dreamers with clean records a two-year reprieve ( `` parole '' ) from deportation and temporary work authorization\u2014not permanent green cards , mind you . After that , if they had remained in school or gainfully employed and if they generally kept out of trouble , they could apply for renewal . About 800,000 people obtained DACA status out of an estimated Dreamer population of a million-plus .\nUp until now , the Trump administration had not only continued to renew the status of existing DACAs but also extended it to new Dreamers , all of which was `` illegal '' if AG Sessions is to be believed . This had raised hopes that Trump would preserve at least this program even as his Department of Homeland Security cracked down on the rest of the undocumented population . ( Indeed , among former DHS Secretary John Kelly 's first acts upon assuming office was to end the late Obama-era policy of limiting deportation action to criminal aliens and making all undocumented aliens , even those with no criminal records , fair game for removal . ) Trump did , after all , say he has a `` big heart '' and would `` take care '' of Dreamers .\nThe vast majority of Dreamers have lived in America practically their entire lives , with little to no contact with their birthland .

So exiling them from a country where they have family , friends , and community ties to one where they have no roots at all is beyond cruel . To add insult to injury , the Dreamers who obtained deferred action status under DACA are especially vulnerable to deportation , because the government now has all their contact information .\nNot only is there no harm in letting them stay , but there is a major upside to keeping them around .\nDreamers are 12.5 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives with the same socioeconomic characteristics . The average DACA beneficiary is 22 years old , is employed , and earns about $ 17 an hour . Projecting from that , Ike Brannon calculates that they contribute $ 215 billion to the economy annually . Meanwhile , their fiscal costs are comparable to the fiscal costs of H-1B workers , which are minimal . Under current law , DACA beneficiaries are ineligible for means-tested welfare benefits that are provided by the federal government or funded through federal matching grants to the states . And few states extend welfare benefits to DACA Dreamers on their own . As a result , DACA beneficiaries contribute $ 60 billion more to taxes than they consume in benefits . All of that works out to about $ 275 billion in economic and fiscal contributions . And given that it costs Uncle Sam $ 10,000 to deport a Dreamer , the total deportation cost of all of them would be about $ 10 billion , adding up to over a quarter trillion total hit to America .\nSo even if you buy the idea that Dreamers are `` lawbreakers , '' if there is any group worthy of a presidential `` pardon , '' it 's them .
