    "content": "TRUMP MASKS UP \u2014 One of the relatively clear findings of political science is that when members of a party are confronted with a new policy question , they will look to trusted ideological leaders for cues about what the \u201c right \u201d position is .\nWhen the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic was understood in March , it was mostly people on the left who decried the use of masks . Liberals argued that the science behind preventing the spread of the disease through mask-wearing was thin or , alternatively , that they should be reserved for health care workers so buying them was an act of selfishness . Mask wearers were shamed on social media by people on the left . But after the CDC promoted the use of masks , liberals , led by prominent Democratic politicians , quickly got on board .\nOn the right , a libertarian strain won the day and mask wearing became seen as an infringement on liberty . But one could just have easily predicted that conservatives were going to see a virus that emanated from China as a foreign threat and a national security issue that needed to be defeated with all of the U.S. government \u2019 s resources . This was how many people on the right saw the threat of the Ebola virus during the Obama administration .\nWhat actually determined the consensus conservative position on masks for the first four months of the pandemic had nothing to do with ideology , and it had nothing to do with science , either . It had to do with personality \u2014 specifically the personality of President Donald Trump . He was anti-mask and , as the political science literature predicts , the conservative movement rallied around his position .\nAfter months of anti-mask messaging , Trump finally reversed himself today .\n\u201c I \u2019 m all for masks , \u201d he said , adding that he would wear one if he were in a crowded room and noting that he had a black one on recently . \u201c I sort of liked the way I looked . \u201d\nMany prominent Republicans and conservatives \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence , former Vice President Dick Cheney , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , \u201c Fox and Friends \u201d host Steve Doocy , Trump whisperer Sean Hannity \u2014 have sent a similar message in recent days as coronavirus cases have spiked , especially in red states through the Sun Belt .\nFor the many conservative voters who look to their leaders for guidance , today just might be the start of a sustained public health campaign that could save lives .\nWelcome to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Nightly : Coronavirus Special Edition .

Much of it was never put in place . Or it was largely ignored . And the alarming surge in coronavirus cases now spreading across the country is less a surprise than a tragically predictable national \u201c I told you so \u201d moment , executive health care editor Joanne Kenen writes . \u201c Every state was allowed to go off and do their own activities , \u201d said Howard Koh , a senior public health official in the Obama administration who is now at Harvard . \u201c And a lot of states opened up when the trends were going the wrong way . \u201d\nTo open safely , states needed vastly expanded testing . They needed contact tracing to identify and isolate people who had been exposed . They needed clear , consistent public health messaging and a coordinated national response , so that Americans could understand that even as economic activity resumes , life does not return to normal . And states needed to pay attention to the epidemiological data \u2014 diagnoses , positivity rates , hospital admissions , ICU capacity \u2014 that would tell them if their caseload was going down and staying down before taking the next step in gradually reopening .\nBut the hierarchy of risk was put aside . Some states that initially avoided the worst effects of Covid-19 stampeded right through the gates . The current resurgence of Covid-19 cases \u2014 and most experts see this as a wave within a first wave , not the second wave that many fear will arrive in the fall \u2014 wasn \u2019 t inevitable . On an almost daily basis , health experts issued public warnings about the risk . By the time governors listened , cases were exploding .\nSKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT \u2014 Canadians are celebrating Canada Day today with a virtual fireworks show instead of the usual display at Ottawa \u2019 s Parliament Hill . In the U.S. , however , there \u2019 s little consensus about how to celebrate our upcoming Independence Day . State officials have partly blamed Memorial Day celebrations for recent case count spikes and hospitalizations . They worry that July 4 gatherings will exacerbate the current crisis .\nArkansas has triple the number of cases today compared with Memorial Day , making the same activities like gathering for barbecues far more dangerous , said Nate Smith , Arkansas Secretary of Health and president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials on a media call today .\nDespite the risks of big gatherings , the Trump administration decided that this year \u2019 s July 4 celebration at the National Mall will be bigger than ever , with more than 10,000 fireworks launched from two different sites over the course of 35 minutes , according to details released today by the Interior Department . The release said that 300,000 cloth masks would be distributed to visitors . Republican South Dakota Gov . Kristi Noem said Tuesday that there would be no social distancing required at a July 3 fireworks show at Mount Rushmore with Trump . And today , Anthony Fauci discouraged Americans from attending the event .\nAs with so much of the pandemic response , individual cities \u2014 and in some cases states \u2014 are making their own judgments about whether to keep or can this year \u2019 s fireworks displays . Our reporters scattered around the country sent us these dispatches :\nNew York officials spread out the annual Macy \u2019 s July 4 fireworks show over six days this week with launches from unannounced locations and a broadcast of the smaller shows planned for Saturday .\nChicago has scrapped its main Navy Pier fireworks show , but there are still smaller celebrations in the \u2018 burbs .\nThe annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular was canceled in May , but the orchestra will hold a virtual broadcast on July 4 .\nIn California , Democratic Gov . Gavin Newsom urged 19 counties to cancel fireworks shows . Many cities , including San Francisco , already have called off the festivities , but one city in Sacramento County , Folsom , is holding a \u201c drive-in \u201d fireworks show on July 3 with cars parked further apart and no food sales , according to our California editor , Kevin Yamamura . A couple other cities in Orange County are planning similar events , according to the OC Register . One city is launching fireworks without having a viewing location , telling residents to watch from their homes .\nIn New Jersey , education reporter Carly Sitrin tells us that aerial consumer fireworks remain prohibited , but Democratic Gov . Phil Murphy signed an executive order on June 14 permitting organized fireworks displays at public and private beaches , boardwalks , lakes , and lakeshores subject to the restrictions on outdoor gatherings . Still , many municipalities have gone ahead and postponed or canceled their events including Ocean City , which normally has a Night in Venice party .\nThe biggest fireworks show in South Florida in Miami \u2019 s Bayfront Park is off , and the nearby town of Hialeah , Fla. , is holding a fireworks display but asking people to stream the festivities from home .\nIn Arizona , many towns are canceling their celebrations , but a few have converted to a drive in show .\nHouston is holding a concert and fireworks display without a live audience .\nAnd Washington D.C \u2019 s neighboring towns , including Alexandria , Va. , and Takoma Park , Md. , are also canceling their celebrations . A short drive up I-95 , Baltimore is too .\nAnd not even cities and states can shut down the impromptu displays of patriotism cropping up around the country . Our Chicago area based Natasha Korecki sends us this handy guide from the Chicago Sun-Times for differentiating between fireworks and gunshots .\n40 PERCENT \u2014 The spread of the coronavirus has increased racial tensions across the country , and Asian Americans and African Americans are facing the worst of it , according to findings from a new survey released today . In the study , conducted by the Pew Research Center , 40 percent of Black and Asian American adults said they have been treated differently or subjected to slurs or jokes as a result of the pandemic , campaign 2020 reporting fellow Maya King writes . A plurality of both groups also expressed anxiety about wearing a mask in public out of fears that they would be viewed as a threat or physically attacked .\nTrump has repeatedly blamed China for the global spread of the virus , referring to it as the \u201c Chinese virus \u201d or \u201c kung flu \u201d during recent rallies and news conferences . \u201c It \u2019 s hard to attribute causality , but what we can say is that many Asian Americans feel they have been subject to slurs or jokes because of their race or ethnicity since the outbreak , \u201d said Neil Ruiz , associate director of global migration and demography at Pew , who co-authored the report .\nNightly asks you : How has the pandemic changed your July 4 holiday ? Send us your answer using our form , and we \u2019 ll include some of them in our Thursday edition .\nJUNE JOBS PREVIEW \u2014 Economists are expecting to learn that the country added about 3 million jobs in June , when the Labor Department releases its monthly jobs report on Thursday . But that was before virus cases started surging across the South and West , and many states started shutting down recently opened businesses . Your host Slack chatted with reporter Megan Cassella about what economists expect in the report and whether fears of a second wave are warranted . This conversation has been edited .\nSince Friday is a holiday , we 're getting the double-whammy of jobs reports tomorrow \u2014 one showing the number of Americans filing unemployment claims last week , and another estimating the overall unemployment rate for June .\nWe do n't know what they 'll show , but we can try to guess ( though that can be a dangerous game these days ) . The weekly claims are expected to remain elevated as they have been for months , likely showing another 1.5 million or so Americans \u2014 or perhaps more \u2014 filing an application for jobless benefits . The monthly numbers could be slightly more hopeful . But they also warn that these monthly numbers come from a survey conducted in mid-June \u2014 and that the economy has taken a turn for the worse since then , as the coronavirus surged .\nFor sure . There 's some anecdotal evidence out there of some folks getting laid off for a second time \u2014 anyone who works at a bar in California , for example . There \u2019 s some real-time private data showing that business activity plateaued and is now even dropping again in states where the virus is spreading rapidly .\nOn a broader level , economists and some lawmakers say we \u2019 ve always known that the coronavirus dictates the economic recovery , and jobs won \u2019 t come back until the virus is contained . We 're seeing those effects play out again now .\nWhat about people who have officially kept their jobs \u2014 how do things look for them ?\nAnecdotally , we do hear stories about employers cutting pay , usually as a way to try to avoid layoffs . Some high-profile executives have announced they \u2019 re cutting their own pay . The idea of course is that with money so tight , if everyone makes a little less , more people can keep their jobs . Some companies have also taken advantage of the heightened unemployment aid by furloughing workers now , knowing they can get the extra money .\nThe survey was conducted in mid-June . They \u2019 re likely to paint a picture way rosier than what \u2019 s happening on the ground now .\n\u2018 REACHING OR NEAR CAPACITY \u2019 \u2014 The United States ' coronavirus testing capacity is at risk of being overwhelmed in some states by a surge in new infections and increased surveillance efforts in nursing homes and jails , Brett Giroir , the coronavirus testing czar said today . \u201c It is absolutely correct that some labs across the country are reaching or near capacity , \u201d Giroir said . Giroir emphasized that young adults , who account for the majority of new cases , must be vigilant about practicing social distancing and wearing a mask , health care reporter David Lim writes . The Department of Health and Human Services is developing plans to implement surge testing in moderate-sized communities of high concern in Texas , Florida and Louisiana , to try to bring the outbreaks in those areas under control .\nBehind the anti-maskers \u2014 Last year , it was vaccines . Now , it \u2019 s masks . California reporter Mackenzie Mays looks at how the same activists are once again turning a public health issue into a culture war \u2014 and why that \u2019 s a big problem for state lawmakers and school teachers \u2014 in the latest edition of \u2588\u2588\u2588 Dispatch .\nWhat is the difference between those democracies that have responded effectively to coronavirus and those that have not ?\n\u201c The democracies led by populists \u2014 the U.S. , U.K. , Brazil \u2014 have done poorly , and the democracies led by institutionalists have done well : Merkel being a prime example of an institutionalist . Then there \u2019 s a separate cut , which is \u201c old democracy \u201d vs. \u201c young democracy. \u201d This doesn \u2019 t entirely work because it doesn \u2019 t take the developing world into account , but basically , if you look at Germany , New Zealand , Australia , Taiwan , those are all young democracies . Whereas the U.K. , the U.S. , France , those are older democracies . And I think there are two features there : one , just a certain kind of aged sclerosis comes with bureaucratic buildup over time , a lack of flexibility and nimbleness .\n\u201c But another thing matters , too : The younger democracies , simply by virtue of having their birth connected to a later historical moment , have more fully embraced the concept of social rights and consequently went into this crisis understanding that the social compact includes things like health , and that the goal of a national response is , among other things , to protect the foundation for social rights . Whereas the U.K. , U.S. , we have systems that rely \u2014 in their fundamentals \u2014 on 18th-century conceptions of political and civil rights as the bedrock ; social rights are still a contested matter for us. \u201d \u2014 Danielle Allen , head of Harvard \u2019 s Safra Center for Ethics and co-author of the university \u2019 s \u201c Roadmap to Pandemic Resilience , \u201d as told to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine \u2019 s Zack Stanton\n\u2018 I \u2019 M TRYING TO DEMOLISH STUFF \u2019 \u2014 Matt Wuerker talks satire during the Trump administration , as well as Pixar \u2019 s Coco and Latino culture in humor with cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz in the latest edition of Punchlines .\n340,000 hours The amount of time Texas judges have logged in Zoom hearings during the pandemic . The state Office of Court Administration bought 3,000 Zoom licenses for 3,220 judges . More than half are using Zoom to conduct business with about 525,000 participants .\nStuck at home to avoid coronavirus , Florida Rep. Donna Shalala decided to get a dog . Her old pooch died two years ago , and \u201c I thought Covid is a perfect opportunity to get a new dog because we \u2019 re stuck , \u201d she said .\nShe checked with Miami-based Paws 4 You Rescue to see what they had . The rescue had the perfect Yorkie , Shalala said , one who \u2019 s about four years old and recently wandered lost into Strada In The Grove restaurant in the heart of her Miami-based district .\n\u201c They said I should give him an Italian name , \u201d Shalala said . So the former Health and Human Services secretary thought of an old friend who \u2019 s now the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .\nA message from PhRMA : America \u2019 s biopharmaceutical companies are sharing their knowledge and resources more than ever before to speed up the development of new medicines to fight COVID-19 . They \u2019 re working with doctors and hospitals on over 1,100 clinical trials . And there \u2019 s no slowing down .

And I think there are two features there: one, just a certain kind of aged sclerosis comes with bureaucratic buildup over time, a lack of flexibility and nimbleness.\n\n\u201cBut another thing matters, too: The younger democracies, simply by virtue of having their birth connected to a later historical moment, have more fully embraced the concept of social rights and consequently went into this crisis understanding that the social compact includes things like health, and that the goal of a national response is, among other things, to protect the foundation for social rights. Whereas the U.K., U.S., we have systems that rely \u2014 in their fundamentals \u2014 on 18th-century conceptions of political and civil rights as the bedrock; social rights are still a contested matter for us.\u201d \u2014 Danielle Allen, head of Harvard\u2019s Safra Center for Ethics and co-author of the university\u2019s \u201cRoadmap to Pandemic Resilience,\u201d as told to POLITICO Magazine\u2019s Zack Stanton\n\n\n\nPUNCHLINES\n\n\u2018I\u2019M TRYING TO DEMOLISH STUFF\u2019 \u2014 Matt Wuerker talks satire during the Trump administration, as well as Pixar\u2019s Coco and Latino culture in humor with cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz in the latest edition of Punchlines.\n\n\n\nNightly Number\n\n340,000 hours The amount of time Texas judges have logged in Zoom hearings during the pandemic. The state Office of Court Administration bought 3,000 Zoom licenses for 3,220 judges. More than half are using Zoom to conduct business with about 525,000 participants.\n\nParting Words\n\nPANDEMIC PUP \u2014 Marc Caputo emails us:\n\nStuck at home to avoid coronavirus, Florida Rep. Donna Shalala decided to get a dog. Her old pooch died two years ago, and \u201cI thought Covid is a perfect opportunity to get a new dog because we\u2019re stuck,\u201d she said.\n\nShe checked with Miami-based Paws 4 You Rescue to see what they had. The rescue had the perfect Yorkie, Shalala said, one who\u2019s about four years old and recently wandered lost into Strada In The Grove restaurant in the heart of her Miami-based district.\n\n\u201cThey said I should give him an Italian name,\u201d Shalala said. So the former Health and Human Services secretary thought of an old friend who\u2019s now the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\u201cI named him Fauci,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nA message from PhRMA: America\u2019s biopharmaceutical companies are sharing their knowledge and resources more than ever before to speed up the development of new medicines to fight COVID-19. They\u2019re working with doctors and hospitals on over 1,100 clinical trials. And there\u2019s no slowing down. America\u2019s biopharmaceutical companies will continue working day and night until they beat coronavirus. Because science is how we get back to normal. See how biopharmaceutical companies are working together to get people what they need during this pandemic.\n\nDid someone forward this email to you?
