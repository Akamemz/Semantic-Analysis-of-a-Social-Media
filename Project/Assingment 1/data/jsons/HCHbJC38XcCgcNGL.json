Dzhokhar is 19 years old, Tamerlan was 26 years old.\n\nUPDATE - A new photo of the two men:\n\nStay tuned for much more as details unfold...\n\nUPDATE - These men have been named, and tied to the bombings, according to the Boston Globe and Business Insider. The link:\n\nOne suspect in Monday\u2019s Boston Marathon bombings has been captured, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation. Another remains on the loose in Watertown after a firefight with police. Authorities have established a 20-block perimeter as they search for him. A scene of chaos descended on Cambridge and Watertown late Thursday night and early Friday morning, as police confirmed an MIT police officer was shot and killed, and an apparent carjacking led police on a wild chase into Watertown.\n\nOne MIT police officer is dead after a wild shootout with a young man who may be one of the potential Boston bombings suspects. Officials say explosives were used during the incident. As of this writing, one man is in custody, while the other remains on the loose:\n\nPolice in Watertown, Mass., reportedly were searching for a heavily armed suspect who may have been involved in the shooting death of an MIT police officer after reportedly taking another suspect into custody early Friday. Police and federal authorities were investigating if the suspects are possibly tied to the Boston Marathon bombing. WCBV-TV said the suspects threw and detonated explosives during a car chase with police. Police were working to apprehend a young male with a hat on who was reportedly pulling on vehicle doors, according to police scanner traffic. An FBI official told Fox News early Friday that one person was in custody and an officer was down but said it was too early to tell if the police activity in Watertown or the MIT shooting were related to the Boston Marathon bombing. Dozens of officers and National Guard members descended on Watertown shortly after the shooting outside a building on MIT's campus in Cambridge, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\n\nOne man has been arrested, according to ABC News:\n\nPolice have a suspect in custody in Watertown, Mass., and the FBI are \"aware of the law enforcement activity in the greater Boston area.\"\n\n\n\nThough details are still sketchy, it seems possible, if not probable that this confrontation with authorities is related to Monday's bombings. The FBI released photos of two men wanted for questioning last night, which may have borne fruit. In light of the \"pulling on car doors\" detail in the story above, perhaps they were desperate to get out of town.",
