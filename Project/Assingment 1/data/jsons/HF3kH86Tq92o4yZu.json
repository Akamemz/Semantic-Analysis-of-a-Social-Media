Japan will host the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics beginning July 23 , 2021 .\nThe 67-page report , \u201c \u2018 I Was Hit So Many Times I Can \u2019 t Count \u2019 : Abuse of Child Athletes in Japan , \u201d documents Japan \u2019 s history of corporal punishment in sport \u2013 known as taibatsu in Japanese \u2013 and finds child abuse in sports training throughout Japanese schools , federations , and elite sports . In interviews and a nationwide online survey , Japanese athletes from more than 50 sports reported abuses that included being punched in the face , kicked , beaten with objects like bats or bamboo kendo sticks , being deprived of water , choked , whipped with whistles or racquets , and being sexually abused and harassed .\n\u201c For decades , children in Japan have been brutally beaten and verbally abused in the name of winning trophies and medals , \u201d said Minky Worden , director of global initiatives at \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c As Japan prepares to host the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo in July 2021 , the global spotlight brings a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change laws and policies in Japan and around the world to protect millions of child athletes . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 documented experiences of more than 800 former child athletes \u2013 more than 50 from in-person interviews , and 757 from an online survey \u2013 including Olympians and Paralympians . The survey had participants from 45 of the 47 Japanese prefectures , and 50 sports . \u2588\u2588\u2588 also monitored Japanese media reports of child abuse in sport , contacted sports federations to assess the availability of hotlines , interviewed academics , journalists , parents , and coaches , and met in person with government and sport federation officials .\nIn 2013 , while Japan was bidding to host the 2020 Olympics , a series of videos of high-profile elite athlete abuse cases , coupled with suicides of child athletes , spurred leading sports agencies to speak out on the need for child protection in sport . In 2018 , a video surfaced showing an Aichi prefecture high school baseball coach repeatedly slapping , punching , and kicking the players on his team . In the video , the coach is seen striking at least five players hard enough to cause the teenage athletes to stagger backward .\nPublic outrage led to important reforms such as setting up hotlines to report abuse . However , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found that these reforms are optional \u201c guidelines \u201d instead of rules , that progress has been uneven and unmonitored , and that there is no mandatory reporting of abuse complaints or statistics .\nThis abuse violates Japanese laws against child abuse , international human rights standards , and International Olympic Committee regulations on safeguarding athletes .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 found that child abuse in sport remains accepted and normalized in many parts of society , and that it is difficult for young athletes to file complaints against a powerful coach or official . Schools and federations rarely punish abusive coaches , often allowing them to continue coaching , \u2588\u2588\u2588 said .\n\u201c Sports federations in Japan are allowed to set up their own systems to track abuse and abusers \u2013 which many simply choose not to do , \u201d said Kanae Doi , Japan director at \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c This exposes children to unacceptable risks , and leaves parents and athletes with few options to file complaints or seek remedies against powerful abusers . \u201d\nChild abuse in sport is a global problem with a lack of unified , clear systems to address violence and abuse . The burden of reporting abuse is often on the victims , while the systems for reporting are opaque , unresponsive , and inadequate .\nWorldwide , coaches and other abusers go unpunished or are promoted to positions in which they can threaten and silence their accusers . Two presidents of sports federations , in Haiti and Afghanistan , have been accused of sexual assault of female athletes over the last 18 months . The United States Olympic doctor Larry Nassar abused hundreds of female gymnasts over decades . Children and teens who come forward are often not believed when accusing powerful coaches who hold the athletes \u2019 success hostage . On June 26 , according to the New York Times , 22-year-old South Korean triathlete Choi Suk-hyeon commtited suicide after filing many complaints with sport and government officials about the physical and psychological abuse she suffered .\n\u201c Sport can bring benefits like health , scholarships , and careers , but too often victims of abuse experience suffering and despair , \u201d said Takuya Yamazaki , a sports lawyer on the Executive Committee of the World Players Association , the global athletes \u2019 trade union who partnered with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on the report . \u201c One of the reasons why it is so hard to deal with cases of abuse is that athletes are not encouraged to have a voice .
