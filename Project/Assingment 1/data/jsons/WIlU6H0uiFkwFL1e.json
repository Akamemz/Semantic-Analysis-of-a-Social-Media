This has been presented as a predictably partisan issue.\n\nOn one side of the wall, Republicans; on the other side Democrats. But by going nuclear the president has made it more complicated than that. There are a lot of Republicans - in the Senate and in the House - deeply uneasy about what Mr Trump is doing.\n\nWhy? Because the constitutional arrangement of the US is that Congress - not the president - controls the purse strings and allocates funds.\n\nThis is a major land grab by the president. It undermines their position and sets a very dangerous precedent.\n\nCan Congress stop Trump's emergency move?\n\nThe National Emergencies Act contains a clause that allows Congress to terminate the emergency status if both houses vote for it - and the president does not veto.\n\nWith a comfortable majority in the House, Democrats could pass such a resolution to the Senate. The Republicans control the Senate, but a number of Republican senators have been vocal in their unease about the president invoking a national emergency.\n\nThe dissenting Republicans include 2012 presidential contender and new senator for Utah Mitt Romney, Florida senator Marco Rubio, and the senator from Maine Susan Collins, who said the move was of \"dubious constitutionality\".\n\nThe resolution would however still require Mr Trump's signature to pass, allowing him to veto it. A supermajority in both houses of Congress is needed to overturn a presidential veto.\n\nWhat is a national emergency?\n\nThe National Emergencies Act is intended for times of national crisis. Mr Trump has claimed that there is a migration crisis at the nation's southern border - a claim strongly refuted by migration experts.\n\nThe largest number of illegal migrants settling in the US each year is those who stay in the country after their visas expire.\n\nDeclaring a national emergency would give the president access to special powers that effectively allow him to bypass the usual political process, and he would be able to divert money from existing military or disaster relief budgets to pay for the wall.\n\nEmergency declarations by previous presidents have been overwhelmingly used for addressing foreign policy crises - including blocking terrorism-linked entities from accessing funds or prohibiting investment in nations associated with human rights abuses.\n\nWhere will the money come from?\n\nOn Friday, Mr Mulvaney said the $8bn would be made up of:\n\n$1.4bn from the agreed budget\n\n$600m from cash and assets seized from drug traffickers\n\n$2.5bn from a defence department anti-drug trafficking fund\n\n$3.5bn reallocated from military construction projects\n\nThe latter is the biggest amount and the relevant statute allows a president to divert funds for projects that \"require use of the armed forces\". This is almost certain to bring a legal challenge.\n\nA congressional aide told ABC News projects that could be cancelled include constructions at Guantanamo Bay, a military school in Japan and special forces facilities in North Carolina.\n\nPoor living conditions for military families have become a concern but a Pentagon spokesman, Bill Speaks, insisted \"military family-housing projects will not be affected\".\n\nTrump officials also said that projects affecting force-readiness would not be compromised.\n\nMr Trump said military officials had told him the wall was more important and that what he was told would be cut \"didn't sound too important to me\".",
