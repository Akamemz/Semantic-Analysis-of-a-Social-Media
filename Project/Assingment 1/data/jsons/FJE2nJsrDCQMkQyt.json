The former Massachusetts governor and current US Senate candidate in Utah issued a lengthy statement on Friday defending equality , steeped in his religious upbringing and belief that \u201c we are all children of God . \u201d\nRomney , who ran against President Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election , touched on a number of issues in his post . He weighed in on President Donald Trump \u2019 s equivocal reaction to the gathering of the alt-right and white supremacists in 2017 , though he did not mention the president by name . He also suggested that it \u2019 s misguided to perceive pushes for equal opportunity by groups that have historically been discriminated against as grabs for a disproportionate share of the pie .\nThe equality of the intrinsic worth of every person is a truth fundamental to our national founding and moral order .
