Her husband got a job as a bartender while starting a series of failed businesses\u2014a vegetable stand , a dry cleaner , a grocery . They never had much . But their house had a real floor . Their daughters had real dolls . They sent all four of their children to college to chase their own dreams .\nThat \u2019 s why on the morning of Dec. 21 , she called her youngest son , Marco Antonio Rubio , the 41-year-old Senator from Florida and great Hispanic hope of the Republican Party\u2014or , as she calls him , Tony . She got his voice mail . \u201c Tony , some loving advice from the person who cares for you most in the world , \u201d she said in Spanish . \u201c Don \u2019 t mess with the immigrants , my son .
