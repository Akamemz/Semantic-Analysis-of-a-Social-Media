    "content": "The chemical weapons deal the Obama administration helped negotiate with Syria two years ago came under withering scrutiny Wednesday as Congress aired gruesome testimony of how the Assad regime has used chlorine barrel bombs in more than two dozen recent attacks on civilians \u2014 leaving lawmakers in both parties frustrated by the president \u2019 s claim to have rid the war-torn nation of chemical munitions .\n\u201c My heart grieves for the Syrian people . I only wish that we had made some different policy choices in Washington three years ago , \u201d said Rep. Eliot L. Engel , the top Democrat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs , who openly questioned the administration \u2019 s decision-making on Syria policy during the panel \u2019 s hearing .\nMr. Engel , who three years ago urged President Obama to arm the Syrian resistance , said the U.S. is \u201c still trying to find our way \u201d in Syria , and the administration \u2019 s approach has been \u201c a disaster \u201d that empowered the Islamic State and left Mr. Assad with the capability to kill his own people with chlorine bombs .\nThe White House brushed aside the criticism , saying it felt it had no choice but to allow Syria to keep chlorine as part of the chemical weapons removal deal that was quickly put together with Mr. Assad and Russian diplomats in 2013 \u2014 because chlorine has widespread nonmilitary uses such as sterilizing drinking water .\nWhile using chlorine as a weapon is forbidden under international law , industrial chlorine used for peaceful purposes is not technically banned by any chemical weapons treaties .\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest pushed back against the suggestion that administration officials had jumped the gun last year by claiming the chemical weapons removal deal with Syria was a success .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s anybody who stood at this podium or any others suggesting that every \u2014 that all chlorine should be removed from Syria , \u201d he said . \u201c What we \u2019 ve insisted upon is that the outrageous , catastrophic , violent behavior of the Assad regime that \u2019 s been perpetrated against the Syrian people should come to an end \u2014 and that includes the use of chlorine to try to attack people . \u201d\nAs the violence in Syria mounted three years ago , President Obama initially said the use of chemical weapons would represent a \u201c red line , \u201d but faced wide criticism when Mr. Assad appeared to cross that line without consequences .\nThe world watched in horror in August 2013 when gruesome images emerged showing the horrific aftermath of a sarin gas attack that killed hundreds of women and children in the opposition-controlled outskirts of Damascus .\nIt was then that the Obama administration and Russia suddenly brokered the agreement to allow Mr. Assad to stay in power and avoid a direct confrontation with the U.S. military as long as he relinquished his banned chemical weapons through a U.N.-backed process .\nIn June 2014 the international Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) declared that deadly elements of Syria \u2019 s chemical arsenal such as mustard gas agents and sarin had all been successfully removed from the nation and destroyed . Secretary of State John F. Kerry also declared the effort a success , testifying before Congress at one point last year that the Obama administration had gotten \u201c all the chemical weapons out of Syria . \u201d\nThe Syrian military \u2019 s more recent shift to using chlorine barrel bombs suggests that a gaping hole was left open in the weapons removal deal \u2014 and it is prompting mounting pressure on the White House . By September 2014 , Mr. Kerry and other administration officials were condemning Damascus over OPCW reports it had deployed chlorine gas in attacks on rebel villages .\n\u201c The Assad regime \u2019 s horrifying pattern of using chlorine as a chemical weapon against the Syrian people underscores the importance of investigating this allegation as quickly as possible , \u201d Mr. Kerry said in a March statement , when another alleged chlorine attack was reported . \u201c The Assad regime must be held accountable for such atrocious behavior . \u201d\nSyria \u2019 s government has repeatedly denied it has used either banned chemical weapons or chlorine in its civil war , but the U.N. Security Council in March adopted a U.S.-sponsored resolution strongly condemning the use of toxic chemicals , including chlorine , in the Syrian conflict amid mounting evidence of continuing deadly chemical attacks .\nMr. Earnest \u2019 s comments came after a prominent Syrian doctor appeared on Capitol Hill Wednesday with sobering testimony of the horrors associated with chlorine barrel bombs that have been targeting civilians in Syria .\n\u201c The majority of the attacks happen in the middle of the night or early morning , \u201d said Dr. Mohamed Tennari , who has treated hundreds of patients for chlorine exposure at a field hospital in the opposition-controlled northern Syrian province of Idlib .\nIn testimony before the Foreign Affairs Committee , Dr. Tennari said 31 separate chlorine attacks have been carried out in the province since mid-March , with more than 540 Syrian civilians \u2014 many of them young children and elderly \u2014 affected by exposure and 10 people dying from suffocation .\n\u201c Victims described smelling a bleachlike odor , \u201d the doctor explained . \u201c Patients of all ages experienced similar symptoms , consistent with exposure to a choking agent , including redness and burning of the eyes , shortness of breath , coughing and , for severe cases , frothing at the mouth . \u201d\n\u201c When choking agents are inhaled , fluid ultimately fills the lungs and the victims suffocate . \u201d\nWhile the death toll is significantly lower than what would be expected from attacks by more conventional chemical weapons , such as sarin , Dr. Tennari said the chlorine attacks trigger no less fear and panic among civilians .\nHe voiced frustration that the international community \u2014 Washington included \u2014 had not done enough to confront the Syrian military for carrying out the attacks .\n\u201c It is an ironic and twisted fact that the government of Syria was allowed to join the Chemical Weapons Convention in October of 2013 , yet since then has time and time again violated the rules of the convention by deliberately using chlorine against its own civilians , and faces no consequences , \u201d he said . \u201c Congress must push the administration to revisit the U.S.-Russia deal of September 2013 with the intention of adding further measures to prevent the use of weaponized chlorine and show that these flagrant and deadly violations have consequences . \u201d\nBut some doubt the Obama administration will take any new action .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not sure I understand why the administration is reluctant to call it out and do something about it , \u201d said Jeffrey Lewis , an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey . \u201c I get that they \u2019 ve made a decision that they don \u2019 t want to get wrapped into Syria \u2019 s civil war , but dropping barrels filled with chlorine is a flagrant violation of the chemical weapons convention .\nAt the same time , however , Mr. Lewis said that the emergence of the chlorine barrel bombs \u201c does not necessarily mean that the deal we struck with Assad was a bad one \u2014 because it did get rid of the very worst chemical weapons in Syria . \u201d\n\u201c But it \u2019 s still a problem , and there are things we could do to retaliate , \u201d he added . \u201c If you knew which units were dropping chlorine barrel bombs from helicopters , well , we could target those units . \u2026 We could lob a cruise missile at an airfield that we thought a barrel bomb attack had started from . \u201d\nHouse Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Edward R.
