But under pressure from activist groups to expand deportation waivers , the president said he could not legally take such action .\n\u201c If we start broadening that , then essentially I \u2019 ll be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally , \u201d Mr. Obama said at the time . \u201c So that \u2019 s not an option . \u201d\nNow , as the president prepares to issue an executive order as soon as Friday to grant legal status to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants , the White House is trying to square his action with those past comments .\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said House Republicans have forced the president into this position by refusing to act on a Senate-passed bill that would grant a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants .\n\u201c House Republicans are being pretty clear about the fact that they \u2019 re not ever going to get around to it , \u201d Mr . Earnest said . \u201c And that \u2019 s what has caused the president or prompted the president to consider some alternatives . \u201d\nAsked by reporters whether Mr. Obama has changed his view of the law in the past year , Mr . Earnest said the president and his advisers are \u201c trying to figure out what exactly the law says and what that means for the president \u2019 s ability to wield some authority here to try to solve problems . \u201d\n\u201c He wanted to basically find out what authority he did have and to ensure that we were leaving no stone unturned in examining what sort of authority the president of the United States could wield to try to address some of these problems that Congress has been unwilling to confront , \u201d Mr . Earnest said .\nThe president also has said repeatedly that he didn \u2019 t want to encourage immigration activists to believe that he could take action without Congress .\n\u201c I do get a little worried that , you know , advocates of immigration reform start losing heart and immediately thinking , well , you know , somehow there \u2019 s an \u2018 out \u2019 here \u2026 if Congress doesn \u2019 t act we \u2019 ll just have the president sign something , and that \u2019 ll take care of it , and we won \u2019 t have to worry about it , \u201d Mr. Obama said last year on Telemundo .\nCecilia Munoz , the president \u2019 s top domestic policy adviser , said Mr. Obama \u201c was expressing in that interview his preference that Congress take action . \u201d\n\u201c But he does have the authority , the legal authority , to take action to establish enforcement priorities , \u201d Ms. Munoz said Tuesday on MSNBC .\nAs the president \u2019 s advisers prepared the legal groundwork for Mr. Obama \u2019 s action , the White House also portrayed the pending executive order as consistent with steps taken by other presidents . Mr . Earnest said \u201c even somebody like President George H.W . Bush \u201d took such actions , creating the \u201c family fairness \u201d program in February 1990 .\nThe program granted protection from deportation for family members living with a legalized immigrant and who were in the U.S. before passage of a 1986 law , signed by President Ronald Reagan , that granted legal status to as many as 3 million illegal immigrants . The Bush administration estimated that up to 1.5 million people would be covered by the policy ; Congress passed a broader immigration law later in 1990 that made the protections permanent .\nMr . Earnest said Mr. Bush \u2019 s action covered \u201c 40 percent of the undocumented population of roughly 3.5 million undocumented immigrants in the country at that time. \u201d He said it illustrated how presidents are authorized by law \u201c in terms of using their executive authority to take actions related to our immigration system that would have a substantial impact on a large number of people . \u201d\nCongressional Republicans have warned Mr. Obama not to issue his order , saying the action would poison any hope of working together next year when the GOP will control the Senate and the House .\nIncoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , didn \u2019 t rule out Tuesday the suggestion that the GOP might withhold the funds for the government to carry out Mr. Obama \u2019 s eventual order on immigration .\n\u201c It \u2019 s always appropriate to use the power of the purse , but it \u2019 s important to remember that the president has an important trump card .
