But the French president on Tuesday moved closer to Mr. Trump \u2019 s harsh critique of the agreement , which Mr. Trump repeated at length in a series of public events .\nMr. Macron said at a joint White House press conference that he always felt the agreement that halted Iran \u2019 s nuclear weapons development until 2025 was insufficient .\n\u201c We therefore wish , from now on , to work on a new deal with Iran , \u201d Mr. Macron said .\nMr. Trump issued his strongest response to date to threats from Iran to restart its suspect nuclear programs if the U.S. pulls out of the 2015 deal negotiated under President Obama .\n\u201c If Iran threatens us in any way , they will pay a price like few other countries have ever paid , \u201d said Mr. Trump , denouncing the existing accord as \u201c insane . \u201d\nThe opening for a renegotiation of the deal , known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , was the most striking outcome from Mr. Macron \u2019 s state visit .\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel travels to Washington later this week to reinforce the message that Mr. Trump can get tough on Iran without unilaterally withdrawing the U.S. from the nuclear accord .\n\u201c Regarding Iran , we have a disagreement regarding the JCPOA , but I think we are overcoming it by deciding to work towards a deal , an overall deal , \u201d Mr. Macron said .\nIran has also stepped up its rhetoric in recent days as Mr. Trump faces a May 12 deadline to decide whether to effectively take the U.S. out of the deal , which was also signed by France , Germany , Britain , China and Russia .\n\u201c I am telling those in the White House that if they do not live up to their commitments \u2026 the Iranian government will firmly react , \u201d Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told reporters in Tehran on Tuesday , according to the Reuters news service . \u201c If anyone betrays the deal , they should know that they would face severe consequences . \u201d\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned that quitting the deal would undermine Washington \u2019 s hope of securing a separate deal with North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons by showing that the U.S. can \u2019 t be trusted to keep its word .\nMr. Trump and Mr. Macron , although sharply opposed on issues including Iran , trade and climate change , forged an unusually close personal relationship during Mr. Trump \u2019 s visit to Paris for Bastille Day last year and in more than 20 phone calls .\nAt the press conference , Mr. Macron , a onetime banker who defied France \u2019 s political establishment to win the presidency last year , called for hammering Iran with additional demands that likely pleased Mr. Trump . The states in the European Union are trying to forge a separate accord addressing Mr. Trump \u2019 s main critiques of the deal , including a permanent ban on Iranian nuclear weapons , a halt to Tehran \u2019 s ballistic missile tests and a political deal to contain Iran \u2019 s destructive influence in the region .\nMany have expected the U.S. to withdraw next month , but Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he is weighing his options .\n\u201c Nobody knows what I \u2019 m going to do on the 12th , \u201d he said , adding that Mr. Macron might have a clue . \u201c It \u2019 s a bad deal . It \u2019 s a bad structure . It \u2019 s falling down . Should have never , ever been made . I blame Congress . I blame a lot of people for it . \u201d\nMichael C. Desch , director of the Notre Dame International Security Center , said Mr. Macron and his European counterparts were giving Mr. Trump a way to stay in the deal .\n\u201c My instinct is that he wants to save the JCPOA and is trying to throw President Trump a few bones , \u201d he said . \u201c No one in Europe has any interest in scrapping JCPOA , so raising the prospect of \u2018 fixing \u2019 JCPOA \u2019 s alleged flaws via new negotiations is an ideal way to kick that can down the road . \u201d\nBeyond the policy skirmishes , Tuesday \u2019 s events provided yet more evidence of the unlikely personal rapport that has developed between the two men . During a series of meetings and social events , including a state dinner , the two leaders reveled in their mutual admiration by exchanging hearty handshakes , hugs and air kisses on both cheeks .\nPalling around in the Oval Office , Mr. Trump joked that reports of their close relationship was , for once , not a media creation .\n\u201c Finally , it \u2019 s not fake news , \u201d Mr. Trump told reporters before the one-on-one meeting .\nHe joked at one point that his French visitor had dandruff on his dark suit jacket and brushed Mr. Macron \u2019 s shoulder and lapel .\n\u201c We have to make him perfect . He is perfect , \u201d Mr. Trump said as Mr. Macron smiled at his host .\nBut there were other serious matters to discuss beyond the atmospherics , including Mr. Trump \u2019 s recent declaration that he wants to pull U.S. troops fighting Islamic State out of Syria as soon as possible .
