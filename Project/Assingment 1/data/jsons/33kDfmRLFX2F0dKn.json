    "content": "On Tuesday , Hillary Clinton named a triad of wonks to lead her policy team . Two of them were widely expected : Jake Sullivan , a top aide to Clinton when she was at the State Department , and Ann O'Leary , who served as legislative director in Clinton 's Senate office , both made the cut .\nBut the third member of the team , Maya Harris , is perhaps the most interesting . Harris , the sister of California Senate candidate Kamala Harris , is n't a known member of Clintonland . She did n't hold a key position in Bill Clinton 's White House , or on Hillary Clinton 's 2008 campaign , or in Hillary Clinton 's State Department . She 's a law professor and , most recently , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , where she published only a single paper \u2014 but it 's a paper that may prove key to Clinton 's 2016 efforts to hold , and even expand , Obama 's coalition .\nThe paper 's title is `` Women of Color : A Growing Force in the American Electorate , '' and in it , Harris criticizes politicians and political strategists for only addressing the concerns of women of color `` as a part of broader efforts aimed at women , youth , or a specific racial or ethnic group . '' Women of color , Harris argues , are their own , incredibly fast-growing voting bloc , and any politician who wants to win them needs to make sure `` their interests are priorities on the policy agenda . ''\nBut Harris 's paper is n't just about how to win the votes of women of color ; it 's also about why politicians should try . She spends most of the paper laying out just how decisive these voters will be in future elections . `` Women are the country \u2019 s largest voting bloc , and women of color are the fastest-growing segment of that group , '' she writes , going on to note that `` women of color represent 74 percent of the growth in eligible women voters since 2000 . ''\nMoreover , women of color are n't just eligible to vote \u2014 they really do vote , at least if you give them something to vote for . This chart from her paper makes the point well \u2014 in every subgroup you can think of , women vote at higher rates than men , and African-American women vote at higher rates than anyone :\nHarris 's paper does n't delve deep into what kinds of policies are likely to win over women of color , but her basic political theory is an interesting signal of how Hillary Clinton 's campaign might try to fashion its own version of Obama 's coalition .\nThere has been wide skepticism that Clinton can sustain the high turnout among minority voters that Obama managed . Harris 's point is that most of those voters are women , and that if Clinton wants them to turn out , she needs to give them reason to turn out . In hiring Harris to help lead policy on her campaign , it 's a reasonable bet that Clinton is signaling she agrees , and intends to try to give them reasons to come to the polls .\nAnd here , Clinton might run a very different kind of campaign than Obama . As much as part of Obama 's 2008 appeal was that he would be the first black president , he was at pains to avoid proposing policy specifically aimed at the black community .\nOnly 12 percent of the electorate , after all , is African-American . Obama needed to convince a majority of voters that he would govern on their behalf , and so even when he gave his famed race speech in Philadelphia , he was quick to separate his historical analysis of racism from his policy intentions :\nI have asserted a firm conviction \u2014 a conviction rooted in my faith in God and my faith in the American people \u2014 that , working together , we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds , and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union . For the African-American community , that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past . It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of American life . But it also means binding our particular grievances \u2014 for better health care and better schools and better jobs \u2014 to the larger aspirations of all Americans : the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling , the white man who has been laid off , the immigrant trying to feed his family .\nBut Clinton 's position is different . The math is on her side . A majority of the electorate is female . A majority of voters of color are female . If Clinton somehow polarizes the electorate perfectly around gender \u2014 if every woman votes for her , and every man votes for her opponent \u2014 she 'll win , and easily .\nThat means Clinton can work to make policy appealing directly to women in a way Obama could n't make policy appealing directly to African-Americans .
