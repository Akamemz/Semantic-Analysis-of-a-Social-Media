    "content": "In November , 1984 , President Ronald Reagan was re\u00eblected in a landslide victory over Walter Mondale , taking forty-nine states and fifty-nine per cent of the popular vote . The Reagan revolution was powerfully reaffirmed . Soon after , Donald Regan , the new chief of staff , sent word to a small group of trusted friends and Administration officials seeking advice on how Reagan should approach his last four years in office . It was an unusual moment in the history of the Presidency , and the experience of recent incumbents offered no guidance . No President since Dwight D. Eisenhower had served two full terms . John F. Kennedy was assassinated . Lyndon Johnson , overwhelmed by the war in Vietnam , had declined to run for re\u00eblection in 1968 . Richard Nixon resigned less than seventeen months into his second term . Gerald Ford ( who was never elected ) and Jimmy Carter were defeated . By the nineteen-eighties , it had become popular to talk about the crisis of the Presidency ; a bipartisan group of Washington leaders , with Carter \u2019 s support , launched the National Committee for a Single Six-Year Presidential Term . Regan \u2019 s effort to foresee a successful second term is documented in a series of memos at the Reagan Library . President Obama , who in November could face one of the tightest bids for re\u00eblection in history , has periodically spoken of his admiration for Reagan . \u201c Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory for America , \u201d he told a Reno , Nevada , newspaper in early 2008 . \u201c He just tapped into what people were already feeling , which was we want clarity , we want optimism. \u201d From the inception of his Presidential bid , Obama has sought to present himself as a leader with far-reaching ideas , and has prided himself on his ability to look past the politics of the moment . To the degree that he is able to ponder his strategy for the next four years , it \u2019 s natural to think he might steal a glance at the Reagan playbook . Responding to Regan \u2019 s confidential memo , Tom Korologos , an adviser to every Republican President from Nixon to George W. Bush , told the Reagan White House that the second term should be viewed from the standpoint of the President \u2019 s intended legacy . \u201c It seems to me that the President needs to decide what his legacy is going to be , \u201d Korologos wrote on January 24 , 1985 , a few days after Reagan \u2019 s second inaugural . \u201c What is he going to be the most proud of when he \u2019 s sitting at the ranch with Nancy four and five years after his Presidency ? Is it going to be an arms control agreement ? Is it going to be a balanced budget ? Is it going to be world-wide economic recovery ? Is it going to be a combination of all of this : peace and prosperity ? . . . Every speech ; every appearance ; every foreign trip ; every congressional phone call and every act involving the President should be made with the long-range goal in mind. \u201d Every President running for re\u00eblection begins to think about his second term well before victory is assured . In early 2009 , Rahm Emanuel , Obama \u2019 s first chief of staff , told me that the White House was already contemplating the Presidency in terms of eight years . He said that it was folly to try to accomplish everything in the first term . \u201c I don \u2019 t buy into everybody \u2019 s theory about the final years of a Presidency , \u201d Emanuel said . \u201c There \u2019 s an accepted wisdom that in the final years you \u2019 re kind of done . Ronald Reagan , in the final years , got arms control , immigration reform , and created a separate new department , \u201d that of Veterans Affairs . Obama \u2019 s campaign is well aware that he may end up like Jimmy Carter or George H. W. Bush , the two most recent one-term Presidents , who were both defeated despite some notable\u2014even historic\u2014accomplishments , including the Camp David Accords , under Carter , and the Gulf War , under Bush . The country remains closely divided , and the economy is teetering again . After several months of relatively positive news , the employment report released in June was gloomy . Barring a disastrous revelation or blunder , Mitt Romney will be a more formidable opponent than many assumed during his rightward lurch to secure the Republican nomination . Many White House officials were reluctant to discuss a second term ; they are focussed more on the campaign than on what comes after . But the ostensible purpose of a political campaign is to articulate for the public what a candidate will do if he prevails . \u201c It \u2019 s a tension , \u201d David Axelrod , Obama \u2019 s longtime political adviser , said . \u201c On the one hand , you don \u2019 t want to be presumptuous in assuming a second term . But campaigns are about the future , and there is an imperative to spell out where we \u2019 re going. \u201d Obama has an ambitious second-term agenda , which , at least in broad ways , his campaign is beginning to highlight . The President has said that the most important policy he could address in his second term is climate change , one of the few issues that he thinks could fundamentally improve the world decades from now . He also is concerned with containing nuclear proliferation . In April , 2009 , in one of the most notable speeches of his Presidency , he said , in Prague , \u201c I state clearly and with conviction America \u2019 s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. \u201d He conceded that the goal might not be achieved in his lifetime but promised to take \u201c concrete steps , \u201d including a new treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons and ratification of the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty . In 2010 , Obama negotiated a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Russians and won its passage in the Senate . But , despite his promise to \u201c immediately and aggressively \u201d ratify the C.N.T.B.T. , he never submitted it for ratification . As James Mann writes in \u201c The Obamians , \u201d his forthcoming book on Obama \u2019 s foreign policy , \u201c The Obama administration crouched , unwilling to risk controversy and a Senate fight for a cause that the President , in his Prague speech , had endorsed and had promised to push quickly and vigorously. \u201d As with climate change , Obama \u2019 s early rhetoric and idealism met the reality of Washington politics and his reluctance to confront Congress . Obama \u2019 s advisers say it is more likely that the President would champion an issue with greater bipartisan support , such as immigration reform . Obama has also said that he hopes to have the time and the attention to address a more robust aid agenda for developing countries than he was able to muster in his first term . These issues will loom over his potential second term , awaiting a push from the President . So , too , will the lingering question of who Obama \u201c really \u201d is : an aspiring compromiser , a lawyerly strategist , or a bold visionary willing to gamble to secure his legacy . Whatever goal Obama decides on , his opportunities for effecting change are slight . Term limits are cruel to Presidents . If he wins , Obama will have less than eighteen months to pass a second wave of his domestic agenda , which has been stalled since late 2010 and has no chance of moving this year . His best opportunity for a breakthrough on energy policy , immigration , or tax reform would come in 2013 . By the middle of 2014 , congressional elections will force another hiatus in Washington policymaking . Since Franklin Roosevelt , Presidents have lost an average of thirty House seats and seven Senate seats in their second midterm election . By early 2015 , the press will begin to focus on the next Presidential campaign , which will eclipse a great deal of coverage of the White House . The last two years of Obama \u2019 s Presidency will likely be spent attending more assiduously to foreign policy and shoring up the major reforms of his early years , such as health care and financial regulation . As William Daley , who served for a year as Obama \u2019 s chief of staff , put it , \u201c After 2014 , nobody cares what he does. \u201d II \u201c Does this make me think I look good ? \u201d\nSooner or later , every re\u00eblected President confronts the frustration lurking in a second term : re\u00eblection to power does not necessarily grant more of it . Richard Nixon and his aides were obsessed with using a second term to take command of a federal government that they believed was hostile to the President and his agenda . \u201c Faced with a bureaucracy we did not control , was not staffed with our people , and with which we did not know how to communicate , we created our own bureaucracy , \u201d White House aides wrote in a 1972 memo found in the files of H. R. Haldeman , who later went to prison for covering up Watergate crimes . Nixon gave his aides detailed directions about how to flush unsympathetic bureaucrats from the government after he won re\u00eblection . Early in the 1972 campaign , he wrote his aides with instructions for a \u201c housecleaning \u201d at the C.I.A . : I want a study made immediately as to how many people in CIA could be removed by presidential action . . . . Of course , the reduction in force should be accomplished solely on the ground of its being necessary for budget reasons , but you will both know the real reason . . . . I want you to quit recruiting from any of the Ivy League schools or any other universities where either the university president or the university faculties have taken action condemning our efforts to bring the war in Vietnam to an end . Nixon \u2019 s paranoid theory was that none of his second-term priorities\u2014from his China policy to his health-care plan\u2014could be addressed until the White House controlled the rest of his government . The housecleaning efforts were not technically a part of Watergate , but they were a harbinger of his second-term self-immolation . The Reagan Administration quickly grasped that whatever power it had gained through re\u00eblection had to be spent judiciously . As part of Regan \u2019 s brainstorming exercise about the President \u2019 s second term , Alfred Kingon , then the Assistant Treasury Secretary , urged the President to choose his top priorities with care . The best that Reagan could hope for was victory on a few big initiatives . \u201c Please remember that there are about 50 or 60 issues going at once , \u201d Kingon wrote . \u201c We can only keep track of 20 or 25 , concentrate on a mere handful and hope to have legislative success in a fraction of that. \u201d James Baker , Reagan \u2019 s chief of staff preceding Regan , wrote to the President after the election and made a similar point . \u201c Unlike the campaign in 1980 , you have campaigned with little specificity , \u201d he told the President . ( Reagan \u2019 s \u201c Morning in America \u201d theme had not been burdened with detailed policy proposals . ) \u201c There are very many items that any right-thinking president would want to achieve , \u201d Baker wrote . \u201c But frankly , there are too many . You must set priorities. \u201d A key challenge for a second-term President lies in managing the delicate balance between what he wants ( his priorities ) and what he thinks the public wants ( his perceived mandate ) \u2014and taking care not to confuse the two . George W. Bush was less adept at this than Reagan . Bush approached his second term with two broad goals . In foreign policy , he attempted to steer his White House away from the radicalism of the first four years . During the 2004 campaign , Bush came close to jettisoning the two people\u2014Vice-President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld\u2014most associated with extreme views of how to handle post-9/11 foreign affairs . After the election , Cheney saw the influence of his principal ideological opponents\u2014Stephen Hadley , the new national-security adviser , and Condoleezza Rice , the new Secretary of State\u2014rise , especially on issues such as Syria , North Korea , and the Administration \u2019 s policy on torture . Cheney \u2019 s recent memoir boils with his indignation at being sidelined . At a National Security Council meeting in 2007 , Cheney made the case for bombing a Syrian nuclear reactor . \u201c After I finished , \u201d he writes , \u201c the President asked , \u2018 Does anyone here agree with the Vice President ? \u2019 Not a single hand went up around the room. \u201d Domestically , however , Bush miscalculated his position . Early in his second term , he made a strong play for Social Security reform ; it failed miserably , for lack of Democratic backing . \u201c If I had it to do over again , I would have pushed for immigration reform , rather than Social Security , as the first major initiative of my second term , \u201d Bush lamented in his memoir . \u201c Unlike Social Security , immigration reform had bipartisan support. \u201d In 2005 , Bush won approval of an energy bill , a trade agreement , and a bankruptcy-reform bill . But the remainder of his Presidency was consumed by scandal ( the Valerie Plame case , the N.S.A. \u2019 s warrantless wiretapping program , the firing of eight U.S . Attorneys for political reasons ) and by badly managed catastrophes ( Katrina , deterioration in Iraq , the crash of financial markets ) . The Democrats took over Congress in 2006 , and on Election Day in 2008 Bush \u2019 s Gallup approval rating stood at twenty-five per cent .\nThere is an argument , common on the right , that if Obama is re\u00eblected he will pursue a more ideological , even radical , agenda because he will be unbound by the moderating influence of another election . As Dick Morris , of Fox News , put it in March , \u201c A second term for Obama would bring on a socialist nightmare hellscape as he moves further to the left. \u201d This argument is often bolstered by noting that Obama recently told the Russian Prime Minister , Dmitry Medvedev , that he would have \u201c more flexibility \u201d to pursue negotiations on missile defense \u201c after my election. \u201d Ed Morrissey , of the conservative blog Hot Air , warned that the comment should cause voters \u201c to fear an Obama second term. \u201d But a President who has won re\u00eblection can also feel less tied to his political base and more free to shift toward the political center . At the start of Reagan \u2019 s second term , Kingon advised the White House that the victory had allowed him to pursue policies that would advance only with bipartisan support\u2014a precondition for success , given that Democrats controlled the House . Kingon noted that only twenty per cent of Americans agreed with Reagan \u2019 s anti-abortion policy and that many Americans voted for Reagan \u201c knowing that he believes in these things but understanding that he would not push for them. \u201d He argued that this was the implicit promise of the Reagan re\u00eblection campaign . Aggressively pursuing social issues , Kingon wrote , would substantially diminish the President \u2019 s political support , and would risk failure in other key areas . \u201c I think it is important to remember that there is a point beyond which popular Presidential support erodes , and he can do nothing , e.g. , Jimmy Carter , \u201d Kingon warned . Reagan largely heeded this advice , and he had one of the most successful second terms in American history . He passed immigration reform , a major reform of the tax code , and an arms-control treaty with the Soviets . He also appointed two conservative Supreme Court Justices , Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy . He ended his Presidency with an approval rating of more than fifty-five per cent . Obama entered office with what many considered a mandate . Taking advantage of large majorities in Congress , he spent the first two years passing major Democratic legislation : financial regulation and health-care reform . But the second two years were devoted to managing the gridlock created by the backlash against the first two , with a resurgent Republican Party intent on Obama \u2019 s defeat . Axelrod told me that Obama has learned from recent history . \u201c President Bush claimed a mandate after the last election and took steps that he never ran on , \u201d Axelrod said , pointing to Bush \u2019 s miscalculation on Social Security . \u201c You have to govern boldly , but with the humility of knowing that you can \u2019 t assume that people embrace your case\u2014you have to make it , even after the election . The thing that trips you up , and certainly tripped up Bush , is the assumption that , if you win , somehow you can then embark on an agenda that is wholly different from the one you campaigned on. \u201d If Obama aims to leave a legislative mark in his second term , he \u2019 ll need two things : a sense of humility , and a revitalized faction of Republican lawmakers willing to make deals with the President . Given the polarized environment and the likelihood of a closely divided Congress , it seems more implausible to suppose that Obama would turn radical in his second term than that he would cool to his Democratic base . III\nAfter every Presidential election , the winner likes to declare why he won , often in terms that set the tone for the following year . \u201c I earned capital in the campaign , political capital , and now I intend to spend it , \u201d Bush said at his first post-election press conference on November 4 , 2004 . Cheney went further : \u201c President Bush ran forthrightly on a clear agenda for this nation \u2019 s future . And the nation responded by giving him a mandate. \u201d But , as his defeat on Social Security soon made clear , Bush had no mandate . \u201c You are organized ! \u201d The idea of a mandate from the people defies the intentions of the Founders and is contrary to the way that most early Presidents viewed their role , according to Robert Dahl , the Yale political scientist . Early Presidents argued on behalf of their policies with appeals to the Constitution rather than to the people . Even Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt , who asked for sweeping new executive powers , did so with strictly constitutional arguments rather than with populist ones . The concept of a mandate was essentially invented by Andrew Jackson , who first popularized the notion that the President \u201c is the direct representative of the American people , \u201d and it was later institutionalized by Woodrow Wilson , who explicitly wanted the American government to be like the more responsive parliamentary system of the United Kingdom . Like Jackson , he argued that the President was the \u201c one national voice in the country. \u201d Every President since Wilson has at least implicitly adopted this theory , and the Presidential mandate has become enshrined in our national politics . But the idea is mostly a myth . The President and Congress are equal , and when Presidents misinterpret election results\u2014especially in re\u00eblections\u2014they get into trouble . In a 2006 book , \u201c Mandate Politics , \u201d the political scientists Lawrence J. Grossback , David A. M. Peterson , and James A. Stimson apply some fancy methodological techniques to congressional voting patterns and find only two modern cases in which Presidents had true mandates , which they define as elections that push members of the opposition party in Congress toward the President \u2019 s positions on key issues . This occurred in 1965 , when Johnson passed the Voting Rights Act , and in early 1981 , when sixty-three Democrats helped Reagan pass his first budget in the House . The media interpreted those elections as representing tectonic changes in politics , and members of Congress followed along . The changes in congressional behavior didn \u2019 t last long , but they enabled both Presidents to achieve major legislative victories in their first year . * * * * But in 1965 and 1981 the two parties were still ideologically mixed . Liberal Northern Republicans voted with Johnson , and Reagan , even though the Democrats controlled the House , could rely on dozens of conservative Democrats to support his agenda . Unlike those periods when some members of Congress feared crossing the President , in 2009 almost all Republicans were willing to bet that Obama \u2019 s popularity was temporary . Instead of fearing a new Democratic tide and helping a popular President pass his agenda , almost all Republicans united in opposition , and in 2010 they took over the House and gained seats in the Senate . Obama \u2019 s aides speak of a victory in November not in sweeping terms of realignment but simply as an opportunity to nudge Republicans away from a policy of pure obstructionism and toward some limited compromise around a few key issues . \u201c The hope is that some of the moderate Republicans\u2014if there are any left\u2014are like , \u2018 Look , we tried it your way , we lost the election , \u2019 \u201d a senior Obama adviser said . \u201c You have to compromise in American politics and divided government . But it depends on whether the interpretation , if Obama wins , is that Republicans didn \u2019 t co\u00f6perate enough or that they co\u00f6perated too much. \u201d One thing is nearly certain : if Obama wins in November , his margin of victory will be among the narrowest in history . Since 1916 , seven Presidents have won a second term , and all of them exceeded the percentage of the popular vote that they received in their first election . With each re\u00eblection since Nixon \u2019 s , the President \u2019 s margin of victory over his opponent has steadily declined . In 1972 , Nixon won another term by a popular-vote margin of twenty-three points . In 1984 , Reagan won his re\u00eblection by eighteen points . In 1996 , Clinton won his by nine points . * In 2004 , Bush beat John Kerry by just 2.5 points , the smallest margin of victory for the re\u00eblection of a President since the nineteenth century . Obama won in 2008 by seven points . If he manages to win this year , it is likely to be by less than that , which would make him the first President in a hundred and twenty-four years to win a second term by a smaller margin than in his initial election . Whatever a mandate is , Obama won \u2019 t have one . IV\nRe\u00eblected Presidents often enjoy a brief respite after their second campaign . The new Congress isn \u2019 t sworn in until January , and the interregnum is used to hire new members of the Administration and plot out a fifth-year agenda . But the aftermath of the 2012 election will be unlike any other transition in memory . Election Day is November 6th . Fifty-five days later , on New Year \u2019 s Eve , the size and the scope of the federal government are scheduled to be radically altered . Federal tax rates for every income group will shoot up to levels not seen since 2001 . Payroll taxes for employees will jump by two percentage points . Unemployment benefits for some three million Americans will be cut off . The Pentagon will start the new year with a fifty-five-billion-dollar budget cut . The budget allocated to everything from the F.B.I . to the Park Service to meat inspections will be slashed by the same amount . Soon after , federal payments to doctors who treat patients using Medicare , the federal health program for the elderly , will be slashed by about a third . The huge increase in taxes and the precipitate drop in government spending would equal an economic contraction of more than five hundred billion dollars , more than three per cent of G.D.P . The impact could send a fragile economy back into a recession . \u201c It \u2019 s two to three times bigger in negative terms than even the biggest year of the stimulus was in positive terms , \u201d Austan Goolsbee , Obama \u2019 s former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , said . It is this frightening confluence of fiscal time bombs , starting on December 31 , 2012 , that has earned the name Taxmageddon . What \u2019 s more , sometime in mid-February the government will reach the limit of its authority to borrow money . If Congress doesn \u2019 t raise the debt ceiling , the United States will default on its loans and will no longer be able to pay all its bills\u2014to doctors , defense contractors , Social Security pensioners , Chinese bondholders , and almost anyone else who receives funds from the federal government . Although the Presidential campaign seems to be dominated by absurd minutiae , such as Romney \u2019 s and Obama \u2019 s respective treatment of canines and Donald Trump \u2019 s theories about the President \u2019 s ancestry , at some point this year the debate will focus on the looming fiscal crash . When that happens , the election may end up being a referendum on what to do about it . Obama will need to beat back Romney \u2019 s charges that he \u2019 s a hapless economic steward , and somehow make the case\u2014unpopular thus far\u2014that the economy \u2019 s woes are best treated by raising taxes and spending . Yet , in a quirk of history , a re\u00eblected Obama could suddenly find his best historical opportunity thrust upon him . Here the arc of Obama \u2019 s Presidency begins to resemble that of Bill Clinton \u2019 s . Both pursued bold domestic agendas in their first two years before Republicans made large midterm gains in Congress , which led to repeated clashes over fiscal issues . The outcomes of Clinton \u2019 s battles , including the government shutdown of 1995 , weren \u2019 t sorted out until after the 1996 Presidential election . An Obama Administration official told me , \u201c The first year of Clinton \u2019 s second term was the resolution of the climactic moments of his third year . I suspect a similar opportunity will open up here. \u201d Clinton \u2019 s re\u00eblection victory made possible a breakthrough on the budgetary issues that had divided him and Republicans for two years . \u201c The ideal conditions for both sides to come together and get something done are when you have a President who is at the peak of his power but is not going to benefit politically from it , \u201d the official said . Solving Taxmageddon would be a major policy achievement , and Obama could argue that he had fulfilled his promise from the 2008 campaign : that he would bring the two major parties together to forge bipartisan agreements . Last year , though , offered a painful reminder of how simplistic that campaign theme was . By the end of 2011 , five groups of bipartisan leaders had tried to negotiate a settlement on all the major tax , entitlement , spending , and deficit issues . Each one failed . First there was the Simpson-Bowles commission , created by the White House . Its report appeared in December , 2010 , with a tough series of proposals of exactly the kind that Obama had asked for . But , as it turned out , the President was not about to trim Social Security benefits and end popular tax deductions without Republicans in Congress agreeing to do the same . \u201c Can I call you back ? I \u2019 m creating happy memories of my childhood for my father. \u201d In May , 2011 , shortly after a government shutdown was averted , Vice-President Joseph Biden and the House Majority Leader , Eric Cantor , two politicians opposed in ideology and temperament , held talks exploring whether a deficit deal was possible . This time , they had a major incentive to reach an agreement : the debt ceiling had to be raised by the end of the summer . The Cantor-Biden talks ended two months later , and Obama and Speaker John Boehner worked until July to reach a \u201c grand bargain \u201d of modest tax hikes , entitlement reforms , and spending cuts . A fourth group , consisting of three Republicans and three Democrats in the Senate , dubbed the Gang of Six , ended up torpedoing the Obama-Boehner negotiations when it came to light that they were negotiating a plan to raise far more revenue than the deal that Obama was ready to strike with Boehner . Instead of a grand bargain , in late July the White House and Republicans agreed to raise the debt ceiling enough for about eighteen more months of government borrowing , and they created yet another bipartisan group to address the long-term fiscal issues . This group was called the Super Committee , and Obama and Congress agreed : if the committee could not find a solution , government spending in 2013 would automatically be reduced by a hundred and ten billion dollars , a cut known in Washington budgetese as \u201c the sequester. \u201d The Super Committee failed . If Obama wins , his immediate task will be to settle more than a decade \u2019 s worth of deferred arguments about how big the government should be and who should pay for it . By this spring , the gamesmanship had begun . \u201c It \u2019 s a discouraging day to talk to me , \u201d a top White House official fumed . That afternoon , May 15th , Boehner had delivered a speech in which he insisted that Republicans would not raise the debt ceiling next year unless a dollar in government spending was cut for every dollar of new borrowing . \u201c I just can \u2019 t believe somebody , even him , would say something that irresponsible again , \u201d the official said . Notwithstanding Boehner \u2019 s antics , there is a possibility that a second Obama term could begin with major deficit reduction and serious reform of taxes and entitlements . A similar opportunity arose in the second terms of Reagan ( who in 1986 signed into law a historic tax-reform bill ) and Clinton ( who in 1997 reached a significant budget deal with Republicans ) . Although both victories occurred when the two parties were less polarized , many White House officials regard the successes as encouraging precedents . Several senior Clinton officials involved in the 1997 deal now work for Obama , including Jacob Lew , Obama \u2019 s chief of staff , and Gene Sperling , the head of the National Economic Council . \u201c You have a dynamic that is similar to the nineteen-nineties , \u201d one White House official said . \u201c There are a number of areas where a Republican Congress and a Democratic Administration sat down , couldn \u2019 t get an agreement , and eventually said , \u2018 No , we \u2019 re going to have to take this to the country . We \u2019 ll see how the country resolves that. \u2019 \u201d He added , \u201c Who knows what the new landscape will be ? It really depends on who controls Congress . \u201d\nAlmost every permutation of government control is possible after November . There are plausible scenarios in which either party could be in charge of the House , the Senate , or the White House . If the election were held today , the Democrats likely would gain some seats in the House and lose some seats in the Senate , and Obama would be narrowly re\u00eblected . Under these conditions , the White House is cautiously optimistic that a compromise could be reached . \u201c If both chambers are more evenly divided , it could be a recipe for actually getting some things done , \u201d David Plouffe , Obama \u2019 s senior adviser , said . \u201c Because of the closeness , neither party \u2019 s going to be able to do anything on its own , so either zero gets done for two years or there is kind of a center. \u201d He argued that , despite the failures of the five bipartisan groups that had tried to negotiate a budget deal last year , there was movement on the toughest issues . For Democrats , the most painful decision is how far to go in making changes to entitlements like Medicare and Social Security . For Republicans , the biggest hurdle is agreeing to higher government revenues . \u201c By the end , more Republicans said they \u2019 re open to revenue than at the beginning , \u201d Plouffe said . \u201c And at the beginning Democrats were very cool to any entitlement reform . By the end , they were willing to do something . That \u2019 s what we learned. \u201d Clearly that \u2019 s an optimistic spin , given Boehner \u2019 s recent remarks . Yet Plouffe and other Obama officials who were involved in the talks insist that the G.O.P . caucus in the House is not as monolithically opposed to a deal as one might think . Last year \u2019 s talks taught the White House that there are divisions between the hard-right Tea Party faction that is unilaterally opposed to any tax hikes and more traditional Republicans who are so concerned about the long-term deficit that under some circumstances they would vote for higher taxes . Plouffe said that the key will be whether Boehner is prepared to alienate the Tea Party bloc . \u201c All the paperwork \u2019 s done ! \u201d he said . \u201c We know what the options are . It \u2019 s all been done ! It \u2019 s not like they \u2019 re starting from scratch. \u201d Over in the Senate , there is a hint that the ice could thaw if Obama wins . Several senators from both parties have begun to meet behind closed doors to address the looming fiscal crisis , with the aim of delivering a tax-and-budget package by September . \u201c Everyone is kind of holding their cards , because we realize that it \u2019 s not game time yet , \u201d the Tennessee Republican Bob Corker told Politico last week . In late May , Mitch McConnell , an architect of the G.O.P . strategy of non-co\u00f6peration since 2009 , also told Politico , \u201c I think we have plenty of members in the Senate on both sides of the aisle who fully understand that we weren \u2019 t sent here just to make a point\u2014that we were sent here to make a difference. \u201d Several White House officials I talked to made it clear that if a deal , or at least the framework for a deal , is not reached before December 31st Obama would allow all the Bush tax cuts to expire\u2014a tactic that would achieve huge deficit reduction , but in a particularly painful and ill-conceived fashion . The Administration is preparing for that outcome , and Republicans may not be willing to budge without the threat of this cataclysm . Plouffe said , \u201c I think we \u2019 re going to have the ability to tell the American people , \u2018 Hey , your taxes may go up on January 1st because these guys refuse to ask the wealthy to do anything . Hey , there are going to be cuts in spending that aren \u2019 t done as smartly as they could because these guys won \u2019 t agree to ask anything from the wealthy. \u2019 \u201d The White House believes that Obama needs to change the psychology of the congressional Republicans and that , if his re\u00eblection won \u2019 t do it , perhaps Taxmageddon will . \u201c To get anything done in the second term , \u201d another White House official said , \u201c the President has to convince the Republican Party that obstructionism is a losing strategy. \u201d * * * * V -=-=-=- Increasingly , hints of Obama \u2019 s second-term vision are becoming evident on the campaign trail . On June 1st , Obama spoke before a luncheon crowd at a farm-to-table restaurant in a converted warehouse in the North Loop of Minneapolis , just yards from the Mississippi River . The restaurant , the Bachelor Farmer , is owned by two sons of the Minnesota governor , Mark Dayton . They had designed a special menu , which highlighted fresh produce grown on the restaurant \u2019 s roof , and the staff wore matching ties made to commemorate the President \u2019 s visit . A hundred people who each gave five thousand dollars to the President \u2019 s campaign dined on a salad of house-smoked pork and a choice of roasted chicken or Copper River sockeye salmon ( a vegetarian menu was also available ) , as Obama spoke about the politics of his potential second term . He noted , as he does with some frequency these days , that his original vision of a bipartisan Washington was a mirage . \u201c My hope , when I came into office , was that we would have Republicans and Democrats coming together because the nation was facing extraordinary challenges , \u201d he said . \u201c It turns out that wasn \u2019 t their approach\u2014to put it mildly. \u201d He insisted that the G.O.P . had moved too far to the right to make bipartisanship possible . He and John McCain had agreed on issues like immigration , climate change , and campaign finance . \u201c The center of gravity for their party has shifted. \u201d \u201c If you have any mental-health issues you \u2019 d like to discuss , now would be a good time. \u201d But maybe , Obama said , his re\u00eblection would halt that trend . \u201c I believe that if we \u2019 re successful in this election\u2014when we \u2019 re successful in this election\u2014that the fever may break , \u201d he said , \u201c because there \u2019 s a tradition in the Republican Party of more common sense than that. \u201d He noted a few areas of possible compromise : deficit reduction , a highway bill , immigration , and energy policy . He repeated the phrase that is becoming a mantra for his campaign : \u201c If we can break this fever. \u201d If President Obama can indeed guide the parties toward an agreement that puts the federal government on a sustainable fiscal path , it would be a substantial achievement and would vindicate his early promise as a bipartisan leader . After that , he might have just one more chance to achieve a major domestic accomplishment before the next round of elections , in 2014 . Gene Sperling noted that first-time Presidents are quickly confronted by the reality of whatever situation they \u2019 ve inherited . \u201c President Clinton used to say to us , \u2018 Look , this is what every Presidency is like\u2014you come in with your agenda and vision , and the fact is , whether you want it or not , ultimately a lot of the legacy for Presidents is how they handle the hand they were dealt as opposed to what they might have thought their agenda was going to be , \u2019 \u201d Sperling said . \u201c To me , in many ways , health care was President Obama making a decision that he was going to hold on to part of the vision that he had set for the country. \u201d A second term , Sperling continued , could put Obama \u201c back to where he might have wanted to have started his Presidency. \u201d The big question that Obama will face is : \u201c What are the things we \u2019 re doing to make ourselves compete so that globalization is working for the middle class , as opposed to what happened the previous decade ? \u201d The President \u2019 s list of options will be short . Obama has been a national politician since 2004 , and the priorities he \u2019 s discussed haven \u2019 t changed much since then . Depending on the makeup of Congress , he might first have to consider whether he needs to play offense or defense . If the President gets past the grand bargain , \u201c it would be a legacy achievement , \u201d Goolsbee , who has known Obama since 2004 , said . \u201c Then he would have to decide : Is the next issue protecting and establishing the health plan , or moving on to something new ? Because it seems clear that the President \u2019 s opponents are going to try to take apart the law. \u201d There are hints that the Supreme Court could simply strike down the Affordable Care Act . It also might strike down the health-care mandate but leave the remainder of the law intact . In that case , it is likely that several provisions regulating insurance markets would send insurance premiums soaring . Insurance companies would be forced to take on expensive new patients regardless of pre\u00ebxisting conditions , yet without the anticipated new revenue from young and less expensive patients who would have been forced to buy insurance . Obama would face a choice : replace the mandate with a new policy or remove the remaining market reforms . One option for replacing the mandate is to push the uninsured into the new system by requiring them to sign up for insurance when applying for other government services , such as food stamps or school loans . But the prospects for this sort of legislation are bleak . \u201c We looked at this , \u201d a former Obama aide said . \u201c We thought it was less constitutional than the mandate . Among the moderate Democrats , the idea that you would pass a bill like this is unimaginable. \u201d Whether the Supreme Court overturns the law in part or in full , the White House will need to respond publicly . \u201c The strategy is to just go on the offensive and say , \u2018 Look at Citizens United , look at the health-care decision , look at Bush v. Gore , \u201d the former aide said . \u201c We have an out-of-control activist court , and Romney will make it worse . That \u2019 s Plan A . Plan B is nothing. \u201d Even if the Court leaves the law alone , Obama may find himself fighting Republican attempts to defund it or to remove the mandate legislatively . If the House is still in Republican hands , even if he were to successfully navigate Taxmageddon he could easily find himself back in a situation like 2011 and 2012 , when almost no bills moved forward .\nBut it seems plausible that Obama could have time for one more big policy change . What would it be ? Several of his advisers talked about pursuing housing reform ; the economy is still being dragged down by the seven hundred billion dollars in negative equity from homeowners who are stuck in houses worth less than their mortgages . The problem has bedevilled the White House since 2009 , because any of the truly effective solutions requires a version of the awful politics of a bailout : people or institutions that acted irresponsibly will be rewarded . \u201c Somebody has to eat the seven hundred billion dollars , \u201d Goolsbee said . \u201c There \u2019 s no way to cover up the fact . Either the banks and mortgage holders have to take seven hundred billion dollars of losses or the government has to come up with seven hundred billion dollars of subsidies to cover these costs . Or you can try to split it . But every significant policy that anyone can come up with has a really big price tag. \u201d Another major initiative under discussion is energy policy , but the politics of energy are almost as fraught as those of housing . As a candidate , Obama talked in stirring terms about the threat from global warming . In June , 2008 , on the night he won the Democratic nomination , he declared that his victory marked \u201c the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal. \u201d But climate change will remain a divisive issue after the election . Among Obama \u2019 s conservative critics , his call to halt the rise of the oceans is a frequently mocked piece of oratory . And one of the biggest failures of his first term was the Administration \u2019 s inability to win a deal on cap and trade\u2014originally a Republican idea . Obama talks about energy in most of his speeches , but , in contrast with 2009 , when the centerpiece of his program was a cap-and-trade approach to reducing carbon emissions , his goal today is unclear . Early discussions on Capitol Hill suggest that , in a wide-ranging deal , a carbon tax might be part of a grand bargain to settle Taxmageddon . The proposition is not as absurd as it sounds . In 1997 , the budget deal struck by Clinton and the Republicans was not so much a meeting in the middle as a swap of major priorities . \u201c That was a deal of trades , \u201d one former Clinton official said . Clinton won policies such as a new children \u2019 s-health program , a higher-education tax cut , and some progressive changes to the welfare bill that he signed into law in 1996 . \u201c We won those things and then we just gave the Republicans big Medicare savings , and we let them cut the capital-gains tax for rich people. \u201d Obama \u2019 s 2010 fiscal deal with the G.O.P . was similar : he swapped an extension of all the Bush tax cuts for more stimulus . In a situation where many favored policies of both parties are on the table , a carbon tax\u2014a heretical idea during the past few years , given the weak economy and high fuel prices\u2014could be resurrected . Still , the Administration seems uncertain what its energy policy is ; many of the stated goals are contradictory . Independence ? Low energy prices ? Reduction of carbon emissions ? Job creation ? Environmental protection ? Unless Obama \u2019 s energy policy regains its clarity , a legislative breakthrough in a second term is unlikely . Several White House officials said that the issue that Obama seems most passionate about is infrastructure . ( One insider Democrat joked that Obama \u2019 s passion for infrastructure is matched only by that of the Vice-President , who loves trains . ) Obama wants to spend an extra hundred and fifty billion dollars on infrastructure during the next six years and reform the process by which projects are awarded , so that it \u2019 s more about merit than about patronage . In 2009 , he was aggravated when he was told that none of the money from the stimulus would be spent on a signature project , a modern-day Hoover Dam or Interstate Highway System . A bold infrastructure package has all the hallmarks of a major Obama policy : it would create jobs , it has a government-reform component , and it could establish a legacy in the form of an upgraded power grid or a high-speed train , with which Obama might forever be associated . \u201c I know it \u2019 s the right thing to do , but if we call the cops this sandbox will be tied up for weeks. \u201d But if , as seems likely , Obama will have just one chance of achieving a major piece of domestic legislation in his second term , the most promising focus , according to current and former aides , would be on immigration . \u201c When you look at the whole second term , the biggest issue I think is fiscal soundness , which is the predicate for real economic improvement and growth , \u201d Bill Daley , Obama \u2019 s former chief of staff , said . \u201c And then the second big issue I see would be immigration reform. \u201d The DREAM Act , which would legalize undocumented aliens who had come to America as children if they enrolled in college or joined the U.S. military , would be an obvious place to start . Obama \u2019 s advisers believe that the politics of immigration may be the only chance for bipartisanship after Taxmageddon . After a party loses , it goes through a period of self-examination . If , despite the lacklustre economy and a general dissatisfaction with the direction of the country , Obama manages to defeat Mitt Romney , the explanation may be a simple matter of demographics : the Republican Party can no longer win the Presidency without increased support from nonwhite voters . \u201c If we win , Latino voters will play a big role in that , \u201d David Plouffe said . \u201c The Republican Party is going to have to make a decision . I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s much of a decision , actually . They \u2019 re going to have to moderate. \u201d The White House is so convinced of the centrality of Hispanics to the current election and its aftermath that Plouffe told me he has been preparing for months for an onslaught of advertisements from a pro-Romney group attacking Obama from the left on immigration , arguing that Obama \u2019 s deportation and border-security policies have been too Draconian . One of the lessons from \u201c Mandate Politics \u201d is that the magnitude of a victory is not as important as defying expectations . Republicans won \u2019 t co\u00f6perate with Obama simply because he \u2019 s won , just as Bush \u2019 s 2004 re\u00eblection did nothing to move Democrats . But if the 2012 results reveal that the G.O.P. \u2019 s weakness among minority voters , especially Hispanics , is dire , political opportunities that seem unlikely today could quickly become conventional wisdom after November . Romney understands this . \u201c We have to get Hispanic voters to vote for our party , \u201d he recently said at a private fund-raiser , unaware that reporters could hear him . Failure to do so \u201c spells doom for us , \u201d Romney said . A rule that holds up quite well in American politics is that the longer a party remains out of power the more moderate it becomes . VI\nOn a recent Friday at the White House , Plouffe stood in front of a map of America , talking about swing states . In some elections , he said , two candidates may try to hide their differences as they woo moderate voters . But this year the Obama campaign would insure that the competing ideologies of the two major parties are not blurred . \u201c Everything we do has to be with that in mind , \u201d Plouffe said . He named some recent examples . In 1992 , Clinton and Bush agreed on certain aspects of free trade and welfare reform . In 2000 , Bush ran on a more progressive education platform than his Republican colleagues . McCain once supported a cap-and-trade system and a version of immigration reform now condemned by almost all Republicans . There would be no such \u201c zones of commonality \u201d this time around . \u201c On every major issue , every one , there are stark differences , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s much more ideological. \u201d * * * * This tone is a sharp change . Obama campaigned from 2004 through 2010 as a bridge between competing orthodoxies\u2014a view of the world that flowed directly from his unique biography . In \u201c Barack Obama : The Story , \u201d by David Maraniss , Obama says , \u201c What I retained in my politics is a sense that the only way I could have a sturdy sense of identity of who I was depended on digging beneath the surface differences of people . The only way my life makes sense is if , regardless of culture , race , religion , tribe , there is this commonality . . . and that we can reach out beyond our differences. \u201d Now Obama is emphasizing the ideological divide , not the bridge across it . \u201c A lot of the tussles that we \u2019 ve had over the last three and a half years have had to do with this difference in vision , \u201d he told the audience in Minneapolis , \u201c and it will be coming to a head in this election. \u201d Much of the talk of bold contrasts is a strategic necessity . Obama wants voters to cast their ballots based on the platforms of the two candidates , not on the record of his first term . The tactic comes with risks , but it helps divert attention from a seeming inability to promote his successes thus far , such as health care ( so long as it lasts ) , financial regulation , and a soft landing after the economic crisis . Never mind that this strategy defies the judgment of most academic studies of voting behavior : that voters largely decide on incumbents based on a retrospective judgment of the economic situation during the last year or so in office . As he spoke , Plouffe , a math whiz who has been compared to Dustin Hoffman \u2019 s character in \u201c Rain Man , \u201d sometimes wrote down the numbers as he spoke them : two hundred and forty-one , the number of Republicans in the House of Representatives last year when he was negotiating with them ; 11/6 , the date of the election . He had no illusions that 2012 would look like 2008 , and pointed to the tiny group of states that would decide the contest . \u201c We \u2019 ve been preparing all along for a kind of race where we have to win it fifty to forty-nine in seven states , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 re facing , Grind it out in Virginia and Colorado and Ohio. \u201d It took considerable arm-twisting to get Plouffe to think past the details of the daily campaign and consider the long view . \u201c If we win , \u201d he said finally , \u201c January of 2017 , what do we want to look back and be able to say ? One , we \u2019 ve recovered from the recession . Second , our economic and tax policies in this country are more centered on the middle class and on people trying to get in the middle class . Third , the big unmet challenges\u2014health care , education reform , energy , immigration , and reducing the deficit in the right way\u2014we met them . \u201c We \u2019 ve also ended a period of war while taking out our leading terrorist enemies , \u201d he added . \u201c Think about that ! That \u2019 s a pretty important book of business , and I think that \u2019 s the legacy he \u2019 d like to leave. \u201d VII",
    "content_original": "In November, 1984, President Ronald Reagan was re\u00eblected in a landslide victory over Walter Mondale, taking forty-nine states and fifty-nine per cent of the popular vote. The Reagan revolution was powerfully reaffirmed. Soon after, Donald Regan, the new chief of staff, sent word to a small group of trusted friends and Administration officials seeking advice on how Reagan should approach his last four years in office. It was an unusual moment in the history of the Presidency, and the experience of recent incumbents offered no guidance. No President since Dwight D. Eisenhower had served two full terms. John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Lyndon Johnson, overwhelmed by the war in Vietnam, had declined to run for re\u00eblection in 1968. Richard Nixon resigned less than seventeen months into his second term. Gerald Ford (who was never elected) and Jimmy Carter were defeated. By the nineteen-eighties, it had become popular to talk about the crisis of the Presidency; a bipartisan group of Washington leaders, with Carter\u2019s support, launched the National Committee for a Single Six-Year Presidential Term. Regan\u2019s effort to foresee a successful second term is documented in a series of memos at the Reagan Library. President Obama, who in November could face one of the tightest bids for re\u00eblection in history, has periodically spoken of his admiration for Reagan. \u201cRonald Reagan changed the trajectory for America,\u201d he told a Reno, Nevada, newspaper in early 2008. \u201cHe just tapped into what people were already feeling, which was we want clarity, we want optimism.\u201d From the inception of his Presidential bid, Obama has sought to present himself as a leader with far-reaching ideas, and has prided himself on his ability to look past the politics of the moment. To the degree that he is able to ponder his strategy for the next four years, it\u2019s natural to think he might steal a glance at the Reagan playbook. Responding to Regan\u2019s confidential memo, Tom Korologos, an adviser to every Republican President from Nixon to George W. Bush, told the Reagan White House that the second term should be viewed from the standpoint of the President\u2019s intended legacy. \u201cIt seems to me that the President needs to decide what his legacy is going to be,\u201d Korologos wrote on January 24, 1985, a few days after Reagan\u2019s second inaugural. \u201cWhat is he going to be the most proud of when he\u2019s sitting at the ranch with Nancy four and five years after his Presidency? Is it going to be an arms control agreement? Is it going to be a balanced budget? Is it going to be world-wide economic recovery? Is it going to be a combination of all of this: peace and prosperity? . . . Every speech; every appearance; every foreign trip; every congressional phone call and every act involving the President should be made with the long-range goal in mind.\u201d Every President running for re\u00eblection begins to think about his second term well before victory is assured. In early 2009, Rahm Emanuel, Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, told me that the White House was already contemplating the Presidency in terms of eight years. He said that it was folly to try to accomplish everything in the first term. \u201cI don\u2019t buy into everybody\u2019s theory about the final years of a Presidency,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThere\u2019s an accepted wisdom that in the final years you\u2019re kind of done. Ronald Reagan, in the final years, got arms control, immigration reform, and created a separate new department,\u201d that of Veterans Affairs. Obama\u2019s campaign is well aware that he may end up like Jimmy Carter or George H. W. Bush, the two most recent one-term Presidents, who were both defeated despite some notable\u2014even historic\u2014accomplishments, including the Camp David Accords, under Carter, and the Gulf War, under Bush. The country remains closely divided, and the economy is teetering again. After several months of relatively positive news, the employment report released in June was gloomy. Barring a disastrous revelation or blunder, Mitt Romney will be a more formidable opponent than many assumed during his rightward lurch to secure the Republican nomination. Many White House officials were reluctant to discuss a second term; they are focussed more on the campaign than on what comes after. But the ostensible purpose of a political campaign is to articulate for the public what a candidate will do if he prevails. \u201cIt\u2019s a tension,\u201d David Axelrod, Obama\u2019s longtime political adviser, said. \u201cOn the one hand, you don\u2019t want to be presumptuous in assuming a second term. But campaigns are about the future, and there is an imperative to spell out where we\u2019re going.\u201d Obama has an ambitious second-term agenda, which, at least in broad ways, his campaign is beginning to highlight. The President has said that the most important policy he could address in his second term is climate change, one of the few issues that he thinks could fundamentally improve the world decades from now. He also is concerned with containing nuclear proliferation. In April, 2009, in one of the most notable speeches of his Presidency, he said, in Prague, \u201cI state clearly and with conviction America\u2019s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.\u201d He conceded that the goal might not be achieved in his lifetime but promised to take \u201cconcrete steps,\u201d including a new treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons and ratification of the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. In 2010, Obama negotiated a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Russians and won its passage in the Senate. But, despite his promise to \u201cimmediately and aggressively\u201d ratify the C.N.T.B.T., he never submitted it for ratification. As James Mann writes in \u201cThe Obamians,\u201d his forthcoming book on Obama\u2019s foreign policy, \u201cThe Obama administration crouched, unwilling to risk controversy and a Senate fight for a cause that the President, in his Prague speech, had endorsed and had promised to push quickly and vigorously.\u201d As with climate change, Obama\u2019s early rhetoric and idealism met the reality of Washington politics and his reluctance to confront Congress. Obama\u2019s advisers say it is more likely that the President would champion an issue with greater bipartisan support, such as immigration reform. Obama has also said that he hopes to have the time and the attention to address a more robust aid agenda for developing countries than he was able to muster in his first term. These issues will loom over his potential second term, awaiting a push from the President. So, too, will the lingering question of who Obama \u201creally\u201d is: an aspiring compromiser, a lawyerly strategist, or a bold visionary willing to gamble to secure his legacy. Whatever goal Obama decides on, his opportunities for effecting change are slight. Term limits are cruel to Presidents. If he wins, Obama will have less than eighteen months to pass a second wave of his domestic agenda, which has been stalled since late 2010 and has no chance of moving this year. His best opportunity for a breakthrough on energy policy, immigration, or tax reform would come in 2013. By the middle of 2014, congressional elections will force another hiatus in Washington policymaking. Since Franklin Roosevelt, Presidents have lost an average of thirty House seats and seven Senate seats in their second midterm election. By early 2015, the press will begin to focus on the next Presidential campaign, which will eclipse a great deal of coverage of the White House. The last two years of Obama\u2019s Presidency will likely be spent attending more assiduously to foreign policy and shoring up the major reforms of his early years, such as health care and financial regulation. As William Daley, who served for a year as Obama\u2019s chief of staff, put it, \u201cAfter 2014, nobody cares what he does.\u201d II \u201cDoes this make me think I look good?\u201d\n\nSooner or later, every re\u00eblected President confronts the frustration lurking in a second term: re\u00eblection to power does not necessarily grant more of it. Richard Nixon and his aides were obsessed with using a second term to take command of a federal government that they believed was hostile to the President and his agenda. \u201cFaced with a bureaucracy we did not control, was not staffed with our people, and with which we did not know how to communicate, we created our own bureaucracy,\u201d White House aides wrote in a 1972 memo found in the files of H. R. Haldeman, who later went to prison for covering up Watergate crimes. Nixon gave his aides detailed directions about how to flush unsympathetic bureaucrats from the government after he won re\u00eblection. Early in the 1972 campaign, he wrote his aides with instructions for a \u201chousecleaning\u201d at the C.I.A.: I want a study made immediately as to how many people in CIA could be removed by presidential action. . . . Of course, the reduction in force should be accomplished solely on the ground of its being necessary for budget reasons, but you will both know the real reason. . . . I want you to quit recruiting from any of the Ivy League schools or any other universities where either the university president or the university faculties have taken action condemning our efforts to bring the war in Vietnam to an end. Nixon\u2019s paranoid theory was that none of his second-term priorities\u2014from his China policy to his health-care plan\u2014could be addressed until the White House controlled the rest of his government. The housecleaning efforts were not technically a part of Watergate, but they were a harbinger of his second-term self-immolation. The Reagan Administration quickly grasped that whatever power it had gained through re\u00eblection had to be spent judiciously. As part of Regan\u2019s brainstorming exercise about the President\u2019s second term, Alfred Kingon, then the Assistant Treasury Secretary, urged the President to choose his top priorities with care. The best that Reagan could hope for was victory on a few big initiatives. \u201cPlease remember that there are about 50 or 60 issues going at once,\u201d Kingon wrote. \u201cWe can only keep track of 20 or 25, concentrate on a mere handful and hope to have legislative success in a fraction of that.\u201d James Baker, Reagan\u2019s chief of staff preceding Regan, wrote to the President after the election and made a similar point. \u201cUnlike the campaign in 1980, you have campaigned with little specificity,\u201d he told the President. (Reagan\u2019s \u201cMorning in America\u201d theme had not been burdened with detailed policy proposals.) \u201cThere are very many items that any right-thinking president would want to achieve,\u201d Baker wrote. \u201cBut frankly, there are too many. You must set priorities.\u201d A key challenge for a second-term President lies in managing the delicate balance between what he wants (his priorities) and what he thinks the public wants (his perceived mandate)\u2014and taking care not to confuse the two. George W. Bush was less adept at this than Reagan. Bush approached his second term with two broad goals. In foreign policy, he attempted to steer his White House away from the radicalism of the first four years. During the 2004 campaign, Bush came close to jettisoning the two people\u2014Vice-President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld\u2014most associated with extreme views of how to handle post-9/11 foreign affairs. After the election, Cheney saw the influence of his principal ideological opponents\u2014Stephen Hadley, the new national-security adviser, and Condoleezza Rice, the new Secretary of State\u2014rise, especially on issues such as Syria, North Korea, and the Administration\u2019s policy on torture. Cheney\u2019s recent memoir boils with his indignation at being sidelined. At a National Security Council meeting in 2007, Cheney made the case for bombing a Syrian nuclear reactor. \u201cAfter I finished,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe President asked, \u2018Does anyone here agree with the Vice President?\u2019 Not a single hand went up around the room.\u201d Domestically, however, Bush miscalculated his position. Early in his second term, he made a strong play for Social Security reform; it failed miserably, for lack of Democratic backing. \u201cIf I had it to do over again, I would have pushed for immigration reform, rather than Social Security, as the first major initiative of my second term,\u201d Bush lamented in his memoir. \u201cUnlike Social Security, immigration reform had bipartisan support.\u201d In 2005, Bush won approval of an energy bill, a trade agreement, and a bankruptcy-reform bill. But the remainder of his Presidency was consumed by scandal (the Valerie Plame case, the N.S.A.\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program, the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys for political reasons) and by badly managed catastrophes (Katrina, deterioration in Iraq, the crash of financial markets). The Democrats took over Congress in 2006, and on Election Day in 2008 Bush\u2019s Gallup approval rating stood at twenty-five per cent.\n\nThere is an argument, common on the right, that if Obama is re\u00eblected he will pursue a more ideological, even radical, agenda because he will be unbound by the moderating influence of another election. As Dick Morris, of Fox News, put it in March, \u201cA second term for Obama would bring on a socialist nightmare hellscape as he moves further to the left.\u201d This argument is often bolstered by noting that Obama recently told the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, that he would have \u201cmore flexibility\u201d to pursue negotiations on missile defense \u201cafter my election.\u201d Ed Morrissey, of the conservative blog Hot Air, warned that the comment should cause voters \u201cto fear an Obama second term.\u201d But a President who has won re\u00eblection can also feel less tied to his political base and more free to shift toward the political center. At the start of Reagan\u2019s second term, Kingon advised the White House that the victory had allowed him to pursue policies that would advance only with bipartisan support\u2014a precondition for success, given that Democrats controlled the House. Kingon noted that only twenty per cent of Americans agreed with Reagan\u2019s anti-abortion policy and that many Americans voted for Reagan \u201cknowing that he believes in these things but understanding that he would not push for them.\u201d He argued that this was the implicit promise of the Reagan re\u00eblection campaign. Aggressively pursuing social issues, Kingon wrote, would substantially diminish the President\u2019s political support, and would risk failure in other key areas. \u201cI think it is important to remember that there is a point beyond which popular Presidential support erodes, and he can do nothing, e.g., Jimmy Carter,\u201d Kingon warned. Reagan largely heeded this advice, and he had one of the most successful second terms in American history. He passed immigration reform, a major reform of the tax code, and an arms-control treaty with the Soviets. He also appointed two conservative Supreme Court Justices, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. He ended his Presidency with an approval rating of more than fifty-five per cent. Obama entered office with what many considered a mandate. Taking advantage of large majorities in Congress, he spent the first two years passing major Democratic legislation: financial regulation and health-care reform. But the second two years were devoted to managing the gridlock created by the backlash against the first two, with a resurgent Republican Party intent on Obama\u2019s defeat. Axelrod told me that Obama has learned from recent history. \u201cPresident Bush claimed a mandate after the last election and took steps that he never ran on,\u201d Axelrod said, pointing to Bush\u2019s miscalculation on Social Security. \u201cYou have to govern boldly, but with the humility of knowing that you can\u2019t assume that people embrace your case\u2014you have to make it, even after the election. The thing that trips you up, and certainly tripped up Bush, is the assumption that, if you win, somehow you can then embark on an agenda that is wholly different from the one you campaigned on.\u201d If Obama aims to leave a legislative mark in his second term, he\u2019ll need two things: a sense of humility, and a revitalized faction of Republican lawmakers willing to make deals with the President. Given the polarized environment and the likelihood of a closely divided Congress, it seems more implausible to suppose that Obama would turn radical in his second term than that he would cool to his Democratic base. III\n\nAfter every Presidential election, the winner likes to declare why he won, often in terms that set the tone for the following year. \u201cI earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it,\u201d Bush said at his first post-election press conference on November 4, 2004. Cheney went further: \u201cPresident Bush ran forthrightly on a clear agenda for this nation\u2019s future. And the nation responded by giving him a mandate.\u201d But, as his defeat on Social Security soon made clear, Bush had no mandate. \u201cYou are organized!\u201d The idea of a mandate from the people defies the intentions of the Founders and is contrary to the way that most early Presidents viewed their role, according to Robert Dahl, the Yale political scientist. Early Presidents argued on behalf of their policies with appeals to the Constitution rather than to the people. Even Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, who asked for sweeping new executive powers, did so with strictly constitutional arguments rather than with populist ones. The concept of a mandate was essentially invented by Andrew Jackson, who first popularized the notion that the President \u201cis the direct representative of the American people,\u201d and it was later institutionalized by Woodrow Wilson, who explicitly wanted the American government to be like the more responsive parliamentary system of the United Kingdom. Like Jackson, he argued that the President was the \u201cone national voice in the country.\u201d Every President since Wilson has at least implicitly adopted this theory, and the Presidential mandate has become enshrined in our national politics. But the idea is mostly a myth. The President and Congress are equal, and when Presidents misinterpret election results\u2014especially in re\u00eblections\u2014they get into trouble. In a 2006 book, \u201cMandate Politics,\u201d the political scientists Lawrence J. Grossback, David A. M. Peterson, and James A. Stimson apply some fancy methodological techniques to congressional voting patterns and find only two modern cases in which Presidents had true mandates, which they define as elections that push members of the opposition party in Congress toward the President\u2019s positions on key issues. This occurred in 1965, when Johnson passed the Voting Rights Act, and in early 1981, when sixty-three Democrats helped Reagan pass his first budget in the House. The media interpreted those elections as representing tectonic changes in politics, and members of Congress followed along. The changes in congressional behavior didn\u2019t last long, but they enabled both Presidents to achieve major legislative victories in their first year. **** But in 1965 and 1981 the two parties were still ideologically mixed. Liberal Northern Republicans voted with Johnson, and Reagan, even though the Democrats controlled the House, could rely on dozens of conservative Democrats to support his agenda. Unlike those periods when some members of Congress feared crossing the President, in 2009 almost all Republicans were willing to bet that Obama\u2019s popularity was temporary. Instead of fearing a new Democratic tide and helping a popular President pass his agenda, almost all Republicans united in opposition, and in 2010 they took over the House and gained seats in the Senate. Obama\u2019s aides speak of a victory in November not in sweeping terms of realignment but simply as an opportunity to nudge Republicans away from a policy of pure obstructionism and toward some limited compromise around a few key issues. \u201cThe hope is that some of the moderate Republicans\u2014if there are any left\u2014are like, \u2018Look, we tried it your way, we lost the election,\u2019 \u201d a senior Obama adviser said. \u201cYou have to compromise in American politics and divided government. But it depends on whether the interpretation, if Obama wins, is that Republicans didn\u2019t co\u00f6perate enough or that they co\u00f6perated too much.\u201d One thing is nearly certain: if Obama wins in November, his margin of victory will be among the narrowest in history. Since 1916, seven Presidents have won a second term, and all of them exceeded the percentage of the popular vote that they received in their first election. With each re\u00eblection since Nixon\u2019s, the President\u2019s margin of victory over his opponent has steadily declined. In 1972, Nixon won another term by a popular-vote margin of twenty-three points. In 1984, Reagan won his re\u00eblection by eighteen points. In 1996, Clinton won his by nine points.* In 2004, Bush beat John Kerry by just 2.5 points, the smallest margin of victory for the re\u00eblection of a President since the nineteenth century. Obama won in 2008 by seven points. If he manages to win this year, it is likely to be by less than that, which would make him the first President in a hundred and twenty-four years to win a second term by a smaller margin than in his initial election. Whatever a mandate is, Obama won\u2019t have one. IV\n\nRe\u00eblected Presidents often enjoy a brief respite after their second campaign. The new Congress isn\u2019t sworn in until January, and the interregnum is used to hire new members of the Administration and plot out a fifth-year agenda. But the aftermath of the 2012 election will be unlike any other transition in memory. Election Day is November 6th. Fifty-five days later, on New Year\u2019s Eve, the size and the scope of the federal government are scheduled to be radically altered. Federal tax rates for every income group will shoot up to levels not seen since 2001. Payroll taxes for employees will jump by two percentage points. Unemployment benefits for some three million Americans will be cut off. The Pentagon will start the new year with a fifty-five-billion-dollar budget cut. The budget allocated to everything from the F.B.I. to the Park Service to meat inspections will be slashed by the same amount. Soon after, federal payments to doctors who treat patients using Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly, will be slashed by about a third. The huge increase in taxes and the precipitate drop in government spending would equal an economic contraction of more than five hundred billion dollars, more than three per cent of G.D.P. The impact could send a fragile economy back into a recession. \u201cIt\u2019s two to three times bigger in negative terms than even the biggest year of the stimulus was in positive terms,\u201d Austan Goolsbee, Obama\u2019s former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said. It is this frightening confluence of fiscal time bombs, starting on December 31, 2012, that has earned the name Taxmageddon. What\u2019s more, sometime in mid-February the government will reach the limit of its authority to borrow money. If Congress doesn\u2019t raise the debt ceiling, the United States will default on its loans and will no longer be able to pay all its bills\u2014to doctors, defense contractors, Social Security pensioners, Chinese bondholders, and almost anyone else who receives funds from the federal government. Although the Presidential campaign seems to be dominated by absurd minutiae, such as Romney\u2019s and Obama\u2019s respective treatment of canines and Donald Trump\u2019s theories about the President\u2019s ancestry, at some point this year the debate will focus on the looming fiscal crash. When that happens, the election may end up being a referendum on what to do about it. Obama will need to beat back Romney\u2019s charges that he\u2019s a hapless economic steward, and somehow make the case\u2014unpopular thus far\u2014that the economy\u2019s woes are best treated by raising taxes and spending. Yet, in a quirk of history, a re\u00eblected Obama could suddenly find his best historical opportunity thrust upon him. Here the arc of Obama\u2019s Presidency begins to resemble that of Bill Clinton\u2019s. Both pursued bold domestic agendas in their first two years before Republicans made large midterm gains in Congress, which led to repeated clashes over fiscal issues. The outcomes of Clinton\u2019s battles, including the government shutdown of 1995, weren\u2019t sorted out until after the 1996 Presidential election. An Obama Administration official told me, \u201cThe first year of Clinton\u2019s second term was the resolution of the climactic moments of his third year. I suspect a similar opportunity will open up here.\u201d Clinton\u2019s re\u00eblection victory made possible a breakthrough on the budgetary issues that had divided him and Republicans for two years. \u201cThe ideal conditions for both sides to come together and get something done are when you have a President who is at the peak of his power but is not going to benefit politically from it,\u201d the official said. Solving Taxmageddon would be a major policy achievement, and Obama could argue that he had fulfilled his promise from the 2008 campaign: that he would bring the two major parties together to forge bipartisan agreements. Last year, though, offered a painful reminder of how simplistic that campaign theme was. By the end of 2011, five groups of bipartisan leaders had tried to negotiate a settlement on all the major tax, entitlement, spending, and deficit issues. Each one failed. First there was the Simpson-Bowles commission, created by the White House. Its report appeared in December, 2010, with a tough series of proposals of exactly the kind that Obama had asked for. But, as it turned out, the President was not about to trim Social Security benefits and end popular tax deductions without Republicans in Congress agreeing to do the same. \u201cCan I call you back? I\u2019m creating happy memories of my childhood for my father.\u201d In May, 2011, shortly after a government shutdown was averted, Vice-President Joseph Biden and the House Majority Leader, Eric Cantor, two politicians opposed in ideology and temperament, held talks exploring whether a deficit deal was possible. This time, they had a major incentive to reach an agreement: the debt ceiling had to be raised by the end of the summer. The Cantor-Biden talks ended two months later, and Obama and Speaker John Boehner worked until July to reach a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d of modest tax hikes, entitlement reforms, and spending cuts. A fourth group, consisting of three Republicans and three Democrats in the Senate, dubbed the Gang of Six, ended up torpedoing the Obama-Boehner negotiations when it came to light that they were negotiating a plan to raise far more revenue than the deal that Obama was ready to strike with Boehner. Instead of a grand bargain, in late July the White House and Republicans agreed to raise the debt ceiling enough for about eighteen more months of government borrowing, and they created yet another bipartisan group to address the long-term fiscal issues. This group was called the Super Committee, and Obama and Congress agreed: if the committee could not find a solution, government spending in 2013 would automatically be reduced by a hundred and ten billion dollars, a cut known in Washington budgetese as \u201cthe sequester.\u201d The Super Committee failed. If Obama wins, his immediate task will be to settle more than a decade\u2019s worth of deferred arguments about how big the government should be and who should pay for it. By this spring, the gamesmanship had begun. \u201cIt\u2019s a discouraging day to talk to me,\u201d a top White House official fumed. That afternoon, May 15th, Boehner had delivered a speech in which he insisted that Republicans would not raise the debt ceiling next year unless a dollar in government spending was cut for every dollar of new borrowing. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe somebody, even him, would say something that irresponsible again,\u201d the official said. Notwithstanding Boehner\u2019s antics, there is a possibility that a second Obama term could begin with major deficit reduction and serious reform of taxes and entitlements. A similar opportunity arose in the second terms of Reagan (who in 1986 signed into law a historic tax-reform bill) and Clinton (who in 1997 reached a significant budget deal with Republicans). Although both victories occurred when the two parties were less polarized, many White House officials regard the successes as encouraging precedents. Several senior Clinton officials involved in the 1997 deal now work for Obama, including Jacob Lew, Obama\u2019s chief of staff, and Gene Sperling, the head of the National Economic Council. \u201cYou have a dynamic that is similar to the nineteen-nineties,\u201d one White House official said. \u201cThere are a number of areas where a Republican Congress and a Democratic Administration sat down, couldn\u2019t get an agreement, and eventually said, \u2018No, we\u2019re going to have to take this to the country. We\u2019ll see how the country resolves that.\u2019 \u201d He added, \u201cWho knows what the new landscape will be? It really depends on who controls Congress.\u201d\n\nAlmost every permutation of government control is possible after November. There are plausible scenarios in which either party could be in charge of the House, the Senate, or the White House. If the election were held today, the Democrats likely would gain some seats in the House and lose some seats in the Senate, and Obama would be narrowly re\u00eblected. Under these conditions, the White House is cautiously optimistic that a compromise could be reached. \u201cIf both chambers are more evenly divided, it could be a recipe for actually getting some things done,\u201d David Plouffe, Obama\u2019s senior adviser, said. \u201cBecause of the closeness, neither party\u2019s going to be able to do anything on its own, so either zero gets done for two years or there is kind of a center.\u201d He argued that, despite the failures of the five bipartisan groups that had tried to negotiate a budget deal last year, there was movement on the toughest issues. For Democrats, the most painful decision is how far to go in making changes to entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. For Republicans, the biggest hurdle is agreeing to higher government revenues. \u201cBy the end, more Republicans said they\u2019re open to revenue than at the beginning,\u201d Plouffe said. \u201cAnd at the beginning Democrats were very cool to any entitlement reform. By the end, they were willing to do something. That\u2019s what we learned.\u201d Clearly that\u2019s an optimistic spin, given Boehner\u2019s recent remarks. Yet Plouffe and other Obama officials who were involved in the talks insist that the G.O.P. caucus in the House is not as monolithically opposed to a deal as one might think. Last year\u2019s talks taught the White House that there are divisions between the hard-right Tea Party faction that is unilaterally opposed to any tax hikes and more traditional Republicans who are so concerned about the long-term deficit that under some circumstances they would vote for higher taxes. Plouffe said that the key will be whether Boehner is prepared to alienate the Tea Party bloc. \u201cAll the paperwork\u2019s done!\u201d he said. \u201cWe know what the options are. It\u2019s all been done! It\u2019s not like they\u2019re starting from scratch.\u201d Over in the Senate, there is a hint that the ice could thaw if Obama wins. Several senators from both parties have begun to meet behind closed doors to address the looming fiscal crisis, with the aim of delivering a tax-and-budget package by September. \u201cEveryone is kind of holding their cards, because we realize that it\u2019s not game time yet,\u201d the Tennessee Republican Bob Corker told Politico last week. In late May, Mitch McConnell, an architect of the G.O.P. strategy of non-co\u00f6peration since 2009, also told Politico, \u201cI think we have plenty of members in the Senate on both sides of the aisle who fully understand that we weren\u2019t sent here just to make a point\u2014that we were sent here to make a difference.\u201d Several White House officials I talked to made it clear that if a deal, or at least the framework for a deal, is not reached before December 31st Obama would allow all the Bush tax cuts to expire\u2014a tactic that would achieve huge deficit reduction, but in a particularly painful and ill-conceived fashion. The Administration is preparing for that outcome, and Republicans may not be willing to budge without the threat of this cataclysm. Plouffe said, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have the ability to tell the American people, \u2018Hey, your taxes may go up on January 1st because these guys refuse to ask the wealthy to do anything. Hey, there are going to be cuts in spending that aren\u2019t done as smartly as they could because these guys won\u2019t agree to ask anything from the wealthy.\u2019 \u201d The White House believes that Obama needs to change the psychology of the congressional Republicans and that, if his re\u00eblection won\u2019t do it, perhaps Taxmageddon will. \u201cTo get anything done in the second term,\u201d another White House official said, \u201cthe President has to convince the Republican Party that obstructionism is a losing strategy.\u201d**** V -=-=-=- Increasingly, hints of Obama\u2019s second-term vision are becoming evident on the campaign trail. On June 1st, Obama spoke before a luncheon crowd at a farm-to-table restaurant in a converted warehouse in the North Loop of Minneapolis, just yards from the Mississippi River. The restaurant, the Bachelor Farmer, is owned by two sons of the Minnesota governor, Mark Dayton. They had designed a special menu, which highlighted fresh produce grown on the restaurant\u2019s roof, and the staff wore matching ties made to commemorate the President\u2019s visit. A hundred people who each gave five thousand dollars to the President\u2019s campaign dined on a salad of house-smoked pork and a choice of roasted chicken or Copper River sockeye salmon (a vegetarian menu was also available), as Obama spoke about the politics of his potential second term. He noted, as he does with some frequency these days, that his original vision of a bipartisan Washington was a mirage. \u201cMy hope, when I came into office, was that we would have Republicans and Democrats coming together because the nation was facing extraordinary challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turns out that wasn\u2019t their approach\u2014to put it mildly.\u201d He insisted that the G.O.P. had moved too far to the right to make bipartisanship possible. He and John McCain had agreed on issues like immigration, climate change, and campaign finance. \u201cThe center of gravity for their party has shifted.\u201d \u201cIf you have any mental-health issues you\u2019d like to discuss, now would be a good time.\u201d But maybe, Obama said, his re\u00eblection would halt that trend. \u201cI believe that if we\u2019re successful in this election\u2014when we\u2019re successful in this election\u2014that the fever may break,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause there\u2019s a tradition in the Republican Party of more common sense than that.\u201d He noted a few areas of possible compromise: deficit reduction, a highway bill, immigration, and energy policy. He repeated the phrase that is becoming a mantra for his campaign: \u201cIf we can break this fever.\u201d If President Obama can indeed guide the parties toward an agreement that puts the federal government on a sustainable fiscal path, it would be a substantial achievement and would vindicate his early promise as a bipartisan leader. After that, he might have just one more chance to achieve a major domestic accomplishment before the next round of elections, in 2014. Gene Sperling noted that first-time Presidents are quickly confronted by the reality of whatever situation they\u2019ve inherited. \u201cPresident Clinton used to say to us, \u2018Look, this is what every Presidency is like\u2014you come in with your agenda and vision, and the fact is, whether you want it or not, ultimately a lot of the legacy for Presidents is how they handle the hand they were dealt as opposed to what they might have thought their agenda was going to be,\u2019 \u201d Sperling said. \u201cTo me, in many ways, health care was President Obama making a decision that he was going to hold on to part of the vision that he had set for the country.\u201d A second term, Sperling continued, could put Obama \u201cback to where he might have wanted to have started his Presidency.\u201d The big question that Obama will face is: \u201cWhat are the things we\u2019re doing to make ourselves compete so that globalization is working for the middle class, as opposed to what happened the previous decade?\u201d The President\u2019s list of options will be short. Obama has been a national politician since 2004, and the priorities he\u2019s discussed haven\u2019t changed much since then. Depending on the makeup of Congress, he might first have to consider whether he needs to play offense or defense. If the President gets past the grand bargain, \u201cit would be a legacy achievement,\u201d Goolsbee, who has known Obama since 2004, said. \u201cThen he would have to decide: Is the next issue protecting and establishing the health plan, or moving on to something new? Because it seems clear that the President\u2019s opponents are going to try to take apart the law.\u201d There are hints that the Supreme Court could simply strike down the Affordable Care Act. It also might strike down the health-care mandate but leave the remainder of the law intact. In that case, it is likely that several provisions regulating insurance markets would send insurance premiums soaring. Insurance companies would be forced to take on expensive new patients regardless of pre\u00ebxisting conditions, yet without the anticipated new revenue from young and less expensive patients who would have been forced to buy insurance. Obama would face a choice: replace the mandate with a new policy or remove the remaining market reforms. One option for replacing the mandate is to push the uninsured into the new system by requiring them to sign up for insurance when applying for other government services, such as food stamps or school loans. But the prospects for this sort of legislation are bleak. \u201cWe looked at this,\u201d a former Obama aide said. \u201cWe thought it was less constitutional than the mandate. Among the moderate Democrats, the idea that you would pass a bill like this is unimaginable.\u201d Whether the Supreme Court overturns the law in part or in full, the White House will need to respond publicly. \u201cThe strategy is to just go on the offensive and say, \u2018Look at Citizens United, look at the health-care decision, look at Bush v. Gore,\u201d the former aide said. \u201cWe have an out-of-control activist court, and Romney will make it worse. That\u2019s Plan A. Plan B is nothing.\u201d Even if the Court leaves the law alone, Obama may find himself fighting Republican attempts to defund it or to remove the mandate legislatively. If the House is still in Republican hands, even if he were to successfully navigate Taxmageddon he could easily find himself back in a situation like 2011 and 2012, when almost no bills moved forward.\n\nBut it seems plausible that Obama could have time for one more big policy change. What would it be? Several of his advisers talked about pursuing housing reform; the economy is still being dragged down by the seven hundred billion dollars in negative equity from homeowners who are stuck in houses worth less than their mortgages. The problem has bedevilled the White House since 2009, because any of the truly effective solutions requires a version of the awful politics of a bailout: people or institutions that acted irresponsibly will be rewarded. \u201cSomebody has to eat the seven hundred billion dollars,\u201d Goolsbee said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to cover up the fact. Either the banks and mortgage holders have to take seven hundred billion dollars of losses or the government has to come up with seven hundred billion dollars of subsidies to cover these costs. Or you can try to split it. But every significant policy that anyone can come up with has a really big price tag.\u201d Another major initiative under discussion is energy policy, but the politics of energy are almost as fraught as those of housing. As a candidate, Obama talked in stirring terms about the threat from global warming. In June, 2008, on the night he won the Democratic nomination, he declared that his victory marked \u201cthe moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.\u201d But climate change will remain a divisive issue after the election. Among Obama\u2019s conservative critics, his call to halt the rise of the oceans is a frequently mocked piece of oratory. And one of the biggest failures of his first term was the Administration\u2019s inability to win a deal on cap and trade\u2014originally a Republican idea. Obama talks about energy in most of his speeches, but, in contrast with 2009, when the centerpiece of his program was a cap-and-trade approach to reducing carbon emissions, his goal today is unclear. Early discussions on Capitol Hill suggest that, in a wide-ranging deal, a carbon tax might be part of a grand bargain to settle Taxmageddon. The proposition is not as absurd as it sounds. In 1997, the budget deal struck by Clinton and the Republicans was not so much a meeting in the middle as a swap of major priorities. \u201cThat was a deal of trades,\u201d one former Clinton official said. Clinton won policies such as a new children\u2019s-health program, a higher-education tax cut, and some progressive changes to the welfare bill that he signed into law in 1996. \u201cWe won those things and then we just gave the Republicans big Medicare savings, and we let them cut the capital-gains tax for rich people.\u201d Obama\u2019s 2010 fiscal deal with the G.O.P. was similar: he swapped an extension of all the Bush tax cuts for more stimulus. In a situation where many favored policies of both parties are on the table, a carbon tax\u2014a heretical idea during the past few years, given the weak economy and high fuel prices\u2014could be resurrected. Still, the Administration seems uncertain what its energy policy is; many of the stated goals are contradictory. Independence? Low energy prices? Reduction of carbon emissions? Job creation? Environmental protection? Unless Obama\u2019s energy policy regains its clarity, a legislative breakthrough in a second term is unlikely. Several White House officials said that the issue that Obama seems most passionate about is infrastructure. (One insider Democrat joked that Obama\u2019s passion for infrastructure is matched only by that of the Vice-President, who loves trains.) Obama wants to spend an extra hundred and fifty billion dollars on infrastructure during the next six years and reform the process by which projects are awarded, so that it\u2019s more about merit than about patronage. In 2009, he was aggravated when he was told that none of the money from the stimulus would be spent on a signature project, a modern-day Hoover Dam or Interstate Highway System. A bold infrastructure package has all the hallmarks of a major Obama policy: it would create jobs, it has a government-reform component, and it could establish a legacy in the form of an upgraded power grid or a high-speed train, with which Obama might forever be associated. \u201cI know it\u2019s the right thing to do, but if we call the cops this sandbox will be tied up for weeks.\u201d But if, as seems likely, Obama will have just one chance of achieving a major piece of domestic legislation in his second term, the most promising focus, according to current and former aides, would be on immigration. \u201cWhen you look at the whole second term, the biggest issue I think is fiscal soundness, which is the predicate for real economic improvement and growth,\u201d Bill Daley, Obama\u2019s former chief of staff, said. \u201cAnd then the second big issue I see would be immigration reform.\u201d The DREAM Act, which would legalize undocumented aliens who had come to America as children if they enrolled in college or joined the U.S. military, would be an obvious place to start. Obama\u2019s advisers believe that the politics of immigration may be the only chance for bipartisanship after Taxmageddon. After a party loses, it goes through a period of self-examination. If, despite the lacklustre economy and a general dissatisfaction with the direction of the country, Obama manages to defeat Mitt Romney, the explanation may be a simple matter of demographics: the Republican Party can no longer win the Presidency without increased support from nonwhite voters. \u201cIf we win, Latino voters will play a big role in that,\u201d David Plouffe said. \u201cThe Republican Party is going to have to make a decision. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a decision, actually. They\u2019re going to have to moderate.\u201d The White House is so convinced of the centrality of Hispanics to the current election and its aftermath that Plouffe told me he has been preparing for months for an onslaught of advertisements from a pro-Romney group attacking Obama from the left on immigration, arguing that Obama\u2019s deportation and border-security policies have been too Draconian. One of the lessons from \u201cMandate Politics\u201d is that the magnitude of a victory is not as important as defying expectations. Republicans won\u2019t co\u00f6perate with Obama simply because he\u2019s won, just as Bush\u2019s 2004 re\u00eblection did nothing to move Democrats. But if the 2012 results reveal that the G.O.P.\u2019s weakness among minority voters, especially Hispanics, is dire, political opportunities that seem unlikely today could quickly become conventional wisdom after November. Romney understands this. \u201cWe have to get Hispanic voters to vote for our party,\u201d he recently said at a private fund-raiser, unaware that reporters could hear him. Failure to do so \u201cspells doom for us,\u201d Romney said. A rule that holds up quite well in American politics is that the longer a party remains out of power the more moderate it becomes. VI\n\nOn a recent Friday at the White House, Plouffe stood in front of a map of America, talking about swing states. In some elections, he said, two candidates may try to hide their differences as they woo moderate voters. But this year the Obama campaign would insure that the competing ideologies of the two major parties are not blurred. \u201cEverything we do has to be with that in mind,\u201d Plouffe said. He named some recent examples. In 1992, Clinton and Bush agreed on certain aspects of free trade and welfare reform. In 2000, Bush ran on a more progressive education platform than his Republican colleagues. McCain once supported a cap-and-trade system and a version of immigration reform now condemned by almost all Republicans. There would be no such \u201czones of commonality\u201d this time around. \u201cOn every major issue, every one, there are stark differences,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more ideological.\u201d **** This tone is a sharp change. Obama campaigned from 2004 through 2010 as a bridge between competing orthodoxies\u2014a view of the world that flowed directly from his unique biography. In \u201cBarack Obama: The Story,\u201d by David Maraniss, Obama says, \u201cWhat I retained in my politics is a sense that the only way I could have a sturdy sense of identity of who I was depended on digging beneath the surface differences of people. The only way my life makes sense is if, regardless of culture, race, religion, tribe, there is this commonality . . . and that we can reach out beyond our differences.\u201d Now Obama is emphasizing the ideological divide, not the bridge across it. \u201cA lot of the tussles that we\u2019ve had over the last three and a half years have had to do with this difference in vision,\u201d he told the audience in Minneapolis, \u201cand it will be coming to a head in this election.\u201d Much of the talk of bold contrasts is a strategic necessity. Obama wants voters to cast their ballots based on the platforms of the two candidates, not on the record of his first term. The tactic comes with risks, but it helps divert attention from a seeming inability to promote his successes thus far, such as health care (so long as it lasts), financial regulation, and a soft landing after the economic crisis. Never mind that this strategy defies the judgment of most academic studies of voting behavior: that voters largely decide on incumbents based on a retrospective judgment of the economic situation during the last year or so in office. As he spoke, Plouffe, a math whiz who has been compared to Dustin Hoffman\u2019s character in \u201cRain Man,\u201d sometimes wrote down the numbers as he spoke them: two hundred and forty-one, the number of Republicans in the House of Representatives last year when he was negotiating with them; 11/6, the date of the election. He had no illusions that 2012 would look like 2008, and pointed to the tiny group of states that would decide the contest. \u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing all along for a kind of race where we have to win it fifty to forty-nine in seven states,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re facing, Grind it out in Virginia and Colorado and Ohio.\u201d It took considerable arm-twisting to get Plouffe to think past the details of the daily campaign and consider the long view. \u201cIf we win,\u201d he said finally, \u201cJanuary of 2017, what do we want to look back and be able to say? One, we\u2019ve recovered from the recession. Second, our economic and tax policies in this country are more centered on the middle class and on people trying to get in the middle class. Third, the big unmet challenges\u2014health care, education reform, energy, immigration, and reducing the deficit in the right way\u2014we met them. \u201cWe\u2019ve also ended a period of war while taking out our leading terrorist enemies,\u201d he added. \u201cThink about that! That\u2019s a pretty important book of business, and I think that\u2019s the legacy he\u2019d like to leave.\u201d VII",
