    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 As the 2020 presidential field takes shape , Democratic voters by double digits say they are more interested in nominating a candidate who can defeat President Trump than one they agree with most on the issues , a new \u2588\u2588\u2588/Suffolk University Poll finds .\nBy 55-35 percent , the Democrats surveyed endorse electability over ideological purity even though they also embrace progressive priorities such as the Green New Deal . They are even inclined to be open to a nominee who espouses socialism .\nThe debate over balancing policy positions with electoral appeal is always part of the calculation in campaigns . Almost a year before the Iowa caucuses open the nominating contests , it has taken on particular intensity as a sprawling field jockeys to challenge a Republican president who inflames the opposition .\nMore : Who is running for president ? Here 's a list of the candidates so far\n`` We 'd much rather have anybody than Trump , '' said Annette Lantos Tillemann-Dick , 66 , an innkeeper in Denver . ( Tillemann-Dick , who was called randomly in the poll , happens to be the daughter of the late California Democratic congressman Tom Lantos . ) She says the country needs a leader `` who will right the ship , because I think we have been in very choppy , choppy waters with a very bad captain for the last few years now . ''\nAaron Dillon , 54 , an engineer from Bolingbrook , a village in Chicago 's southwest suburbs , is looking for a candidate who can `` punch back '' against the president . `` We as Democrats need to get a little tougher , '' he said in a follow-up interview . `` We do n't need to get nasty and dirty , but we need to say we 're not going to take that . ''\nAmong Democratic and independent voters combined , sentiment was more closely divided : 48 percent say they want the Democratic Party to nominate `` a candidate who can win , even if different from my priorities , '' while 38 percent prefer `` a candidate in line with my priorities , even if it is harder to win . ''\nThere is cautionary news for Democrats in the poll . In a hypothetical match-up , Trump edges out an unnamed Democratic nominee , 39 percent to 36 percent , with 11 percent supporting an unnamed third party candidate . Fifteen percent are undecided .\nBoth Trump and the Democratic candidate hold the support of 80 percent of those in his or her own party . But nearly one in four independent voters choose the third-party option \u2013 a red flag for Democrats who hope to oust Trump . The independent campaign being considered by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has stoked concern among some Democrats that he could boost Trump 's re-election prospects by siphoning off votes from the Democratic nominee .\n`` In this week 's poll , Trump , [ House ] Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic Party and the Republican Party all had higher negatives than positives , '' says David Paleologos , director of the Suffolk Political Research Center . `` The third-party nominee is an outlet for disdain . ''\nAmong independent voters who consider themselves liberal , one in three now support the third-party candidate , a finding that is likely to alarm Democrats . `` Pass the Tums , '' Paleologos advises , although he notes that third-party candidates traditionally see their support decline as Election Day approaches .\nThat said , there are red flags in the survey for Republicans as well . Trump 's re-election is backed by just 38 percent of those surveyed . No candidate has managed to win the White House with support that low since 1824 . In 2016 , Trump carried 46 percent , trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the popular vote but prevailing in the Electoral College .\nCLOSE President Donald Trump on Saturday told an appreciative audience of conservatives that he 'll win re-election in 2020 and by a bigger margin than he did in 2016 .
