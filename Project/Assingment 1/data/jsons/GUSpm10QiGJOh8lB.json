The chaplains , or a guest , offer a prayer at the opening of each day that Congress is in session , and they minister to the members , their staffs , and their families .\nWhen he was the Senate historian , Mr. Ritchie says he often had to answer queries from outraged citizens and visitors who viewed the chaplaincy and opening prayers as a violation of the separation of church and state . But Article 1 of the Constitution allows the chambers to \u201c chuse \u201d their officers , and the chaplains have always been officers , the historian says . As the current Senate chaplain , Barry Black , notes on his web page , the chamber honors the separation of church and state , \u201c but not the separation of God and State . \u201d\nThe Supreme Court agrees . In 1983 , it held that a chaplaincy and opening prayers in legislatures do not violate the Constitution ( Marsh v. Chambers ) . In 2014 , it upheld opening prayers at municipal meetings , so long as the practice is not discriminatory . That ruling could soon get a test .

None of us belongs here or lives here , \u201d says Coons , a Presbyterian who holds a master \u2019 s degree in ethics from Yale Divinity School and who sometimes guest-preaches on Sundays at various churches in Delaware . The prayer breakfast , he says , \u201c helps humanize this place . \u201d\nBoth the House and Senate breakfasts strive to include speakers from diverse faiths , and Coons says the Senate breakfast reflects the \u201c wide range of beliefs and backgrounds \u201d of the chamber : liberal Democrats , conservative Republicans , Jews , Roman Catholics , Mormons , and mainline and evangelical Protestants .\nPeople attend for a variety of reasons . The meetings offer a spiritual respite from an otherwise hectic life . They help lawmakers cope with demoralizing gridlock . They reveal something about their colleagues that they otherwise might never see . Then there \u2019 s the literal breaking of bread \u2013 uninterrupted visiting time over pastries and coffee .\n\u201c You \u2019 re off the grid , \u201d says Sen. John Boozman ( R ) of Arkansas , who co-chairs the Senate breakfast along with Sen. Tim Kaine ( D ) of Virginia , a devout Catholic who is now Hillary Clinton \u2019 s running mate . Aside from the faith part of the hour , it \u2019 s \u201c almost like a coffee club , \u201d says Senator Boozman , who is a Southern Baptist . \u201c Once a week , you \u2019 re sitting around with people who have become your friends . \u201d\nIndeed , this soft-spoken former football player for the Arkansas Razorbacks ( his framed jersey hangs in his office ) says he would never have really gotten to know his harmonica-playing co-chair were it not for the breakfast .\nYet that is one reason some lawmakers are critical of the meetings \u2013 they seem too much like a clannish club . \u201c People think , oh it \u2019 s kind of secret , it \u2019 s kind of a cabal , \u201d says Senator Kaine . \u201c It \u2019 s only secretive because you want people to be free to be really candid about who they are. \u201d He \u2019 s been on a mission to invite non-Christian senators to share their stories \u2013 as long as what \u2019 s said inside the meetings , stays inside the meetings .\nOne of the oddest political couples in Washington is Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R ) of Texas and Rep. Janice Hahn ( D ) of California . Choose your antonyms \u2013 fire and ice , North and South , oil and water \u2013 politically , they are each other \u2019 s polar opposite .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t listen to him on the floor , \u201d says Congresswoman Hahn , seated on a blue leather sofa in her office . Representative Gohmert is famous to C-SPAN viewers for his long end-of-the-day speeches in the House chamber , excoriating the president . The Texan is a favorite among tea party groups . \u201c I can \u2019 t watch him , \u201d she reiterates .\nYet there they were in 2014 , co-hosting the National Prayer Breakfast . The duo bantered , joked , took little digs at each other , and then turned serious when talking about the teachings of their common Christian faith . He \u2019 s a devout member of a Southern Baptist church ; she \u2019 s Church of Christ .\nThey also pray together every Thursday morning at 8:00 , when their small group of 20 or so Republicans and Democrats meets in a room just off the members \u2019 large dining hall . Along the way , they \u2019 ve discovered commonalities : They each have three children \u2013 one with the same name ; he was a judge and her brother \u2019 s a judge ; she went to a Christian college in Texas , his home state .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve become friends , and people find this [ particular friendship ] the most strange , \u201d says Hahn .\nHer Democratic colleagues are surprised when she walks through the tunnels beneath the Capitol complex and Republicans greet her cheerily by name or ask about a family member . \u201c They \u2019 re like , \u2018 How do you know these people ? \u2019 I \u2019 m like , \u2018 I \u2019 m in this weekly prayer breakfast. \u2019 \u201d She also attends a small bipartisan , bicameral women \u2019 s Bible study group on Wednesday mornings .\nHer staff fiercely protects these time slots from other scheduling intrusions . Both Hahn and Gohmert say that scheduling creep of various caucus meetings during the time traditionally reserved for the House prayer breakfast has led to a decline in attendance . Even in the more robust days when the group was twice the size it is now , it still represented only a fraction of the 435 House members .\nLike the Senate prayer breakfast , the House version relies heavily on testimonials about a faith journey given by a member or guest . Participants ask for prayers , and prayers are given . Praying together over a marriage that \u2019 s dissolving , a child \u2019 s drug problem , or an ailing parent , or listening to a person \u2019 s faith story , \u201c really does begin to break down barriers , \u201d says Hahn . \u201c You realize everyone \u2019 s the same . \u201d\nShe says it \u2019 s not easy to worship with people who don \u2019 t share your political beliefs , especially if they advance policies that you consider \u201c disgusting. \u201d But that \u2019 s also strengthened her faith .\nFor many of her Democratic friends , however , that challenge holds no allure . \u201c I \u2019 ve heard my colleagues say it \u2019 s very difficult to pray with [ Republicans ] in the morning and have them cut food stamps in the afternoon , \u201d Hahn says . \u201c We think taking care of the homeless , feeding the poor , creating jobs for people \u2013 that is our faith . They , I \u2019 m sure , feel the same way about us . It \u2019 s very hard for them to pray with us after we \u2019 ve talked about being pro-choice and funding Planned Parenthood . \u201d\nIn a phone interview , Gohmert laments the rhetoric of the recent gun debate , and cites Democratic characterizations of Republicans as uncaring and indifferent over gun deaths . That gets \u201c a little demoralizing , \u201d the Texan admits .\nBut coming together in prayer is something else . \u201c Janice and I have very different views ... but we work well with each other . We share Christian love , \u201d he says . \u201c There \u2019 s a bond with Janice that transcends political situations . \u201d\nShe says much the same thing about him . And they both agree on this : The practical upshot of their friendship is to show others that such a relationship is possible .\nSince the duo hosted the National Prayer Breakfast , \u201c people have commented how amazing and how enjoyable it was to see two people that clearly liked each other , got along well , and were from different parties , \u201d says Gohmert .\nThe question is whether \u2013 or how much \u2013 a faith-supported friendship can actually lead to legislative bipartisanship and problem solving . Kaine offers one answer from his time in state politics , as Virginia \u2019 s lieutenant governor and then governor .\nFor eight years , he participated in a Tuesday prayer group when the state legislature was in session . They called themselves the \u201c dog patrol \u201d because they met at 6:30 a.m .\n\u201c I really got to know my colleagues , \u201d he said in a May interview , as bluegrass music streamed from a computer in his office . \u201c Then there \u2019 d be a vote on something that would be important to me and someone would vote against it . The first couple of times I \u2019 m like , \u2018 Well , that makes me mad . I mean , I thought we were friends . \u2019 \u201d\nBut then he thought about it more . Was he putting in that hour a week just to win three more votes on a bill ? He realized that wasn \u2019 t the right motive . Neither was he going to fundamentally change another person \u2019 s politics , nor would someone fundamentally change his .\nFor him , the effect of the prayer breakfast in the US Senate is more subtle . The 15-minute testimonials from fellow lawmakers \u2013 which range from \u201c churchy \u201d and \u201c doctrinal \u201d to accounts of how a senator grew up or overcame a painful experience , or a member \u2019 s aspirations in life \u2013 reveal what motivates a person . That \u2019 s what helps with the bridge building .\n\u201c They know what motivates me and I know what motivates them. \u201d As a result , he says , \u201c I do think they \u2019 ll give me a fair shake on the merits . \u201d\nOne of his Democratic colleagues , Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota , sees an even more direct connection between the relationships forged in the prayer breakfast and work in the halls of Congress . \u201c I \u2019 ve gotten to know people through that prayer breakfast . That has led to some positive legislative developments , \u201d Senator Klobuchar says .\nShe cites her work on international adoptions . It was through the breakfast , which she co-chaired in 2009 and 2010 , that she learned Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R ) of Oklahoma has a personal interest in adoption . His daughter , Molly , adopted a baby girl from an orphanage in Ethiopia .\nSenator Inhofe ended up being one of two Republican cosponsors on a 2009 adoption bill by Klobuchar . It allows US parents who have already completed international adoptions to bring in older siblings who are above the legal adoption age . The bill became law in 2010 .\nKlobuchar also notes that \u201c it tends to be the prayer-breakfast people \u201d who prevent reductions in the US foreign aid budget \u2013 which is a favorite target for cutbacks . She describes a group of Republicans who attend the breakfast as \u201c very faith-focused , and who like to go to Africa , and believe in helping people in other countries .... [ They ] have been key to continuing funding foreign aid . \u201d\nThe Senate and House prayer breakfasts are hardly the only faith-based gatherings on the Hill , though they \u2019 re the best known . Lawmakers \u2013 and staff \u2013 also gather in other groups , often quite small and intimate .\nSome people aren \u2019 t comfortable with the testimonial aspect of prayer breakfasts . Some aren \u2019 t used to the free-form Protestant way of praying \u2013 as opposed to set prayers , such as in the Catholic faith . Still others prefer more readings and study of Scripture .\nBut it \u2019 s not the form of worship , it \u2019 s the togetherness that helps bridge the divide in Congress , say lawmakers . Take the Bible study led by Inhofe on Thursday afternoons at noon . It includes three more Republicans and three Democrats , according to Sen. Tim Scott ( R ) of South Carolina .\nHe calls his study group a \u201c classic example \u201d of a faith-based way to establish trust between members of the two parties . \u201c Once you establish trust , you typically work toward a friendship , and that friendship will lead toward legislative solutions that are bipartisan , \u201d says Senator Scott , who does not attend the Senate prayer breakfast .\nOne example of that trust is Scott \u2019 s legislative effort to make body cameras more widely available to police . It grew out of last year \u2019 s fatal shooting of Walter Scott , an African-American who ran from a white police officer after being pulled over for a broken brake light in North Charleston , S.C. \u2013 the senator \u2019 s hometown . The black man was shot from behind while fleeing , as shown on a private video that surfaced .\nThe South Carolina senator , the only Republican African-American in the Senate , reached out to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey , the only black Democrat in the Senate , to work on the police camera legislation . Senator Booker is also in Inhofe \u2019 s Bible study group .\n\u201c The fact that we \u2019 re both attending the Bible study helps a lot , \u201d Scott says , \u201c and once I pushed the legislation forward I called his office and asked him to participate in it , and he said \u2018 yes. \u2019 \u201d The legislation , however , is stalled for now .\nScott was recently at the nexus of another faith-based bipartisan push to improve race relations . In March , he and Rep. James Clyburn , a Democrat also from the Palmetto State , cohosted a congressional civil rights \u201c pilgrimage \u201d to South Carolina , organized by the Faith & Politics Institute . The institute is a nonprofit that brings members of Congress together in interfaith reflection and travel . It focuses on racial , religious , and political reconciliation .\nThe spring pilgrimage , which included senior congressional leadership from both parties and chambers , toured historical sites in Columbia , Orangeburg , and Charleston , and culminated in a Palm Sunday service at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston . Last year , a young white man , Dylann Roof , killed nine black worshipers at the church who had welcomed him as a stranger . Much of the country was amazed at the unconditional forgiveness expressed by the church community toward the shooter after the massacre .\nJudging from a documentary film made about the trip , the pilgrimage appeared to move the members of Congress . Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D ) of Rhode Island said he had never heard of the 1968 \u201c Orangeburg massacre , \u201d in which state highway patrol officers shot at protesters on the South Carolina State University campus , a historically black college in Orangeburg . Three black men were killed and nearly 30 people were injured in the protests over a whites-only bowling alley . \u201c It \u2019 s been moving , and also a little bit stunning \u201d to learn about the massacre , the senator says in the film .\nA younger member of the touring congressional group , Rep. Will Hurd ( R ) of Texas , expressed amazement at his close encounter with civil rights history . Congressman Hurd , a Republican , was born in San Antonio in 1977 , nearly a decade after the crucible year of 1968 . He \u2019 s the son of a mixed-race couple \u2013 his father is African-American . \u201c It \u2019 s hard for me to understand what you all went through , \u201d he says in the film . \u201c That \u2019 s one of the things about these trips . [ It ] helps me understand that . \u201d\nCommenting at a panel discussion about the documentary after a screening at the Capitol in July , Scott said that the response at Emanuel church after the shooting has \u201c significantly \u201d affected his leadership style . \u201c We all seem to be knuckleheads at times , \u201d he said about Congress . \u201c We need to get our act together ... and one of the ways that we do that is by paying attention to a family , a church family , who \u2019 s done so . \u201d\nMany Americans might come to the same conclusion about members of Congress \u2013 that they need to sit down and talk with each other more civilly . Prayer groups are one way they \u2019 re doing that .",

Then there\u2019s the literal breaking of bread \u2013 uninterrupted visiting time over pastries and coffee.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re off the grid,\u201d says Sen. John Boozman (R) of Arkansas, who co-chairs the Senate breakfast along with Sen. Tim Kaine (D) of Virginia, a devout Catholic who is now Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. Aside from the faith part of the hour, it\u2019s \u201calmost like a coffee club,\u201d says Senator Boozman, who is a Southern Baptist. \u201cOnce a week, you\u2019re sitting around with people who have become your friends.\u201d\n\nIndeed, this soft-spoken former football player for the Arkansas Razorbacks (his framed jersey hangs in his office) says he would never have really gotten to know his harmonica-playing co-chair were it not for the breakfast.\n\nYet that is one reason some lawmakers are critical of the meetings \u2013 they seem too much like a clannish club. \u201cPeople think, oh it\u2019s kind of secret, it\u2019s kind of a cabal,\u201d says Senator Kaine. \u201cIt\u2019s only secretive because you want people to be free to be really candid about who they are.\u201d He\u2019s been on a mission to invite non-Christian senators to share their stories \u2013 as long as what\u2019s said inside the meetings, stays inside the meetings.\n\nMICHAEL BONFIGLI/SPECIAL TO THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR\n\nOne of the oddest political couples in Washington is Rep. Louie Gohmert (R) of Texas and Rep. Janice Hahn (D) of California. Choose your antonyms \u2013 fire and ice, North and South, oil and water \u2013 politically, they are each other\u2019s polar opposite.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t listen to him on the floor,\u201d says Congresswoman Hahn, seated on a blue leather sofa in her office. Representative Gohmert is famous to C-SPAN viewers for his long end-of-the-day speeches in the House chamber, excoriating the president. The Texan is a favorite among tea party groups. \u201cI can\u2019t watch him,\u201d she reiterates.\n\nYet there they were in 2014, co-hosting the National Prayer Breakfast. The duo bantered, joked, took little digs at each other, and then turned serious when talking about the teachings of their common Christian faith. He\u2019s a devout member of a Southern Baptist church; she\u2019s Church of Christ.\n\nThey also pray together every Thursday morning at 8:00, when their small group of 20 or so Republicans and Democrats meets in a room just off the members\u2019 large dining hall. Along the way, they\u2019ve discovered commonalities: They each have three children \u2013 one with the same name; he was a judge and her brother\u2019s a judge; she went to a Christian college in Texas, his home state.\n\nBILL CLARK/CQ ROLL CALL/AP\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become friends, and people find this [particular friendship] the most strange,\u201d says Hahn.\n\nHer Democratic colleagues are surprised when she walks through the tunnels beneath the Capitol complex and Republicans greet her cheerily by name or ask about a family member. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018How do you know these people?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m in this weekly prayer breakfast.\u2019 \u201d She also attends a small bipartisan, bicameral women\u2019s Bible study group on Wednesday mornings.\n\nHer staff fiercely protects these time slots from other scheduling intrusions. Both Hahn and Gohmert say that scheduling creep of various caucus meetings during the time traditionally reserved for the House prayer breakfast has led to a decline in attendance. Even in the more robust days when the group was twice the size it is now, it still represented only a fraction of the 435 House members.\n\nLike the Senate prayer breakfast, the House version relies heavily on testimonials about a faith journey given by a member or guest. Participants ask for prayers, and prayers are given. Praying together over a marriage that\u2019s dissolving, a child\u2019s drug problem, or an ailing parent, or listening to a person\u2019s faith story, \u201creally does begin to break down barriers,\u201d says Hahn. \u201cYou realize everyone\u2019s the same.\u201d\n\nShe says it\u2019s not easy to worship with people who don\u2019t share your political beliefs, especially if they advance policies that you consider \u201cdisgusting.\u201d But that\u2019s also strengthened her faith.\n\nFor many of her Democratic friends, however, that challenge holds no allure. \u201cI\u2019ve heard my colleagues say it\u2019s very difficult to pray with [Republicans] in the morning and have them cut food stamps in the afternoon,\u201d Hahn says. \u201cWe think taking care of the homeless, feeding the poor, creating jobs for people \u2013 that is our faith. They, I\u2019m sure, feel the same way about us. It\u2019s very hard for them to pray with us after we\u2019ve talked about being pro-choice and funding Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview, Gohmert laments the rhetoric of the recent gun debate, and cites Democratic characterizations of Republicans as uncaring and indifferent over gun deaths. That gets \u201ca little demoralizing,\u201d the Texan admits.\n\nBut coming together in prayer is something else. \u201cJanice and I have very different views ... but we work well with each other. We share Christian love,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a bond with Janice that transcends political situations.\u201d\n\nShe says much the same thing about him. And they both agree on this: The practical upshot of their friendship is to show others that such a relationship is possible.\n\nSince the duo hosted the National Prayer Breakfast, \u201cpeople have commented how amazing and how enjoyable it was to see two people that clearly liked each other, got along well, and were from different parties,\u201d says Gohmert.\n\nHahn agrees. \u201cWe were Exhibit A.\u201d\n\nCAROLYN KASTER/AP\n\nThe question is whether \u2013 or how much \u2013 a faith-supported friendship can actually lead to legislative bipartisanship and problem solving. Kaine offers one answer from his time in state politics, as Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor and then governor.\n\nFor eight years, he participated in a Tuesday prayer group when the state legislature was in session. They called themselves the \u201cdog patrol\u201d because they met at 6:30 a.m.\n\n\u201cI really got to know my colleagues,\u201d he said in a May interview, as bluegrass music streamed from a computer in his office. \u201cThen there\u2019d be a vote on something that would be important to me and someone would vote against it. The first couple of times I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, that makes me mad. I mean, I thought we were friends.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut then he thought about it more. Was he putting in that hour a week just to win three more votes on a bill? He realized that wasn\u2019t the right motive. Neither was he going to fundamentally change another person\u2019s politics, nor would someone fundamentally change his.\n\nFor him, the effect of the prayer breakfast in the US Senate is more subtle. The 15-minute testimonials from fellow lawmakers \u2013 which range from \u201cchurchy\u201d and \u201cdoctrinal\u201d to accounts of how a senator grew up or overcame a painful experience, or a member\u2019s aspirations in life \u2013 reveal what motivates a person. That\u2019s what helps with the bridge building.\n\n\u201cThey know what motivates me and I know what motivates them.\u201d As a result, he says, \u201cI do think they\u2019ll give me a fair shake on the merits.\u201d\n\nOne of his Democratic colleagues, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, sees an even more direct connection between the relationships forged in the prayer breakfast and work in the halls of Congress. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know people through that prayer breakfast. That has led to some positive legislative developments,\u201d Senator Klobuchar says.\n\nShe cites her work on international adoptions. It was through the breakfast, which she co-chaired in 2009 and 2010, that she learned Sen. Jim Inhofe (R) of Oklahoma has a personal interest in adoption. His daughter, Molly, adopted a baby girl from an orphanage in Ethiopia.\n\nSenator Inhofe ended up being one of two Republican cosponsors on a 2009 adoption bill by Klobuchar. It allows US parents who have already completed international adoptions to bring in older siblings who are above the legal adoption age. The bill became law in 2010.\n\nKlobuchar also notes that \u201cit tends to be the prayer-breakfast people\u201d who prevent reductions in the US foreign aid budget \u2013 which is a favorite target for cutbacks. She describes a group of Republicans who attend the breakfast as \u201cvery faith-focused, and who like to go to Africa, and believe in helping people in other countries.... [They] have been key to continuing funding foreign aid.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nThe Senate and House prayer breakfasts are hardly the only faith-based gatherings on the Hill, though they\u2019re the best known. Lawmakers \u2013 and staff \u2013 also gather in other groups, often quite small and intimate.\n\nSome people aren\u2019t comfortable with the testimonial aspect of prayer breakfasts. Some aren\u2019t used to the free-form Protestant way of praying \u2013 as opposed to set prayers, such as in the Catholic faith. Still others prefer more readings and study of Scripture.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the form of worship, it\u2019s the togetherness that helps bridge the divide in Congress, say lawmakers. Take the Bible study led by Inhofe on Thursday afternoons at noon. It includes three more Republicans and three Democrats, according to Sen. Tim Scott (R) of South Carolina.\n\nHe calls his study group a \u201cclassic example\u201d of a faith-based way to establish trust between members of the two parties. \u201cOnce you establish trust, you typically work toward a friendship, and that friendship will lead toward legislative solutions that are bipartisan,\u201d says Senator Scott, who does not attend the Senate prayer breakfast.\n\nOne example of that trust is Scott\u2019s legislative effort to make body cameras more widely available to police. It grew out of last year\u2019s fatal shooting of Walter Scott, an African-American who ran from a white police officer after being pulled over for a broken brake light in North Charleston, S.C. \u2013 the senator\u2019s hometown. The black man was shot from behind while fleeing, as shown on a private video that surfaced.\n\nThe South Carolina senator, the only Republican African-American in the Senate, reached out to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, the only black Democrat in the Senate, to work on the police camera legislation. Senator Booker is also in Inhofe\u2019s Bible study group.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re both attending the Bible study helps a lot,\u201d Scott says, \u201cand once I pushed the legislation forward I called his office and asked him to participate in it, and he said \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d The legislation, however, is stalled for now.\n\nScott was recently at the nexus of another faith-based bipartisan push to improve race relations. In March, he and Rep. James Clyburn, a Democrat also from the Palmetto State, cohosted a congressional civil rights \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to South Carolina, organized by the Faith & Politics Institute. The institute is a nonprofit that brings members of Congress together in interfaith reflection and travel. It focuses on racial, religious, and political reconciliation.\n\nThe spring pilgrimage, which included senior congressional leadership from both parties and chambers, toured historical sites in Columbia, Orangeburg, and Charleston, and culminated in a Palm Sunday service at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston. Last year, a young white man, Dylann Roof, killed nine black worshipers at the church who had welcomed him as a stranger. Much of the country was amazed at the unconditional forgiveness expressed by the church community toward the shooter after the massacre.\n\nJudging from a documentary film made about the trip, the pilgrimage appeared to move the members of Congress. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D) of Rhode Island said he had never heard of the 1968 \u201cOrangeburg massacre,\u201d in which state highway patrol officers shot at protesters on the South Carolina State University campus, a historically black college in Orangeburg. Three black men were killed and nearly 30 people were injured in the protests over a whites-only bowling alley. \u201cIt\u2019s been moving, and also a little bit stunning\u201d to learn about the massacre, the senator says in the film.\n\nA younger member of the touring congressional group, Rep. Will Hurd (R) of Texas, expressed amazement at his close encounter with civil rights history. Congressman Hurd, a Republican, was born in San Antonio in 1977, nearly a decade after the crucible year of 1968. He\u2019s the son of a mixed-race couple \u2013 his father is African-American. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to understand what you all went through,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things about these trips. [It] helps me understand that.\u201d\n\nCommenting at a panel discussion about the documentary after a screening at the Capitol in July, Scott said that the response at Emanuel church after the shooting has \u201csignificantly\u201d affected his leadership style. \u201cWe all seem to be knuckleheads at times,\u201d he said about Congress. \u201cWe need to get our act together ... and one of the ways that we do that is by paying attention to a family, a church family, who\u2019s done so.\u201d\n\nMany Americans might come to the same conclusion about members of Congress \u2013 that they need to sit down and talk with each other more civilly. Prayer groups are one way they\u2019re doing that.",
