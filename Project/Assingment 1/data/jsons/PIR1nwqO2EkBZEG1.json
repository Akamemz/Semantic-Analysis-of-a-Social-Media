John Larson skipped the rare session with his party \u2019 s presidential hopeful for a face-to-face with the House parliamentarian . Larson had an obscure question about House rules : What would happen if he and a bunch of his colleagues took to the House floor to stage a sit-in protest , effectively shutting down the House ?\nLarson was told that it was an \u201c unprecedented instance that was hard to know what the response would be. \u201d It was assumed the raucous Democratic protest would force Republicans to adjourn the House , which is exactly what happened .\nAs Democrats on Capitol Hill struggle to push new gun control measures in the face of overwhelming GOP opposition , Larson and Rep. John Lewis ( D-Ga. ) \u2014 with the blessing of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats \u2014 wanted to do something dramatic after the massacre in Orlando .\nAnd Wednesday \u2019 s protest was nothing if not dramatic \u2014 an escalation of tactics by a virtually powerless minority that amounted to guerrilla warfare to force action on an issue .
