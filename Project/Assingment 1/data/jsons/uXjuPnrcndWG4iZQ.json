    "content": "Robert Mueller \u2019 s far-reaching Russia investigation is expected to delve into one of the biggest political phenomena of the Donald Trump era \u2014 fake news .\nThe special counsel \u2019 s team is stacked with prosecutors and FBI agents well equipped to investigate the Moscow-connected Twitter bots and Facebook trolls that churned out campaign-related headlines boosting Trump \u2019 s candidacy . And more than a dozen sources from Congress , law enforcement and white-collar criminal cases who are familiar with such probes say the question of potential collusion between Trump \u2019 s aides and the invasive social media accounts is a crucial one .\n\u201c For sure , \u201d former FBI agent and counterterrorism expert Clinton Watts said when asked whether Mueller \u2019 s focus would be on the Trump campaign \u2019 s potential connections to the Russia-based online activity . \u201c Where money and connections and influence come together is where it will play out . \u201d\n\u201c When they talk collusion , that \u2019 s one of the things they \u2019 ll look at , \u201d added a former federal prosecutor . \u201c The question will be : Did they do that all on their own , or did they do that in coordination with the blessing , with a direction or any connection , to people from the campaign ? \u201d\nBut Mueller \u2014 who is keeping mum on the scope of his investigation \u2014 faces a steep challenge . He has to prove that Trump \u2019 s aides and allies directly assisted the Russia-linked mischief makers , thereby running afoul of a federal law that prohibits presidential campaigns from accepting or coordinating contributions or expenditures \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 from foreign nationals .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard to imagine there wasn \u2019 t some coordination on this , \u201d said Nick Akerman , a former federal prosecutor with expertise in computer technology and fraud cases who worked on the Watergate special task force that helped force President Richard Nixon \u2019 s resignation .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

Another study , by researchers from the University of Oxford and the University of Pennsylvania , found that the biggest cluster of Trump-minded bots was nearly four times larger than any mechanisms pumping up Clinton .\nAs it pursues its investigation , Mueller \u2019 s team has at its disposal the underlying assessments of the Central Intelligence Agency , FBI and National Security Agency , which in early January released a public report that stated Moscow led an \u201c unprecedented \u201d attack on the U.S. election blending covert hacking with open moves by state-funded Russian propaganda and paid social media users , or trolls \u2014 all in an attempt to help elect Trump .\nMueller \u2014 whose spokesman declined comment for this story \u2014 would likely take that conclusion further by examining whether the Trump campaign or Trump 's intermediaries delivered microtargeted data to the Russian social media operators to help hone their messages , especially in critical swing states like Wisconsin , Michigan and Pennsylvania .\nSocial media experts say one of the most obvious pathways for Mueller and other investigators to understand what happened in 2016 should involve the major social-media companies themselves .\nIn May , Howard and his colleague Robert Gorwa co-authored an op-ed in The Washington Post calling on the House Intelligence Committee to force Facebook \u2019 s hand and produce the underlying metadata about any questionable accounts .\n\u201c If there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian influence operations , Facebook may be able to spot that too , \u201d they wrote . \u201c In many ways , massive coordinated propaganda campaigns are just another form of election interference .

But representatives from Facebook , as well as Twitter , declined to comment when asked whether they \u2019 d had any interactions or were cooperating with Mueller \u2019 s special counsel team .\nBrad Parscale , the Trump campaign \u2019 s top digital strategist , also declined to answer a series of questions about the Russia investigation , though in previous interviews with other media outlets he insisted the Republican \u2019 s campaign didn \u2019 t pay for bots during the presidential race . Asked by Fox News in May whether he \u2019 d noticed \u201c anything weird \u201d on social media during the campaign , Parscale responded \u201c absolutely not , \u201d adding that the data Trump \u2019 s campaign had been using \u201c directly came from the Republican National Committee . \u201d\n\u201c The other side wants to believe this false narrative because they don \u2019 t want to believe their candidate was so bad that this was even possible , \u201d Parscale said . \u201c The truth is that data was already there , and we just used it to beat a bad candidate with a great candidate . \u201d\nAccording to a CNN report last month , the House Intelligence Committee wants to interview Parscale as part of its Russia investigation .

Marco Rubio ( R-Fla. ) , who lost in the 2016 primary race against Trump and has complained that former members of his campaign were nearly victimized by Russian hackers as he launched his Senate reelection effort .\nIn an interview , House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) said his panel is studying both how the Russia-based social media accounts operated during the 2016 campaign and \u201c whether they had any help of U.S. persons , whether there was any coordination of those efforts either in the timing or targeting of those fake stories . \u201d\n\u201c It does concern me , \u201d Schiff said . \u201c It is something we \u2019 re looking at . \u201d\nWhether the Mueller team or congressional investigators will be able to get to the bottom of the Russian social media accounts is unclear .\nWatts , now a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute , said he doesn \u2019 t doubt that users of Russian social media accounts were posing as conservative voters in the U.S. who supported Trump . But he \u2019 s also not convinced Mueller will be able to find clear evidence of collusion between the Republican \u2019 s campaign and Moscow . That \u2019 s in part because the operators of those accounts are more than capable of doing their work without getting any inside data or intelligence from the Trump campaign . \u201c You don \u2019 t need Americans . You can do it from Russia , \u201d he said .\nAnd even if Russian bots were operating in force in the 2016 cycle , some Republicans doubt they would have had much effect on voters .\n\u201c I think you can annoy people . I think you can push a news cycle . I think you can intimidate people even . But I don \u2019 t think you can influence people , \u201d said Chris Wilson , a senior research and analytics strategist from Sen. Ted Cruz 's 2016 campaign .\nDemocrats see things differently . In the closing days of the November election , President Barack Obama criticized the proliferation of fake news stories circulating online , arguing at a Michigan rally : \u201c And people , if they just repeat attacks enough , and outright lies over and over again , as long as it \u2019 s on Facebook and people can see it , as long as it \u2019 s on social media , people start believing it .
