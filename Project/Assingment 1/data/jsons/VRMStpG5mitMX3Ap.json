Even his critics \u2013 and in Australia they are legion \u2013 concede that Rudd is a trenchant analyst of geopolitics . But in the US political arena , where toughness on China is prized and compromise equals capitulation , is anyone listening ?\nThe modern evolution of U.S.-China relations began in 1971 under President Richard Nixon . That year , Dr. Kissinger , his national security adviser , reached an agreement with China to normalize relations between the two countries . Nixon \u2019 s visit to Beijing in February 1972 ended a quarter-century of isolation from the West .\nBy the end of the 1970s , China had begun to reform its socialist economy ; in its place , a capitalist phoenix emerged , eager to do business with the US and other rich nations . Chinese citizens soaked up foreign ideas and fashions no longer deemed politically toxic . Many personal freedoms were restored . Some people got rich . Others made a modest living , while urging their children \u2013 in most cases , a single child \u2013 to aim higher . Opportunities for education exploded after formal schooling had been all but abandoned during Mao \u2019 s Cultural Revolution . More than a quarter of a million Chinese are now enrolled in US universities .\nNixon was no idealist . He saw China as a counterweight to the Soviet Union . What China did at home was a lesser concern . \u201c The relationship has always been strategic , \u201d says Jeffrey Bader , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington .\nSince Nixon , successive US presidents have adopted the notion that engagement with China \u2013 trade , diplomacy , education \u2013 would eventually lead to political liberalization , as it had in some other closed regimes . In essence , the more that America knew about China , and China knew about America , the more certain it was that Western norms and practices would prevail .\nBy most measures , this hasn \u2019 t happened . Under Xi , who took power in March 2013 , civic space for critical debate has narrowed . Human rights lawyers , Christian activists , and liberal professors have all been targeted and detained as threats to single-party rule . Under Xi , whose term runs to 2023 , China \u2019 s growing military muscle is being flexed over disputed islands in East Asia . Its economic weight is already felt globally , from Brazil to South Africa to Australia , and that in turn is giving Beijing a greater say in global affairs .\n\u201c Chinese power is increasing . Its economic and financial influence is increasing , and it \u2019 s winning a lot of deference from the world on that basis , \u201d says Andrew Nathan , a professor of politics at Columbia University in New York .\nOne example is the $ 100 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , which China launched in June with 56 other countries . The US was not among them . But close allies such as Britain , Germany , and South Korea chose to join , despite US objections to the bank \u2019 s lending rules . China says that the AIIB fills a gap in financing for poor countries and isn \u2019 t a competitor to the Washington-based World Bank . At the same time , the US is negotiating a trade pact , the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which pointedly excludes China . \u201c If we don \u2019 t write the rules , China will write the rules out in that region , \u201d President Obama told The Wall Street Journal in April .\nSuch political and economic rivalry , combined with China \u2019 s military buildup , raises the question of whether China may undermine the US role as guarantor of global security . In the South China Sea , China has built airstrips on disputed islands and reefs . It bristles at US Navy surveillance flights along its coastline . Further north , the Senkaku Islands held by Japan , which China calls Diaoyu and claims as its own , are also being contested .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not about lumps of rock or coral , \u201d says Hugh White , professor of strategic studies at Australian National University in Canberra . \u201c It \u2019 s about who leads in Asia . \u201d\nAlong China \u2019 s rim , countries such as Australia , South Korea , the Philippines , and Japan are military allies of the US . But like all countries in Asia , their largest trading partner is now China . Should Sino-American relations turn overtly adversarial in the future , they would be forced to pick a side . For now , any sign that US allies in Asia are cozying up to China as a hedge against a perceived decline in US strength or willingness to fight could encourage Chinese hawks to push harder \u2013 and panic US military strategists . Conversely , an American move to expand its role in the region and arm its allies would spark similar reactions on the other side .\nHistorians call it the Thucydides Trap : a cycle of conflict that escalates when a rising power disturbs an existing order . In the 5th century BC , Sparta began to see Athens , an upstart city-state bristling with new ideas , as a rival . This led to a protracted and mutually ruinous struggle for military supremacy in ancient Greece . \u201c It was the rise of Athens and the fear this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable , \u201d wrote Thucydides in his \u201c History of the Peloponnesian War . \u201d\nRudd clicks on a picture of Thucydides during his TED talk ( \u201c This guy up here ? He \u2019 s not Chinese , and he \u2019 s not American . He \u2019 s Greek. \u201d ) He highlights the research of Harvard professor Graham Allison , director of the Belfer Center . Mr. Allison has found that , since 1500 , the Thucydides Trap has been sprung 15 times . In 11 cases the result was catastrophic war , including in 1914 when Germany challenged British primacy .\nAmericans may find it hard to picture China as Athens , the birthplace of democracy . But Chinese policymakers , as keen students of world history , would have little trouble transposing Sparta , a superpower accustomed to dictating terms to others , onto the US . In 2013 , Xi told an international delegation , of which Rudd was a member , that China wasn \u2019 t seeking to impose its will on the world . \u201c This is not in the DNA of this country given our long cultural and historical background. \u201d Then Xi added , \u201c We all need to work together to avoid the Thucydides Trap . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s a saying : \u201c When elephants fight , the grass suffers. \u201d In ancient times , the grass was unruffled by the rise and fall of distant empires . In our globalized world , a stampede hurts everyone . When Josette Sheeran , president of the Asia Society , attended a summit in Ethiopia , she was seated at dinner with seven African leaders . All told her that their nations \u2019 future depends on constructive US-China relations . \u201c Every region is telling us that the US and China need to work it out , \u201d she says .\n\u201c Call me Kevin , \u201d Rudd tells me when we meet in his surprisingly spare office at the Asia Society . In person he \u2019 s affable and solicitous , asking if my cup of tea is hot enough . He tells me he made it himself \u2013 the actual tea blend . When he was foreign minister , he won a tea-blending competition run by Twinings . Now , a share of profits from all sales of his Australian Afternoon Tea go to his designated charity for animal welfare . I tell him I like the tea . He looks pleased . \u201c I grew up on a farm in rural Australia . The culture of having a cup of tea was a defined culture , \u201d he says .\nRudd speaks in measured , often digressive chunks , with the cadence of a diplomat and the ellipses of a politician adept at swerving past questions . He \u2019 s fond of folksy Anglo-Australian metaphors . Referring to political changes in Myanmar ( Burma ) , he speaks of \u201c movement at the station , \u201d a cattle-ranching term . He also lapses into wonky bureaucratese \u2013 political \u201c internalities \u201d and \u201c investment instrumentalities . \u201d\nChina has defined Rudd \u2019 s career , for better or worse . Raised in hardscrabble rural Australia , he studied Chinese history and culture and went on to serve as a diplomat , then built a political career that culminated in him being elected Australian prime minister in a landslide victory in 2007 . While Rudd \u2019 s campaign was grounded in domestic politics , his credentials on China at a time when it was buying up vast amounts of Australian natural resources were clearly a selling point .\nHis message , says Nicholas Stuart , author of a 2007 biography of Rudd , was that \u201c America is the past . China is the new century . And I can unlock the door for you . \u201d\nThree years later , Rudd was out , replaced by his deputy leader , Julia Gillard . His brusque style of leadership had alienated party colleagues and senior bureaucrats alike , and he \u2019 d lost public support after flip-flopping on issues such as climate change , which he once called the greatest moral challenge facing the world . At the United Nations climate talks in Copenhagen , Denmark , in 2009 , Rudd was overheard using colorful expletives about Chinese negotiators who helped sabotage a binding deal . On this and other issues involving China , Rudd frequently found himself caught between conflicting views and expectations . \u201c He overestimated his position and thought the Chinese would give him a lot more space \u201d on global warming and other issues , says Professor White , who has informally advised Rudd .\nHe was also hurt by the release of a WikiLeaks cable in which he struck a bellicose tone on China over a private lunch in 2009 with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .\nRudd served unhappily as foreign minister under Ms. Gillard . In 2013 he unseated her and briefly served as prime minister again before losing an election . It was a bitter end to his political career . He resigned from Parliament and accepted an offer to teach at Harvard . In September 2014 , Rudd spoke with former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson at an Asia Society panel on China , which led to him being tapped as president of ASPI .\nIn Australia , many believe that Rudd is eyeing the job of UN secretary-general after Ban Ki-moon \u2019 s second term ends next year . The Asia Society , in proximity and prestige , is an ideal launchpad . Rudd denies that he covets the job or that he would stand a chance . The UN \u2019 s informal rotation system is against him : Someone from Eastern Europe is due to fill the post next . Still , Frank Brennan , a Jesuit priest and law professor at Australian Catholic University in Canberra who has known Rudd since 1990 , says he would be a candidate . \u201c He \u2019 s got another big gig in him , whatever it might be . \u201d\nRudd considers himself a realist on Chinese politics . In his Belfer study , he flatly rejects the idea that China \u2019 s brand of authoritarian capitalism is bound to fail in the future , despite its current economic travails . It would be \u201c imprudent in the extreme \u201d to assume a \u201c China collapse , \u201d he writes . \u201c This would amount to a triumph of hope over cold , hard analysis . \u201d\nBoiled down , Rudd \u2019 s argument is that the US and China need to set aside political issues on which their positions are too far apart , such as the status of Taiwan . Instead , they should build mutual trust via joint initiatives on common problems where there is overlap while taking a \u201c constructive \u201d approach to bilateral and multilateral issues , such as reform of the UN and of Pan-Asian forums . Rudd argues that Sino-American cooperation can in time yield the political capital needed for strategic breakthroughs . Curbing the effects of climate change \u2013 Mr. Obama and Xi drew up a joint plan of action at a summit in Beijing last November \u2013 is an example of common purpose .\nRudd says his report is aimed primarily at policy elites in the US and China , and that any bluntness is intentional . \u201c It \u2019 s causing some level of discomfort in both capitals , I assume .... I \u2019 m not in the business of dancing around the edges , \u201d he says .\nFor US readers , Rudd deftly unspools Chinese \u201c realist \u201d thinking on the tenets of American foreign policy , namely that the US has \u201c a dual strategy of undermining China from within , while also containing China from without. \u201d Exhibit A : Obama \u2019 s first-term \u201c pivot \u201d to Asia and US arms sales to countries such as India and Vietnam . From China \u2019 s perspective , such steps are evidence of preemptive containment .\nSimilarly , Rudd recognizes the concerns of US strategists who fret that China seeks to create a sphere of influence in Asia that would exclude the US . Rudd notes that Xi is far more decisive and destiny-driven than his predecessors . In May 2014 , Xi outlined a regional security concept in which the US wasn \u2019 t welcome . \u201c The people of Asia are capable and wise enough to strengthen cooperation among themselves in order to achieve the peace and stability of Asia , \u201d he said .\nThe US military remains far more capable and better equipped than the Chinese military and is likely to remain so for decades . But perceptions matter . In 2013 , the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reported the findings of a survey of opinion leaders in China and the US . Majorities in both countries said they viewed the other country as a competitor . Asked if they considered China as an enemy , only 2 percent of US government elites said they did . Among Chinese , 27 percent view the US as an enemy .\nCritics say Rudd \u2019 s engagement strategy \u2013 finding common ground and solving non-core problems \u2013 won \u2019 t defuse the deeper divisions . Sino-American tensions aren \u2019 t simply about a lack of goodwill or diplomatic mechanisms , says Ashley Tellis , a senior associate at Carnegie and coauthor of a report published in April that advocates a hawkish US stance on China . \u201c These are fundamental clashes of interest . There \u2019 s nothing in Kevin \u2019 s report that tells me how to circumnavigate these clashes . \u201d\nRudd argues that Xi may be open to a \u201c grand strategic bargain \u201d with the US on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . Other analysts have proposed that a parallel formula be found for Taiwan , whereby the US stops selling weapons in return for a Chinese pledge not to force reunification . Mr. Bader , who was Obama \u2019 s principal adviser on Asia from 2009 to 2011 , is skeptical of sweeping quid pro quo deals . \u201c They don \u2019 t happen . Every issue is unique and disaggregated and has its own set of bureaucratic actors involved , \u201d he says .\npower accommodation , too , which he likens to the 1815 Congress of Vienna . \u201c I think there will be a long period of friction over these particular issues . I don \u2019 t think they can be settled upfront by some kind of compromise . \u201d\nRudd doesn \u2019 t linger on the consequences of the US ceding ground to China in Asia . Yet even a gradual rebalancing would mark a major shift , says White , author of a 2013 book , \u201c The China Choice : Why America Should Share Power. \u201d He says Rudd needs to be frank about what it means to the US to begin to treat China as a peer . \u201c Kevin is trying to say you can do this and it \u2019 s not going to hurt . But this is going to hurt . \u201d\nSince leaving office , Rudd has kept up his contacts in China . He attends academic gatherings and has been invited to speak at military-run events . While his Belfer study refers to \u201c senior Chinese interlocutors , \u201d Rudd is cagey about whom he meets with . \u201c It \u2019 s far better to talk to folks when you can when opportunities arise , in Beijing or Washington , but not to make a song and dance about it , \u201d he tells me .\nIn 2008 , Rudd asserted in a speech in Chinese at Peking University that he was a zhengyou , a sincere friend who would speak frankly to China . But his charm offensive flopped after WikiLeaks revealed that he also spoke frankly to America about China . In 2014 , Bob Carr , who succeeded Rudd as Australian foreign minister , wrote in a memoir that his Chinese counterpart , Wang Yi , had said of Rudd , \u201c You know , in China ... some people love him ... and some people ... hate him ! \u201d\nIn Washington , Rudd has cultivated policymakers on both sides of the aisle , though his personal connections are strongest among Democrats , including foreign-\npolicy advisers to Mrs. Clinton . In 2009 , Obama called Rudd two weeks after the president \u2019 s first inauguration . After he was demoted to foreign minister , Rudd continued to meet with Obama \u2019 s national security adviser . Rudd is still consulted on China by the Obama administration , says Mr. Nealer , who notes his briefings \u201c appeal to senior policymakers who crave insights without agendas . \u201d\nWhile China may be the reason the White House calls , in his new position at the Asia Society , Rudd has a broad portfolio . One morning in July , I joined a small group at the launch of an ASPI task force chaired by Rudd to promote Indian membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping . The next day , he held an hour-long teleconference briefing on Japan . On the third day , I attended a panel on the Iran nuclear deal , which drew a large crowd to the eighth floor of the Asia Society as the evening sun glanced off the platinum-priced apartments of Park Avenue nearby .\nFlanked by a former US ambassador and an Iranian-born researcher , Rudd used his introductory remarks to emphasize the historic challenge of nuclear proliferation . He then segued into a self-deprecatory joke about being unable to find his way around New York . As a moderator , Rudd is brisk and sure-footed . Still , just as he did at the earlier event on India , Rudd casually let slip his own bona fides . \u201c I was just talking to the Chinese mission at the UN , just a few days ago , \u201d he said , and added that China takes some pride in its role in the Iranian negotiations .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nIt \u2019 s a claim that anyone could probably adduce from public statements . But coming from Rudd it has the ring of authority .\nAs the Iran panel broke up , Rudd lingered to greet invitees and mingle with the public . From the back of the room , I watched a group of six button-down students from a Jesuit high school approach Rudd for a photo . Their teacher explained to me that the boys were all members of the debating club , and had been studying the Iran deal . Smiling , Rudd turned to them and said , \u201c Hi , boys . I \u2019 m Kevin . \u201d",

In speeches and articles, he argues that despite the rancor and paranoia, common ground exists between West and East \u2013 and more can be found. \u201cMost of the world today is made up of folks who like blowing up bridges, or, alternatively, those that prefer shouting to bridge-building,\u201d Rudd told me when we met in New York in July. \u201cUnless you build some bridges, problems frankly become irresolvable.\u201d\n\nRudd knows firsthand the political constraints that leaders face in foreign affairs, particularly when it comes to China.

Human rights lawyers, Christian activists, and liberal professors have all been targeted and detained as threats to single-party rule. Under Xi, whose term runs to 2023, China\u2019s growing military muscle is being flexed over disputed islands in East Asia.

At the same time, the US is negotiating a trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which pointedly excludes China. \u201cIf we don\u2019t write the rules, China will write the rules out in that region,\u201d President Obama told The Wall Street Journal in April.\n\nSuch political and economic rivalry, combined with China\u2019s military buildup, raises the question of whether China may undermine the US role as guarantor of global security. In the South China Sea, China has built airstrips on disputed islands and reefs. It bristles at US Navy surveillance flights along its coastline. Further north, the Senkaku Islands held by Japan, which China calls Diaoyu and claims as its own, are also being contested.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about lumps of rock or coral,\u201d says Hugh White, professor of strategic studies at Australian National University in Canberra. \u201cIt\u2019s about who leads in Asia.\u201d\n\nAlong China\u2019s rim, countries such as Australia, South Korea, the Philippines, and Japan are military allies of the US. But like all countries in Asia, their largest trading partner is now China. Should Sino-American relations turn overtly adversarial in the future, they would be forced to pick a side. For now, any sign that US allies in Asia are cozying up to China as a hedge against a perceived decline in US strength or willingness to fight could encourage Chinese hawks to push harder \u2013 and panic US military strategists. Conversely, an American move to expand its role in the region and arm its allies would spark similar reactions on the other side.\n\nHistorians call it the Thucydides Trap: a cycle of conflict that escalates when a rising power disturbs an existing order. In the 5th century BC, Sparta began to see Athens, an upstart city-state bristling with new ideas, as a rival. This led to a protracted and mutually ruinous struggle for military supremacy in ancient Greece. \u201cIt was the rise of Athens and the fear this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable,\u201d wrote Thucydides in his \u201cHistory of the Peloponnesian War.\u201d\n\nRudd clicks on a picture of Thucydides during his TED talk (\u201cThis guy up here? He\u2019s not Chinese, and he\u2019s not American. He\u2019s Greek.\u201d) He highlights the research of Harvard professor Graham Allison, director of the Belfer Center. Mr. Allison has found that, since 1500, the Thucydides Trap has been sprung 15 times. In 11 cases the result was catastrophic war, including in 1914 when Germany challenged British primacy.\n\nAmericans may find it hard to picture China as Athens, the birthplace of democracy. But Chinese policymakers, as keen students of world history, would have little trouble transposing Sparta, a superpower accustomed to dictating terms to others, onto the US. In 2013, Xi told an international delegation, of which Rudd was a member, that China wasn\u2019t seeking to impose its will on the world. \u201cThis is not in the DNA of this country given our long cultural and historical background.\u201d Then Xi added, \u201cWe all need to work together to avoid the Thucydides Trap.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a saying: \u201cWhen elephants fight, the grass suffers.\u201d In ancient times, the grass was unruffled by the rise and fall of distant empires. In our globalized world, a stampede hurts everyone. When Josette Sheeran, president of the Asia Society, attended a summit in Ethiopia, she was seated at dinner with seven African leaders. All told her that their nations\u2019 future depends on constructive US-China relations. \u201cEvery region is telling us that the US and China need to work it out,\u201d she says.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n\u201cCall me Kevin,\u201d Rudd tells me when we meet in his surprisingly spare office at the Asia Society. In person he\u2019s affable and solicitous, asking if my cup of tea is hot enough. He tells me he made it himself \u2013 the actual tea blend. When he was foreign minister, he won a tea-blending competition run by Twinings. Now, a share of profits from all sales of his Australian Afternoon Tea go to his designated charity for animal welfare. I tell him I like the tea. He looks pleased. \u201cI grew up on a farm in rural Australia. The culture of having a cup of tea was a defined culture,\u201d he says.\n\nRudd speaks in measured, often digressive chunks, with the cadence of a diplomat and the ellipses of a politician adept at swerving past questions. He\u2019s fond of folksy Anglo-Australian metaphors. Referring to political changes in Myanmar (Burma), he speaks of \u201cmovement at the station,\u201d a cattle-ranching term. He also lapses into wonky bureaucratese \u2013 political \u201cinternalities\u201d and \u201cinvestment instrumentalities.\u201d\n\nChina has defined Rudd\u2019s career, for better or worse. Raised in hardscrabble rural Australia, he studied Chinese history and culture and went on to serve as a diplomat, then built a political career that culminated in him being elected Australian prime minister in a landslide victory in 2007. While Rudd\u2019s campaign was grounded in domestic politics, his credentials on China at a time when it was buying up vast amounts of Australian natural resources were clearly a selling point.\n\nHis message, says Nicholas Stuart, author of a 2007 biography of Rudd, was that \u201cAmerica is the past. China is the new century. And I can unlock the door for you.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Rudd was out, replaced by his deputy leader, Julia Gillard. His brusque style of leadership had alienated party colleagues and senior bureaucrats alike, and he\u2019d lost public support after flip-flopping on issues such as climate change, which he once called the greatest moral challenge facing the world. At the United Nations climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009, Rudd was overheard using colorful expletives about Chinese negotiators who helped sabotage a binding deal. On this and other issues involving China, Rudd frequently found himself caught between conflicting views and expectations. \u201cHe overestimated his position and thought the Chinese would give him a lot more space\u201d on global warming and other issues, says Professor White, who has informally advised Rudd.\n\nHe was also hurt by the release of a WikiLeaks cable in which he struck a bellicose tone on China over a private lunch in 2009 with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nRudd served unhappily as foreign minister under Ms. Gillard. In 2013 he unseated her and briefly served as prime minister again before losing an election. It was a bitter end to his political career. He resigned from Parliament and accepted an offer to teach at Harvard. In September 2014, Rudd spoke with former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson at an Asia Society panel on China, which led to him being tapped as president of ASPI.\n\nIn Australia, many believe that Rudd is eyeing the job of UN secretary-general after Ban Ki-moon\u2019s second term ends next year. The Asia Society, in proximity and prestige, is an ideal launchpad. Rudd denies that he covets the job or that he would stand a chance. The UN\u2019s informal rotation system is against him: Someone from Eastern Europe is due to fill the post next. Still, Frank Brennan, a Jesuit priest and law professor at Australian Catholic University in Canberra who has known Rudd since 1990, says he would be a candidate. \u201cHe\u2019s got another big gig in him, whatever it might be.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nRudd considers himself a realist on Chinese politics. In his Belfer study, he flatly rejects the idea that China\u2019s brand of authoritarian capitalism is bound to fail in the future, despite its current economic travails. It would be \u201cimprudent in the extreme\u201d to assume a \u201cChina collapse,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis would amount to a triumph of hope over cold, hard analysis.\u201d\n\nBoiled down, Rudd\u2019s argument is that the US and China need to set aside political issues on which their positions are too far apart, such as the status of Taiwan. Instead, they should build mutual trust via joint initiatives on common problems where there is overlap while taking a \u201cconstructive\u201d approach to bilateral and multilateral issues, such as reform of the UN and of Pan-Asian forums. Rudd argues that Sino-American cooperation can in time yield the political capital needed for strategic breakthroughs. Curbing the effects of climate change \u2013 Mr. Obama and Xi drew up a joint plan of action at a summit in Beijing last November \u2013 is an example of common purpose.\n\nRudd says his report is aimed primarily at policy elites in the US and China, and that any bluntness is intentional. \u201cIt\u2019s causing some level of discomfort in both capitals, I assume.... I\u2019m not in the business of dancing around the edges,\u201d he says.\n\nFor US readers, Rudd deftly unspools Chinese \u201crealist\u201d thinking on the tenets of American foreign policy, namely that the US has \u201ca dual strategy of undermining China from within, while also containing China from without.\u201d Exhibit A: Obama\u2019s first-term \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia and US arms sales to countries such as India and Vietnam. From China\u2019s perspective, such steps are evidence of preemptive containment.\n\nSimilarly, Rudd recognizes the concerns of US strategists who fret that China seeks to create a sphere of influence in Asia that would exclude the US. Rudd notes that Xi is far more decisive and destiny-driven than his predecessors. In May 2014, Xi outlined a regional security concept in which the US wasn\u2019t welcome. \u201cThe people of Asia are capable and wise enough to strengthen cooperation among themselves in order to achieve the peace and stability of Asia,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US military remains far more capable and better equipped than the Chinese military and is likely to remain so for decades. But perceptions matter. In 2013, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reported the findings of a survey of opinion leaders in China and the US. Majorities in both countries said they viewed the other country as a competitor. Asked if they considered China as an enemy, only 2 percent of US government elites said they did. Among Chinese, 27 percent view the US as an enemy.\n\nCritics say Rudd\u2019s engagement strategy \u2013 finding common ground and solving non-core problems \u2013 won\u2019t defuse the deeper divisions. Sino-American tensions aren\u2019t simply about a lack of goodwill or diplomatic mechanisms, says Ashley Tellis, a senior associate at Carnegie and coauthor of a report published in April that advocates a hawkish US stance on China. \u201cThese are fundamental clashes of interest. There\u2019s nothing in Kevin\u2019s report that tells me how to circumnavigate these clashes.\u201d\n\nRudd argues that Xi may be open to a \u201cgrand strategic bargain\u201d with the US on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Other analysts have proposed that a parallel formula be found for Taiwan, whereby the US stops selling weapons in return for a Chinese pledge not to force reunification. Mr. Bader, who was Obama\u2019s principal adviser on Asia from 2009 to 2011, is skeptical of sweeping quid pro quo deals. \u201cThey don\u2019t happen. Every issue is unique and disaggregated and has its own set of bureaucratic actors involved,\u201d he says.\n\nProfessor Nathan discounts the likelihood of any great-\n\npower accommodation, too, which he likens to the 1815 Congress of Vienna. \u201cI think there will be a long period of friction over these particular issues. I don\u2019t think they can be settled upfront by some kind of compromise.\u201d\n\nRudd doesn\u2019t linger on the consequences of the US ceding ground to China in Asia. Yet even a gradual rebalancing would mark a major shift, says White, author of a 2013 book, \u201cThe China Choice: Why America Should Share Power.\u201d He says Rudd needs to be frank about what it means to the US to begin to treat China as a peer. \u201cKevin is trying to say you can do this and it\u2019s not going to hurt. But this is going to hurt.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSince leaving office, Rudd has kept up his contacts in China. He attends academic gatherings and has been invited to speak at military-run events. While his Belfer study refers to \u201csenior Chinese interlocutors,\u201d Rudd is cagey about whom he meets with. \u201cIt\u2019s far better to talk to folks when you can when opportunities arise, in Beijing or Washington, but not to make a song and dance about it,\u201d he tells me.\n\nIn 2008, Rudd asserted in a speech in Chinese at Peking University that he was a zhengyou, a sincere friend who would speak frankly to China. But his charm offensive flopped after WikiLeaks revealed that he also spoke frankly to America about China. In 2014, Bob Carr, who succeeded Rudd as Australian foreign minister, wrote in a memoir that his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, had said of Rudd, \u201cYou know, in China ... some people love him ... and some people ... hate him!\u201d\n\nIn Washington, Rudd has cultivated policymakers on both sides of the aisle, though his personal connections are strongest among Democrats, including foreign-\n\npolicy advisers to Mrs. Clinton. In 2009, Obama called Rudd two weeks after the president\u2019s first inauguration. After he was demoted to foreign minister, Rudd continued to meet with Obama\u2019s national security adviser. Rudd is still consulted on China by the Obama administration, says Mr. Nealer, who notes his briefings \u201cappeal to senior policymakers who crave insights without agendas.\u201d\n\nWhile China may be the reason the White House calls, in his new position at the Asia Society, Rudd has a broad portfolio. One morning in July, I joined a small group at the launch of an ASPI task force chaired by Rudd to promote Indian membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping. The next day, he held an hour-long teleconference briefing on Japan. On the third day, I attended a panel on the Iran nuclear deal, which drew a large crowd to the eighth floor of the Asia Society as the evening sun glanced off the platinum-priced apartments of Park Avenue nearby.\n\nFlanked by a former US ambassador and an Iranian-born researcher, Rudd used his introductory remarks to emphasize the historic challenge of nuclear proliferation. He then segued into a self-deprecatory joke about being unable to find his way around New York. As a moderator, Rudd is brisk and sure-footed. Still, just as he did at the earlier event on India, Rudd casually let slip his own bona fides. \u201cI was just talking to the Chinese mission at the UN, just a few days ago,\u201d he said, and added that China takes some pride in its role in the Iranian negotiations.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nIt\u2019s a claim that anyone could probably adduce from public statements. But coming from Rudd it has the ring of authority.\n\nAs the Iran panel broke up, Rudd lingered to greet invitees and mingle with the public. From the back of the room, I watched a group of six button-down students from a Jesuit high school approach Rudd for a photo. Their teacher explained to me that the boys were all members of the debating club, and had been studying the Iran deal. Smiling, Rudd turned to them and said, \u201cHi, boys. I\u2019m Kevin.\u201d",
