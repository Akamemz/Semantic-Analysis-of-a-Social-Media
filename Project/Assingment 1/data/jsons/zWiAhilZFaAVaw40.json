    "content": "When it comes to impeachment , the court of public opinion is the court that matters .\nOn Thursday , the New York Times published yet another of its almost-weekly scoops about the Trump administration . This time , reporter Michael Schmidt detailed claims that Trump tried to use his White House counsel to lobby Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation , White House lawyers deliberately withheld accurate legal information from Trump as part of an apparent effort to stop him from firing Comey , and an aide to Jeff Sessions reportedly attempted to gather \u201c dirt \u201d on James Comey before Comey \u2019 s termination .\nThe article was framed around allegations that the president had potentially obstructed justice during the Russia investigation , and Schmidt noted that legal experts are \u201c divided \u201d as to whether there already exists enough evidence to bring an obstruction charge . In fact , immediately after the Times published its piece , the excellent Lawfare blog posted a special-edition podcast analyzing whether these new details materially advanced an obstruction case . The article did nothing to change my own view that so far there is insufficient publicly available evidence to conclude that Trump violated federal law .\nBut rather than spending time parsing the article and the relevant statutes , it \u2019 s time for some plain talk about impeachment . Any impeachment analysis will not ultimately turn on whether Trump violated the law . If we want to accurately analyze the prospects for impeachment , we have to understand that impeachment isn \u2019 t a legal proceeding . As my colleague Andrew McCarthy has explained in book-length detail , it \u2019 s a political process that \u2019 s influenced by legal arguments . The political branches of government make the decision . Members of the Congress \u2014 not the federal judiciary \u2014 determine if a president has committed \u201c high crimes and misdemeanors \u201d that require his removal from office .\nUnderstanding this reality helps us understand the recent past . Why was Bill Clinton able to survive in 1998 in the face of overwhelming evidence that he committed perjury and obstructed justice ? He was a popular president governing in a time of peace and prosperity . His average approval rating for his second term was a whopping 61 percent . House impeachment managers came forward with ample evidence of misconduct , but there was no chance that Democrat senators would vote to convict . Not only did the public ( and much of the media ) back the Democratic party in spite of the law , they arguably voted to punish Republicans for their impeachment efforts in the 1998 midterms .\nWhat about Richard Nixon ? As the Watergate scandal drip-dripped into the public square , overwhelming evidence of guilt accumulated , and the media thirsted for the president \u2019 s political blood , his approval rating plunged . He maintained a \u201c loyal core \u201d of 25 percent , but his disapproval spiked into the mid-sixties . Both men violated the law , but two different presidents operating in two different political environments achieved very different outcomes .\nThe lesson to take isn \u2019 t \u201c unpopular presidents get impeached. \u201d After all , George W. Bush hit dismal lows in his second term , but he never faced a realistic impeachment threat . The lesson instead is that the combination of credible claims of corruption or abuse of power , opposition-party control , and low public approval can drive a president out of office . Alter any one of these factors , and the president stays .\nThe combination of credible claims of corruption or abuse of power , opposition-party control , and low public approval can drive a president out of office .

Instead , he \u2019 ll face Congress , and Congress faces the people \u2019 s court .\nSo , where does Trump stand now ? He \u2019 s in more peril than his supporters may understand .
