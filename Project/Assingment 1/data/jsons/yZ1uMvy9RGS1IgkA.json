    "content": "Wiping away tears for schoolchildren gunned down three years ago , President Obama said Tuesday he \u2019 s imposing new gun regulations by executive action because Congress refuses to pass gun measures that could prevent more mass shootings in the U.S .\nThe president directed government agencies to take several steps to restrict gun ownership , the most significant of which is expanding background checks on some gun sales such as online transactions that have skirted the requirement .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s move circumventing Congress on guns immediately drew battle lines for the 2016 elections , with Republican presidential candidates vowing to overturn Mr. Obama \u2019 s actions and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton promising to build on the president \u2019 s \u201c progress . \u201d\nGun rights advocates said Mr. Obama \u2019 s action is misguided , will not make people safer and has instantly energized conservatives in an election year . Gun control groups said their movement now has unprecedented momentum .\n\u201c The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now , but they can not hold America hostage , \u201d Mr. Obama declared as he outlined the new regulations at the White House . \u201c We do not have to accept this carnage as the price of freedom . \u201d\nSen. Marco Rubio , the Florida Republican running for president , released a new television ad Tuesday saying that Mr. Obama plans to \u201c take away our guns , \u201d and America needs a president \u201c who will keep us safe \u201d from terrorists .\nThe president \u2019 s 10 steps on guns include $ 500 million more in federal funding for treating mental illness \u2014 a move that would likely need congressional approval \u2014 and tightening the reporting requirement for guns that are lost or stolen in transit .\nOn Capitol Hill the reaction was split mainly along party lines . Speaker Paul D. Ryan , Wisconsin Republican , said Mr. Obama is engaging in \u201c a form of intimidation that undermines liberty . \u201d\n\u201c He knows full well that the law already says that people who make their living selling firearms must be licensed , regardless of venue , \u201d Mr. Ryan said . \u201c Still , rather than focus on criminals and terrorists , he goes after the most law-abiding of citizens . \u201d\nThe speaker vowed that Congress will conduct \u201c vigilant oversight \u201d on the president \u2019 s moves .\n\u201c No matter what President Obama says , his word does not trump the Second Amendment , \u201d Mr. Ryan said . \u201c His executive order will no doubt be challenged in the courts . Ultimately , everything the president has done can be overturned by a Republican president , which is another reason we must win in November . \u201d\nSen. Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat , said Mr. Obama \u2019 s action will \u201c bring some sanity to our gun laws and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and other potentially dangerous individuals . \u201d\nIn announcing the steps , Mr. Obama surrounded himself with survivors of mass shootings and family members of victims in the East Room event , including former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona . He said there was \u201c a lot of heartache \u201d in the room .\nDuring his 40-minute address , the president brushed away tears as he spoke about the 20 children who were murdered at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut in 2012 , which prompted a failed push in Congress to expand background checks on gun purchases .\n\u201c First-graders , \u201d Mr. Obama said , brushing tears from his face . \u201c Every time I hear about those kids , it makes me mad . And , by the way , it happens on the streets of Chicago every day . \u201d\nDan Gross , president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , met with Mr. Obama before the event and told him that the group \u2019 s late founders , Sarah and Jim Brady , were \u201c looking down smiling \u201d on the president . They hugged .\nMr. Brady was the press secretary to President Reagan who was grievously wounded in an assassination attempt on the president in 1981 .\nIn the East Room Mr . Gross said it was \u201c deeply moving to watch the president wipe tears from his eyes . \u201d\n\u201c It is clear that these are the actions of a man who is pure in his intent , doing whatever he can to save lives , \u201d he said , calling the day \u201c truly historic . \u201d\nMr. Obama said his actions are designed \u201c not to debate the last mass shooting , but to do something to try to prevent the next one. \u201d While he said he wasn \u2019 t motivated solely by mass shootings in the U.S. , he mentioned them prominently and listed a series of mass shootings from Sandy Hook to the terrorist attack in December in San Bernardino , California .\nThe president said he supports the Second Amendment , but said the rights of gun owners are interfering with other constitutional rights .\n\u201c Second Amendment rights are important , but there are other rights that we care about as well , \u201d the president said . \u201c Our right to worship freely and safely \u2014 that right was denied to Christians in Charleston , South Carolina . And that was denied Jews in Kansas City . And that was denied Muslims in Chapel Hill , and Sikhs in Oak Creek . They had rights too . Our right to peaceful assembly \u2014 that right was robbed from moviegoers in Aurora and Lafayette . Our unalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness \u2014 those rights were stripped from college students in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara , and from high schoolers at Columbine , and from first-graders in Newtown .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not on the ballot again ; I \u2019 m not looking to score some points , \u201d the president said . \u201c But we do have to feel a sense of urgency about it .

That \u2019 s very concerning . \u201d\n\u201c This may just be a temporary victory for him in theory as he pleases his base , \u201d Mr. Pratt said . \u201c It certainly has rallied our base . In the end , he may realize that doing this in an election year was a grave mistake . \u201d\nMr. Obama \u2019 s action also incorporates a move by the Social Security Administration to include information in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) about beneficiaries who are deemed incapable of handling their own finances and are prohibited from owning firearms .
