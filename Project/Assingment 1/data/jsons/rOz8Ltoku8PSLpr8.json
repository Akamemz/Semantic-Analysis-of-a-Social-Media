    "content": "Rep. Luis Gutierrez \u2019 s endorsement of Paul Ryan for Speaker of the House has drawn new attention to Ryan \u2019 s two-decade history of pushing for open borders immigration policies . A previously little noticed 2013 video of Ryan and Gutierrez stumping for Sen. Marco Rubio \u2019 s amnesty bill\u2014in which the two make a candid pitch for unlimited immigration\u2014shows just how far Ryan is willing to go to push for open borders policies .\nIn the wide-ranging 53 minute video , which took place in Chicago , both Gutierrez and Ryan outline their shared plan for adopting open borders : that is , a national policy of allowing companies to bring in and hire as many foreign workers as they would like . This \u201c free movement \u201d of people across national boundaries is the centerpiece of the open borders ideology to which Ryan has devoted much of his career .\nThe video is entitled : \u201c Rep . Paul Ryan and Rep. Luis Gutierrez Push For Immigration Reform. \u201d The two Congressional partners lay out an immigration plan that is far more radical in scope than many would have imagined , and absent from virtually all major media coverage of the Ryan speakership push . The video gives fresh insight into what legislation Paul Ryan would advance\u2014 and what legislation he would block\u2014if given the Speaker \u2019 s gavel .\nIn the video , Ryan begins by adopting a left-wing narrative about GOP voters and suggesting that their opposition to mass migration is fueled by \u201c ignorance. \u201d Ryan rejects the idea that America is \u201c a country \u201d \u2014 i.e . a land with a fixed border and heritage\u2014but instead an \u201c idea \u201d since ideas don \u2019 t have borders .\n[ America ] is not just a country . America is an idea . It \u2019 s an idea that people from all over the world to aspire to achieve\u2026 There is no other economic system , no other immigration system that has done more to lift people out of poverty than the American free enterprise system , and American immigration system that we have here . That \u2019 s what makes us proud . So the question is : what do we do to restore this ? [ \u2026 ] We \u2019 ve had plenty of waves of immigration that have always been met with resistance in the past\u2014the Irish wave is just but one of them . Each wave is met with some ignorance , is met with some resistance .\nRyan appears to be taking a page from his mentor Jack Kemp , who\u2014 as Ann Coulter has written\u2014 had a habit of smearing blue-collar voters of his own party if they opposed his expansionist agenda .\nRyan \u2019 s retelling of history leaves out critical facts . The history of the United States is not one of immigration but assimilation .\nAfter the immigration wave from 1880-1920 , immigration was cut off . There was no net immigration increase for fifty straight years in order to melt European immigrants into society . Ignoring this history , Ryan is arguing that the unprecedentedly-large non-European wave of the last fifty years should be followed by an even bigger wave that is already happening .\nIn fact , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported , Ryan was integral in derailing a 1990s bipartisan push to cut immigration \u2013 thereby repudiating the historical assimilation policy of the United States .\nGutierrez praises Ryan \u2019 s history of sabotaging conservative immigration reforms and embracing progressive ones .\nI want to share something\u2026 I saw Paul\u2014 Congressman Ryan\u2014 and we were talking . And he\u2014 I just want you to know that when he worked for Kemp , and he was a staffer there , they were against Proposition 187 in California . I want you to know\u2014 because people think , \u2018 Oh , he just showed up lately on the scene on immigration \u2019 \u2014 No , he has a history on this issue . And I want you to know that in 2005 when [ Jeff ] Flake and I introduced comprehensive immigration bill\u2026 and Kennedy and McCain was the first bipartisan , bi-cameral bill\u2026 Paul Ryan was an original cosponsor of comprehensive immigration reform . And I want to share one last thing with you . There was a day that we were in his office , and I \u2019 ll apologize to him later , and he said to me , \u2018 Well , Luis , I don \u2019 t want to do it because it \u2019 s the political thing to do , I want to do it cause it \u2019 s the right thing to do. \u2019 And he said , \u2018 You know , you and I are Catholics and our Catholic values do not allow us to create a permanent underclass. \u2019 And you know what ? My heart soared that day . I mean I could walk so much easier that day . I felt strengthened that day by his words .\n\u201c Luis is right , \u201d Ryan declared . \u201c I \u2019 ve worked on this issue back since the early 90s . And many Republican and Democrat coalitions trying to make this system work . \u201d\nRyan \u2019 s work in the 90s helped add another 10 million immigrants to the United States , according to the President of NumbersUSA Roy Beck .\nIn the video , Ryan seemed proud of the role he was playing in completing the Rubio-Schumer amnesty push :\nFor the first time in a long time I really believe that we have an opportunity to have a real , long-term solution\u2026 and it \u2019 s because like Luis Gutierrez , and Paul Ryan [ i.e . referring to himself in third person ] , and everybody in between are talking to each other in a sincere way , to come together , to find common ground to once and for all get this done\u2026 I really think we are the farthest on the path ever since I \u2019 ve been looking at this issue and I \u2019 ve been in Congress for 15 years .\nThe Rubio-Schumer bill would have issued 33 million green cards in ten years\u2014or 33 new immigrants for every one South Carolina GOP voter . South Carolina is significant because one of Ryan \u2019 s other partners in trying to push an immigration expansion is Congressman Mick Mulvaney .\nRyan and Gutierrez then proceeded to lay out their plan for open borders . Again , open borders refers to a policy of allowing people to freely and legally enter the a country without any firm limits . For instance , for European countries within the European Union , people are entitled to move freely from one country to another . Ryan lays out how the same legal structure could be adopted for the United States and all the foreign countries of the world .\nRyan describes this \u201c open \u201d immigration system and how it will replace American workers :\nWe need to let legal immigrants come here legally . We can \u2019 t have a system where we pay homage and adherence to the rule of law if we don \u2019 t have an open system where people can come here in search of their American dream , where the work that won \u2019 t be done by people who are already here can be filled by the people who want to come here and do those jobs .\nNational Review \u2019 s Rich Lowry once declared that Republican politicians who argue there are jobs Americans won \u2019 t do\u2014or to use Ryan \u2019 s words \u201c work that won \u2019 t be done by people who are already here \u201d \u2014 \u201c that person should be shot , he should be hanged , he should be wrapped in a carpet and thrown in the Potomac River . \u201d\nMoreover , Ryan \u2019 s statement is simply not logical\u2014the United States already has the most expansive immigration policy in the world , letting tens of millions of foreign nationals legally enter the U.S. , vote in U.S. elections , and claim U.S benefits .\nThe Kennedy-pushed 1965 immigration rewrite eliminated President Calvin Coolidge \u2019 s immigration caps and opened up American immigration visas to almost anyone in the world . Year after year , as a result of our current policy , the United States admits one million plus foreign nationals on green cards , one million guest workers , dependents and refugees , and half a million foreign youths sought by college administration . Because of our vast admissions policy , America has four times more immigrants living here than has any other country on the planet . Yet Ryan is arguing that this is not enough , that the United States should effectively have a legal free movement clause with the world .\n\u201c We need to clear the backlog of green cards , \u201d Ryan declared .\nBut the backlog is a term invented by immigration expansionists to say anyone who wants a U.S. green card should be giving the green card . Ironically , most of the people who have applied for the millions of green cards Ryan wants expedited come from poor countries are likely to favor big government policies like Obamacare .\nRyan then outlined his plan to grant amnesty to the illegal aliens , in addition to all the foreign nationals to whom Ryan wants to give expedited admission slips :\nWe have to offer people a path to earned legalization . We have to invite people to come out of the shadows\u2026 We need to make sure that the children who are here , who are brought here , who did not choose to come here , who were brought by their parents\u2013 that they have an ability to earn citizenship in a far faster way . These are the things that we think are the principles that Republicans and Democrats can come together on .\nBy arguing that speedy citizenship should be guaranteed to any illegal alien brought here by his or her parents , Ryan has made another argument for open borders . There are two billion youth in the world ; under Ryan \u2019 s theory , if any of their parents smuggle them into the United States , the parents should be made voting citizens . As former USCIS Director Ken Palinkas has explained , granting amnesty to illegal immigrant minors , \u201c extend [ s ] birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries \u201d and represents a promise of \u201c perpetual amnesty . \u201d\nRyan explained that his position on immigration is in part motivated by his belief that American workers should be replaced : \u201c We want an economic based immigration system where\u2026 labor and supply and demand can meet each other so we can help fuel our economy and create jobs , \u201d Ryan said .\nThe phrase \u201c labor supply and demand can meet each other , \u201d is a centerpiece of open borders thought . Under this global one-world theory , any willing employer should be able to hire any willing worker regardless of what country they live in . This view , that America is an \u201c idea \u201d and not a \u201c nation \u201d sees borders as an obstacle to commerce .\nDemonstrating how outside-the-mainstream Ryan \u2019 s view is here , a recent poll from KellyAnne Conway \u2019 s The Polling Company found that only four percent of the entire country believes that American workers should not get preference for jobs over those applying from foreign countries .\nHowever , Ryan goes even further than the four percent by suggesting there should be no limits at all \u2013 that employers should be able to legally hire foreigners whenever they want and in any quantity .\nEven though there are currently 94 million Americans operating outside of the workforce , Paul Ryan argues that we need to increase low-skilled immigration so that foreign laborers can come and go to fill any job they please .\nWe want to have a system where people can come here and work\u2013 go back and forth if they want to\u2026 so that we have an open door to the people who want to come and contribute to our country , who want to come and make a difference in their families \u2019 lives , and our economy\u2026 That \u2019 s why we have all of these various principles that we agree work if we put this together\u2026 and that \u2019 s why it \u2019 s very encouraging to see Republicans and Democrats coming together on this issue .\nAgain , Ryan is here articulating the open borders vision of the \u201c free movement \u201d of people across international boundaries . What the EU has among solely European countries \u2013 over the objections of rising insurgent populist parties \u2013 Ryan would like America to have with every country on the planet .\nRyan also expressed his desire to give away coveted white-collar jobs : \u201c You have to have a workable guest worker system . You have to have a system so that high-tech employers can get high-tech entrepreneurs . \u201d\nGutierrez confirmed their plan to increase foreign labor to compete for middle class American jobs . When the two were asked about the next step in their legislative plans , Gutierrez answered for them as Ryan looked on sympathetically while Gutierrez attacked American workers who \u201c do not have the talent \u201d necessary to fill American jobs .\nWe \u2019 ve been working with our Republican colleagues in putting legislation together , and it will have some of the very elements that Congressman Ryan and I have described . I mean , if you collect together what he has said and I have said , you kind of the get the general out [ of the plan ] \u2026 We \u2019 re going to have a worker program and in the high tech industry we \u2019 re going to tell people , \u2018 Look , there are tens of thousands of jobs at Microsoft and Intel and the STEM industry needs . Tens of thousands that go unfilled because we do not have the talent graduating from our own universities , so this tells us that we have some work to do in terms of sending kids\u2026 so we \u2019 re going to invite people to come into the system that can fill [ these jobs ] .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 has previously reported , there is in fact an 11-million person surplus of STEM-certified Americans . Many of these American workers have been forced to train their foreign replacements before the company lets them go , as one terminated Disney employee documented exclusively for \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Gutierrez claims that Microsoft has thousands of jobs available , but in the last year , Microsoft actually announced plans to lay off more than 18,000 workers while simultaneously lobbying for legislation championed by Ryan , Gutierrez , and Rubio that would increase the number of low-wage tech workers brought in to take American jobs .\nRyan confirmed Gutierrez \u2019 s analysis : \u201c What Luis and I are putting out there are the basic components of a system that we want to endure . We don \u2019 t want to be having this conversation five years from now because we just did piecemeal reform\u2026 so that \u2019 s why we \u2019 re talking about all of these things together . \u201d\nThroughout the entire exchange , it was clear that Ryan got along with Gutierrez personally and intimately . At one point during the discussion , after Ryan gently teased Gutierrez for making faces at him , Gutierrez stroked Ryan \u2019 s arm and then rested his head on Ryan \u2019 s shoulder as Ryan laughed comfortably . The two were clearly at ease with one another .\nGutierrez continued told audience members at the event that new arrivals are more entrepreneurial than those who have been in the United States for a longer period of time . Gutierrez seemed excited about the prospect of transforming America \u2019 s economy so that it more closely mirrored that of the street-vendors economy of developing countries in Latin America where wares are sold on street corners to impoverished families :\nIt seems to me that the closer you are to the moment you arrived in America , the more entrepreneurial you are\u2026 It just cause I see people in the neighborhood that just get here and I see a grown man and he \u2019 s forty , forty-five years old and he \u2019 s selling cotton candy on a long pole that \u2019 s maybe 10 feet up and he \u2019 s out there because he \u2019 s going to make a dollar doing that . I just see people on every corner just selling stuff and creating businesses , that entrepreneurial spirit is there , we want to bring it to the forefront .\nRyan nodded his head up and down with vigor in agreement .\nRyan explained to the audience , \u201c This [ i.e . immigration ] is one of those unique issues where a Democrat and a Republican\u2013 and there are plenty others in Congress\u2013 see that this is important for the vitality of our economy . \u201d\nTo modernize our laws , so that we can maintain national security and if we meet this moment , all of the faith in divided government\u2013 I \u2019 m joking here , but there is no faith in our divided government , we haven \u2019 t gotten anything done of record , of seriousness , in a long time , that \u2019 s an uncertainty tax that I think is plaguing this economy , \u2018 Those guys in Washington can \u2019 t get anything right , they never get anything done \u2019 \u2013 this would be an opportunity to prove them [ the American people ] wrong . This would be an opportunity to prove that in this country divided government can actually work and make a difference .\nOn a note of camaraderie , Ryan declared , \u201c It \u2019 s very encouraging to see Republicans and Democrats coming together on this issue . \u201d\nRyan also introduced a theme that would soon become Marco Rubio \u2019 s campaign theme . It offers a veiled allusion to how great life will be in a \u201c New American Century \u201d brought about by Rubio-Ryan Republicans :",

Many of these American workers have been forced to train their foreign replacements before the company lets them go, as one terminated Disney employee documented exclusively for Breitbart News. Gutierrez claims that Microsoft has thousands of jobs available, but in the last year, Microsoft actually announced plans to lay off more than 18,000 workers while simultaneously lobbying for legislation championed by Ryan, Gutierrez, and Rubio that would increase the number of low-wage tech workers brought in to take American jobs.\n\nRyan confirmed Gutierrez\u2019s analysis: \u201cWhat Luis and I are putting out there are the basic components of a system that we want to endure. We don\u2019t want to be having this conversation five years from now because we just did piecemeal reform\u2026 so that\u2019s why we\u2019re talking about all of these things together.\u201d\n\nThroughout the entire exchange, it was clear that Ryan got along with Gutierrez personally and intimately. At one point during the discussion, after Ryan gently teased Gutierrez for making faces at him, Gutierrez stroked Ryan\u2019s arm and then rested his head on Ryan\u2019s shoulder as Ryan laughed comfortably. The two were clearly at ease with one another.\n\nGutierrez continued told audience members at the event that new arrivals are more entrepreneurial than those who have been in the United States for a longer period of time. Gutierrez seemed excited about the prospect of transforming America\u2019s economy so that it more closely mirrored that of the street-vendors economy of developing countries in Latin America where wares are sold on street corners to impoverished families:\n\nIt seems to me that the closer you are to the moment you arrived in America, the more entrepreneurial you are\u2026 It just cause I see people in the neighborhood that just get here and I see a grown man and he\u2019s forty, forty-five years old and he\u2019s selling cotton candy on a long pole that\u2019s maybe 10 feet up and he\u2019s out there because he\u2019s going to make a dollar doing that. I just see people on every corner just selling stuff and creating businesses, that entrepreneurial spirit is there, we want to bring it to the forefront.\n\nRyan nodded his head up and down with vigor in agreement.\n\nRyan explained to the audience, \u201cThis [i.e. immigration] is one of those unique issues where a Democrat and a Republican\u2013 and there are plenty others in Congress\u2013 see that this is important for the vitality of our economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d Ryan declared:\n\nTo modernize our laws, so that we can maintain national security and if we meet this moment, all of the faith in divided government\u2013 I\u2019m joking here, but there is no faith in our divided government, we haven\u2019t gotten anything done of record, of seriousness, in a long time, that\u2019s an uncertainty tax that I think is plaguing this economy, \u2018Those guys in Washington can\u2019t get anything right, they never get anything done\u2019\u2013 this would be an opportunity to prove them [the American people] wrong. This would be an opportunity to prove that in this country divided government can actually work and make a difference.\n\nOn a note of camaraderie, Ryan declared, \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging to see Republicans and Democrats coming together on this issue.\u201d\n\nRyan also introduced a theme that would soon become Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign theme. It offers a veiled allusion to how great life will be in a \u201cNew American Century\u201d brought about by Rubio-Ryan Republicans:",
