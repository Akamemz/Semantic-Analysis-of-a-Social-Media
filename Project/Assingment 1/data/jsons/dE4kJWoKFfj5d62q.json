But to others , it was a painful example of African Americans forced to respond to acts of violence with understanding , writes Barrett Holmes Pitner .\nOn Wednesday , former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger , 31 , who is white , was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of her neighbour Botham Jean , who was black . She will be eligible for parole in 5 years .\nGuyger 's conviction was seen as a moment of justice for many observers since it is still relatively rare for police officers to be convicted of unlawful killings in America , yet many onlookers also thought her sentence was too lenient . However , the true shock occurred as Guyger received a profound - and controversial - amount of compassion from her victim 's family and the judge .\nFollowing Guyger 's sentencing , Jean 's 18-year-old brother Brandt took the stand and said `` I forgive you '' and `` I love you as a person and I do n't wish anything bad on you , '' before leaving the stand so that he could embrace Guyger .\nTheir hug lasted nearly a minute as those in the courtroom openly wept from this stunning show of compassion .\nSome seasoned court commentators described it as the most powerful moment they had ever seen in a courtroom .
