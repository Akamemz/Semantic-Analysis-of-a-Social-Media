Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 10 , 2018\nSpeaking with reporters at the Oval Office on Friday , Trump lavished praise on Porter , who announced his resignation on Wednesday . The president said he hopes Porter has a \u201c wonderful career \u201d ahead of him and pointed out that Porter said the allegations aren \u2019 t true . \u201c Now he also , as you probably know , he says he \u2019 s innocent , \u201d he said . \u201c And I think you have to remember that . He said very strongly yesterday that he \u2019 s innocent . So you \u2019 ll have to talk to him about that . But we absolutely wish him well , he did a very good job while he was at the White House . \u201d\nThe White House \u2019 s response to the Porter allegations hasn \u2019 t been great , to say the least\nThe Daily Beast reported on Friday that Trump has privately expressed doubts about the Porter assault allegations and has repeatedly asked whether there are reasons Porter \u2019 s ex-wives , Colbie Holderness ( who released the black eye picture ) and Jennifer Willoughby ( who filed an emergency protection order against him ) , might lie .\nThe White House and some Republicans initially supported Porter . After the allegations surfaced , White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R-UT ) , whom Porter worked for , came to Porter \u2019 s defense , vouching for his character and saying he shouldn \u2019 t resign \u2014 although they both backed off somewhat days later . Kelly released a statement saying there is \u201c no place for domestic violence in our society , \u201d though he clarified \u201c every individual deserves the right to defend their reputation. \u201d Hatch said Porter is a \u201c good guy \u201d but \u201c there \u2019 s enough there to take it very seriously . \u201d\nIt also appears many in the White House , including Kelly and White House counsel Don McGahn , knew about the allegations against Porter long before they surfaced this week .\n( \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Andrew Prokop has a full explainer of the Porter allegations and the White House \u2019 s handling of it here . )\nThat Trump would brush aside assault allegations is really not surprising\nTrump has a long history of both employing and defending men accused of harming women , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Anna North pointed out .\nSteve Bannon , CEO of Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign and White House chief strategist until August 2017 , was charged in 1996 with domestic violence , battery , and dissuading a witness . Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was charged with battery in March 2016 after a Breitbart reporter , Michelle Fields , reported he had forcibly grabbed her . ( A prosecutor declined to proceed with the case . ) Andrew Puzder , Trump \u2019 s initial nominee for secretary of labor , was accused of assault and battery by his ex-wife , Lisa Fierstein , and he eventually withdrew from consideration for the Cabinet post .\nIn November , Trump backed Roy Moore , the Republican candidate for the US Senate seat in Alabama previously held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who was accused of assaulting a 14-year-old girl and pursuing dates with other teenage girls when he was in his 30s . \u201c He totally denies it , \u201d the president said of the allegations against Moore . Trump also came to the defense of ousted Fox News host Bill O \u2019 Reilly , who faced sexual harassment claims from multiple women and had a $ 32 million settlement with one accuser . Trump in April 2017 said O \u2019 Reilly is a \u201c good person \u201d who he doesn \u2019 t think \u201c did anything wrong . \u201d\nAnd , of course , there are multiple allegations against Trump himself , which he \u2019 s denied . The president has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 17 women , including his ex-wife Ivana , who reportedly said at a 1990 divorce deposition that he pulled out a fistful of her hair and raped her . ( In 2015 she responded to a Daily Beast story , saying that the alleged rape was \u201c without merit. \u201d ) Trump was also caught on the now-infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape bragging about sexual assault . \u201c Grab \u2018 em by the pussy , \u201d he said on the tape .\nTrump \u2019 s Saturday tweet was probably prompted by the Porter allegations and their immediate fallout . It also reflects his take on abuse and assault allegations against men by women : Some of them might be true , but a lot probably aren \u2019 t , and even if they are , who cares if it happened a long time ago , anyway ?\nAnd why wouldn \u2019 t he think that ? For Trump , there haven \u2019 t been any consequences .
