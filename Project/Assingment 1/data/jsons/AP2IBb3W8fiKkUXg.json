    "content": "Joe Biden is sharing the presidential primary \u2019 s top tier with two progressive senators . One , he says , levied an unprompted attack against his commitment to the Democratic Party and exhibits \u201c elitist \u201d behavior . The other , he stresses with striking frequency , is \u201c honest \u201d and , in the most Senate-speak way , a friend .\n\u201c Bernie \u2019 s been honest ; he \u2019 s going to raise taxes on middle class , \u201d Biden said in July at a convention in Detroit about Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2019 ( I-VT ) approach to funding Medicare for All , a progressive policy that Biden \u2019 s campaign says is not the best way to cover Americans \u2019 health care needs .\nSince then , the former vice president become more consistent with his praise . \u201c First and foremost , the thing you must do in public life is be honest with the public , \u201d he said on Monday night during a CNN town hall addressing the same topic . \u201c Bernie 's been honest . \u201d\nThe same amount of honesty on the subject , he suggested , does not apply to Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) , who waited longer than her primary rivals to release details of her Medicare for All proposal , including the funding behind it . \u201c Let 's get something straight . She attacked me ! \u201d Biden said during the town hall about Warren , who suggested he is running in the wrong party \u2019 s primary and accused him of repeating Republican talking points . \u201c It \u2019 s not about her , \u201d he added when asked by the moderator about calling her \u201c elitist. \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s about the attitude that exists right now . If you disagree with me , you must be bad . \u201d\nThat dynamic \u2014 Biden responding to or ramping up criticism of Warren , while oftentimes going out of his way to praise Sanders \u2019 honesty \u2014 has been escalating in recent weeks . With less than three months until the Iowa caucuses , the former vice president has sharpened his messaging against the Massachusetts senator over substance and style , and has largely left Sanders , who also remains a top-tier contender for the Democratic nomination , alone .\nWhile the two politicians in their late seventies voted in opposite directions on a variety of high-stakes decisions ( including to authorize the Iraq War and NAFTA , which Biden was for and Sanders was against ) , they have enjoyed a generally collegial Senate relationship . Sanders often refers to Biden as his \u201c good friend \u201d whom he disagrees with on many issues . And Biden tends to do the same .\n\u201c I know genuinely the senator does have a respect for Vice President Biden , \u201d a senior Sanders 2020 campaign adviser told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c They \u2019 ll joust on the debate stage , that \u2019 s as far as it will go . \u201d\nIn contrast , his relationship with Warren , dating back at least 17 years , is illustrated in vivid detail during a 2005 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over a bankruptcy bill that Biden supported and Warren was adamantly against . There were several terse exchanges leaving little doubt what the two thought of each other . But even before that hearing , Warren was not a fan . In her 2003 book , The Two-Income Trap : Why Middle-Class Parents Are Going Broke , Warren wrote that Biden \u2019 s support of the bill that she believed hurt low-income women in particular was hypocritical . \u201c Senators like Joe Biden should not be allowed to sell out women in the morning and be heralded as their friend in the evening , \u201d she wrote . In 2013 , when Warren was being sworn into the Senate , Biden quipped : \u201c You gave me hell . \u201d\n\u201c The personal animus is a big part of it , \u201d Karthik Ganapathy , who served as the battleground states communications director for Sanders \u2019 2016 campaign but is currently unattached , said about the dynamic between Biden and Warren that has largely excluded Sanders .\nBiden \u2019 s advisers say giving brownie points to Sanders for honesty is nothing more than simply conveying the timeline and fact pattern that has unfolded in the months-long health-care discussion , when he was up front with voters about raising taxes from the get-go .\n\u201c I think that [ Biden ] has acknowledged that Sanders has been upfront about it because he has , \u201d a Biden campaign adviser said about the thinking behind the praise . \u201c And [ Warren ] hasn \u2019 t . \u201d\nTo be sure , Biden \u2019 s campaign has not always left Sanders alone . Campaign officials and surrogates have frequently hit back against the Vermont Independent on Twitter and in several news stories , largely over health care , which remains a top priority for Democrats . In an October interview with CNBC , Biden \u2019 s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield questioned Sanders \u2019 \u201c credibility \u201d for declining to say how he would pay for Medicare for All .\n\u201c It \u2019 s alarming that Senator Sanders , who has been up-front for years that Medicare for All would require middle-class tax hikes , won \u2019 t tell voters \u2018 right now \u2019 how much more they will pay in taxes because of his plan , \u201d Bedingfield said . \u201c When you \u2019 re running to take on the most dishonest president in American history , \u201d she added , \u201c Senator Sanders and others who back Medicare for All have to preserve their credibility . \u201d\nBut over the past two weeks , as Biden has sharpened his response to Warren , Sanders has appeared to be less of a priority , multiple strategists , pollsters , current and former campaign advisers noted .\nBiden \u2019 s \u201c more worried about her candidacy than he is about Sanders \u2019 , \u201d Andy Smith , a University of New Hampshire pollster , said about Warren . \u201c They don \u2019 t think Sanders is as much of a threat . \u201d\nWhile Biden has fallen in some surveys in New Hampshire , the first primary state that follows just eight days after the Iowa caucus , polling averages indicate it \u2019 s a neck-and-neck race . In the latest Real Clear Politics polling average in the Granite State , Biden and Warren are dead even at 19.7 percent , with Sanders at 19 percent , representing a statistical tie .\nIn Iowa , the top tier is also volatile . The latest Monmouth University poll shows South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg narrowly topping the crowded Democratic field there , earning 22 percent of support , compared to Biden \u2019 s 19 percent , just one point away from Warren \u2019 s 18 percent . Sanders comes in a distant fourth place at 13 percent .\n\u201c If [ Biden ] drives people away from Sanders , he \u2019 s driving them into Warren \u2019 s camp , \u201d Patrick Murray , director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn another scenario : \u201c A stronger Bernie means a weaker Warren , \u201d Sean McElwee , co-founder of Data for Progress , a nonprofit progressive think tank , said .
