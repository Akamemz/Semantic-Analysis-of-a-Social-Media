Tim Kaine of Virginia has emerged as a leading contender after a methodical search , several Democrats close to the campaign say , receiving spirited backing from President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton .\nIn selecting the battleground of Florida to make her public announcement , Clinton is hoping to seize the spotlight from Republicans after their convention in Cleveland . She is set to visit Orlando and Tampa on Friday , but her new partner is not expected to join her until Saturday at a rally here at Florida International University , where the student body is more than half Hispanic .\nKaine speaks fluent Spanish , and last week , Clinton beamed at a Virginia rally as he declared : `` Estamos listos para Hillary ! '' or `` We are ready for Hillary ! ''\nClinton has yet to reveal her choice beyond her tight inner circle , fearful of it leaking before a well-orchestrated weekend rollout is set into motion . Her campaign , looking to build their email and text list , has offered supporters the chance to be the `` first to know '' their vice presidential pick , much like Barack Obama did in 2008 .\nThe focus of her search in the final days also centers on Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , according to several Democrats close to the process , confident either Kaine or Vilsack would fit her chief criteria of being a strong governing partner and ready for the presidency .\n`` She 's not going to be waffling at the 11th hour like ( Donald ) Trump , '' one Democrat close to the process said , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the secrecy surrounding the selection . `` By now , she knows who she wants and will be confident in her choice .

Cory Booker of New Jersey , who would be the first African-American vice presidential nominee . Democrats close to the process said Perez and Booker had considerable strengths , far beyond their diversity , but their limited experience in national security and government made them less likely to be selected .\nThe Clinton campaign watched the closing day of the Republican convention with great interest , particularly Trump 's speech , but decided against making an announcement early Friday morning . Her campaign is trying to rally excitement around the Democratic ticket heading into the party 's convention next week in Philadelphia .\nThe consensus , even among several Democrats close to other finalists , is that Kaine will be tapped as Clinton 's vice presidential candidate . Yet others close to Clinton still cautioned against counting out Vilsack , who has the most state and federal governing experience and the longest personal relationship with Clinton .\nFor Clinton , the selection of a running mate opens a new and important chapter in her political life .\nHer first presidential campaign ended long before any serious consideration of a running mate began , so this phase of her campaign is uncharted terrain , a moment where she can choose her own partner .\nShe was deeply involved in the selection of Al Gore to be her husband 's running mate in 1992 , but this choice is hers .
