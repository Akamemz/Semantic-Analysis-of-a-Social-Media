Brewer ordered that training materials produced to help police understand the law and its limits should be distributed throughout the state in preparation for a ruling .\nThe materials , created by a state board that sets standards for all law enforcement , include a DVD designed to help police understand the circumstances that would let them question someone about immigration status .\nThat power has been the most controversial part of the law , SB 1070 , which Mrs . Brewer signed in 2010 but was largely halted by lower federal courts as an infringement on federal powers .\nIn her order , Mrs . Brewer said the materials need to \u201c make clear that an individual \u2019 s race , color or national origin alone can not be grounds for reasonable suspicion to believe any law has been violated . \u201d\nAmong other provisions , the Arizona law requires police to check the immigration status of those they have encountered during their duties and have reasonable suspicion are in the country illegally .\nImmigrant-rights groups and civil liberties organizations said SB 1070 would lead to racial profiling , but that has yet to be tested in court .\nInstead , the Obama administration sued to halt Arizona \u2019 s law , arguing it would set the stage for a patchwork of laws throughout the country and infringe on the federal government \u2019 s exclusive rights to set immigration policy .\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in late April and is expected to rule before the end of June , when its 2011-2012 term concludes .\nDuring oral arguments the justices seemed to take a dim view of the government \u2019 s challenge to at least parts of the law , saying the state seemed to want to push federal officials to enforce their own laws rather than try to compete with them .\nThe Obama administration said it should be allowed to determine the extent of calls it gets from local authorities to respond to illegal immigrants , but the justices said the government can always ignore those calls if they want .\nThe administration appeared on firmer ground , however , when it argued Arizona should not be allowed to impose its own state penalties , such as jail time against illegal immigrants who try to seek jobs .\nIn her executive order , Mrs .
