There is no corroborating evidence either way . So the crucial questions are : How do we sit with this uncertainty ? How do we weigh the two contradictory testimonies ? How do we measure these testimonies when all of cognitive science tells us that human beings are really bad at spotting falsehood ? Should a person \u2019 s adult life be defined by something he did in high school ?\nCommentators and others may have acknowledged uncertainty on these questions for about 2.5 seconds , but then they took sides . If they couldn \u2019 t take sides based on the original evidence , they found new reasons to confirm their previous positions . Kavanaugh is too angry and dishonest . He drank beer and threw ice while in college . With tribal warfare all around , uncertainty is the one state you are not permitted to be in .\nThis , of course , led to an upsurge in base mobilization .

He has to get Spartacus-like histrionic in order to whip Democrats toward his presidential candidacy . Kavanaugh can \u2019 t just dispassionately try to disprove the allegations made against him . Instead , he gets furious and stokes up culture war rage in order to fire up the Republican base .\nThis leads to an epidemic of bigotry .

It was bigotry against Jews that got Alfred Dreyfus convicted in 1894 . It was bigotry against young black males that got the Central Park Five convicted in 1990 . It was bigotry against preppy lacrosse players that led to the bogus Duke lacrosse scandal .\nThis past month we \u2019 ve seen thousands of people convinced that they know how Kavanaugh behaved because they know how \u201c privileged \u201d people behave .
