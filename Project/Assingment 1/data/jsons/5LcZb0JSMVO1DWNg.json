    "content": "The spring 2018 primary season began in earnest Tuesday , as voters in Ohio , West Virginia , Indiana , and North Carolina went to the polls . And overall , it was a consequential night of voting , but not a shocking one . In the highest-profile races , the attention-getting outsiders for the most part went down to defeat in favor of more mainstream choices .\nFor the Senate , we now know the Republican nominees for three key races , who will challenge three Democratic senators representing states Trump won . Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin will face off with Republican state Attorney General Pat Morrisey in West Virginia , Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly will go up against Republican Mike Braun in Indiana , and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown will face Republican Rep. Jim Renacci in Ohio . These are all outcomes that the dubiously nicknamed \u201c Cocaine Mitch \u201d McConnell is happy with .\nThe matchup for the governor \u2019 s race in Ohio , one of the most important ones in the country , has also now been settled . Democrat Richard Cordray will run against Republican Mike DeWine ; both establishment favorites triumphed in their respective primaries . This will be a crucial contest for the next redistricting \u2014 and , meanwhile , the state \u2019 s voters also approved a moderate reform to that redistricting process .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wasn \u2019 t on the ballot today , but his reputation and influence were on the line in West Virginia \u2019 s Senate race .\nDon Blankenship , a former coal company CEO convicted of conspiring to violate federal mine safety laws after a disaster that killed 29 miners , was running for the GOP nod to take on Sen. Joe Manchin , and McConnell and the Republican establishment desperately hoped he wouldn \u2019 t win .\nSo Blankenship hit back , with attacks that ranged from reasonable ( he said McConnell is part of the \u201c swamp \u201d ) to racist ( he attacked McConnell \u2019 s in-laws by dubbing them \u201c his China family \u201d ) to ridiculous ( he called McConnell \u201c Cocaine Mitch \u201d for factually suspect reasons ) .\nBlankenship dominated headlines toward the end of the race , and Republicans feared they had another Roy Moore on their hands , in what would have been another major humiliation for McConnell .\nBut in the end , West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey won the primary , and Blankenship ended up in last place among the three major candidates \u2014 in a resounding victory for McConnell .\nReally , though , Blankenship \u2019 s fairly resounding defeat is also a win for basic human decency . The man is a convicted criminal whose corrupt and mismanaged company was implicated in a disaster that led to many deaths . He then tried to make a comeback by embracing racism and idiotic conspiracy theories ( he said the government caused the disaster at his mine and framed him for it ) . The 20 percent or so of the vote he got is still too much , but his last-place finish is a fitting conclusion \u2014 let \u2019 s hope it \u2019 s a conclusion , at least \u2014 of the political career of Don Blankenship .\nDemocrats lost control of the Ohio governor \u2019 s mansion back in 2010 and hope to finally reclaim it this year , particularly because the winner of November \u2019 s gubernatorial race will be in office for the next redistricting , in 2021 .\nBut the party approached Tuesday \u2019 s primary with some trepidation \u2014 because Dennis Kucinich was on the ballot .\nKucinich , a former member of Congress who ran for president in 2004 and 2008 , has long been a left-wing gadfly for the Democratic Party . But he \u2019 s also sometimes shown a tendency to defend Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and even has claimed to have seen UFOs . Establishment Democrats feared that if Kucinich won , their chances of retaking the governorship would fall drastically .\nChallenging Kucinich was Richard Cordray , the former ( and first fully confirmed ) director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , under Barack Obama . Cordray , the former attorney general of Ohio , stepped down from the CFPB last November to run for the state \u2019 s governorship . Democrats viewed him as a top recruit , but his early polling was tepid , and some feared Kucinich might have a shot .\nIn the end , though , Cordray won by a landslide . Now , the former Ohio attorney general will face the current Ohio attorney general , Republican Mike DeWine , in the high-stakes gubernatorial contest this fall .\nThe incumbent Democratic senator from Indiana , Joe Donnelly , is widely viewed as one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators running for reelection this year .\nThe moderate , anti-abortion senator won his first term in 2012 by defeating far-right GOP nominee Richard Mourdock , who blundered his way to defeat by claiming pregnancy from rape was something \u201c God intended. \u201d Republicans have long believed that win was a fluke . Furthermore , Indiana has moved sharply to the right in recent years . Obama narrowly won the state in 2008 , then lost it by about 10 points in 2012 , and Hillary Clinton lost it by 19 points in 2016 .\nSo when the GOP nomination fight to face Donnelly devolved into a remarkably vicious and negative contest , the senator and his team were naturally thrilled . Tara Golshan described how all three candidates ended up with a catchy negative nickname \u2014 \u201c Lyin \u2019 Todd \u201d Rokita , \u201c Missing \u201d Luke Messer , and \u201c Tax Hike Mike \u201d Braun . It was genuinely unclear whom Donnelly would prefer to run against .\nBut the eventual GOP winner , business owner Mike Braun , has some real strengths . He \u2019 s rich and can self-fund his campaign against Donnelly . Furthermore , unlike his two rivals , Rokita and Messer , Braun can \u2019 t be attacked as a creature of the unpopular Republican-controlled Congress .\nDonnelly \u2019 s hope is that Braun is less vetted than Rokita or Messer . Perhaps , for instance , he will be vulnerable to attacks on his business practices . But this race surely won \u2019 t be anything remotely resembling a cakewalk . Donnelly \u2019 s in for the fight of his life .\nWith Republicans having controlled the House of Representatives since 2011 , many of their incumbents are getting antsy and dreaming of becoming senators or governors .\nBut there \u2019 s a problem : That GOP-controlled House in Washington , DC , isn \u2019 t popular . And state politicians or outsider entrepreneurs may well seem like better choices to drain the swamp .\nThere was , as mentioned , Braun \u2019 s defeat of Reps. Rokita and Messer in Indiana . Morrisey , West Virginia \u2019 s attorney general , beat Rep. Evan Jenkins in that state too . Rep. Robert Pittenger of North Carolina couldn \u2019 t even hold on to his current seat in the face of a right-wing primary challenge from Mark Harris .\nThe sole bright spot for House Republicans who sought higher office was Rep. Jim Renacci \u2019 s victory in the Ohio Senate primary over banker Mike Gibbons . Even there , though , Renacci starts as a clear underdog to Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown .\nA strange thing happened during Ohio \u2019 s primary : One of the most pro-Republican-gerrymandered states in the country put an actual bipartisan deal to reform gerrymandering in front of its voters \u2014 and it passed , easily .\nPreviously , Ohio \u2019 s once-a-decade redistricting for its congressional seats was controlled by the legislature , with the governor \u2019 s approval . That meant that if one party controlled the governorship and both chambers of the legislature , they could more or less gerrymander to their hearts \u2019 content , which Republicans did last time around .\nBut Republicans and Democrats in the state came together and struck a deal that put some checks on the majority party \u2019 s power . Under it , the legislature has to try to come up with a new map supported by a big bipartisan majority . If several attempts at this fail , a one-party map can still pass , but it would expire after four years , rather than the current 10 . Additionally , legislators are instructed not to draw maps that \u201c unduly \u201d favor one party or incumbents .\nThis is , to be clear , a moderate reform at best , not a radical one . It leaves redistricting in the hands of politicians , rather than handing it over to an independent commission , as some reformers preferred . And some Democrats have questioned whether this compromise meant sacrificing the opportunity for greater and more meaningful anti-gerrymandering measures . But even a moderate gerrymandering reform has been a rare thing this decade .",
