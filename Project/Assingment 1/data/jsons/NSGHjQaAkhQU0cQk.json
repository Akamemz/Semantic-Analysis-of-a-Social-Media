The president is especially proud of the surging stock market , which he crowed about Friday morning on Twitter .\nDow goes from 18,589 on November 9 , 2016 , to 25,075 today , for a new all-time Record . Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks , Record fastest 1000 point move in history . This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda ! Jobs , Jobs , Jobs . Six trillion dollars in value created ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 5 , 2018\nBut if you look beyond the frothy heights of the Dow and S & P 500 , there \u2019 s little sign that Trump has accomplished much . Yes , he \u2019 s presiding over a gradual , fairly steady expansion left over from the Obama years . And he hasn \u2019 t tanked the economy , like some feared he might . But there \u2019 s little proof he \u2019 s done anything special to significantly boost it .\nThis isn \u2019 t a dig at Trump \u2019 s record , exactly . Aside from rare exceptions , like passing a massive stimulus bill in the middle of a recession , there typically isn \u2019 t much a president can do to dramatically alter the course of the economy on a year-to-year basisi . But it \u2019 s worth keeping in mind that Trump \u2019 s tenure has been fairly ho hum the next time someone claims he really is making the economy great again .\nStart with the labor market . On Friday , the government reported that U.S. employers added 148,000 workers to their payrolls in December . That figure will be revised a couple of times . But for now , it \u2019 s a shrug-worthy number capping off an unremarkable year of job growth . Overall , the country added 171,000 new jobs a month in 2017 , down from 187,000 in 2016 and 226,000 a month in 2015 . It \u2019 s not as if things sped up towards the end of the year , either , as Trump settled into the White House .\nSome of this slight slowdown is to be expected . Unemployment is low , at 4.1 percent . And the closer the U.S. gets to full employment , the fewer jobs we need to create in order keep everyone who wants to work employed . The point is , there hasn \u2019 t been some sort of dramatic hiring surge under Trump . We \u2019 re just seeing more of the same .\nMeanwhile , the tightening labor market still isn \u2019 t leading to much faster wage growth . Average hourly earnings for all workers rose 2.5 percent in 2017 , compared to almost 2.9 percent in 2016 . Once you take inflation ( last recorded for November ) into account , average pay has barely jumped at all .\nThere are other signs of lingering softness in the labor market , too . The employment rate for workers between the ages of 25 and 54 is still a good deal below its pre-recession peak . It \u2019 s rising , but it seems like some Americans who should be working are still on the sidelines .\nIn short , job growth is trucking along unremarkably and wage growth has actually slowed at a time when we \u2019 re still digging our way out of the crater left behind by 2008 . A golden era this is not .\nWhat about the blue collar jobs Trump promised to bring back ? On the one hand , the U.S. did add 71,000 more manufacturing jobs this year than last . But it added 62,000 fewer construction jobs . Does this have anything whatsoever to do with the president \u2019 s regulatory pruning and tax-cutting ? Who knows . But it \u2019 s not exactly boom times for hard hats .\nOne thing some serious economic commentators have tried to give Trump credit for has been this year \u2019 s surge in business investment . Last week , Binyamin Appelbaum and Jim Tankersley of the New York Times reported that thanks to Trump \u2019 s light-touch on regulation , \u201c a wave of optimism has swept over American business leaders , and it is beginning to translate into the sort of investment in new plants , equipment and factory upgrades that bolsters economic growth , spurs job creation \u2014 and may finally raise wages significantly . \u201d\nThis seems to be an overstatement at best . While it \u2019 s true that business investment has picked up the pace this year , much of that has been due to rising oil prices , which have led drillers to restart their rigs after shuttering them during the crude crash of 2015 and 2016 . As economist Dean Baker notes , at least 43 percent of this year \u2019 s increase in business investment has come from the oil and gas industry\u2014which the Bureau of Economic Analysis labels under the category \u201c mining exploration , shafts , and wells. \u201d Without all that oil drilling , investment has been good , but not necessarily something to write a sweeping article about .
