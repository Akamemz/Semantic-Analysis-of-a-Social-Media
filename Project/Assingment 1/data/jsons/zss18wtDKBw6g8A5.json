On April 13 , it projected 68,841 deaths and a range of 30,188 to 175,965 .\nThe IHME model produced the projections that led President Donald Trump and the White House coronavirus response task force to announce that even if Americans did everything right , as many as 240,000 people would die of the coronavirus by the end of the summer .\nThe model has also overestimated the number of hospitalizations and the number of needed ventilators , and those projections have had political implications and also been economically damaging for health care providers that shut down all nonessential medical procedures to prepare for COVID-19 surges that , in some areas , never arrived .\nWhat 's the problem ?
