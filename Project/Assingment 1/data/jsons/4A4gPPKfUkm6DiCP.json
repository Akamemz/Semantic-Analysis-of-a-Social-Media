Frank Wolf , R-Va. , chairman of the Capitol Hill commission holding the hearing , slammed the Obama administration for turning down the invitation to testify .\n\u201c It is amazing , \u201d Wolf told FoxNews.com . \u201c I can \u2019 t , almost , believe it . \u201d\nThe hearing , which began Friday morning , focuses on the plight of religious minorities in Iran . Slated to testify are the group representing the Abedini family in the U.S. as well as Abedini \u2019 s wife , Naghmeh .\nThe Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission reached out to the State Department last Friday in a bid to bring in a State Department witness to speak on the lead-off panel .\nA Wolf aide said despite repeated attempts they didn \u2019 t hear back from the department until Thursday , when the department said no one was available .\nWolf voiced skepticism at the excuse . \u201c The building is loaded with people , \u201d he said of the State Department .\n\u201c The very fact that the United States government is not speaking out sends a very powerful message , \u201d Wolf said .\nAbedini converted from Islam to Christianity in 2000 and became a U.S. citizen in 2010 after he married his American wife . The Iranian government does not recognize his American citizenship , though it had enabled him to travel freely between both countries until this past summer , when he was pulled off a bus and placed under house arrest , according to his supporters .\nThe Obama administration has publicly called for Abedini \u2019 s release . But Naghmeh Abedini recently told Fox News that she has not received a phone call from President Obama or the secretary of state .\nIn prepared testimony for Friday \u2019 s hearing , she plans to say she is \u201c disappointed \u201d with the U.S. government .\n\u201c I am disappointed that our president and our State Department have not fully engaged this case \u2013 disappointed that this great country is not doing more to free my husband , a U.S. citizen .
