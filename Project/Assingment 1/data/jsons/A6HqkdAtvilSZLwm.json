    "content": "Bernie Sanders sparked a furor Sunday when he announced he would not attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee \u2019 s annual conference because the organization provides a platform \u201c for leaders who express bigotry and oppose basic Palestinian rights. \u201d AIPAC\u2014a powerful pro-Israel organization\u2014issued a furious response , pointing out that its events are bipartisan . The speaker list for this year \u2019 s conference , set to begin on March 1 , includes Vice President Mike Pence , Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg , former presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker ( D-N.J. ) , and other members of Congress and policy officials . Barack Obama spoke at multiple AIPAC events .\nBut this year \u2019 s AIPAC conference will also feature some deeply controversial speakers . That includes Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz , an anti-immigrant politician who has sought to ban girls under 14 from wearing headscarves in schools . Even more awkwardly for AIPAC , Kurtz \u2019 s rise to power was initially aided by his alliance with a far-right party with a history of anti-Semitism . Also in attendance will be Serbian president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 , a nationalist politician who has praised accused war criminal Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 .\nTo be sure , both Kurz and Vu\u010di\u0107 have records that would make them appealing to AIPAC . Since entering politics , Kurz has positioned himself as a strong supporter of the Israeli government , making multiple visits to the country and forging a close relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . And despite his past political alliances , he \u2019 s been an outspoken voice against anti-Semitism . Vu\u010di\u0107 , too , has sought to raise awareness about anti-Semitism and the holocaust . Still , AIPAC \u2019 s critics say those gestures don \u2019 t erase the more troubling aspects of the two leaders \u2019 politics .\n\u201c AIPAC \u2019 s modus operandi is to valorize anyone who \u2019 s willing to unequivocally praise the Israeli government without meaningfully criticizing the ongoing occupation , and without insisting on the importance of Palestinian rights alongside Israeli security . These days , the most prominent voices willing to do that are most often coming from the ethno-nationalist , xenophobic right wing , \u201d said Logan Bayroff , a spokesperson for J Street , an American Jewish advocacy group that seeks to end the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories .\nXenophobia\u2014and specifically warnings that immigrants pose a threat to European identity\u2014has indeed been a hallmark of Kurz \u2019 s rhetoric . Most of the migrants seeking refuge in Europe are from Muslim-majority countries , and four of the top five origin nations of newly naturalized EU citizens are majority Muslim . In January , Kurz told the Financial Times that he was proud of Austria \u2019 s status as a \u201c Christian-dominated \u201d country . \u201c If we do not fight against illegal migration , Europe will not be the same in five , 10 or 20 years , \u201d he told the paper . \u201c If we do not control who is allowed to come we will not be able to live in security\u2026and we will not be able to keep our identity . \u201d\nIn 2017 Kurz formed a coalition government between his center-right Austrian Peoples \u2019 Party and the Freedom Party , an extreme right-wing party that was originally founded after the Second World War by a former Austrian SS officer . Though the Freedom Party \u2019 s agenda has shifted from its origins and is now focused on demonizing Muslims , it has still been associated with a number of anti-Semitic incidents in recent years . ( Kurz , on the other hand , has used his platform to speak out against the persecution of Jews\u2014and has promoted events highlighting Jewish identity . )\nKurz \u2019 s coalition with the Freedom Party finally came to an end in May 2019 , when Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache became embroiled in a scandal that dominated the Austrian press . Video of a sting operation orchestrated by an unknown party showed Strache speaking with someone claiming to be an associate of a Russian oligarch ; Strache appeared to offer public contracts in return for political campaign support . After a vote of no confidence , Kurz stepped down , only to return after his party won new elections in September 2019 .\nThe Freedom Party \u2019 s stint as a partner in the governing coalition may not have lasted for long , but it coincided with a troubling time in Austria . The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights reported 88 anti-Semitic incidents in Austria perpetrated by right-wing extremists between 2017 and 2018\u2014similar numbers to earlier in the 2010s , but a marked increase from proceeding decade . In fact , Austrian intelligence organizations\u2014responsible for preventing such attacks\u2014found themselves in the awkward position of being overseen by a party with political ideals resembling the fringe groups they were tasked with monitoring . According to a May 2019 New York Times article , \u201c Inside the agency , senior operatives described a situation in which they now find themselves protecting informants and information not only from hostile states\u2014but from members of their own government. \u201d During the Freedom Party \u2019 s tenure , Jewish groups in Austria maintained a no-contact policy with the party , and one Jewish Austrian community leader called the party \u2019 s eventual ouster a \u201c validation of the Jewish community . \u201d\nSince January , Kurz \u2019 s Austrian People \u2019 s Party has been partnered in a governing coalition with the Austrian Green party , but his anti-migrant agenda is still present . The 300-page contract between the two parties includes plans for Kurtz \u2019 s head scarf ban in schools . Kurz recently described illegal immigration as a threat of equal stature to that posed by climate change .\nMuch like Kurz , Vu\u010di\u0107 has embraced nationalism . He began his political career in 1998 as information minister for the government during violent clashes with ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo . According to Foreign Policy , that job entailed downplaying the brutality : \u201c Serbia needed a lot of explaining , and Vu\u010di\u0107 cut his teeth defending Belgrade in the face of foreign criticism . \u201d\nVu\u010di\u0107 \u2019 s efforts to downplay Serbian military violence against ethnic minorities isn \u2019 t just a thing of the past . During a 2018 speech while visiting ethnic Serbs in Kosovo , Vu\u010di\u0107\u2014whose leadership has been marked by a growing authoritarianism\u2014sparked outrage by praising Milosevic . \u201c Milosevic was a great Serbian leader whose intentions were certainly for the best , but our results were very poor , \u201d Vu\u010di\u0107 said , according to the Associated Press . \u201c Not because he wanted that , but because our wishes were unrealistic , while we neglected and underestimated the interests and aspirations of other nations . \u201d\nMilosevic , who died in 2006 while on trial for war crimes , is considered largely responsible for the bloody war that killed an estimated 100,000 people and led to the genocide of thousands of Bosnian Muslims during the 1990s . He also green-lit military suppression in Kosovo that killed an estimated 10,000 people .\nFor Bayroff , the elevation of figures like Kurz and Vu\u010di\u0107 is a worrying development . When the rhetoric of such leaders becomes legitimized , he says , \u201c it never ends up being good for the Jewish people . \u201d",
