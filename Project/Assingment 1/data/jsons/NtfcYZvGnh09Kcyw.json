( David McNew/Retuers )\nWe live in an era of collapsing confidence in institutions , and the market economy has been no exception . Polls show declining support for capitalism , especially among the young . And the market system is increasingly under attack not only from the left but from some smart social conservatives , populists , and nationalists on the right . To effectively defend democratic capitalism , its champions will need to understand the nature of these criticisms , to see where they have a point , and to think about how to make a case for markets that takes them seriously .\nNot all the contemporary critics of capitalism are all that serious , of course , just as not all its defenders are . But those who voice the deepest grievances have in common some complaints that should not be ignored .\nFor the most part , these complaints are not fundamentally economic but rather are moral . This sometimes is not obvious even to the people lodging them . But arguments about inequalities of wealth or power , cronyism and special-interest influence , a shallow consumerism that corrupts the soul and undermines the dignity of work , a stateless cosmopolitanism that neglects national priorities , and a commitment to creative destruction over protective preservation are arguments about the ends of capitalism at least as much as its means . They accuse our society of a failure to prioritize the highest things , and so they charge us with moral failings embodied in a corrupt political economy .\nThis means , for one thing , that evidence of capitalism \u2019 s ability to produce prosperity will be of limited use in response . It is important to make people aware that the market system has brought billions out of grinding poverty and continues to do so still . This is essential to the moral case for capitalism and is an answer to the shallowest charges against it . But if the market were in fact , as some of its critics suggest , a great machine for replacing material poverty with moral poverty , then evidence of its success in reducing deprivation would not be proof against the charge that it produces depravity . Similarly , evidence of economic growth is not an answer to the charge that overall prosperity comes at costs to some particular Americans that should be unacceptable to all of us .\nThe case for markets as engines of liberty is crucial to the defense of capitalism too , but in a similarly constrained way . The right to property is especially vital to human dignity , and no society could be just while violating it or trampling our other liberties .
