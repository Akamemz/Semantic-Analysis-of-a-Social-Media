The organization understands that \u201c there is a danger labeling groups as hate groups when we \u2019 re in such a fragmented , polarized , and nuanced sociopolitical climate , \u201d says Brian Levin , a former SPLC worker .\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center , a group known for combating white supremacy , has recently seen criticism turn inward . Several of its leaders have departed under allegations of racist or misogynist behavior in the workplace . Beyond that , concerns have risen that its efforts to root out extremism are , in some part , based on \u201c selling the idea of Southern intolerance to a do-gooder Yankee donor base , \u201d as a former SPLC staffer wrote .\nOnce a Democrat living in rural Kansas , Evan Mulch sought to wrench wisdom out of his daily life by reading and debating a full array of moral philosophies .\nBut one day , he stopped looking . \u201c You can only go down so many rabbit holes , \u201d he says .\nHe found his philosophical home at the archconservative John Birch Society , which is undergoing a renaissance in the Trump era .\nTo many progressives in the United States , Mr. Mulch is less a believer in small government than a patriot-movement extremist .\nThat view has been spread via the Southern Poverty Law Center and its influential Hatewatch project . In 2013 , the SPLC \u2019 s Hatewatch blog called the Society a group of \u201c conspiracy theory-loving , U.N.-hating , federal government-despising , Ron Paul-supporting , environmentalist-bashing ... true believers . \u201d\n\u201c Nearly everyone I run into says that the SPLC is a hate group itself , \u201d he says . \u201c So when a hate group is calling other groups hate groups , it may have lost all credibility . \u201d\nEven as the SPLC , based in Montgomery , Alabama , has become a heavy-hitting counterweight against rising white nationalism in the U.S. , it is in the midst of its own reckoning .\nIn the past month , three key leaders have either been fired or resigned amid allegations of racism and misogyny in the workplace \u2013 an irony for an organization founded to fight those impulses .\nBut for a lot of Americans , the scandal is much bigger than a tale of workplace hypocrisy . It is about how to police debate in an era when tribalism and name-calling seems to dominate the public square .\n\u201c If [ the SPLC ] needs to clean house , good , because their work is absolutely essential , \u201d says Catherine McNicol Stock , author of \u201c Rural Radicals : Righteous Rage in the American Grain. \u201d \u201c But this is also a reminder that people on the left have to be careful not to equate the ideas of conservatism [ with extremism ] . \u201d\nHints of a moral crisis in an organization founded to uphold civil rights may extend beyond the office . Critics have raised concerns that its efforts to root out extremism are , in some part , based on \u201c selling the idea of Southern intolerance to a do-gooder Yankee donor base \u201d that supports a $ 741 million trust fund , as a former SPLC staffer wrote in The New Yorker magazine .\nOut of a modernist six-story edifice set against Montgomery \u2019 s modest skyline , the SPLC manages a platoon of lawyers to litigate civil rights complaints . A smaller group is its outward face : the Intelligence Project , widely quoted publisher of Hatewatch , which tracks extremism throughout the U.S .\nSPLC \u2019 s bankrupting of the Ku Klux Klan has been widely reported , and the group gained still more prominence as it tracked racists and bigots from the Clinton through Obama eras .\nBut with the Trump election , it took on fresh stature . Last year , it helped force several conservative commentators \u2013 including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones , who is currently being sued by parents of slain Sandy Hook children for spreading conspiracy theories that their children \u2019 s murders were all a hoax \u2013 off mainstream social media platforms . It routinely assists law enforcement , including the FBI , in tracking hate groups , and has been ringing alarm bells about a rising tide of white nationalist violence . In its most recent report , the Intelligence Project also noted a rise in violent black nationalism .\nIn recent years , the Intelligence Project has apologized to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson for listing him on an extremist watch . It also paid out millions in a libel settlement to a man it misidentified as an anti-Muslim extremist .\nAnd critics have blamed the SPLC \u2019 s labeling as extremists mainstream figures like author Charles Murray \u2013 who posited in the \u201c Bell Curve \u201d the widely debunked theory that there may be genetic differences between the races \u2013 as contributing to hostility toward free speech on college campuses .\nAnd then two weeks ago , a bombshell : The center suddenly announced the firing of co-founder Morris Dees . Late last month , president Richard Cohen and several other principals resigned . The center has been relatively mum about the details , but the shake-up came after a prominent black female attorney resigned , causing employees to write a letter saying that \u201c allegations of mistreatment , sexual harassment , gender discrimination , and racism threaten the moral authority of this organization and our integrity along with it . \u201d\nLast week , the center hired Tina Tchen , Michelle Obama \u2019 s former chief of staff , to help overhaul its workplace culture . On Wednesday , it announced that an SPLC board member , former juvenile court judge Karen Baynes-Dunning , is taking over as interim CEO .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear that our mission and our work combating hate and extremism are as needed as ever , so the vital work of the Intelligence Project goes on , \u201d an SPLC spokesperson writes in an email . \u201c Like all parts of the SPLC , we \u2019 re eager to see Tina Tchen \u2019 s review process continue and look forward to making any changes needed to ensure we have a workplace that reflects our highest values . \u201d\nThe news led to eye-opening shellackings from news organizations that routinely use the SPLC \u2019 s findings to fuel stories . The Los Angeles Times and The New Yorker were among those that published tough critiques .\nBut a gentler charge , says Professor Stock , who teaches American studies at Connecticut College in New London , is that the SPLC applies what moral philosophers call a \u201c hero standard \u201d to group membership \u2013 the idea , for example , that those not actively trying to rescue Jews during the Holocaust were bad people . That high bar of virtue means that the SPLC \u2019 s brush sometimes splatters non-extremist Americans .\nThe organization understands that \u201c there is a danger labeling groups as hate groups when we \u2019 re in such a fragmented , polarized , and nuanced sociopolitical climate , \u201d said Brian Levin , former associate director for legal affairs of the SPLC \u2019 s Klanwatch/Militia Task Force , in a conversation before the shake-up .\nBut it \u2019 s the \u201c gray areas \u201d between free speech and violence-inspiring hatred where extremism can flourish \u2013 and where hate-watch groups can skate onto thin ice , says extremism expert J.M . Berger .\nLast year , the Intelligence Project listed a man named Vince Buckles as a leader of the secessionist and increasingly militant League of the South in Louisiana . Mr. Buckles was at one point a cast member on the \u201c Sons of Guns \u201d reality TV show .\nAt the time , Hatewatch editor Heidi Beirich told the Monitor \u2019 s Christa Case Bryant that it stood by its reporting . She said Mr. Buckles \u201c downplayed his role \u201d because \u201c this guy had a lot to lose by the disclosure of this . I know he was at some league events . \u201d\nReached last year by the Monitor at his gun shop in Louisiana , Mr. Buckles acknowledged that he had been at a league event in New Orleans . But he says all he did was pay a membership fee to the League of the South .\nHe denies being a racist , claiming his gun shop is one of only a few in his parts of Louisiana that actively caters to a black clientele . For Mr. Buckles , at least , it \u2019 s like he woke up one day to find his reputation at stake for simply holding what he sees as traditional American views .\n\u201c The growing rise of left-wing politics means that stuff that used to be center of the road is now right-wing , \u201d says Mr. Buckles . \u201c Bill Clinton \u2019 s policies are not that different from Trump , but Trump is a Nazi and Clinton was a Democrat hero . It \u2019 s a very , very left shift . We thought this was healed , but now we have seen that it is not healed . \u201d\nPainting Americans like Mr. Buckles and Mr. Mulch as nationalist revolutionaries underscores the lack of a hard definition of extremism , complicated by the difficulty of a majority-white nation to address a surge of white nationalism , argues Mr. Berger , author of \u201c Jihad Joe , \u201d in an email .\nIn many ways , he says , the Supreme Court \u2019 s definition of pornography \u2013 \u201c I know it when I see it \u201d \u2013 has become the mainstream standard for extremism . \u201c And it \u2019 s not a healthy one. \u201d In his view , the extremism label should only be applied to groups that base their existence on the promotion of hostile action against another group .\n\u201c If \u2018 extremist \u2019 is just a label for someone you disagree with , then it \u2019 s a pretty useless label , \u201d says Mr. Berger .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
