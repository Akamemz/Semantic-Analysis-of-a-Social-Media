That 's partly because he regularly makes his pitch to minority voters in front of almost entirely white audiences . But it 's also because -- even as the Trump campaign has added events with more diverse audiences -- they 've tended to be small roundtables stacked with participants selected by the campaign .\n`` He talks about us , and he does n't talk to us , '' said Bettina Incl\u00e1n , the 2012 director of Hispanic outreach for the Republican National Committee . `` It does n't matter whether you are white , black , brown , yellow or red , ( voters ) want authenticity -- that you 're not just going to them for their vote but you care about their issues . ''\nShe was one of multiple strategists and leaders of minority efforts who questioned whether Trump 's appeals were truly aimed at non-white voters and whether they are focusing more on optics than actual engagement .\n`` Sometimes these outreach efforts seem like they 're geared to appease Republicans and white voters who are leaving him , '' Incl\u00e1n said .\n`` Mr. Trump is committed to being a president for all Americans , and unlike Hillary Clinton , that includes campaigning hard for everyone 's vote , '' said Miller , as he knocked Clinton for her relatively light public schedule . `` Mr. Trump knows that by working together , we can improve economic opportunities for everyone , make our communities safe and break up Washington 's rigged system that has left too many behind .

''\nUnlike other high-profile Hispanic supporters who dumped Trump after the speech , Su\u00e1rez said he has n't left the advisory board because he does n't want to make a `` rash decision . '' Still , he said if Trump 's latest speech is an indication he 's backing mass deportations , the GOP candidate would `` virtually close the door of every immigrant majority congregation in the United States . ''\nPolitical operatives and leaders of minority-focused organizations said there are plenty of more authentic and effective opportunities available for Trump to engage with minority voters .\nIncl\u00e1n suggested Trump buy television advertising in Spanish in Nevada -- a state where polls show him within striking distance of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton -- to highlight his business record and focus on job creation .\nIn the past , GOP candidates have focused their efforts on minority business or evangelical communities .

He said he was impressed with Trump 's interest in the issues that were raised and walked away leaning toward Trump .\n`` I think that was a human side of Trump that we saw , '' Sultan said . `` It definitely made me really reconsider him . ''\nAlfred Liz , whose parents were born in the Dominican Republic , also said he was surprised by Trump 's affable demeanor at the roundtable .\n`` When people are actually able to meet him and get to know the real Donald Trump , he 's completely different , '' he said . `` When people get over that barrier that 's been put in place and enforced by Democrats , then people will be able to see that that 's the guy they want to vote for . ''\nPerhaps the most resounding criticism of Trump 's new outreach effort , though , is that the candidate should have started his appeal to minority voters far sooner .\nA Suffolk University/USA Today poll released this week was the latest to illustrate the chasm between Trump and Clinton when it comes to non-white voters . While 24 % of Hispanic voters opted for Trump , 65 % backed Clinton . And he received just 4 % of the African-American vote , compared to her 92 % .\n`` Minority outreach , stakeholder engagement and coalition-building -- those are long-term projects . Those are n't just things that happen when you say you 're going to go and engage the African-American community , '' said Jeff Polesovsky , who served as the political director of Gov . John Kasich 's presidential campaign and deputy campaign manager when Kasich ran for re-election in Ohio in 2014 . That year , Kasich won 26 % of the African-American vote .\n`` You have to spend a lot of time listening , understanding their needs and then reacting with a sense of urgency , '' Polesovsky said .

''\nPalomarez , the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce head , said he believes Trump has little chance of improving his numbers with Latino voters after his latest immigration speech .\n`` Honestly , it just seems like there 's no going back .
