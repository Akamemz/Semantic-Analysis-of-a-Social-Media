But Brazilians , exhausted by years of failed leftism , don \u2019 t appear too worried , according to the Spectator , which noted this telling anecdote :\nWhen Pink Floyd \u2019 s Roger Waters gave a concert in S\u00e3o Paulo recently and broadcast an anti-Bolsonaro message to his audience , they booed him roundly for a quarter of an hour . He had miscalculated : fans wealthy enough to afford a ticket for his show would be Bolsonaro voters . Brazilians feel that only they can understand the peculiar afflictions of their country and there is irritation that others should see fit to give them a homily . Hard times call for strong measures . The country has made its choice , and it has voted for military discipline over a corrupt leftwing regime with no answer to the gang-violence of its streets . It has been easy to play on voters \u2019 fears : the homicide level in some Brazilian cities is high enough to meet the UN \u2019 s criterion for low-intensity civil war .\nMost of the news coming out of Brazil in recent days sounds promising : Bolsonaro has canceled a climate change summit for next year in Rio , seeing it as costly and an ideologically histrionic waste of time ; he has named a foreign minister who forthrightly rejects the pro-abortion claptrap of the international community and dismisses enviro activism as Marxism by other means ; Bolsonaro is getting into squabbles with Cuban and Venezuelan commies , signaling that the country will unlatch itself from the region \u2019 s vest of suicidal leftism .\nNaturally , this leaves the Western liberal elite fretful . It had grown accustomed to Brazilian leftism . How dare Bolsonaro \u2019 s aides stain the honor of China \u2014 that was the ludicrous tone of the media \u2019 s coverage of his appointment of a top diplomat who dared to blog that China \u2019 s climate change activism is a Marxist crock of the first order , an obvious attempt to goad Western economies into destroying themselves on the altar of idiotic and ineffectual \u201c green \u201d sacrifices . The lefty Guardian harrumphed that \u201c South America \u2019 s biggest nation , \u201d with , my gosh , \u201c the greatest and most biodiverse forest on Earth , the Amazon , \u201d has now fallen into the hands of such right-wing cretins as Ernesto Araujo , Bolsonaro \u2019 s choice for foreign minister . We are supposed to be very frightened that Araujo considers the greenies \u201c anti-Christian \u201d and useful idiots for anti-Western countries , who peddle a dogma that \u201c has been used to justify increasing the regulatory power of states over the economy and the power of international institutions on the nation states and their populations , as well as to stifle economic growth in democratic capitalist countries and to promote the growth of China . \u201d\nSounds about right . Kudos to Bolsonaro for selecting him . One can only laugh at the headlines the media has been putting on \u201c bad news \u201d stories in Brazil lately , such as this Reuters gem : \u201c Brazil \u2019 s Bolsonaro names Trump fan top diplomat as Cuba relations sour. \u201d Oh my .
