And more indications that support for impeachment is trending in Democrats \u2019 favor could spur a moment of reckoning for Republicans on Capitol Hill . Should impeachment gain the support of an undeniable majority , Republicans who previously declined to distance themselves from the president could quickly change their calculus \u2014 setting Trump on the same lonely course that led to President Richard Nixon \u2019 s Watergate-era resignation in August 1974 .\n\u201c From my point of view as a Republican pollster , the president \u2019 s base has been solid so far , \u201d said Micah Roberts , a partner at Public Opinion Strategies , which oversaw an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted last week . \u201c But college-educated whites have electoral significance for us in the suburbs and can completely shift the dynamic and the conversation just by virtue of shifting the overall numbers . \u201d\nBack-to-back polls this week found greater support for the impeachment proceedings than opposition among white voters with college degrees \u2014 a group that backed Trump over Hillary Clinton by a slightly greater margin in 2016 , according to publicly available exit data . Fifty percent of college-educated whites in an NPR/Marist College survey said they approved of House Democrats \u2019 decision to launch the formal impeachment inquiry into Trump . That compares to a narrower margin of support for the move , 45-43 , in a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday .\n\u201c If you look at college-educated whites , those are probably some of the most engaged voters . They are a big and important chunk of the electorate and they have shifted the most resolutely toward impeachment so far , \u201d Roberts said .\nEven more dangerous for the president and his allies is the apparent groundswell of support for impeachment among women \u2014 including self-described independents , white women with college degrees and women in suburban communities . Five polls conducted since last Tuesday have shown majorities of women endorsing Democratic efforts to remove Trump from office , ranging from 57 percent of registered female voters who strongly or somewhat approve of impeachment in a CBS survey released Sunday to 62 percent of women in a Quinnipiac University survey released Monday who said they think \u201c Trump believes he is above the law . \u201d\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult poll found a 15-point gap between independent women who support impeachment ( 48 percent ) and voters within the same demographic who oppose it ( 33 percent ) . A similar gap emerged in the NPR/Marist survey among suburban women , 57 percent of whom said they support the impeachment inquiry versus 39 percent who disapprove of the move .\n\u201c I really don \u2019 t like where we are right now , \u201d said one prominent Republican pollster .\nTo be sure , some of the same polls include evidence suggesting impeachment could become a political risk for Democrats as they head into a heated election year . And the rapid-pace environment in which the impeachment process has already unfolded , combined with varying levels of understanding of the process itself , mean a lot of voters are still in \u201c wait-and-see mode , \u201d according to Roberts .\n\u201c There are some people who say , \u2018 Yes , of course Congress should look into this , \u2019 but there is still a lot of confusion as to what comes next , \u201d said Ryan Winger , a Colorado-based pollster , citing a CBS survey in which 12 percent of voters said they believed Trump \u201c would be removed from office immediately \u201d if the House votes to impeach him . ( The next step in the impeachment process would typically include a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate , in accordance with long-standing procedural rules . )\nA Monmouth University poll released Tuesday also highlighted areas of confusion involving the facts that led to the impeachment inquiry against Trump . Among Republican respondents , only 40 percent said they believed Trump mentioned the possibility of an investigation into Joe Biden \u2019 s son Hunter on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , which led Pelosi to pull the trigger on impeachment proceedings . Trump does not use the word \u201c investigation \u201d in a transcript of the call made public by the White House , but does claim the former vice president \u201c went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution \u201d of his son .\n\u201c Towards the end of last week , as more people knew about what was going on and were processing the messages coming from Democrats and the Trump campaign , the number of Republicans who said [ Trump \u2019 s ] behavior was appropriate actually went up , \u201d said Patrick Murray , director of Monmouth University \u2019 s Polling Institute . \u201c This told us how powerful partisan filters can be for just interpreting obvious facts . \u201d\nFor these reasons , GOP officials have been quietly conducting their own surveys to gain an accurate read on how key demographic groups are responding to the impeachment developments and the Republican Party \u2019 s response .
