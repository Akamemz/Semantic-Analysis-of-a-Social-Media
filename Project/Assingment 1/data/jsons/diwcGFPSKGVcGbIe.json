Interest payments on the national debt alone, it noted, are expected to total some $4.2 trillion over the next decade.\n\nAnd that number could fluctuate depending on rates.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nThe lead author of the Deloitte study, director Bill Eggers, stressed the way that U.S. government debt could quickly spiral out of control if investors become less willing to lend more money.\n\n\"If interest rates go up by simply 3 percent over the next decade, the additional cost to the Treasury, just for interest payments, would equal the peak combined cost of the wars in both Afghanistan in Iraq,\" he said.\n\nSo what could $4.2 trillion buy instead?\n\nDeloitte, an accounting and consulting firm that often audits government finances, says it's enough to do all of the following:\n\nbuild 80,000 miles of highways\n\npay tuition for every science/math/engineering college degree in the country\n\ntriple U.S. government general R&D funding\n\nbuild six international space stations\n\noffset 80 percent of global warming pollution in the atmosphere as recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\nThe report notes that the $4.2 trillion could also be given back in the form of tax cuts.\n\nNot all economists are on board with the implications of the study.\n\n\"The major holders of government bonds are agencies and individuals within the U.S.,\" Robert Stonebraker, an economics professor at Winthrop University, told FoxNews.com.\n\n\"So if you pay $1 trillion in interest on the debt, a lot of it will go back to Americans anyway.\"\n\nBut Eggers noted that a lot of the interest payments do go overseas.\n\n\"If you look at the interest payments going to foreign countries, soon we're going to be spending enough to essentially finance the Chinese military,\" he said.\n\nCurrently, foreigners own some $5 trillion in U.S. government bonds, $1 trillion of which is owned by China.\n\nSome criticized the report's ideas.\n\n\"I think they're overhyping the need to fix the debit crisis in short run,\" Stonebraker said.\n\n\"If the economy recovers, a lot of the debt will go away automatically.
