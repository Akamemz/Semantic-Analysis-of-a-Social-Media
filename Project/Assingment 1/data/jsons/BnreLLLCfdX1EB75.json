But realists on both sides know such a scenario is highly unlikely to happen , at least to a result the Left would want . In all likelihood , open displays of tyrannical force such as openly rounding up certain people groups or door-to-door weapons confiscations are highly likely to result in open displays of resistance , and a civil war that is likely to be fought , and won , by the good guys .\nOn the topic of whether or not citizens could resist \u201c violent tyranny , \u201d \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Kurt Schlichter writes , \u201c The short answer is , \u2018 Yes. \u2019 As Vietnam , Iraq , and Afghanistan all teach , a decentralized insurgency with small arms can effectively confront a modern police/military force ...

Happen , \u201d opines National Review \u2019 s Mark Wright .\n\u201c Make no mistake , armed rebellion would be the consequence , \u201d writes Varad Mehta for The Federalist in a piece that \u2019 s par for the course when it comes to most thinking on the right . \u201c Armed men would be dispatched to confiscate guns , they would be met by armed men , and blood would be shed . Australia is a valid example for America only if you are willing for that blood to be spilled in torrents and rivers . To choose Australia is to choose civil war . \u201d\nEven the more sane gun control proponents are wise to the political situation . University of Sydney professor Philip Alpers , who is also the founding director of GunPolicy.org , told the New York Times , \u201c What Australia did was a confiscation of private property under the threat of jail time , compensated or not . That wouldn \u2019 t wash in the United States . \u201d\nFurther , when unduly oppressive laws are actually passed in the United States , such as recent laws in New York and Connecticut passed after the Sandy Hook massacre , they are often ignored by the majority of gun owners and sparsely enforced by the states themselves . \u201c New York and Connecticut authorities so far have shown no inclination to enforce their laws by going door to door to round up unregistered guns and arrest their owners , \u201d Mehta wrote in the 2015 piece . \u201c But that \u2019 s what would be necessary to enforce the law . A federal law , therefore , would require sweeping , national police action involving thousands of lawmen and affecting tens of millions of people . If proponents of gun control are serious about getting guns out of Americans \u2019 hands , someone will have to take those guns out of Americans \u2019 hands . \u201d\nSure , it \u2019 s hard to argue with Mehta \u2019 s logic , at least on the surface . And it \u2019 s a good thing for gun owners , right ?\nNot necessarily , not if you look just beneath that surface .\nConsider : If rational minds on the Left know all this , to what end are they still pushing for such laws , especially when it \u2019 s obvious that they don \u2019 t care whether ANY gun control laws are actually enforced .

It \u2019 s one thing to hold up your rifle and shout \u201c come and take it , \u201d \u00e0 la Charleton Heston , before thousands of like-minded people . The Feds aren \u2019 t going to come to a National Rifle Association convention and start arresting people , at least not yet .

Not yet .\nBut believe me , under the right circumstances and with the right laws in place , the arrests will come . They \u2019 ll come when you \u2019 re going to work , or to the bank , or to the park with your kids , or a thousand other places . They \u2019 ll come after you \u2019 ve used your now-illegal AR-15 to defend yourself against a home invader , or if they spot it during a \u201c routine \u201d home search .\nNever , ever underestimate these people and the depth of their evil .
