    "content": "With the Supreme Court \u2019 s conservative majority casting serious doubt this week on the future of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , Congress is facing the very real possibility of having the issue dumped on its doorstep .\nThe court is expected to make a ruling sometime next spring \u2014 right in the middle of an election year , when the politics of immigration will be even more difficult . And there is simply no recent evidence that points to Congress coming to a deal , throwing into doubt the deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the country as children .\nSince passing a comprehensive immigration overhaul in 2013 that was ignored by the House , the Senate has been unable to get 60 votes for a substantial immigration bill . The chamber did pass a spending bill delivering aid to the border this year , but Democrats battled one another so fiercely over the matter that it made the party only more skittish to deal with the Trump administration .\nPerhaps the biggest hurdle is the massive trust deficit between Senate Democrats and the president . They feel so burned by past negotiations \u2014 on transportation , gun safety and immigration reform , among the issues \u2014 that many in the party seem not to have it in them to try again .\n\u201c It is exceptionally difficult to make any deal that sticks . For a man who is supposed to be a great deal-maker , we have yet to see a great deal , \u201d centrist Sen. Chris Coons ( D-Del . ) said .\nCoons said when he tries to reengage Democrats on immigration , they remind him of the 2018 debacle , when the president rejected a bill that would have provided a massive $ 25 billion for border security in return for protecting DACA recipients and their parents . That bill failed 54-45 , and the president \u2019 s plan to cut legal immigration in addition to dealing with DACA and the border wall fared even worse , dying 39-60 .\nTrump tweeted this week : \u201c If Supreme Court remedies with overturn , a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay ! \u201d\nBut Democrats aren \u2019 t the only ones who are skeptical of the president \u2019 s negotiating style on immigration .\nJust eight Republicans joined the Democrats on the compromise immigration proposal in 2018 , a number advocates say could have been much higher without Trump and his aides intervening to oppose it .\n\u201c The night before it had 60 . \u2026 And overnight we lost six Republicans , \u201d said Sen. Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) . \u201c I read different things and hear different things that [ Trump ] is actually sympathetic to the DACA population . But he \u2019 s obviously under pressure from hardliners like Stephen Miller to do the wrong thing . \u201d\nA White House official said the administration opposed the bipartisan immigration plan because it relied on future Congresses to actually deliver the money for the border and would hamper the executive branch \u2019 s immigration enforcement priorities .\nThough the House passed legislation dealing with DACA protections earlier this year , the Senate has ignored it . And on legislation , the bar is so much higher in the Senate , with its 60-vote requirement . Under the current party splits , the chamber \u2019 s supermajority threshold on the filibuster would require either seven Democrats or 13 Republicans to cross party lines on any immigration bill .\nSen. Joe Manchin ( D-W.Va. ) put it simply : \u201c We don \u2019 t have the votes in the Senate , OK ? \u201d\n\u201c I truly believe in my heart of hearts that the president liked the 2013 immigration reform . \u2026 His staff around him and the base will not let him go there , \u201d Manchin said . \u201c It hasn \u2019 t happened , and it doesn \u2019 t look like it \u2019 s going to happen .

Marco Rubio ( R-Fla. ) , a supporter of the 2013 comprehensive immigration bill , said Congress \u2019 best hope of success is narrowing legislation as much as it possibly can to cover only the 660,000 young people whose status could be thrown into uncertainty .\n\u201c It \u2019 s important to remind everybody that the president offered a bill that dealt with Dreamers . ...
