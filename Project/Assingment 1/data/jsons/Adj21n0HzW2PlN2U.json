But it \u2019 s an option \u2013 rarely used \u2013 that would at least convey moral outrage over certain presidential actions .\nBut Congress is not facing a binary choice , \u201c impeachment , up or down. \u201d There are many options for responding to a president who defies subpoenas and whom a significant portion of Americans view as unfit for office . Among them is another form of sanction for perceived wrongdoing : censure , or a formal reprimand in the form of a majority resolution by one or both chambers of Congress .\nNow that retired special counsel Robert Mueller has spoken publicly about his Trump-Russia investigation , effectively leaving next steps to Congress , the question of impeachment has gained fresh urgency . The Mueller report found no provable conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia in the 2016 election , but it detailed 10 examples of potential obstruction of justice by the president .\nYes or no : Do you favor impeaching President Donald Trump ? That \u2019 s the question Democratic politicians around the country are being battered with \u2013 at town halls , in fundraisers , during TV interviews . Support for impeachment has been slowly rising among Democrats in Congress , within the large Democratic presidential field , and among the American people .\nNow that retired special counsel Robert Mueller has spoken publicly about his Trump-Russia investigation , effectively leaving next steps to Congress , the question has gained fresh urgency .\nBut \u201c impeachment , up or down \u201d may not be the right question . Indeed , in responding to a president who defies subpoenas and whom a significant portion of Americans view as unfit for office , Congress is not facing a binary choice .

But it \u2019 s an option \u2013 rarely used \u2013 that would at least convey moral outrage over certain presidential actions , for those who feel it . The Mueller report found no provable conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia in the 2016 election , but it detailed 10 examples of potential obstruction of justice by the president .\nDemocratic pollster Mark Penn , a critic of the Mueller investigation , agrees that \u201c censure makes sense \u201d \u2013 in part because holding such a vote against the president in the Democratic-controlled House would put \u201c a lot of Republicans in a bind. \u201d Mr. Trump enjoys 90 percent support among Republican voters , which makes it politically dangerous for GOP members to vote against him . So far , the only Republican in either chamber to come out in favor of impeachment is the libertarian-leaning Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan .\nA House censure vote against Mr. Trump could hold some political peril for Democrats . As with impeachment , Mr. Trump could wear a censure resolution as a badge of honor . And the party \u2019 s liberal base would likely perceive it as a mere slap on the wrist in the face of what many Democrats see as egregious or even illegal presidential behavior . But would it lead them to stay home in the 2020 election ? Mr. Penn is doubtful .\n\u201c It \u2019 s pretty unlikely activists will pass on an opportunity to vote against Trump , \u201d the pollster says .\nFor now , though , debate among Democrats centers squarely on impeachment \u2013 or more precisely , whether to launch a formal impeachment inquiry . The hope is that such an inquiry would unearth further evidence of presidential wrongdoing , either in matters related to the Mueller investigation or elsewhere , including Mr. Trump \u2019 s financial dealings .\nIn effect , a preliminary impeachment inquiry is already starting , though not in name . The warm-up act comes Monday , when former Nixon White House counsel John Dean testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on obstruction of justice , along with former U.S. attorneys and other legal experts . Mr. Dean was the star witness against President Richard Nixon in the 1973 Watergate hearings that eventually led to the 37th president \u2019 s resignation .\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler has announced additional hearings in coming weeks that will focus on \u201c other important aspects of the Mueller report . \u201d\nOn another track , the full House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr and former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt for failing to deliver subpoenaed documents and , in Mr. McGahn \u2019 s case , for defying a subpoena to testify . The contempt resolution is expected to contain language that boosts Democrats \u2019 efforts to obtain Trump tax returns .\nSo far , no key witnesses in the Trump-Russia inquiry , including Mr. Mueller himself , have agreed to testify in Congress . In a rare public statement last week , Mr. Mueller said \u201c the report is my testimony. \u201d But Democrats still want him to appear before Congress , if only to give voice to key points from his report , based on the assumption that few Americans will read the 448-page tome .

Mr. Penn \u2019 s latest Harvard-Harris poll shows support for impeachment and removal from office at 37 percent , up from 28 percent in April ; support for \u201c no action \u201d is at 42 percent , and 20 percent favor censure . Among polled Democrats , 60 percent favor impeachment ; among independents , it \u2019 s 36 percent .\nTime is not on the pro-impeachment side , barring an explosive revelation . With each passing day , the November 2020 election takes up more oxygen and boosts the argument that the voters should decide Mr. Trump \u2019 s fate . Democrats are keenly aware that , based on what \u2019 s known , the Republican-controlled Senate would not come close to convicting and removing the president even if he were impeached by the House .\nSo the calendar , in effect , is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s friend , as she tries to fend off pro-impeachment forces within her caucus . Speaker Pelosi maintains impeachment is still on the table , but only in the event of a major new revelation .\nHere the argument becomes circular : The likeliest path to explosive new information , if it exists , would come via a formal impeachment inquiry , congressional Democrats say . They believe it would boost their case in court as they seek access to grand jury testimony and documents underlying the Mueller report .
