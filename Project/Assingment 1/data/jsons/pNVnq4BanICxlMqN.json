It \u2019 s a crucial point and a powerful argument against either Sanders or Warren as the Democratic nominee . But neither of the two of them ever directly addressed or specifically rebutted it .\nThere were smaller contests within the larger one on Tuesday night \u2014 for example , Buttigieg versus Beto O \u2019 Rourke , 46 , for the affections of voters who yearn for generational change . Buttigieg definitely came out on top , in part because he hewed more tightly to the argument that it was time for new approaches and unsullied optimism , capably noting how much of the conversation around him had remained unchanged in Democratic politics for decades . O \u2019 Rourke rambled , and the only strong impression of him that I came away with was that he \u2019 s tall . His performance won \u2019 t arrest his fade from the promise and prominence of his 2018 Senate campaign . He must miss Ted Cruz dearly , and no one ever does that .\nButtigieg \u2019 s backers told him before this debate that he needed to show more fire than he did the last time around , after which he stalled in the polls . He didn \u2019 t achieve quite the animation that they sought , but he made strides in that direction . At no point during the night did I come so close to standing up and cheering as when he took on Trump \u2019 s Republican enablers on Capitol Hill .\n\u201c If you are watching at home and you are a Republican member of Congress , \u201d he said , \u201c consider the fact that when the sun sets on your career , and they are writing your story , of all the good and bad things you did in your life , the thing you will be remembered for is whether in this moment , with this president , you found the courage to stand up to him or continued to put party over country. \u201d It was a canned soliloquy , sure , but that made it no less necessary .\nMaybe Delaney gets some wind out of the night , although I suspect he \u2019 s at such a negligible velocity that it doesn \u2019 t matter . Maybe one of the other moderates does , though they became , as the evening went on , not so much individual candidates as a blockade against Democratic socialism , the dizzier dimensions of the Green New Deal and any Medicare for all plan that starts by wiping out private insurance .
