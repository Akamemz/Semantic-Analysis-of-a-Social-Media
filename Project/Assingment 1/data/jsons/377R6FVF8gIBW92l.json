It was also the person put into the job : Mueller , who spent his career in the FBI and who takes the post just weeks after Trump startled lawmakers and officials from both parties by abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey ( who is also , incidentally , Mueller \u2019 s close friend ) .\nIn the aftermath of the firing , congressional Democrats began calling for a special counsel or special prosecutor to take over the investigation because of fears that the Justice Department would n't be able or willing to properly investigate Trump and his current and former aides . But few seemed to think that would actually happen .\nThat 's why the announcement by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein came as a surprise to so many people \u2014 including the White House , which was reportedly given just 30 minutes \u2019 warning before the announcement went public .\nIf Rosenstein \u2019 s name sounds familiar , it \u2019 s because the administration initially claimed that Trump only decided to fire Comey after Rosenstein sent a letter to the White House recommending that he do so . This turned out to have been a lie \u2014 Trump later admitted that he \u2019 d already decided to fire Comey long before Rosenstein \u2019 s letter .\nSo when Rosenstein announced that he had appointed a special counsel , it had the feel of a career lawyer with a reputation for probity and nonpartisanship striking a blow at a White House that had thrown him under the bus by trying to make him the scapegoat for the Comey firing .\n\u201c My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted , \u201d Rosenstein said in a DOJ press release . \u201c I have made no such determination . What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances , the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command . \u201d\nThere 's a lot to unpack there , including the fact that Mueller wo n't have the powers many people assume . He also wo n't be entirely independent . But he 'll have a lot of power all the same \u2014 and is probably almost literally the last person Trump would want in the job .\nA special counsel is weaker than an independent special prosecutor\nSpecial prosecutors and special counsels are both appointed to remove conflicts of interest in federal criminal investigations , if the situation would otherwise lead to officials investigating their own superiors . They are supposed to be independent , usually either judges or highly respected attorneys .\nBut while the two terms are often used interchangeably in the media \u2014 and , more confusingly , by members of Congress who should know better \u2014 they \u2019 re not quite the same thing .\nIn 1978 , in the wake of the Watergate scandal , Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act , creating something called a \u201c special prosecutor \u201d ( also called an \u201c independent counsel \u201d ) who would be independent from the supervision and control of the president . The role was to investigate and prosecute \u2014 in a court of law \u2014 possible violations of federal law by high-level officials .\nThe 1978 law also created a special three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , appointed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court , that would be responsible for appointing and overseeing a special prosecutor when formally asked to do so by the attorney general .\nUnder that law , only the attorney general had the authority to request that the panel appoint a special prosecutor . Majorities on either the House or Senate Judiciary Committee could formally ask the attorney general to file a request , but \u2014 because of the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution \u2014 the attorney general could still technically say no . They would merely have to tell Congress why they were refusing to do it .\nThe law creating special prosecutors expired in 1999 , when Congress chose not to renew it . That meant that the whole mechanism for establishing an independent special prosecutor went away .\nSo the Justice Department decided instead to use its own powers to create something similar within the department itself : a \u201c special counsel . \u201d\nThis person is appointed directly by the attorney general ( not an independent three-judge panel , like before ) and \u2014 this is the important part \u2014 is thus directly answerable to the attorney general .

Mueller will be able to issue subpoenas , forcing people to testify and turn over documents . Whether he chooses to do so , of course , remains to be seen .\nSo that \u2019 s what we have today .
