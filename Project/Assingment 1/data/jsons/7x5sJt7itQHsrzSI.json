After the election , in which more than 70 percent of Latinos voted for President Obama , House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , said `` a comprehensive approach is long overdue '' and that Republican House leaders and Obama `` can find the common ground . ''\nOn Nov. 16 , Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart announced that he and fellow Hispanic Republican lawmakers had begun meeting with Democrats to `` find a bipartisan solution . ''\nDemocratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois , who has aggressively pushed for immigration reform , even when his fellow Democrats were silent , could n't be happier .\n`` Finally , thank God , '' Gutierrez says . `` On a serious note , I 've met with a dozen of my colleagues on the Republican side , and they have all said , 'We 've got to get this done .

''\nThis coming week , the Congressional Hispanic Caucus , which consists largely of Democrats , is expected to release a set of `` principles '' that they hope will guide bipartisan talks when the new Congress begins in January . Obama also has urged lawmakers to `` seize the moment '' early next year .\nThe Hispanic caucus 's parameters will include the bedrock goals of Democrats and immigrant advocates , such as a path to legal status if not outright citizenship , and requirements such as learning English and paying back taxes .
