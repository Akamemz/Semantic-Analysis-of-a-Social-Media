    "content": "President Trump highlighted \u201c American victims of illegal immigration \u201d on Friday , hosting families of people killed by people who immigrated to the U.S. illegally to tell their stories and hitting back at critics of his rescinded policy that separated some children from their parents who crossed the border illegally .\n\u201c These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones , \u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House . \u201c These are the families the media ignores . These are the stories that Democrats and people that are weak on immigration don \u2019 t want to discuss . \u201d\nHe was surrounded on a stage by so-called \u201c Angel \u201d families who lost loved ones to violence by immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally . Many of the parents held large photographs of their dead children .\nReferring to the furor over separating children from their parents at the border , in all but a few cases temporarily for investigative purposes , Mr. Trump emphasized repeatedly that the families gathered with him had lost their loved ones forever .\n\u201c They \u2019 re not separated for a day , or two days , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c They \u2019 re permanently separated , because they were killed by criminal illegal aliens . \u201d\nOne of the parents , Steve Ronnebeck , talked about his 21-year-old son Grant , who was shot and killed for a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t hear these stories , and some of our media won \u2019 t talk to you about it , \u201d Mr. Ronnebeck said . \u201c But this is permanent separation . \u201d\nHe said he places a Christmas tree on his son \u2019 s grave each year .\nLaura Wilkerson of Pearland , Texas , recounted the story of her son Josh , who was tortured and killed in 2010 .\n\u201c None of our kids had a minute to say goodbye , \u201d she said . \u201c We weren \u2019 t lucky enough to be separated for five days , or 10 days . We \u2019 re separated permanently . We can never have them back on this Earth . \u201d\nShe added , \u201c We can \u2019 t speak to them , we can \u2019 t Skype with them , \u201d referring to outrage over migrant children who have been separated from their parents being able to speak with them on the phone only twice a week .\nSeveral family members urged the audience and Mr. Trump to support their grass-roots organization , Fight Sanctuary State , to encourage state and local authorities to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agents instead of shielding illegal immigrants .\n\u201c If we don \u2019 t kill this in California , it will spread , \u201d said Drew Rosenberg , who lost his son , of the sanctuary-city and -state movement . \u201c It \u2019 s a death sentence for American law-abiding citizens . \u201d\nSabine Durden , a legal immigrant from Germany , told the story of her Dominic , 30 , who was killed in Moreno Valley , California , in 2012 when his motorbike was hit by an immigrant from Guatemala , who was living illegally in the U.S. and had prior convictions including two DUIs .\n\u201c It took me five years to become a citizen , a proud citizen , \u201d she said . \u201c And I didn \u2019 t drag my son \u2026 over borders , through deserts . I didn \u2019 t place him in harm \u2019 s way . I came here the right way . \u201d\nShe said the man who killed her son had been deported once , but returned to the U.S. and enjoyed sanctuary in Riverside , California .\n\u201c The judge , the DA , they knew who he was , \u201d she said . \u201c They gave him probation after his second DUI . Five weeks later , he killed my child . The public needs to know , and they deserve to know , that this could happen to each one of you at any given second . \u201d\nAfter the death of her only child , Ms. Durden said she was going to kill herself , until Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015 .\n\u201c President Trump , coming down that escalator that day and talking about illegal immigration , stopped me in my track , \u201d she said . \u201c And I thank President Trump , Vice President [ Mike Pence ] \u2026 I thank everybody out here . Make sure you get our stories out . \u201d\nShowing the audience a locket , she said : \u201c I brought my son . This is what I have left \u2014 his ashes . I wear his ashes in a locket . This is how I get to hug my son . So remember , when you go and hug your kids , that there are many of us , thousands of us , who don \u2019 t get to do that any more . Let \u2019 s work together and get this done \u2014 all politicians . I don \u2019 t care what side you \u2019 re on . You don \u2019 t want your child in a casket or in an urn . \u201d\nMr. Trump said he invited the families to the White House \u201c because the news media has overlooked their stories . \u201d\n\u201c I want the American people to hear from them directly , \u201d he said . \u201c For years their pain was met with silence \u2026 but no more . Their loved ones have not died in vain . We will secure our borders . Eventually , the word will get out . \u201d\nMr. Trump cited statistics of crime committed by immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally , including 600,000 criminal offenses committed by more than 250,000 migrants over the past seven years in Texas alone . He also noted that 15,000 Americans died of heroin overdoses in 2016 , with 90 percent of heroin coming across the southern border .\nThe president also again criticized Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland , California , who alerted immigrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally to a federal raid earlier this year to thwart their capture . He mistakenly referred to her as the mayor of San Diego .\n\u201c What are they going to do about looking at her , by the way ? \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c I \u2019 ve been asking this question for four weeks . \u201d\nAmong the \u201c Angel \u201d family members invited by the White House were :\n\u2022 Agnes Gibboney , who lost her son Ronald da Silva after he was shot and killed by a gang member , who crossed the border illegally .\n\u2022 Juan Pina , who lost his 14-year-old daughter Christy Sue in 1990 , allegedly at the hands of a Mexican national who raped and killed her . Her alleged killer was extradited from Mexico last month .\n\u2022 Michelle Wilson-Root , whose 21-year old daughter Sarah was killed in 2016 following a vehicular accident allegedly caused by Edwin Mejia \u2014 who had entered the country illegally and , as a result of \u201c catch-and-release \u201d loopholes , was released into the U.S. interior as an unaccompanied minor .
