( Rick Wilking/Reuters )\nWhat the college-admissions scandal can teach us about public-school teacher pay .\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute ( EPI ) \u2014 a liberal think tank affiliated with teachers \u2019 unions \u2014 public-school teachers earn , on average , 21.4 percent less than private-sector workers in other fields who have similar educational and demographic characteristics .

As we have recently seen , private-school parents will spend outrageous sums to help their kids get ahead . Consider Full House actress Lori Loughlin , whose two daughters attended Marymount , an all-girls Catholic high school in Los Angeles that charges annual tuition of $ 37,000 . As if to cement the point that money was no object when it came to her daughters \u2019 education , Ms. Loughlin is currently under federal indictment for paying a $ 500,000 bribe to University of Southern California officials to admit her daughters , based on the fiction that they were collegiate-level rowers .
