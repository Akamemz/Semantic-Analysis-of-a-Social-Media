Our pilots and our armed forces , they simply fulfilled their duties , which consisted of responding to ... violations of the rules of engagement . I think this is the essence . ''\nIn a meeting with community leaders in Ankara , Erdogan said , `` If the same violation occurs today , Turkey has to react the same way . ''\nTurkey has repeatedly said it shot down the Russian warplane on Tuesday only after the plane ignored several warnings and entered Turkish airspace .\nRussia has contested the claim , and its rescued co-pilot Capt . Konstantin Murakhtin told state media that `` there were no warnings -- not via the radio , not visually . '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said the downing of the Russian jet did not appear spontaneous , but more `` like a planned provocation . ''\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told reporters in Moscow on Thursday that the strike was unexpected .\n`` It did not even come into our mind that we could be struck by a party that we considered to be our ally , '' he said . `` We considered Turkey to be a friendly country .

He charged that Turkey was trying to bring its relations with Russia to a `` dead end . ''\nErdogan dubbed a `` huge mistake '' Putin 's claim that Turkey is an accomplice to terrorism and that shooting down Russia 's plane `` represents a stab in the back . ''\nHe also addressed a claim -- repeated Thursday afternoon by Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova -- that Turkey had oil and financial ties to ISIS .\n`` If Mr. Putin is saying that we are cooperating with Daesh , that we are accomplices , I think that would be a huge mistake , because we are doing the exact opposite , '' he told CNN , using another name for ISIS . `` Yesterday there was a declaration which was very unacceptable . Some people claimed that we were buying oil from Daesh -- and the fact that people in positions of authority in Russia said this is very , very unacceptable . ''\nHe said Russia has no room to talk because it is not taking on the terrorist outfit itself : `` Russia is not engaged in a fight against Daesh in Syria . On the contrary , they are actually targeting moderate opposition . ''\nThe assertion is supported by CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton , a retired U.S. Air Force colonel , who said , `` None of the targets that ... the Russians were going after had anything to do with ISIS . Those were all those Turkmen groups . ''\nLate Thursday , however , Russia insisted again it had taken out `` all terrorists '' in the area where the navigator of the Russian jet crash was rescued , Konashenkov said . Russia 's air force conducted `` massive airstrikes '' and the Syrian army had provided artillery support , giving full control of the mountainous area in north Latakia governorate to Syrian troops , he said , claiming that Russia now controls all ISIS supply routes in north Syria .\nNow the economic weapons are being unsheathed .
