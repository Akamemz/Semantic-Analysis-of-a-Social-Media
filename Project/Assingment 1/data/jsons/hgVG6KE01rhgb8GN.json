In much of the world , people are desperate for the government to show up and rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic .\nReagan \u2019 s attitude to government solidified into orthodoxy for more than three decades , spreading abroad \u2013 particularly in the UK with the help of Margaret Thatcher \u2013 and captured the centre ground of politics in both countries .\nThe antipathy to the state was selective : Reagan , like Donald Trump today , racked up huge deficits , spent heavily on defence and built up a system of corporate welfare through subsidies and tax breaks . But on both sides of the Atlantic , the prevailing wisdom was the state should wherever possible get out of the business of trying to control inequality and provide services to the less fortunate .\nThere are already some signs that the Covid-19 shock may challenge those attitudes . Disease and mass unemployment have always been far better recruiting sergeants for the cause of big government than any party manifesto \u2013 and this crisis is unlikely to be an exception .\nSome social scientists and historians argue that this pandemic could become a turning point in social history \u2013 on a par with the New Deal in the US or the post-war Labour government in the UK .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been on this kind of trajectory for last 30-odd years where the individual was taking priority over the collective . And now we \u2019 re actually back into the kind of spirit that our parents and grandparents lived through in which communities have to pull together , \u201d Fiona Hill , a British-born historian who served on Trump \u2019 s national security council .\nHill pointed to the UK , where 750,000 people signed up as volunteers for the National Health Service ( NHS ) and a wave of climate activism on both sides of the Atlantic .\n\u201c I do think there is a huge appetite among younger people , trying to get more government action . I really do think we could start to see the tide turning here . \u201d\nSome of the biggest swings in public opinion have been in countries where the state \u2019 s role in social welfare has been in most rapid retreat .\nThe US and the UK stand out because the pandemic struck as their governments were seeking to roll back longstanding social welfare systems and are now scrambling to reassemble temporary versions of them on the run .\nWhat is not clear yet is whether these stopgap measures will evaporate as soon as Covid-19 is sufficiently contained for people to go back to work \u2013 or whether some of them will stick .\nAuthoritarian leaders may use Covid-19 crisis to tighten their grip Read more\nThe coronavirus pandemic could also boost statism of another kind \u2013 more Big Brother than Great Society \u2013 by providing cover for governments to restrict civil liberties and entrench themselves in power , as Viktor Orb\u00e1n has done in Hungary . There are few signs yet that China \u2019 s leaders will be held accountable for their failure to contain the outbreak at its source , and their response to criticism has been further suppression of dissent and science .\nThe outbreak has created a surge in digital monitoring of populations that many civil libertarians fear will harden afterwards into a permanently raised level of surveillance .\nThe accretion of state power could accompany wider provision of public services , or take precedence over them . The less a government does for its people , the more it has to control them .\nIn the US , the Trump administration is likely to face resistance if it seeks to withdraw forms of social support that have long been standard in most western democracies .\n\u201c The whole pandemic , I think , has laid bare all of the inadequacies of the US social safety net , \u201d John Schmitt , the vice-president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington , said . \u201c A very basic thing every other advanced economy in the world guarantees workers is at least a minimum amount of paid sick days . The US does not have at the national level any laws like that .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard for me to imagine that there won \u2019 t be significant support when the dust settles for state , local and federal legislation to address that incredibly longstanding policy failure , \u201d he said .\nThere are two other areas where Schmitt predicted there would be strong demand for lasting change . One is unemployment insurance , currently a meagre patchwork of different state systems subject to minimum national standards .\nProfit over people , cost over care : America 's broken healthcare exposed by virus Read more\nThe other is the healthcare system . As a far broader cross-section of Americans face medical bankruptcy because they have partial or no health insurance , it will be harder for Trump to pursue his effort to obliterate the Obama administration \u2019 s Affordable Care Act , which extended the scope of health insurance coverage , and could provide support for a more ambitious expansion of government-funded healthcare .\nFor parallel reasons , it will be even harder politically for Boris Johnson to bargain away the fundamentals of the NHS at trade talks with Washington , after it saved his life .\nIt is too early to predict how the coronavirus shock will affect the outcome of this year \u2019 s US elections . All other things being equal , greater popularity for a government-funded social safety net should translate into more votes for Democrats , who have traditionally championed such policies . But Trump will seek to take that ground , insisting , for example , that his name is on the $ 600 cheques the federal government is sending out each week to supplement unemployment benefit .\nAnd the elections could be as much about cultural and political loyalties as social policy .\nArlie Hochschild , a sociologist who has written extensively about the American right , said she had been watching responses to the crisis in Kentucky .\n\u201c Trump supporters are generally older people in poor health , and if they \u2019 re blue-collar , they \u2019 re actually less likely to have work that they can do from home , \u201d Hochschild said . \u201c What \u2019 s happened in this short period of time has challenged so much of what they believe in . \u201d\nDespite that , she said , the crisis seemed to have had little effect on political identification and affiliation . \u201c There is no immediate turnaround in attitude . I think they \u2019 re going to vote for Trump , pretty much at the same rate as they did in \u2019 16 . \u201d\nTwo states : one Democrat , one Republican . Two very different outcomes Read more\nIf Trump is re-elected , few believe there will be much lasting change to the role of the state . His instincts have been to seek to hand leadership during the crisis to the CEOs of big corporations , lining them up in the Rose Garden when he declared a national emergency on 13 March .\nOpinions differ on whether a Democratic administration under Joe Biden would be a force for transformational change .\n\u2018 You \u2019 re seeing a closer alliance between the left and the centre of the Democratic party \u201d Theda Skocpol , a sociology professor at Harvard University , said . If Democrats also capture the Senate , she added : \u201c I think it sets the stage for for a real change in direction \u2013 the first important one since Reagan . \u201d\nDean Baker , co-founder of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research in Washington \u2013 and one of the first economists to identify the US housing bubble that created the conditions for the global financial meltdown in 2008 \u2013 argues that that crisis demonstrated how impervious the economic system was to shocks , no matter who is in government .\n\u201c The thought that we had this horrible experience and now everyone \u2019 s going to learn from it : it wasn \u2019 t true really in \u2019 08- \u2019 09 , and I don \u2019 t have a lot of confidence it \u2019 ll be true this time , \u201d Baker said .\nMuch may depend on the depth and duration of the coronavirus shock . A V-shaped , rapid bounceback is looking less likely with every passing week , and a gradual U-shaped recovery or even an extended depression become real possibilities .
