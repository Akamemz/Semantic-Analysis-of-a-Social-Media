    "content": "As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rises quickly in the United States and in many other countries around the world , the official number of new cases in China , the source of the pandemic , has fallen dramatically . Given the record of secrecy , duplicity , and coverup by the Communist government of China , there is little cause to take those official figures at anything close to face value . Nevertheless , Western media organizations , the World Health Organization , and the United Nations have taken to referring to China 's numbers as \u201c confirmed cases \u201d comparable to cases in other countries with more open societies and transparent governments , giving the impression that China has largely conquered the virus .\nThe Chinese government department responsible for tracking statistics during the crisis is the National Health Commission of the People 's Republic of China . The commission 's website has been publishing daily updates since late January . From the first report on January 25 , the number of cases of the now-named COVID-19 virus skyrocketed from 1,287 to 17,205 in just over a week .
