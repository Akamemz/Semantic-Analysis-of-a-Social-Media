They also served as the first test of new electronic voting machines that have been rolled out across the country to protect the 2020 election from foreign interference.\n\nIn the wake of the disputed 2000 Bush v.

Russia is expected to launch a similar campaign again in 2020. Intelligence officials fear foreign powers like China and Iran may do the same.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nConcern over foreign interference has spawned a nationwide push to replace the vulnerable voting machines. More than 130,000 new machines have been purchased in precincts across the country to replace older paperless ones, many of which carry known security vulnerabilities. These old machines are particularly worrisome because they don\u2019t create a paper backup, meaning there\u2019s no way to know whether their results have been compromised.

A bill providing extra funding for election systems recently passed both houses, and more money could be apportioned before 2020. However, legislation passed by House Democrats that would require all voting systems to have a paper record has stalled in the Republican-led Senate.\n\nThe next big debate in election integrity may be just around the corner.
