His 100th day in office was approaching , and Trump was eager to reshape the hardening narrative of a White House veering off course .\nSo he took it upon himself to explain that his presidency was actually on track , inviting a pair of \u2588\u2588\u2588 reporters into the Oval Office for an impromptu meeting . He sat at the Resolute desk , with his daughter Ivanka across from him . One aide said the chat was off-the-record , but Trump insisted , over objections from nervous-looking staffers , that he be quoted .\nHe addressed the idea that his senior aides weren \u2019 t getting along . He called out their names and , one by one , they walked in , each surprised to see reporters in the room\u2014chief of staff Reince Priebus , then chief strategist Steve Bannon , and eventually senior adviser Jared Kushner . \u201c The team gets along really , really well , \u201d he said .\nHe turned to his relationships with world leaders . \u201c I have a terrific relationship with Xi , \u201d he said , referring to the Chinese president , who Trump recently invited for a weekend visit at his Mar-a-Lago resort .\nFinally , he rattled off the biggest hits of his first three months and promised more to come .\nIt was classic Trump : Confident , hyperbolic and insistent on asserting control .\nBut interviews with nearly two dozen aides , allies , and others close to the president paint a different picture \u2013 one of a White House on a collision course between Trump \u2019 s fixed habits and his growing realization that this job is harder than he imagined when he won the election on Nov. 8 .\nSo far , Trump has led a White House gripped by paranoia and insecurity , paralyzed by internal jockeying for power . Mistrust between aides runs so deep that many now employ their own personal P.R . advisers \u2014 in part to ensure their own narratives get out . Trump himself has been deeply engaged with media figures , even huddling in the Oval Office with Matt Drudge .\nTrump remains reliant as ever on his children and longtime friends for counsel . White House staff have learned to cater to the president \u2019 s image obsession by presenting decisions in terms of how they \u2019 ll play in the press . Among his first reads in the morning is still the New York Post . When Trump feels like playing golf , he does \u2014 at courses he owns . When Trump feels like eating out , he does \u2014 at hotels with his name on the outside .\nAs president , Trump has repeatedly reminded his audiences , both public and private , about his longshot electoral victory . That unexpected win gave him and his closest advisers the false sense that governing would be as easy to master as running a successful campaign turned out to be . It was a rookie mistake . From the indignity of judges halting multiple executive orders on immigration-related matters\u2014most recently this week\u2014to his responses to repeated episodes of North Korean belligerence , it \u2019 s all been more complicated than Trump had been prepared to believe .\n\u201c I think he \u2019 s much more aware how complicated the world is , \u201d said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who serves as an informal administration adviser . \u201c This will all be more uphill than he thought it would be because I think he had the old-fashioned American idea that you run for office , you win , then people behave as though you won . \u201d\nTrump has had some successes . He nominated and saw confirmed a new Supreme Court justice , rolled back Obama-era regulations , and oversaw dramatic military actions in Syria and Afghanistan . He has signed rafts of executive actions , unilateral decisions familiar to the former Trump Organization president .\nYet he approaches the 100-day mark with record-low approval ratings and no major legislative accomplishment to his credit . Nothing hit Trump harder , according to senior White House officials , than the congressional defeat of his first major legislative package\u2014the bill to repeal Obamacare . As he sat in the Oval Office last week , Trump seemed to concede that even having risen to fame through real estate and entertainment , the presidency represented something very different .\n\u201c Making business decisions and buying buildings don \u2019 t involve heart , \u201d he said . \u201c This involves heart . These are heavy decisions . \u201d\nMore than 200 of Trump \u2019 s campaign promises are scribbled in marker on a whiteboard in Steve Bannon \u2019 s West Wing office , which he calls his \u201c war room. \u201d Other pledges are printed and taped beneath a poster that says : \u201c Make America Great Again . \u201d\n\u201c Deport 2 million criminal illegal immigrants , \u201d reads one pledge . Others call for all of President Obama \u2019 s executive orders to be reversed and for the U.S. to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement , or NAFTA . A few have large check marks next to them . Another sign notes 11 have been delayed . It \u2019 s a visual encapsulation of how Bannon sees the presidency about keeping promises .\nIn Kushner \u2019 s office , just steps away , there \u2019 s no \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d memorabilia . Instead , the whiteboard lists deadlines for bipartisan projects in his newly-founded Office of American Innovation on infrastructure and veterans \u2019 affairs . Kushner often talks about the presidency like it \u2019 s a business , describing it privately as \u201c entrepreneurial \u201d and in \u201c beta mode. \u201d He often doesn \u2019 t mind when Trump flip-flops , if it \u2019 s in the service of striking a deal .\nThe gap in worldview and temperament between the two has produced the most combustible , and consequential , conflict in the West Wing . In the first days following Trump \u2019 s inauguration , it was Bannon who pushed to speed through a blitz of executive orders , including the ill-fated travel ban . And it \u2019 s been Kushner , a 36-year-old real estate scion , who \u2019 s leaned the other way , encouraging his capricious father-in-law to espouse less divisive positions .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an ideas and ideology battle every day , \u201d one senior administration official said .\nPerhaps the defining and unanswered question of the Trump presidency is what he truly believes in . Is he the inflexible immigration hardliner who described undocumented Mexican immigrants as \u201c rapists \u201d in his June 2015 kickoff speech or the president who recently said those brought here illegally as children should \u201c rest easy \u201d because he doesn \u2019 t plan to deport them ? Will he try to make deals with Democrats ? Or will he devote himself to Bannon \u2019 s nationalist agenda ? And , other than winning , what does Trump really want ?\nNo single day was more telling about the ambiguity of Trumpism than April 12 . It was that day that Trump not-so-quietly reversed himself on at least four of his campaign promises . He canceled a federal hiring freeze imposed in his first week . He flipped on labeling China a currency manipulator . He endorsed the Export-Import bank that he had called to eliminate . He declared NATO relevant , after trashing it repeatedly on the campaign trail .\n\u201c I said it was obsolete , \u201d Trump said . \u201c It is no longer obsolete . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s critics and supporters alike are equally flummoxed about what this president stands for .\nWhite House communications director Mike Dubke told staff in a recent meeting \u201c there is no Trump doctrine \u201d when it comes to foreign policy . The president was moved to send missiles into Syria in part based on gruesome images of dead Syrian children he saw on TV . But he \u2019 s maintained the same hardline that those suffering children should not be accepted into America as refugees . Trump has overseen the use of the largest bomb short of a nuclear weapon in Afghanistan and talks tough about obliterating the Islamic State . Yet in a recent chat in his West Wing office , Priebus backed away from the idea of greater troop engagement , saying the administration doesn \u2019 t want to engage in \u201c long-term ground wars in the Middle East . \u201d\n\u201c He is not a movement conservative . He is definitely not an establishment Republican , \u201d said Ken Blackwell , who headed domestic policy during Trump \u2019 s transition . \u201c He \u2019 s transactional and makes calls based on his gut . Those of us who are accustomed to an ideological framework \u2014 it takes getting used to . \u201d\nBut Trump \u2019 s ideologically noncommittal approach has bumped up against the constraints of a hyperpartisan Washington where the letters on congressional vote cards \u2014 D or R \u2014 are paramount .\nSome are whispering that Trump should work with Democrats on infrastructure . Others say he must forge ahead only with Republicans on health care . Maybe he should work with both on taxes . Trump , it seems , is just looking for success .\n\u201c I am flexible , \u201d as Trump said recently in a Rose Garden appearance . \u201c And I \u2019 m proud of that flexibility . \u201d\nWhen Donald Trump gets angry , he fumes . \u201c You can \u2019 t make them happy , \u201d he said . \u201c These people want more and more . \u201d\nHe was complaining to friends that he had negotiated for weeks with Freedom Caucus members and he couldn \u2019 t believe the group was still against the health care legislation . Trump and his advisers were buzzing about making an enemies list and wanted to force a vote . But it was Trump , a man who hates to show weakness , who had to blink . As support flagged , the bill was shelved .\n\u201c I kind of pooh-poohed the experience stuff when I first got here , \u201d one White House official said of these early months . \u201c But this shit is hard . \u201d\nNowhere has Trump \u2019 s learning curve been steeper than Capitol Hill . According to people close to the president , Trump believed that in selecting Priebus as chief of staff he was getting a deeply connected Washington wise man , someone who could guide his agenda through Capitol Hill .\nBetween Priebus and Vice President Mike Pence , who once served in House leadership , Trump thought he had the experts he needed and wouldn \u2019 t have to worry about Congress that much . But Priebus is a political insider , not a congressional one . And Pence , who was governor of Indiana before joining Trump \u2019 s ticket , has been absent from the Hill during the rise of the House Freedom Caucus , the ideological hardliners who delivered Trump the most stinging defeat of his young presidency .\nHouse Republicans \u2019 rejection of his plan to repeal-and-replace Obamacare served as a wake-up call \u2014 and a clarifying moment when he realized he couldn \u2019 t leave Congress to others , even Speaker Paul Ryan .\nTrump had campaigned in generalities \u2014 \u201c repeal-and-replace with something terrific , \u201d he \u2019 d promised \u2014 and after the election Trump and his team decided to let Ryan take the lead on health care . Trump just wanted to sign a bill . He didn \u2019 t necessarily care what it said .\nBut the Freedom Caucus did . They felt left out of the process\u2014and they hated Ryan \u2019 s bill . They complained to the White House almost every day and made threats . They seized on the bill \u2019 s anemic public approval .\nSo Trump personally got involved , just as he had long negotiated with business partners , offering a mix of wooing and threats . He even dispatched his budget director , Mick Mulvaney , a former House GOP hardliner himself , to threaten a particularly outspoken critic , Rep. Mark Sanford .\nIt backfired . Freedom Caucus members weren \u2019 t afraid to say no . In an embarrassing setback , Trump called to pull the bill .\nPresident Donald Trump \u2019 s critics and supporters alike are equally flummoxed about what this president stands for . | Getty\nWhite House officials played down the loss in recent conversations -- even as Trump has put immense pressure on Pence and Priebus to resuscitate the bill . \u201c The narrative that somehow or another a signature piece of legislation must be out of the House and Senate in 100 days is a ridiculous standard , \u201d Priebus said .\nTrump seemed , at first , not to even understand the scope of his health care failure . He called reporters and spoke about moving on . Top-level aides bragged about his good mood . \u201c No bullshit , I think he \u2019 s actually pretty comfortable with the outcome , \u201d a senior White House official crowed .\nAfter the health care fight , Marc Short , the president \u2019 s legislative director , had a meeting with his team on \u201c lessons learned , \u201d people familiar with the meeting say . Several administration officials said Trump has told them not to leave the Congressional details to Ryan and others \u2013 and that he eventually grasped how damaging the health care defeat could be to the rest of his agenda .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think they realized what a big issue this was for the grassroots , \u201d said Jenny Beth Martin , head of Tea Party Patriots , who had met with Trump .\nTrump \u2019 s team now has another chance to pass the law . They spent several weeks wooing conservatives \u2013 and secured the backing Wednesday of the Freedom Caucus , which blocked the first bill from passing . They brought members and outside groups \u2013 including those funded by the conservative billionaire donors Charles and David Koch \u2013 to the White House .\nThey successfully convinced the conservatives who don \u2019 t like Ryan to get on board . But now , moderates concerned about making health benefits worse for their constituents are balking . White House officials are hoping to have a vote Friday or Saturday , just in time for Trump \u2019 s 100-day mark .\nThe defeat represented an early inflection point for a president who is openly more transactional than ideological . More than anything , it reinforced the president \u2019 s conviction that he could only trust the tight circle of people closest to him .\nNow , Trump is forging ahead alone on taxes , rolling out a dramatic package of tax cuts on Wednesday without input from Hill leaders . \u201c We aren \u2019 t listening to anyone else on taxes , \u201d said one senior administration official , referring to Ryan . \u201c It \u2019 s our plan . \u201d\nAs Trump is beginning to better understand the challenges\u2014and the limits\u2014of the presidency , his aides are understanding better how to manage perhaps the most improvisational and free-wheeling president in history . \u201c If you \u2019 re an adviser to him , your job is to help him at the margins , \u201d said one Trump confidante . \u201c To talk him out of doing crazy things . \u201d\nInterviews with White House officials , friends of Trump , veterans of his campaign and lawmakers paint a picture of a White House that has been slow to adapt to the demands of the most powerful office on earth .\n\u201c Everyone is concerned that things are not running that well , \u201d said one senior official . \u201c There should be more structure in place so we know who is working on what and who is responsible for what , instead of everyone freelancing on everything . \u201d\nBut they \u2019 re learning . One key development : White House aides have figured out that it \u2019 s best not to present Trump with too many competing options when it comes to matters of policy or strategy . Instead , the way to win Trump over , they say , is to present him a single preferred course of action and then walk him through what the outcome could be \u2013 and especially how it will play in the press .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t walk in with a traditional presentation , like a binder or a PowerPoint . He doesn \u2019 t care . He doesn \u2019 t consume information that way , \u201d said one senior administration official . \u201c You go in and tell him the pros and cons , and what the media coverage is going to be like . \u201d\nDownplaying the downside risk of a decision can win out in the short term . But the risk is a presidential dressing-down\u2014delivered in a yell . \u201c You don \u2019 t want to be the person who sold him on something that turned out to be a bad idea , \u201d the person said .\nAdvisers have tried to curtail Trump \u2019 s idle hours , hoping to prevent him from watching cable news or calling old friends and then tweeting about it . That only works during the workday , though\u2014Trump \u2019 s evenings and weekends have remained largely his own .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not like the White House doesn \u2019 t have a plan to fill his time productively but at the end of the day he \u2019 s in charge of his schedule , \u201d said one person close to the White House . \u201c He does not like being managed . \u201d\nHe also doesn \u2019 t like managing\u2014or , rather , doesn \u2019 t mind stoking competition among his staffers . While his predecessor was known as \u201c no-drama Obama , \u201d Trump has presided over a series of melodramas involving his top aides , including Priebus , Bannon , counselor Kellyanne Conway and economic adviser Gary Cohn .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply .\n\u201c He has always been a guy who loves the idea of being a royal surrounded by a court , \u201d said Michael D \u2019 Antonio , one of Trump \u2019 s biographers .\nMany of those aides spent the opening weeks of the presidency pushing their own agendas \u2013 and sparring with one another . Priebus brought into the White House his chief of staff , chief operating officer and chief strategist from the RNC ; Bannon has his own P.R . person and two writers from Breitbart ; Kushner brought allies from the business world , and recently recruited his own publicity adviser ; Conway has her own chief of staff ; now Ivanka Trump has a chief of staff , too .\nFor now , all sides seem to have forged a delicate d\u00e9tente . Kushner and Bannon met earlier this month at Trump \u2019 s Mar-a-Lago estate and agreed to work out their differences . Trump aides now downplay talk of a shakeup involving Bannon \u2013 talk that , until just a few days ago , had reached a fever pitch . There have been a few changes here and there \u2013 Katie Walsh is out as deputy chief of staff , and KT McFarland has been moved off the national security team \u2013 but don \u2019 t expect any big personnel changes anytime soon , they say .\nYet there is little question that the months of infighting have taken a toll on Trump \u2019 s aides . Many are unaccustomed to working for a man who can consult with 20 outside associates a day , change his mind in a minute and change his mood even quicker .\nOf late , some Republican National Committee members have become deeply concerned about Priebus , who was party chairman before joining Trump \u2019 s team . Priebus , who is distrusted by some rival White House factions and lacks the control previous chiefs of staff have had , has privately complained about the profound frustrations of the job .\nPriebus , who is married and has two young children , has vented about the long hours he \u2019 s had to spend away from his family . In March , he missed an RNC donor retreat in Florida because , he told friends at the time , he needed to be at home to celebrate one of his children \u2019 s birthdays .\nTrump the businessman and presidential candidate loved pitting top aides against one another . The internal competition ensured that the best ideas would rise to the top , he believed . Plus , he liked telling people , it made his employees work even harder to impress him .\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has developed a ritual of sorts : Just before going onstage for his televised briefings , he usually walks down the hall to the Oval Office to ask Trump what he wants to hear on TV that day . Cable news only occasionally carried press briefings from Obama \u2019 s secretaries in the later years of his presidency , but Spicer \u2019 s almost-daily outings have become a regular , wall-to-wall fixture .\nHis sessions with Trump were described by people familiar with them as part pep talk and part talking-point seminar . In the early days , Trump criticized Spicer fiercely , prompting him to upgrade his delivery at the podium as well as his wardrobe of suits . Now , people close to the president say , Trump brags about Spicer \u2019 s ratings .\nYet Trump continues to see himself as the best guardian of his own image . In New York , he infamously made calls to reporters pretending to be a spokesman . He personally called into the New York tabloid gossip pages as a source for years , and he even dialed cable news control rooms to suggest coverage after he became the presumptive Republican nominee in 2016 .\nThat hasn \u2019 t changed in the White House , where Trump continues to crave attention and approval from news media figures . Trump huddled in the Oval Office with Matt Drudge , the reclusive operator of the influential Drudge Report , to talk about his administration and the site . Drudge and Kushner have also begun to communicate frequently , said people familiar with the conversations . Drudge , whose visits to the White House haven \u2019 t previously been reported , didn \u2019 t respond to a request for comment .\nSeveral senior administration aides said Trump loves nothing more than talking to reporters \u2013 no matter what he says about the \u201c failing \u201d New York Times or CNN \u2013 and he often seems personally stung by negative coverage , cursing and yelling at the TV . Kushner , too , sometimes calls TV personalities and executives , in particular MSNBC host Joe Scarborough , according to people close to the Trump son-in-law . ( It didn \u2019 t go unnoticed in the West Wing that , at the height of the Kushner-Bannon war , the Drudge Report and Scarborough \u2019 s Morning Joe had an anti-Bannon flair to their coverage . )\nIf the goal of most administrations has been to set the media agenda for the day , it \u2019 s often the reverse in Trump \u2019 s White House , where what the president hears on the cable morning gabfests on Fox News , MSNBC and CNN can redirect his attention , schedule and agenda . The three TVs in the chief-of-staff 's office sometimes dictate the 8 a.m. meeting \u2013 and are always turned on to cable news , West Wing officials say .\nBehind the scenes , Trump \u2013 who beneath his confident veneer can be deeply sensitive to criticism \u2013 has been jolted when lawmakers took to TV to jab the president . If anyone had anything to say to the president , White House aides vented , they should do it with him personally \u2013 not from the camera . \u201c If you go on TV and blast him , it \u2019 s over , \u201d one senior administration official said .\nSince taking office , Trump has 16 times tagged Fox and Friends , the network \u2019 s morning show , in his tweets , and countless other times weighed in on whatever they were talking about on air . After Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings went on Morning Joe and asked the president to call him , Trump did . After Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher defended Trump in an early Saturday morning Fox News hit , Trump called him moments later , inviting him to an Oval Office meeting . And after news segments , Trump will sometimes call his own advisers to discuss what he saw .\nNo slight is too small to ignore . West Wing staffers have even fumed about news coverage of the Easter Egg Roll . First , it was that Trump \u2019 s White House wouldn \u2019 t be smart enough to pull it off . Then , it was that no one would be there . And after the Easter Egg Roll went off without a hitch , \u201c no one wanted to give us any credit , \u201d said one senior administration official .\nIt is part of a siege mentality that has taken hold , from the president down , with Trump and his associates believing their coverage has stayed just as bad \u2014 or gotten worse \u2014 since the campaign ended in November . Senior administration officials said they \u2019 ve never seen Trump angrier than when the media focused its attention on the crowd size at his inauguration .\nThe darkest cloud shadowing the West Wing has been continuous questions about the Trump campaign \u2019 s connections to Russia .\nThe FBI director testified he is investigating Trump associates for possible collusion with a hostile foreign power , Trump \u2019 s first national security adviser , Michael Flynn , resigned over his interactions with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Attorney General Jeff Sessions ultimately had to recuse himself from his own department \u2019 s investigation after he failed to disclose his own conversations with Kislyak .\n\u201c If we have a good day , then within 48 hours there \u2019 s a Russia story , \u201d said another senior administration official . \u201c That \u2019 s just how it works . \u201d\nThe news about Sessions \u2019 interaction with the Russian ambassador came the day after Trump \u2019 s widely praised speech to a joint session of Congress . And it stomped on any momentum the White House had , especially Trump \u2019 s trip to an aircraft carrier later that week . At the end of the week , after Sessions recused himself from the probe , Trump exploded at his aides about his frustrations .\nYet Trump was grinning in his office last week . He wanted to pose for pictures behind the cleaned-off Resolute desk and in front of his gold curtains . He has posed for hundreds of pictures there \u2013 sometimes with a grin , sometimes with a thumbs-up \u2013 and has guests stand behind him . He seemed a man of few worries -- even though his aides were back out pushing a high-stakes health care vote , the government was one week from shutting down and North Korea was continuing its provocations .\nThe fact that 100 days , as a marker , has no legal or actual significance outside the media has not seemed to matter to Trump . While he has publicly derided the deadline as \u201c ridiculous \u201d on Twitter , he has decidedly reshuffled his schedule , priorities and agenda in the last two weeks to notch political points , knowing the deadline would get inordinate media coverage .\nHe has repeatedly pressed aides to have a health care vote before Saturday . He surprised his own staff by promising a tax reform plan by this week and urged them to round out his list of accomplishments . He has maintained an aggressive calendar , wooing conservative outlets and traditional reporters alike .\nHe told aides this week needed to be a busy one \u2014 just as he told them after his inauguration .\nIn days 1 through 10 , it was executive orders on a federal hiring freeze , abortions abroad , withdrawing from an Asian trade deal and the explosive immigration order barring immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries . He got into a diplomatic row with Australia , one of America \u2019 s closest allies . The immigration order sparked international protests and was stopped in court . Trump later told advisers he regretted how it was handled .\nIn days 90 through 100 , it was a flurry of executive orders . He got into a diplomatic row with Canada , one of America \u2019 s closest allies , threatening a trade war . He moved toward unwinding NAFTA . \u201c There is no way we can do everything he wants to do this week , \u201d one senior official said .\n\u201c Trump is a guy of action . He likes to move , \u201d said Chris Ruddy , a close friend . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t necessarily worry about all the collateral damage or the consequences . \u201d\nWhite House officials say they now have a more deliberative process of decision-making . Issues don \u2019 t go to his desk until they \u2019 ve had a thorough vetting in at least three meetings . Aides have cautioned him to slow down and have told him everything is not possible in his time frame . Sometimes , administration officials say , he listens and takes the news well . Sometimes , he keeps the demands going .\nTrump may be learning and adjusting . But he is still Trump . On Saturday , he \u2019 ll celebrate his 100th day in office by boycotting the traditional White House Correspondents \u2019 Dinner in favor of a rally in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . The rallies , which remind him of the campaign trail , often improve his mood , several people close to him say . \u201c I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania , \u201d he tweeted by way of announcement . \u201c Look forward to it ! \u201d",
    "content_original": "Trump's First 100 Days The education of Donald Trump The White House remains on a collision course between the president's fixed habits and the demands of his new job.\n\nThe 70-year-old leader of the free world sat behind his desk in the Oval Office last Friday afternoon, doing what he\u2019s done for years: selling himself. His 100th day in office was approaching, and Trump was eager to reshape the hardening narrative of a White House veering off course.\n\nSo he took it upon himself to explain that his presidency was actually on track, inviting a pair of POLITICO reporters into the Oval Office for an impromptu meeting. He sat at the Resolute desk, with his daughter Ivanka across from him. One aide said the chat was off-the-record, but Trump insisted, over objections from nervous-looking staffers, that he be quoted.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe addressed the idea that his senior aides weren\u2019t getting along. He called out their names and, one by one, they walked in, each surprised to see reporters in the room\u2014chief of staff Reince Priebus, then chief strategist Steve Bannon, and eventually senior adviser Jared Kushner. \u201cThe team gets along really, really well,\u201d he said.\n\nHe turned to his relationships with world leaders. \u201cI have a terrific relationship with Xi,\u201d he said, referring to the Chinese president, who Trump recently invited for a weekend visit at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nFinally, he rattled off the biggest hits of his first three months and promised more to come.\n\nIt was classic Trump: Confident, hyperbolic and insistent on asserting control.\n\nBut interviews with nearly two dozen aides, allies, and others close to the president paint a different picture \u2013 one of a White House on a collision course between Trump\u2019s fixed habits and his growing realization that this job is harder than he imagined when he won the election on Nov. 8.\n\nSo far, Trump has led a White House gripped by paranoia and insecurity, paralyzed by internal jockeying for power. Mistrust between aides runs so deep that many now employ their own personal P.R. advisers \u2014 in part to ensure their own narratives get out. Trump himself has been deeply engaged with media figures, even huddling in the Oval Office with Matt Drudge.\n\nTrump remains reliant as ever on his children and longtime friends for counsel. White House staff have learned to cater to the president\u2019s image obsession by presenting decisions in terms of how they\u2019ll play in the press. Among his first reads in the morning is still the New York Post. When Trump feels like playing golf, he does \u2014 at courses he owns. When Trump feels like eating out, he does \u2014 at hotels with his name on the outside.\n\nAs president, Trump has repeatedly reminded his audiences, both public and private, about his longshot electoral victory. That unexpected win gave him and his closest advisers the false sense that governing would be as easy to master as running a successful campaign turned out to be. It was a rookie mistake. From the indignity of judges halting multiple executive orders on immigration-related matters\u2014most recently this week\u2014to his responses to repeated episodes of North Korean belligerence, it\u2019s all been more complicated than Trump had been prepared to believe.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s much more aware how complicated the world is,\u201d said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who serves as an informal administration adviser. \u201cThis will all be more uphill than he thought it would be because I think he had the old-fashioned American idea that you run for office, you win, then people behave as though you won.\u201d\n\nTrump has had some successes. He nominated and saw confirmed a new Supreme Court justice, rolled back Obama-era regulations, and oversaw dramatic military actions in Syria and Afghanistan. He has signed rafts of executive actions, unilateral decisions familiar to the former Trump Organization president.\n\nYet he approaches the 100-day mark with record-low approval ratings and no major legislative accomplishment to his credit. Nothing hit Trump harder, according to senior White House officials, than the congressional defeat of his first major legislative package\u2014the bill to repeal Obamacare. As he sat in the Oval Office last week, Trump seemed to concede that even having risen to fame through real estate and entertainment, the presidency represented something very different.\n\n\u201cMaking business decisions and buying buildings don\u2019t involve heart,\u201d he said. \u201cThis involves heart. These are heavy decisions.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nMore than 200 of Trump\u2019s campaign promises are scribbled in marker on a whiteboard in Steve Bannon\u2019s West Wing office, which he calls his \u201cwar room.\u201d Other pledges are printed and taped beneath a poster that says: \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeport 2 million criminal illegal immigrants,\u201d reads one pledge. Others call for all of President Obama\u2019s executive orders to be reversed and for the U.S. to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. A few have large check marks next to them. Another sign notes 11 have been delayed. It\u2019s a visual encapsulation of how Bannon sees the presidency about keeping promises.\n\nIn Kushner\u2019s office, just steps away, there\u2019s no \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d memorabilia. Instead, the whiteboard lists deadlines for bipartisan projects in his newly-founded Office of American Innovation on infrastructure and veterans\u2019 affairs. Kushner often talks about the presidency like it\u2019s a business, describing it privately as \u201centrepreneurial\u201d and in \u201cbeta mode.\u201d He often doesn\u2019t mind when Trump flip-flops, if it\u2019s in the service of striking a deal.\n\nThe gap in worldview and temperament between the two has produced the most combustible, and consequential, conflict in the West Wing. In the first days following Trump\u2019s inauguration, it was Bannon who pushed to speed through a blitz of executive orders, including the ill-fated travel ban. And it\u2019s been Kushner, a 36-year-old real estate scion, who\u2019s leaned the other way, encouraging his capricious father-in-law to espouse less divisive positions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ideas and ideology battle every day,\u201d one senior administration official said.\n\nPerhaps the defining and unanswered question of the Trump presidency is what he truly believes in. Is he the inflexible immigration hardliner who described undocumented Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d in his June 2015 kickoff speech or the president who recently said those brought here illegally as children should \u201crest easy\u201d because he doesn\u2019t plan to deport them? Will he try to make deals with Democrats? Or will he devote himself to Bannon\u2019s nationalist agenda? And, other than winning, what does Trump really want?\n\nNo single day was more telling about the ambiguity of Trumpism than April 12. It was that day that Trump not-so-quietly reversed himself on at least four of his campaign promises. He canceled a federal hiring freeze imposed in his first week. He flipped on labeling China a currency manipulator. He endorsed the Export-Import bank that he had called to eliminate. He declared NATO relevant, after trashing it repeatedly on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI said it was obsolete,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is no longer obsolete.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critics and supporters alike are equally flummoxed about what this president stands for.\n\nWhite House communications director Mike Dubke told staff in a recent meeting \u201cthere is no Trump doctrine\u201d when it comes to foreign policy. The president was moved to send missiles into Syria in part based on gruesome images of dead Syrian children he saw on TV. But he\u2019s maintained the same hardline that those suffering children should not be accepted into America as refugees. Trump has overseen the use of the largest bomb short of a nuclear weapon in Afghanistan and talks tough about obliterating the Islamic State. Yet in a recent chat in his West Wing office, Priebus backed away from the idea of greater troop engagement, saying the administration doesn\u2019t want to engage in \u201clong-term ground wars in the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is not a movement conservative. He is definitely not an establishment Republican,\u201d said Ken Blackwell, who headed domestic policy during Trump\u2019s transition. \u201cHe\u2019s transactional and makes calls based on his gut. Those of us who are accustomed to an ideological framework \u2014 it takes getting used to.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s ideologically noncommittal approach has bumped up against the constraints of a hyperpartisan Washington where the letters on congressional vote cards \u2014 D or R \u2014 are paramount.\n\nSome are whispering that Trump should work with Democrats on infrastructure. Others say he must forge ahead only with Republicans on health care. Maybe he should work with both on taxes. Trump, it seems, is just looking for success.\n\n\u201cI am flexible,\u201d as Trump said recently in a Rose Garden appearance. \u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of that flexibility.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhen Donald Trump gets angry, he fumes. \u201cYou can\u2019t make them happy,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people want more and more.\u201d\n\nHe was complaining to friends that he had negotiated for weeks with Freedom Caucus members and he couldn\u2019t believe the group was still against the health care legislation. Trump and his advisers were buzzing about making an enemies list and wanted to force a vote. But it was Trump, a man who hates to show weakness, who had to blink. As support flagged, the bill was shelved.\n\n\u201cI kind of pooh-poohed the experience stuff when I first got here,\u201d one White House official said of these early months. \u201cBut this shit is hard.\u201d\n\nNowhere has Trump\u2019s learning curve been steeper than Capitol Hill. According to people close to the president, Trump believed that in selecting Priebus as chief of staff he was getting a deeply connected Washington wise man, someone who could guide his agenda through Capitol Hill.\n\nBetween Priebus and Vice President Mike Pence, who once served in House leadership, Trump thought he had the experts he needed and wouldn\u2019t have to worry about Congress that much. But Priebus is a political insider, not a congressional one. And Pence, who was governor of Indiana before joining Trump\u2019s ticket, has been absent from the Hill during the rise of the House Freedom Caucus, the ideological hardliners who delivered Trump the most stinging defeat of his young presidency.\n\nHouse Republicans\u2019 rejection of his plan to repeal-and-replace Obamacare served as a wake-up call \u2014 and a clarifying moment when he realized he couldn\u2019t leave Congress to others, even Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nTrump had campaigned in generalities \u2014 \u201crepeal-and-replace with something terrific,\u201d he\u2019d promised \u2014 and after the election Trump and his team decided to let Ryan take the lead on health care. Trump just wanted to sign a bill. He didn\u2019t necessarily care what it said.\n\nBut the Freedom Caucus did. They felt left out of the process\u2014and they hated Ryan\u2019s bill. They complained to the White House almost every day and made threats. They seized on the bill\u2019s anemic public approval.\n\nSo Trump personally got involved, just as he had long negotiated with business partners, offering a mix of wooing and threats. He even dispatched his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, a former House GOP hardliner himself, to threaten a particularly outspoken critic, Rep. Mark Sanford.\n\nIt backfired. Freedom Caucus members weren\u2019t afraid to say no. In an embarrassing setback, Trump called to pull the bill.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s critics and supporters alike are equally flummoxed about what this president stands for. | Getty\n\nWhite House officials played down the loss in recent conversations -- even as Trump has put immense pressure on Pence and Priebus to resuscitate the bill. \u201cThe narrative that somehow or another a signature piece of legislation must be out of the House and Senate in 100 days is a ridiculous standard,\u201d Priebus said.\n\nTrump seemed, at first, not to even understand the scope of his health care failure. He called reporters and spoke about moving on. Top-level aides bragged about his good mood. \u201cNo bullshit, I think he\u2019s actually pretty comfortable with the outcome,\u201d a senior White House official crowed.\n\nAfter the health care fight, Marc Short, the president\u2019s legislative director, had a meeting with his team on \u201clessons learned,\u201d people familiar with the meeting say. Several administration officials said Trump has told them not to leave the Congressional details to Ryan and others \u2013 and that he eventually grasped how damaging the health care defeat could be to the rest of his agenda.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they realized what a big issue this was for the grassroots,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, head of Tea Party Patriots, who had met with Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s team now has another chance to pass the law. They spent several weeks wooing conservatives \u2013 and secured the backing Wednesday of the Freedom Caucus, which blocked the first bill from passing. They brought members and outside groups \u2013 including those funded by the conservative billionaire donors Charles and David Koch \u2013 to the White House.\n\nThey successfully convinced the conservatives who don\u2019t like Ryan to get on board. But now, moderates concerned about making health benefits worse for their constituents are balking. White House officials are hoping to have a vote Friday or Saturday, just in time for Trump\u2019s 100-day mark.\n\nThe defeat represented an early inflection point for a president who is openly more transactional than ideological. More than anything, it reinforced the president\u2019s conviction that he could only trust the tight circle of people closest to him.\n\nNow, Trump is forging ahead alone on taxes, rolling out a dramatic package of tax cuts on Wednesday without input from Hill leaders. \u201cWe aren\u2019t listening to anyone else on taxes,\u201d said one senior administration official, referring to Ryan. \u201cIt\u2019s our plan.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nAs Trump is beginning to better understand the challenges\u2014and the limits\u2014of the presidency, his aides are understanding better how to manage perhaps the most improvisational and free-wheeling president in history. \u201cIf you\u2019re an adviser to him, your job is to help him at the margins,\u201d said one Trump confidante. \u201cTo talk him out of doing crazy things.\u201d\n\nInterviews with White House officials, friends of Trump, veterans of his campaign and lawmakers paint a picture of a White House that has been slow to adapt to the demands of the most powerful office on earth.\n\n\u201cEveryone is concerned that things are not running that well,\u201d said one senior official. \u201cThere should be more structure in place so we know who is working on what and who is responsible for what, instead of everyone freelancing on everything.\u201d\n\nBut they\u2019re learning. One key development: White House aides have figured out that it\u2019s best not to present Trump with too many competing options when it comes to matters of policy or strategy. Instead, the way to win Trump over, they say, is to present him a single preferred course of action and then walk him through what the outcome could be \u2013 and especially how it will play in the press.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t walk in with a traditional presentation, like a binder or a PowerPoint. He doesn\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t consume information that way,\u201d said one senior administration official. \u201cYou go in and tell him the pros and cons, and what the media coverage is going to be like.\u201d\n\nDownplaying the downside risk of a decision can win out in the short term. But the risk is a presidential dressing-down\u2014delivered in a yell. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the person who sold him on something that turned out to be a bad idea,\u201d the person said.\n\nAdvisers have tried to curtail Trump\u2019s idle hours, hoping to prevent him from watching cable news or calling old friends and then tweeting about it. That only works during the workday, though\u2014Trump\u2019s evenings and weekends have remained largely his own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the White House doesn\u2019t have a plan to fill his time productively but at the end of the day he\u2019s in charge of his schedule,\u201d said one person close to the White House. \u201cHe does not like being managed.\u201d\n\nHe also doesn\u2019t like managing\u2014or, rather, doesn\u2019t mind stoking competition among his staffers. While his predecessor was known as \u201cno-drama Obama,\u201d Trump has presided over a series of melodramas involving his top aides, including Priebus, Bannon, counselor Kellyanne Conway and economic adviser Gary Cohn.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Priebus brought into the White House his chief of staff, chief operating officer and chief strategist from the RNC; Bannon has his own P.R. person and two writers from Breitbart; Kushner brought allies from the business world, and recently recruited his own publicity adviser; Conway has her own chief of staff; now Ivanka Trump has a chief of staff, too.\n\nFor now, all sides seem to have forged a delicate d\u00e9tente. Kushner and Bannon met earlier this month at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate and agreed to work out their differences. Trump aides now downplay talk of a shakeup involving Bannon \u2013 talk that, until just a few days ago, had reached a fever pitch. There have been a few changes here and there \u2013 Katie Walsh is out as deputy chief of staff, and KT McFarland has been moved off the national security team \u2013 but don\u2019t expect any big personnel changes anytime soon, they say.\n\nYet there is little question that the months of infighting have taken a toll on Trump\u2019s aides. Many are unaccustomed to working for a man who can consult with 20 outside associates a day, change his mind in a minute and change his mood even quicker.\n\nOf late, some Republican National Committee members have become deeply concerned about Priebus, who was party chairman before joining Trump\u2019s team. Priebus, who is distrusted by some rival White House factions and lacks the control previous chiefs of staff have had, has privately complained about the profound frustrations of the job.\n\nPriebus, who is married and has two young children, has vented about the long hours he\u2019s had to spend away from his family. In March, he missed an RNC donor retreat in Florida because, he told friends at the time, he needed to be at home to celebrate one of his children\u2019s birthdays.\n\nTrump the businessman and presidential candidate loved pitting top aides against one another. The internal competition ensured that the best ideas would rise to the top, he believed. Plus, he liked telling people, it made his employees work even harder to impress him.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has developed a ritual of sorts: Just before going onstage for his televised briefings, he usually walks down the hall to the Oval Office to ask Trump what he wants to hear on TV that day. Cable news only occasionally carried press briefings from Obama\u2019s secretaries in the later years of his presidency, but Spicer\u2019s almost-daily outings have become a regular, wall-to-wall fixture.\n\nHis sessions with Trump were described by people familiar with them as part pep talk and part talking-point seminar. In the early days, Trump criticized Spicer fiercely, prompting him to upgrade his delivery at the podium as well as his wardrobe of suits. Now, people close to the president say, Trump brags about Spicer\u2019s ratings.\n\nYet Trump continues to see himself as the best guardian of his own image. In New York, he infamously made calls to reporters pretending to be a spokesman. He personally called into the New York tabloid gossip pages as a source for years, and he even dialed cable news control rooms to suggest coverage after he became the presumptive Republican nominee in 2016.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t changed in the White House, where Trump continues to crave attention and approval from news media figures. Trump huddled in the Oval Office with Matt Drudge, the reclusive operator of the influential Drudge Report, to talk about his administration and the site. Drudge and Kushner have also begun to communicate frequently, said people familiar with the conversations. Drudge, whose visits to the White House haven\u2019t previously been reported, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nSeveral senior administration aides said Trump loves nothing more than talking to reporters \u2013 no matter what he says about the \u201cfailing\u201d New York Times or CNN \u2013 and he often seems personally stung by negative coverage, cursing and yelling at the TV. Kushner, too, sometimes calls TV personalities and executives, in particular MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, according to people close to the Trump son-in-law. (It didn\u2019t go unnoticed in the West Wing that, at the height of the Kushner-Bannon war, the Drudge Report and Scarborough\u2019s Morning Joe had an anti-Bannon flair to their coverage.)\n\nIf the goal of most administrations has been to set the media agenda for the day, it\u2019s often the reverse in Trump\u2019s White House, where what the president hears on the cable morning gabfests on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN can redirect his attention, schedule and agenda. The three TVs in the chief-of-staff's office sometimes dictate the 8 a.m. meeting \u2013 and are always turned on to cable news, West Wing officials say.\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump \u2013 who beneath his confident veneer can be deeply sensitive to criticism \u2013 has been jolted when lawmakers took to TV to jab the president. If anyone had anything to say to the president, White House aides vented, they should do it with him personally \u2013 not from the camera. \u201cIf you go on TV and blast him, it\u2019s over,\u201d one senior administration official said.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has 16 times tagged Fox and Friends, the network\u2019s morning show, in his tweets, and countless other times weighed in on whatever they were talking about on air. After Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings went on Morning Joe and asked the president to call him, Trump did. After Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher defended Trump in an early Saturday morning Fox News hit, Trump called him moments later, inviting him to an Oval Office meeting. And after news segments, Trump will sometimes call his own advisers to discuss what he saw.\n\nNo slight is too small to ignore. West Wing staffers have even fumed about news coverage of the Easter Egg Roll. First, it was that Trump\u2019s White House wouldn\u2019t be smart enough to pull it off. Then, it was that no one would be there. And after the Easter Egg Roll went off without a hitch, \u201cno one wanted to give us any credit,\u201d said one senior administration official.\n\nIt is part of a siege mentality that has taken hold, from the president down, with Trump and his associates believing their coverage has stayed just as bad \u2014 or gotten worse \u2014 since the campaign ended in November. Senior administration officials said they\u2019ve never seen Trump angrier than when the media focused its attention on the crowd size at his inauguration.\n\nThe darkest cloud shadowing the West Wing has been continuous questions about the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia.\n\nThe FBI director testified he is investigating Trump associates for possible collusion with a hostile foreign power, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned over his interactions with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Attorney General Jeff Sessions ultimately had to recuse himself from his own department\u2019s investigation after he failed to disclose his own conversations with Kislyak.\n\n\u201cIf we have a good day, then within 48 hours there\u2019s a Russia story,\u201d said another senior administration official. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it works.\u201d\n\nThe news about Sessions\u2019 interaction with the Russian ambassador came the day after Trump\u2019s widely praised speech to a joint session of Congress. And it stomped on any momentum the White House had, especially Trump\u2019s trip to an aircraft carrier later that week. At the end of the week, after Sessions recused himself from the probe, Trump exploded at his aides about his frustrations.\n\n\n\n***\n\nYet Trump was grinning in his office last week. He wanted to pose for pictures behind the cleaned-off Resolute desk and in front of his gold curtains. He has posed for hundreds of pictures there \u2013 sometimes with a grin, sometimes with a thumbs-up \u2013 and has guests stand behind him. He seemed a man of few worries -- even though his aides were back out pushing a high-stakes health care vote, the government was one week from shutting down and North Korea was continuing its provocations.\n\nThe fact that 100 days, as a marker, has no legal or actual significance outside the media has not seemed to matter to Trump. While he has publicly derided the deadline as \u201cridiculous\u201d on Twitter, he has decidedly reshuffled his schedule, priorities and agenda in the last two weeks to notch political points, knowing the deadline would get inordinate media coverage.\n\nHe has repeatedly pressed aides to have a health care vote before Saturday. He surprised his own staff by promising a tax reform plan by this week and urged them to round out his list of accomplishments. He has maintained an aggressive calendar, wooing conservative outlets and traditional reporters alike.\n\nHe told aides this week needed to be a busy one \u2014 just as he told them after his inauguration.\n\nIn days 1 through 10, it was executive orders on a federal hiring freeze, abortions abroad, withdrawing from an Asian trade deal and the explosive immigration order barring immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries. He got into a diplomatic row with Australia, one of America\u2019s closest allies. The immigration order sparked international protests and was stopped in court. Trump later told advisers he regretted how it was handled.\n\nIn days 90 through 100, it was a flurry of executive orders. He got into a diplomatic row with Canada, one of America\u2019s closest allies, threatening a trade war. He moved toward unwinding NAFTA. \u201cThere is no way we can do everything he wants to do this week,\u201d one senior official said.\n\n\u201cTrump is a guy of action. He likes to move,\u201d said Chris Ruddy, a close friend. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t necessarily worry about all the collateral damage or the consequences.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials say they now have a more deliberative process of decision-making. Issues don\u2019t go to his desk until they\u2019ve had a thorough vetting in at least three meetings. Aides have cautioned him to slow down and have told him everything is not possible in his time frame. Sometimes, administration officials say, he listens and takes the news well. Sometimes, he keeps the demands going.\n\nTrump may be learning and adjusting. But he is still Trump. On Saturday, he\u2019ll celebrate his 100th day in office by boycotting the traditional White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in favor of a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The rallies, which remind him of the campaign trail, often improve his mood, several people close to him say. \u201cI will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania,\u201d he tweeted by way of announcement. \u201cLook forward to it!\u201d\n\nBen White contributed to this report.",
