But he is not willing to accept a deal that does n't ask enough of the very wealthiest in taxes and instead shifts the burden to the middle class and seniors . The speaker 's 'Plan B ' approach does n't meet this test because it ca n't pass the Senate and therefore will not protect middle class families , and does little to address our fiscal challenges with zero spending cuts .
