Imagine a stereotypical member of the 1 percent class who has closets full of luxury fashion , a house equipped with the latest in high-end entertainment technology , a driveway overflowing with cars . Sounds nice , but that kind of lifestyle presents a problem at Christmas : What gifts can you get someone who literally has everything ?\nRich people , like unhappy families , are all different . Members of the working class may be consumed by mundane concerns like making sure their kids can go to college and their cars can get them to their jobs , but the wealthier you are , the more resources you can devote to your personal interests and esoteric hobbies , whether that means getting really into Scotch , exotic pets , or toppling governments . Tailoring a gift to a rich person 's idiosyncratic desires is therefore paramount .\n`` There are different stages of development in the high net worth world , '' said Winston Chesterfield , the founder of Barton Consulting , a firm that advises companies marketing luxury items to the wealthy . Those who are new to wealth tend to flaunt it , he said : `` Whether you 're in the U.S.A. or Ukraine you want to express it , you want to show that you have wealth to your family members , to people who are friends of your family , to yourself . You want to prove it . '' That means watches and jewelry for your spouse , new cars for your kids , Travis Scott giving Kylie Jenner an over-the-top diamond necklace made to look like her company 's logo .\nBut people who have had money for longer\u2014either because they 've grown up rich or because they 've had years to enjoy their money\u2014tend to lose that urge to flash . `` They feel that actually it 's a risk to spend money , '' said Chesterfield . `` They get a little bit more cynical and they get a little more focused on value for money . '' This type of rich person might be generous in giving to charity , they might buy something for a family member whenever asked , but they are n't buying ribbon-adorned Range Rovers for their kids to wake up to on Christmas morning . `` People worth hundreds of millions do n't really just gift wall-to-wall Louis Vuitton and Chanel boxes , '' said Chesterfield . `` That 's not really what they want to do . ''\nIn other words , you could blow your entire paycheck on a handbag for your fashionable over-privileged friend and it would only confirm how out of step you are . As chronicled in a 2018 article about gift-giving in the notoriously posh British magazine Tatler , among many rich people it really is the thought that counts\u2014you want to lavish attention and time on your friends , not just money , though you will naturally spend a lot of money on gifts too :\nNothing is more piously time-consuming than an experience gift : something that you can do together , such as a transatlantic cruise on the Queen Mary 2 for a cherished friend who \u2019 s scared of flying , or a course with their favourite personal trainer at the Lanesborough . You might even , for a friend \u2019 s 50th birthday , give her 50 different experiences in the 50 days running up to the big day . And then , when your birthday came around , she would remember you once told her that , as a teenager , you really fancied a chef from Ready Steady Cook , then hire him for the night to rustle up a meal at the Connaught with six of your best friends .\n( Do n't worry if you do n't know what the Lanesborough or the Connaught are ; you ca n't afford to stay in those hotels anyway . )\nSo it 's no surprise that this year 's gift guide from Robb Report , a luxury publication that contains a lot of coverage of private jets , skews heavily toward the experiential .
