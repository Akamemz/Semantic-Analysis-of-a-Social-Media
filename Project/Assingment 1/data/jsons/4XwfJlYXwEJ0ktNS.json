    "content": "The House of Representatives devolved into chaos Tuesday over whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had the right to say that President Donald Trump \u2019 s tweets attacking four progressive lawmakers of color were \u201c racist , \u201d as a matter of official record .\nThe controversy started during a debate over a House resolution condemning Trump \u2019 s tweets , in which he said the four lawmakers , three of whom were born in the US , should \u201c go back \u201d to other countries . ( The resolution ultimately passed on a vote of 240-187 , with four Republicans voting in favor . ) Pelosi called the tweets racist during a speech on the House floor .\n\u201c Every single member of this institution should join us in condemning the president \u2019 s racist tweets , \u201d Pelosi said . \u201c To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people . \u201d\nRepublicans called for Pelosi \u2019 s words to be removed from the official record , arguing the speaker broke a House parliamentary rule that states lawmakers can not malign the character of the president .\nWhat ensued was hours of tumult that pushed Democrats and Republicans into their respective corners , caused the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus to \u201c abandon \u201d his duties presiding over the House floor , and that left Pelosi \u2014 the House speaker \u2014 temporarily banned from speaking on the floor for the rest of the day . ( We \u2019 ll explain all of this ) .\nThe mayhem comes down to House Republicans \u2019 refusal to censure Trump , no matter the extremity of his rhetoric . Since his weekend tweets , Trump has not backed down on his comments about Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Ilhan Omar , Ayanna Pressley , and Rashida Tlaib , saying they \u201c hate \u201d the United States . Republicans have been steadfast in defending him .\n\u201c Let us preserve those ideals of order and decency this body was founded on , \u201d Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on the House floor as he called for Pelosi \u2019 s remarks to be removed from the record . \u201c Madame Speaker , it \u2019 s not just our nation that \u2019 s watching , but the world is watching . I hope you can rise to this occasion . \u201d\nBut for Democrats , now in the House majority , Pelosi \u2019 s statement \u2014 and the resolution \u2014 are a matter of accountability .\n\u201c We can \u2019 t be gagged when we want to criticize the actions of the president , \u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin ( D-MD ) said .\nIn the middle of a vote , civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis ( D-GA ) told reporters outside the floor of the House , \u201c The president is a racist . We can not deny that . \u201d\nNancy Pelosi \u2019 s fight to call Trump \u2019 s tweets racist and the mayhem on the House floor , explained\nPelosi calling Trump \u2019 s tweets racist on the House floor was met with immediate objection from the Republican side of the aisle .\nRep. Doug Collins ( R-GA ) said she broke the House rules by attacking Trump \u2019 s character .\n. @ SpeakerPelosi : `` Every single member of this institution ... should join us in condemning the president 's racist tweets . To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people . '' pic.twitter.com/nsskh7TuCS \u2014 CSPAN ( @ cspan ) July 16 , 2019\nBut Pelosi said the parliamentarian ( the official who advises representatives on the House \u2019 s rules ) had already signed off on her speech , and refused to withdraw her words . Then came the chaos .\nRepublicans and Democrats engaged in an hour-long deliberation , with tensions escalating on the floor . Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ( D-MO ) , the former leader of the Congressional Black Caucus who was presiding over the House floor during Pelosi \u2019 s speech , decided to \u201c abandon the chair \u201d out of frustration .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t ever , ever want to pass up , it seems , an opportunity to escalate , \u201d Cleaver said , chastising the lawmakers on the floor . \u201c I dare anyone to look at any of the footage and see if there was any unfairness . But unfairness is not enough because we just want to fight . I abandon the chair . \u201d\nIn Cleaver \u2019 s absence , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D-MD ) took the chair and brought with him a decision \u2014 one that surprised his own party . He ruled that Pelosi \u2019 s remarks were not in order . In other words , he ruled that lawmakers , including Pelosi , could not say Trump or his tweets were racist . Instead , they would go on to say the rhetoric coming out of the White House was . ( That \u2019 s how closely House members were parsing their words . )\nThat ruling pushed the House floor to a vote : The body as a whole would have to decide whether Pelosi \u2019 s comments calling Trump \u2019 s tweet \u2019 s racist would be removed from the official record . Democrats stood in lockstep : The motion to strike them failed 190-232 . Independent Rep. Justin Amash ( MI ) , who recently left the Republican Party , voted with Democrats .\nBut that wasn \u2019 t the only vote the body had to take . Because Hoyer ruled that Pelosi \u2019 s words had violated decorum , Pelosi got the punishment House members receive for speaking out of turn : not being allowed to speak on the floor for the rest of the day . That punishment was overturned by a vote , too .\n\u201c The speaker engaged in a small-but-necessary act of legislative civil disobedience , \u201d Rep. Raskin said . \u201c She needed to tell the truth about the president \u2019 s remarks . \u201d\nRaskin added , \u201c There is a logic for parliamentary rules to prevent us from engaging in ad hominem attacks , where we attack the personality or character of the president . But Speaker Pelosi didn \u2019 t do that . She criticized his remarks . And members of the House have to have the right to do that . To criticize policy and remarks of the president . That \u2019 s a necessary implication of the separation of powers . \u201d\nBlame Thomas Jefferson for the obscure parliamentary procedure behind all this\nThe crux of this fight is a line in House parliamentary procedure that \u201c personal abuse , innuendo , or ridicule of the President is not permitted . \u201d\nAs Josh Chafetz , a law professor at Cornell Law School , pointed out in a Twitter thread , this is not actually a standing rule of the House .
