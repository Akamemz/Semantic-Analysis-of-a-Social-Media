It 's real . It 's palpable .\nCase in point : The American Prospect 's Paul Waldman gives us an earful about President Trump and how Trump is destroying everything that 's good and decent in America . Let me share some of his words , which speak for themselves -- but I 'll speak for them , too .\n`` The impending impeachment of Donald Trump brings with it the possibility of something that has been in short supply over the last three years : accountability , '' Waldman writes . `` At last , you may think , we can use a constitutional process to proclaim at last that This Is Not OK. '' Waldman goes on to acknowledge that Trump probably wo n't be held to account after all , because though the House will likely impeach him , the Senate will vote against removing him from office .\nWhat strikes me is Waldman 's unchecked assertion that Trump 's accountability `` has been in short supply . '' He wholly ignores that Democrats have been feverishly pursuing Trump since he announced his candidacy . For two years , they 've prosecuted a bogus case on Trump `` colluding '' with Russia , guaranteeing they had unimpeachable evidence .\nThey were lying , and their would-be savior , special counsel Robert Mueller , produced no evidence of collusion . Accountability ? Why have n't the Democrats had to answer for their wasting taxpayers ' time and money over this lie ? Neither they nor their legacy media co-conspirators have uttered one syllable of apology to the American people , let alone President Trump , for dragging us through this nightmare .\nInstead , they immediately pivoted to Ukraine . Here we go again -- but this time , it 's really serious . What is this , the fourth impeachment attempt ? Why not ? We now know from released transcripts that they 've been planning this coup from the jump . We already knew it , but we 've got the smoking gun . Will they be held to account for their election and post-election interference ? Of course not , unless their constituents vote them out of office for abuse of power .\nWaldman continues : `` This is one of the products of Trump 's time in office : the contamination of our emotional lives . Trump has made us feel dread , despair , disillusionment , and a dozen other awful emotions whose grip it feels impossible to escape . And even if he loses in 2020 then slinks back to Mar-a-Lago to spend his days regaling his dwindling number of sycophants with tales of his matchless presidency , we 'll continue to live with the effects for years or even decades to come .

It 's just so exhausting for poor Waldman . He writes : `` And how many times have you found yourself almost involuntarily talking with friends or family about some awful thing Trump did or said , only to have someone stop and say , 'Oh god , let 's just not talk about him for a while . I ca n't take it . ''\nWhat 's exhausting is the ceaseless leftist noise machine railing against Trump . Leftists need to remove the smudges from their mirrors and see that they are projecting . They are the ones who have been vicious and hateful toward Trump from the beginning . They have wrongly accused him -- and his supporters ( half of Americans ) -- of racism and cruelty . They have contempt for all his supporters . Yet has Trump called them Nazis ? Racists ?\nIf you do n't believe me , read Waldman 's elaboration : `` For many the mere fact that Trump could win in 2016 ( even if he got three million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton ) was reason enough to lose faith in their country in a fundamental way . Eight years before they had convinced themselves that Barack Obama 's election meant America could be the place they wanted it to be : inclusive , tolerant , progressive , hopeful . Trump came along and told them that America was not that place . ''\nWhat ? Precisely the opposite is true . Progressives are the antithesis of inclusion , tolerance and hope .
