By that metric , 9 % of the public overall is consistently conservative , including 20 % of Republicans and Republican leaners ; most of the remaining Republicans and leaners were \u201c mostly conservative \u201d ( 33 % ) or had a mixture of liberal and conservative views ( 37 % ) .\nHere are five facts drawn from our package of reports about consistent conservatives :\n11Consistent conservatives participate in politics at higher rates than most other ideological groups . Political engagement tends to be highest among the most consistent conservatives and liberals , the Pew Research survey found . Half of consistent conservatives , for example , said they had contacted an elected official within the past two years \u2013 the highest level of any of our five groups . ( The corresponding figure for all Americans , by the way , was 28 % . ) Consistent conservatives also ranked high on other measurements of political engagement , such as donating money ( 26 % ) , attending campaign events ( 24 % ) and volunteering on a campaign ( 12 % ) .\n22Conservatives had outsize influence in the November midterm elections . Although consistent conservatives make up only about 9 % of the total adult population , they vote at higher rates than people elsewhere on the ideological spectrum : 78 % said they always vote , compared with 49 % of the general public . Consequently , a report we published a few weeks before the 2014 midterms estimated that consistent conservatives would make up 17 % of the November 2014 electorate .\n33Conservatives would rather live in small towns or rural areas than anywhere else . Our research found an overwhelming preference among the most conservative Americans for nonurban lifestyles : 41 % of consistent conservatives said they would live in a rural area if they could live anywhere in the U.S. , and 35 % picked a small town ; just 4 % said they \u2019 d prefer a city .\nSimilarly , three-quarters of consistent conservatives said they \u2019 d rather live in a place where \u201c the houses are larger and farther apart , but schools , stores and restaurants are several miles away , \u201d and just 22 % said they \u2019 d choose to live where \u201c the houses are smaller and closer to each other , but schools , stores and restaurants are within walking distance . \u201d\n44When it comes to raising children , conservatives prioritize responsibility , faith and hard work . When we asked our American Trends Panel about the three most important traits to teach children , 61 % of consistent conservatives cited \u201c being responsible , \u201d and about as many ( 59 % ) identified religious faith as particularly important ; hard work was chosen by 44 % . While responsibility led among all five ideological groups , and hard work was among the top three for all but consistent liberals , religious faith was chosen by significantly more consistent conservatives than all other groups .\n55Conservatives gravitate toward Fox News . A separate Pew Research report on polarization and media habits found that 47 % of consistent conservatives ( and 31 % of people with mostly conservative views ) cited Fox News as their main source for news about government and politics ; no other news source came close .
