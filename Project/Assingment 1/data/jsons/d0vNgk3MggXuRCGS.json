Jacqui Lewis was filled with an unexpected emotion when it was her time to address those gathered for a post-election song service in Manhattan \u2019 s Washington Square Park last week .\nEven before Tuesday , she and her progressive colleagues at Auburn Seminary in New York , a school with a mission to train multifaith leaders , wanted the service to be something simple : a \u201c soulful post-election singing to sustain our spirits , \u201d they called it , and a moment , they hoped , that could help heal and rejuvenate people \u2019 s spirits after such a bruising election .\nLike many in this corner of the country , however , they had really only imagined one winner , and that was not President-elect Donald Trump . So the song service was filled instead with tears , and many within the gathering \u2013 which included around 300 people of the Muslim , Jewish , Sikh , and Christian faiths \u2013 were searching for some new center at the \u201c songs for the soul \u201d service .\n\u201c This is what love looks like , \u201d said Ms. Lewis , standing in the middle of the crowd and noting that her congregation , Middle Collegiate Church in the East Village , is \u201c left of left of left. \u201d \u201c And I don \u2019 t presume that because you are in this circle , I don \u2019 t presume that you share my politics . I don \u2019 t know who you voted for in the privacy of the booth . What I do know , is that you are what love looks like to me this day . \u201d\nThroughout this week , both before and after the election of Mr. Trump as the nation \u2019 s 45th president , a number of faith leaders across the country had been planning services of healing and reconciliation , most citing the depth of the rancor and bitterness that had characterized much of the election .\nThey are in many ways , too , part of a traditional post-election ritual of American democracy : a call for the country to step back from the partisan vitriol and demand the peaceful transition of power , as President Obama and the president-elect did on Thursday , along with words of respect and unity .\nIn New York and other cities around the nation , however , protests continue to erupt , and despite the rituals of unity , some of the deep tensions within the campaign season have hardly begun to abate .\nThe song service in Washington Square , too , soon drew a number of students who had been shouting slogans against the newly-elected president . But they were drawn by the singing , and many joined the group to sing along and listen to the multifaith leaders \u2019 words .\n\u201c I \u2019 m talking about love that takes risks , that speaks truth , that dares to look the other in the eye \u2013 love is curious about why , why you voted that way . What \u2019 s your dream attached to that ? How can we find traction in the in-between spaces ? \u201d says Lewis . \u201c This isn \u2019 t time for polarities . This a now a both/and situation .
