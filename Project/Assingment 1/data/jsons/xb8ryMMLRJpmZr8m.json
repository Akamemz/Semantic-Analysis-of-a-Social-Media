On the convention floor , that argument got personal .\n\u201c I hope you realize the irony of what she \u2019 s doing , \u201d Paul Czisny , a Wisconsin delegate for Bernie Sanders , said , nodding his head backward at a young woman in the stands , a piece of white tape across her mouth that said in stark black letters SILENCED . Periodically , she stood up and photographers rushed over , camera shutters whirring , to snap her admittedly very dramatic portrait .\n\u201c She \u2019 s able to vote , she \u2019 s able to get elected as a delegate , she \u2019 s able to come here , \u201d Czisny rolled his eyes . He \u2019 s as pissed off as anyone about the business of the Democratic National Committee emails\u2014 \u201c it just feeds the frustrations of the Bernie people \u201d \u2014but he was frustrated with people like that young woman . \u201c Unfortunately , all they \u2019 re doing is aiding the Trump camp , \u201d he said . \u201c Virtually no one here \u201d \u2014meaning the Bernie delegates\u2014 \u201c is going to vote for Trump , but will they stay home ? Will they vote for Jill Stein [ of the Green Party ] ? I find this maddening because we \u2019 ve seen this movie before , and if we think Bush was a disaster , Trump will be an even bigger disaster . \u201d\nLike the other Bernie supporters in the Wisconsin delegation , he doesn \u2019 t love Hillary Clinton , but he would do the adult thing and vote for her come November . \u201c Because I \u2019 m not selfish , \u201d says 22-year-old Bernie activist Hailey Storsved , who led the student movement for Sanders at her university . \u201c It \u2019 s kind of like saying , \u2018 I \u2019 m taking my ball and going home . \u2019 \u201d\nMonday night 's Democratic National Convention felt , at times , like an unsettled argument\u2014a restive Sanders contingent looking for opportunities to boo the primary opponent he 'd been railing against for months , and boo everyone she 'd invited to support her . But a big part of the argument was underway within the Sanders camp itself : How long to hold out against your own party 's nominee ? This is politics , after all : At what point did principle become a kind of vanity ?\nAt what point does principle become a kind of vanity ?\nI tried to talk to the young woman with the tape over her mouth , but she refused to communicate , silenced as she was . Instead , she showed me a Facebook post she wrote . \u201c The DNC is threatening that they might pull my credentials if I don \u2019 t take this off , \u201d she wrote of her mouth tape . Her name is Angie Aker . \u201c They want to truly silence me . They don \u2019 t even want me to have this much free speech . \u201d\nA follow-up question about who she was and why she felt silenced resulted in her showing me her screen : another Facebook post . \u201c FOR THE MEDIA LOOKING FOR CONTEXT ON MY \u201c SILENCED \u201d CRY FOR HELP : the establishment wants us to lie for them and say we are behind Hillary when it \u2019 s clear there hasn \u2019 t even been a fair primary , \u201d she wrote . \u201c I \u2019 m desperate to show somehow it \u2019 s not true . \u201d\nThen she ran out of Facebook posts to show me , and commandeered my notepad to scribble me notes , like a modern Beethoven . \u201c Everyone has to vote their conscience , \u201d she wrote , echoing Ted Cruz at last week \u2019 s Republican convention . \u201c I don \u2019 t know who I \u2019 ll vote for . But I know I won \u2019 t cast my vote out of fear anymore . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 re talking about the political maturation of left-wing politics , \u201d said Peter Rickman , a young man leading the Wisconsin delegation , a longtime left-wing activist , and a Sanders supporter . He was going to get behind Clinton , rallying fellow Bernie-ites to her side because , as he said , \u201c We don \u2019 t need to love Hillary , but we need to mobilize so that , after November , we \u2019 re fighting for a progressive agenda under a Clinton White House and not being on the defensive in a proto-fascist regime. \u201d When I asked him about the silenced woman in his delegation , he too rolled his eyes at Aker . He leaned in conspiratorially . \u201c She runs Upworthy , \u201d he said , referring to the social media site . \u201c Soon someone is going to put two and two together that she \u2019 s just doing this to get personal attention. \u201d ( Aker actually works in video licensing for the site . )\nThere was a periodic booing from behind the very polite and very pragmatic Wisconsin delegation , most of whom seemed at peace with the need to vote for Clinton in the fall . \u201c Oh , that \u2019 s not us , \u201d one of them told me . \u201c That \u2019 s New Mexico . \u201d\nUp a few rows was the New Mexico delegation , which was in the thick of a civil war .\n\u201c No , never , \u201d said a young man named Rusty Pearce , a Sanders delegate from the state . \u201c This is a political revolution and a political revolution doesn \u2019 t just stop . \u201d\n\u201c We will continue to work to elect progressives up and down the ticket , \u201d said a freckled middle-aged woman named Nicole Renee Peters . She also wasn \u2019 t voting for Hillary . \u201c I \u2019 m not for Hillary and I \u2019 m not for Trump , \u201d she said defiantly . \u201c I will never vote for Hillary. \u201d Most of their state delegation , they both told me confidently , was for Sanders and felt the same way .\n\u201c Unfortunately , that \u2019 s not true , \u201d chimed in an older woman named Theresa Trujeque standing next to me with a Hillary sign . \u201c The majority is for Hillary. \u201d Twenty-four delegates out of 43 were for Hillary .\nAfter some squabbling and eye-rolling at me\u2014Can you believe her ? Can you believe these two ? \u2014they agreed that there were 18 delegates for Hillary and 16 for Bernie .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve been telling us to shut up all day , \u201d Peters complained to me .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve been fighting and booing all day , \u201d Trujeque complained to me .\nThey \u2019 ve been telling us to shut up all day , \u201d a Sanders delegate complained to me .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve been fighting and booing all day , \u201d a Clinton delegate complained to me .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve been fighting with the poor delegates with Indiana , \u201d Trujeque scolded . \u201c It \u2019 s not respectable . \u201d\n\u201c Well , I don \u2019 t find it respectable that Hillary Clinton lied under oath ! \u201d\n\u201c In the Democratic Party , there \u2019 s room for disagreement , \u201d Peters insisted . \u201c Instead you \u2019 re exercising fascism . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been involved in the Democratic Party for years and there \u2019 s no fraud , no corruption we take care of everyone .
