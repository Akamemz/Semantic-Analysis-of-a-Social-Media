Bush 's White House . `` I do n't go so far as to say that it 's perjury , but there is a lesser charge of failing to provide accurate information to Congress . ''\n`` A nominee at a confirmation hearing has an obligation to provide full and complete information to Congress , '' Painter continued . `` Conduct that might be just short of perjury in a deposition in a typical civil case is entirely inappropriate in front of Congress . ''\nHowever , such misdemeanor charges are usually only rolled out as part of a plea deal after prosecutors obtain or threaten more serious felony perjury charges . Some lawyers say those would be a stretch in Sessions ' case .\n`` Perjury is very hard to prove , '' said former House Counsel Stan Brand , who worked for the Democrats . `` You have to prove two elements that are very difficult in the Congressional context : one is intent and two is an absolutely clear and unambiguous question . ''\nHow Sessions ' statements fit into the typical rubric is somewhat unclear . While Sen. Al Franken 's question to Sessions was fairly clear , it was also a query about his future plans , and therefore almost incapable of generating a direct answer that would amount to perjury .\nSessions ' arguably erroneous statement was the kind of rhetorical detour counsel often tells their clients not to take when testifying : a gratuitous response that was n't really called for by the question .\nAfter a wind-up about breaking press reports on alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian agents , Franken asked : `` if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign , what will you do ? ''\nSessions replied : `` Senator Franken , I 'm not aware of any of those activities . I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did n't have \u2014 did not have communications with the Russians , and I 'm unable to comment on it .

Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the time . I appreciate that some have taken the view that this was a false comment . That is not my intent . That is not correct , '' the attorney general declared .\nHowever , later in the exchange with reporters , Sessions said he could not rule out the possibility that he discussed election-related matters during his September meeting with the Russian diplomat , Sergey Kislyak .\n`` I do n't recall , but most of these ambassadors are pretty gossipy , and .... this was in the campaign season , but I do n't recall any specific political discussions , '' the attorney general said .\nSessions ' initial denial could be legally problematic if it is contradicted by staffers at the meeting or by other evidence , such as intercepts of Russian reports on what was said , attorneys said .\nOne unpleasant parallel for Sessions comes from the prolonged confirmation hearings of Attorney General Richard Kleindienst in 1972 .\nDuring those hearings , Kleindienst denied that he 'd received instructions from anyone at the White House about how to handle a high-profile antitrust investigation into ITT Corp .\n`` I was not interfered with by anybody at the White House , '' he said repeatedly .\nA year later , tapes emerged of President Richard Nixon himself instructing Kleindienst to drop the case .\nKleindienst resigned less than a year into his tenure as attorney general .
