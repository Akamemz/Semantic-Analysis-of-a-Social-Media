    "content": "2013 got off to a promising start when perennial conservative huckster Dick Morris was finally fired from Fox News .\nBut any hope for year free from scandal unraveled as conservative outlets like Fox , and venerable institutions like CBS and CNN , found themselves mired in ethical morasses of their own making .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 looks back at the year in media ethics :\nCBS ' 60 Minutes did n't just bungle the reporting of its \u201c exclusive \u201d story about the 2012 terror attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi , Libya . The program also stonewalled when key questions were raised about its report , and failed to make a basic disclosure about its key witness .\nIn late October the top-rated news program ran a report rehashing old myths about Benghazi , and featuring the supposed \u201c eyewitness \u201d account of the attacks from British security contractor Dylan Davies , who appeared on the show under the pseudonym \u201c Morgan Jones. \u201d Davies ' claims included him scaling a 12 foot wall on the side of the diplomatic compound and dispatching a terrorist with his rifle butt . He also told correspondent Lara Logan he had supposedly seen Ambassador Chris Stevens ' dead body in a local hospital .\nAlmost immediately , reporters and media critics -- including \u2588\u2588\u2588 -- questioned the veracity of the report and its star \u201c witness. \u201d But CBS ' initial reaction was to dig in and defend its already problematic reporting . Only after more information surfaced -- this time showing that Davies gave the FBI a different account of the night of the Benghazi attacks than what he told CBS -- did the network finally investigate , pull the report , and apologize to viewers .\nAs CNN media critic Brian Stelter pointed out of CBS ' initial reaction to criticism : \u201c CBS did exactly the wrong thing . They got up against the wall . They got defensive \u201d instead of trying to \u201c figure out what went wrong . \u201d\nA CBS internal review later found that Logan 's report was \u201c deficient in several respects , \u201d and her \u201c team did not sufficiently vet Davies ' account of his own actions and whereabouts that night. \u201d Logan and producer Max McClellan were also put on indefinite leave .\nCBS also admitted fault in failing to disclose that Davies ' book was published by the CBS-owned Simon & Schuster . The practice of inconsistently disclosing a publisher 's corporate ties to 60 Minutes has been a repeat issue for the program throughout the years .\nWhen CNN hired Newt Gingrich to co-host its revived Crossfire program , \u201c the most trusted name in news \u201d knew what it was getting : a partisan who was brought down by \u201c ethics problems \u201d and is still involved with political organizations that are actively raising money . So perhaps it was n't a surprise that weeks after Gingrich 's Crossfire debut , media ethicists were already heavily criticizing CNN for failing basic transparency .\nIn September , CNN told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that if Gingrich , who serves as honorary co-chair for the American Legacy PAC , \u201c is helping fund a candidate and that candidate 's on the show , or being discussed on the show , of course he 'll disclose that . Disclosure is important when it 's relevant. \u201d But \u2588\u2588\u2588 noted later that month that Gingrich failed to make those disclosures when hosting Sen. Rand Paul , and when discussing Sen. Ted Cruz -- both of whom received money from Gingrich 's PAC .\nThe networked subsequently issued a statement \u201c clarifying the policy \u201d to state that such disclosures are not required \u201c since the co-host 's political support is obvious by his or her point of view expressed on the program. \u201d CNN 's apparent reversal drew an onslaught of criticism from reporters and media writers , including on CNN 's Reliable Sources .\nDespite the criticism , CNN has still allowed Gingrich to host politicians his PAC has supported , and Gingrich 's media company was paid $ 9,500 in September by the Republican National Committee , a fact he has not divulged on Crossfire .\nBe cautious if you receive a promotional email from a conservative pundit .\nIn July , Fox News contributor and RedState editor Erick Erickson emailed subscribers to his RedState.com email list claiming he 's found the \u201c best investment advice I know of , bar none , \u201d in the financial newsletter of analyst Mark Skousen . Yet 12 paragraphs of Erickson 's signed endorsement were virtually identical to language used by Ann Coulter in emails four years ago .\nErickson 's email sent readers to a page promising a \u201c secret retirement plan \u201d that \u201c can make you America 's Next Millionaire ! \u201d The page claims that \u201c even regular people with just $ 10,000 or $ 20,000 \u201d are using this secret plan -- nicknamed the \u201c Romney Retirement Plan \u201d -- to become \u201c instant millionaires. \u201d The long , circuitous video states that by subscribing to Skousen 's newsletter ( 1 year for $ 99.95 ) , you 'll get access to the secret . Skousen 's website , like RedState , is owned by Eagle Publishing . Erickson later claimed he did n't \u201c earn a penny \u201d for the email .\nRegardless of whether Erickson was paid for the get-rich-quick email , there has certainly been no shortage of conservatives attempting to cash in on their followers through dubious or shady practices . ( For an example of how conservative email lists are selling out their subscribers to a disgraced financial firm , go here . ) As Salon 's Alex Pareene noted , \u201c the conservative movement is an elaborate moneymaking venture . For professional movement conservatives , their audiences and followers are easy marks . \u201d\nFox News was forced to fire contributor Tobin Smith this year for receiving compensation to promote a company 's stock , a violation of network policy , following a report by Fox corporate sibling MarketWatch . \u2588\u2588\u2588 subsequently noted that Smith received compensation and used his Fox credentials to promote numerous other risky company stocks through his website and conservative newsletters .\nAnother Fox Business analyst , Charles Payne , was also compensated to promote the stocks of at least three companies since joining Fox . The share prices of the companies Payne was paid to tout are now essentially worthless .\nThough Fox fired Smith , it did not react publicly to Payne 's paid promotions , which occurred prior to 2013 . Payne responded to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by ducking questions and scrubbing his website .\nWhile Fox claimed in 2009 that it \u201c prohibits any on-air talent from endorsing products or serving as a product spokesperson , \u201d that policy appears to be lax if non-existent . In addition to Payne and Smith shilling for company stocks , Fox News contributors Keith Ablow ( diet company ) and Wayne Rogers ( reverse mortgages ) have also recently worked as company spokespersons .\nFox is acting as a waiting room for Republicans to collect a paycheck and stay visible while they contemplate runs for office .\nMedia writer Howard Kurtz ( now with Fox ) said \u201c Fox News is the go-to channel for most GOP primary voters , and being a host or frequent guest is a terrific platform in a friendly environment . \u201d\nIn 2013 , no fewer than nine Fox News employees were linked with future campaigns for office : Liz Cheney ( who has since left to run for office ) , Geraldo Rivera , Keith Ablow , Scott Brown , Sarah Palin , Mike Huckabee , John Bolton , Ben Carson , and Allen West . Both Rivera and Ablow eventually decided not to run .\nFox candidates have used their airtime to , in the words of Rivera , \u201c hone a message \u201d for a possible campaign . Media ethicists on the other hand have said letting Fox candidates test out their potential messages on-air poses a \u201c clear conflict \u201d for a news outlet .\nThe Fox candidates are n't new . Former contributors such as Rick Santorum , Newt Gingrich , John Kasich , Pete Snyder , Mark Sanford , and Angela McGlowan ( now back with Fox ) left Fox to run for office . This roster also shows the risks of leaving the cozy confines of Fox : though the candidates ' time on Fox helped ( Santorum once said his employment with Fox has \u201c been big \u201d ) , it did n't always guarantee a win .\nThe Wall Street Journal was criticized last year for repeatedly failing to disclose that many of its op-ed writers were also advising the campaign of Mitt Romney . While 2013 did n't have a national election , it still had newspapers ' opinion sections failing to disclose relevant ties about its writers .\nThe Wall Street Journal has repeatedly published op-ed pieces related to environmental issues without noting that the op-ed 's writers were tied to industries affected by environmental regulation .\nThe Wall Street Journal and Las Vegas Review-Journal published op-eds from the Employment Policies Institute to push claims about labor issues without noting the group is closely connected to the fast food industry .\nFoxNews.com published an op-ed from Colin Hanna arguing against film industry regulation without disclosing his organization has received money to promote the film industry .\nThe New York Times published an op-ed defending cable broadband without noting the writer 's group has received money from the cable industry 's chief lobbying group .\nUSA Today published an op-ed from a group attacking \u2588\u2588\u2588 for purportedly engaging \u201c in the 21st century 's version of book burning \u201d by \u201c target [ ing ] advertisers on shows such as Rush Limbaugh and Fox News. \u201d The paper did n't disclose that the group receives financial support from the very media companies that have a business interest in preventing such actions .\nShould media outlets cut back on accountability when readers are looking for accuracy ?\nThat 's a question surrounding The Washington Post 's decision to hire a part-time reader representative to replace its full-time ombudsman position in March .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 ' Joe Strupp reported on the move and concerns from Post veterans over the change .
