And Democrats would be utterly defenseless to stop them .\nTypically , party leaders offer at least the pretense of seeking bipartisanship when discussing their policy plans . But Ryan is saying frankly that Republicans would use budget reconciliation \u2014 a powerful procedural tool \u2014 to bypass Democrats entirely . It \u2019 s the same tool Republicans slammed Democrats for using to pass the 2010 health care law over their objections .\nWhile GOP leaders have made empty threats to use reconciliation to repeal Obamacare in the past , Ryan is making it clear that this time he plans to use it when it counts .

But it \u2019 s not . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s how the process works : If the House and Senate pass identical budgets , they can include broad instructions for Congress to pass reconciliation legislation that has privileged status and can not be filibustered in the Senate . The bill is intended to change current law to comply with the budget \u2019 s directives and must abide by certain parliamentary rules , such as having some effect on spending or tax levels .
