    "content": "The separation of church and state survived a close brush with death on Thursday , emerging scathed but alive thanks to a compromise decision that may not hold for long . Seven justices voted to allow a 94-year-old , 40-foot cross to remain on public land and those managing the cross to continue receiving state funding . But that lopsided vote conceals deep fractures among the justices over the government \u2019 s authority to honor and promote religion . The majority opinion portends more radical decisions to come while doing real damage to the establishment clause today , diminishing the state \u2019 s obligation to respect all faiths by endorsing none .\nThursday \u2019 s ruling in American Legion v. American Humanist Association rests on a magic trick : The majority transmogrified the cross , a \u201c preeminent Christian symbol , \u201d into a monument with a \u201c secular meaning. \u201d This is no mean feat . The cross in question rests at the center of a busy intersection in Bladensburg , Maryland . It towers over everything around it . Completed in 1925 , the \u201c Bladensburg Peace Cross \u201d was designed as a tribute to 49 area soldiers who died in World War I . At its dedication ceremony , a Catholic priest gave an invocation ; state representatives encouraged the community to view the monument as \u201c symbolic of Calvary \u201d ; and the ceremony ended with a benediction provided by a Baptist pastor . The Bladensburg cross is , indisputably , a symbol of Christianity .\nThat fact creates a problem under the First Amendment , which prohibits any law \u201c respecting an establishment of religion. \u201d The American Humanist Association filed a lawsuit against the state commission that owns the cross , demanding that it transfer the monument to private lands , convert it to an obelisk , or demolish it . According to the AHA , the cross violates the Lemon test , a standard sometimes used by SCOTUS to assess establishment clause disputes . Under that test , a government action must have a secular purpose ; it must not advance or inhibit religion ; and it must not foster excessive entanglement between religion and government . The 4th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals found that the cross runs afoul of the Lemon test because a reasonable observer would view the cross as an endorsement of Christianity , thereby impermissibly advancing a certain religious belief .\nSpoiler alert : The Supreme Court \u2019 s conservative majority was never going to uphold the 4th Circuit \u2019 s decision . Right-leaning justices loathe the Lemon test because it is both stringent and malleable , giving courts too much power ( in their minds ) to enforce government secularism . The big question in American Legion , then , was how severely SCOTUS would hobble the Lemon test and , by extension , the establishment clause . And the answer is \u2026 complicated . Justice Samuel Alito \u2019 s majority opinion abolishes the test \u2019 s application to \u201c established , religiously expressive monuments , symbols , and practices. \u201d But it leaves Lemon applicable , for now , to other church-state cases .\nWhy are \u201c monuments , symbols , and practices \u201d different ? Alito , joined by Chief Justice John Roberts , as well as Justices Brett Kavanaugh , Stephen Breyer , and Elena Kagan , gave four reasons . First , \u201c identifying their original purpose or purposes may be especially difficult. \u201d Second , their \u201c purposes \u2026 often multiply \u201d with the passage of time . Third , and relatedly , their \u201c message \u201d may \u201c evolve \u201d over time\u2014shifting from sectarian to secular . Fourth , removing them once they \u2019 ve gained \u201c familiarity and historical significance \u201d may \u201c strike many as aggressively hostile to religion. \u201d ( Note the contradiction here : A long-standing cross no longer conveys a purely Christian message , but removing it may convey an anti-Christian message . Go figure . )\nIn light of these concerns , Alito wrote , the Lemon test is ill-suited to \u201c monuments , symbols , and practices \u201d that have been around for a while . Instead , the \u201c passage of time \u201d gives them \u201c a strong presumption of constitutionality. \u201d And there is nothing to rebut that presumption here , since \u201c a World War I cross remains a memorial to the fallen \u201d and a \u201c symbol of their sacrifice , \u201d whatever its other implications . Even if it began as a Christian monument , it has \u201c acquired additional layers of historical meaning in subsequent years. \u201d Those layers mean that , today , the cross \u201c does not offend the Constitution . \u201d\nWhat , exactly , is the rule laid down here ? Alito wrote that religious monuments \u201c to soldiers who sacrificed their lives for this country more than a century ago \u201d are constitutional . What about a monument to soldiers who died a half-century ago ? How about in the past decade ? Or yesterday ? Alito doesn \u2019 t say\u2014presumably to hang onto Breyer and Kagan \u2019 s votes . Both liberal justices wrote separately to limit the majority opinion . Breyer noted that a cross \u201c erected only recently \u201d would not pass constitutional muster . Kagan declined to join a portion of the opinion bashing Lemon but agreed that it wasn \u2019 t necessary to apply it here .\nBy contrast , Kavanaugh wrote separately to insist that \u201c this Court no longer applies the old test articulated in Lemon. \u201d In other words , Kavanaugh suggested , SCOTUS doesn \u2019 t have to kill Lemon because Lemon is already dead . Instead , the court ostensibly applies a rather convoluted standard : If a \u201c challenged government practice is not coercive \u201d and it is rooted in history or tradition , or treats religion and secularism equally , or constitutes an accommodation or exemption for the faithful , then it \u2019 s constitutional . I \u2019 m not sure Kavanaugh \u2019 s effort to retcon a new establishment clause rule into \u201c the last 48 years \u201d of Supreme Court jurisprudence will be successful , but it \u2019 s a valiant effort .\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion to reiterate his belief that the establishment clause does not apply to the states , meaning a state legislature could literally establish an official religion without infringing upon the Constitution . Justice Neil Gorsuch , joined by Thomas , wrote to insist that individuals offended by a religious symbol shouldn \u2019 t have standing to sue in the first place . For good measure , Gorsuch also disparaged the Lemon test and declared that the court had \u201c shelved \u201d it . And , weirdly , he interpreted the court \u2019 s decision as one allowing the government to build a public cross any time it wants , ignoring its many qualifications about the importance of a monument \u2019 s age in assessing its constitutionality .\nOnly Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor , dissented . After all the hedging and sniping between the majority and the concurrences , Ginsburg \u2019 s opinion is refreshingly straightforward . She reminds us of a simple truth : No matter how many secular meanings we might ascribe to it , the cross represents the \u201c central theological claim of Christianity : that the son of God died on the cross , that he rose from the dead , and that his death and resurrection offer the possibility of eternal life . \u201d\n\u201c As I see it , \u201d Ginsburg wrote , \u201c when a cross is displayed on public property , the government may be presumed to endorse its religious content. \u201d The cross \u201c elevates Christianity over other faiths , and religion over nonreligion \u201d ; it \u201c affirms that , thanks to the soldier \u2019 s embrace of Christianity , he will be rewarded with eternal life. \u201d Shortly after World War I , the government recognized the cross to be an inappropriate tribute to non-Christian soldiers , and the \u201c overwhelming majority of World War I memorials contain no Latin cross. \u201d ( Ironically , while Alito \u2019 s majority opinion roots its analysis in \u201c history and tradition , \u201d Ginsburg \u2019 s dissent is far more attuned to the history of the Bladensburg cross and its place in World War I commemoration . ) The cross , Ginsburg concluded , actively implies \u201c official recognition of [ Christianity ] paramountcy and thus contravenes the Establishment Clause . \u201d\nGinsburg and Sotomayor , however , are never going to persuade a majority of their colleagues to enforce bona fide separation of church and state . The real fight in American Legion is between Kavanaugh and Gorsuch on one side and Kagan and Breyer on the other . Kavanaugh and Gorsuch think the Lemon test is already slain and that the government is free to build more crosses today . Kagan and Breyer think the Lemon test remains good law outside of the memorial context and that only newer religious monuments may be unconstitutional .\nWho \u2019 s right ? For now , Kagan and Breyer\u2014Alito \u2019 s majority opinion is narrowly confined to \u201c longstanding monuments , symbols , and practices. \u201d But Kavanaugh and Gorsuch are wishcasting , eager for the next case , and eventually Roberts and Alito may lose their patience for compromise . American Legion preserves important precedents , including those barring government-sponsored school prayer . But it also shows how easily those precedents could be overturned with a gesture toward \u201c history and tradition. \u201d ( School prayer was pervasive for a long time ; does that make it OK ? ) Kagan and Breyer limited the damage this time around , but the conservative justices may be poised to steamroll over the establishment clause in the years ahead .",
