Parents and teachers fretted on Facebook about how to talk to kids about Trump \u2019 s victory and how to make them feel safe .\nThe election of a candidate who promised mass deportations and a wall between the U.S. and Mexico triggered widespread panic among immigrants , from millennials who gained temporary legal status under the Obama administration \u2019 s executive order for childhood arrivals , or DACA , to parents who have U.S.-born children but are at risk of deportation .\n\u201c I \u2019 m angry .
