On Tuesday Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said that Donald Trump was `` temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president. \u201d Trump , the Republican presidential nominee , responded on Wednesday morning with a speech in Philadelphia declaring Clinton `` trigger happy and very unstable , whether we like it or not . ''\nThe Clinton campaign reacted with yet another ad featuring Trump 's own words this time disparaging veterans and their families . The anti-Trump Priorities USA SuperPAC went even further with a new spot that shows Trump saying , `` I love war . '' Trump 's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway responded by saying the bizarre comment was taken out of context but the full quote , which he gave last November at a wild Fort Dodge , Iowa , rally ( the same one where he called Ben Carson a child molester ) , is even worse than what it sounds like in the ad :\n\u201c I \u2019 m good at war . I \u2019 ve had a lot of wars of my own . I \u2019 m really good at war . I love war in a certain way , but only when we win . \u201d\nTrump has never been in the service , although he has said , '' I always felt I was in the military \u201d because of his education at a military-themed boarding school and he believes he has \u201c more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military . \u201d\nThat comment `` I 'm good at war '' says everything about Trump as he demonstrated last night at the town hall forum that he is indeed unfit to be president of the United States . There were many aspects of his performance that had people gasping at the mere idea of this man in a position of real power , not the least of which was his comment that President Barack Obama compares unfavorably to Russian President Vladimir Putin who `` has an 85 percent approval rating '' and is `` very much a leader '' because he has `` strong control over his country . ''\nBut it was around the question of ISIS and the Middle East where he really showed his true colors . He was upset that Hillary Clinton had earlier claimed that he had lied when he said he had been against the Iraq War and defended himself by pointing to an Esquire magazine article from 2004 \u2014 which does n't really help since the war began in the spring of 2003 . The fact-checkers have declared his pants are on fire numerous times on this but he just keeps saying it .\nLast night he also made a passing reference to someone `` asking him about Iraq '' 14 years ago , and you may be surprised to learn that at that same crazy Iowa rally he told the crowd that a delegation from the White House came to him to ask his opinion and he advised not to go in because it would destabilize the region . To the best of my knowledge this claim has never been validated . It 's possible , of course , this was the Bush administration . But let 's just say that it 's as likely as Trump 's witnessing thousands of New Jersey Muslims cheering after 9/11 .\nYou 'll knock the hell out of one and the other one is going to come and take over the other . You do n't have to be a genius to figure this out even though I am a genius .\nAnd by the way , I 'm more militaristic than anybody in this room . I 'm going to make our military so strong , so powerful .\nEveryone seems to think that Trump has `` pivoted '' from his position that he could not reveal his plan to defeat ISIS to his announcement today that he would give the generals 30 days from the inauguration to come up with one . But that 's wrong . Trump 's secret plan is not so secret . At that same rally last fall , Trump spoke about it plainly :\n`` I know more about ISIS than the generals do . Believe me . . . . I would bomb the shit out of 'em . . . . I \u2019 d blow up the pipes . I \u2019 d blow up the \u2014 I \u2019 d blow up every single inch . There would be nothing left . And you know what , you get Exxon to come in there and in two months \u2014 you ever see these guys how good they are ? The great oil companies ? They \u2019 ll rebuild that sucker brand-new . It \u2019 ll be beautiful . And I \u2019 d bring it , and I \u2019 d take the oil . ''\nAt the forum , he reiterated this belief that America should `` take the oil '' because he thinks this will make ISIS surrender and has taken to saying `` to the victor goes the spoils '' apparently unaware that this is a considered a war crime . He has said in the past it would require a permanent force to protect the oil but that it would n't take much .\nTrump said that under Obama and Clinton 's leadership `` the generals have been reduced to rubble '' and `` reduced to a point where it \u2019 s embarrassing for our country .
