They are between life and death . Amongst the victims are French citizens as well as foreigners , who came from all continents . And there are a number of young children who came to watch fireworks with their families , who have been struck down just to satisfy the cruelty of one individual or possible of a group. \u201d \u201c We have visited scores of injured , who have horrendous images in their heads . They are suffering more because of the psychological trauma .

About 15 % of easyJet \u2019 s total seat capacity involves flights that begin or end in France . After the atrocity in Nice that killed more than 80 people celebrating Bastille Day , the budget carrier , which is also the largest airline at Nice airport , flying 3.7 million passengers to and from it each year , saw its shares slide 45p , or 3.8 % , to 1126p .\nI pray for the victims of the attack in Nice and their families .

Our hearts go out to the French people and to all those who \u2019 ve lost loved ones or been injured . \u201c While the full picture is still emerging , it seems that at least 80 people are feared dead and many others have been injured . These were innocent victims enjoying a national celebration with their friends and families . \u201c We are working urgently to establish whether any British nationals were caught up in the attack . Our ambassador is travelling to Nice today with consular staff and they will be doing all they can to help anyone affected . \u201c I have asked my deputy national security adviser to chair a COBRA meeting of senior officials , to review what we know and what we can do to help , and I will speak to President Hollande today and make clear that the United Kingdom stands shoulder to shoulder with France today , as we have done so often in the past . \u201c If , as we fear , this was a terrorist attack , then we must redouble our efforts to defeat these brutal murderers who want to destroy our way of life . We must work with France and our partners around the world to stand up for our values and for our freedom . \u201d\n\u201c Nothing that we have proposed has been put in place . Considering the new nature of terrorism which is now a terrorism of opportunity , that \u2019 s to say without hierarchical structure , the urgency is to attack the ideology on which this terrorism is based . \u201c And in this space , nothing has been done , absolutely nothing \u2013 no reintroduction of double punishment , nor depriving people of nationality , nor the closure of salafist mosques\u2026 nor the banning of certain organisations . In truth we are not at war . For the moment , we are in a war of words . \u201d\nA label on the side of the truck suggests it was hired from Via Location .

A split second later, a huge white truck was traveling at breakneck speed over people\u2026 This truck of death passed a few meters from me and I did not realize it. I saw bodies flying like bowling pins in its path. Heard noises, screams that I will never forget. I was paralyzed. I did not move. I followed this hearse with me eyes. Around me, there was panic. People were running, screaming, crying. Then I realized. And I ran with them\u2026 Blood. Groans. Sunbathers [on the beach near the promenade] were first at the scene. They brought water to the wounded and towels they filed where there was no hope. At this time, I lacked courage. I wanted to help, to be of service\u2026 in short to do something.
