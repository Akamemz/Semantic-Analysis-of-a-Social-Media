    "content": "In an excellent recent article , conservative legal commentator and longtime religious liberty litigator David French explains why current law protects religious liberty far more than many people\u2014particularly many conservatives\u2014think . French makes many good points , and I agree with nearly everything he says . I do have two reservations about his conclusion , however . One relates to the specific field of immigration law , which is a major exception to his thesis . The second is the growing tendency of many on both right and left to vary their approach to religious liberty issues depending on whose ox is being gored . The latter does not in itself change the nature of current legal doctrine . But it could have negative effects down the road .\nHere are some of the excellent points French makes . On Title VII and employment discrimination :\nI have seen a remarkable amount of commentary in the aftermath of the Supreme Court 's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County arguing that the Supreme Court dealt religious liberty in America a serious , dangerous blow . Bostock , for those who do n't follow SCOTUS case names closely , is the case that interpreted Title VII 's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of `` sex '' to necessarily include sexual orientation and gender identity . As I read piece after piece , I realized that many of the people writing about the impact on religious freedom simply did n't understand the law . A generation of Americans raised on breathless activist warnings about freedom 's demise genuinely believe that religious organizations teeter on a dangerous precipice\u2026 . Religious employers have a right to impose religious litmus tests on their employees . Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2014the same statute at issue in Bostock\u2014contains a provision specifically designed to protect the autonomy of religious organizations . It states , `` This subchapter shall not apply \u2026 to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation , association , educational institution , or society of its activities . '' It 's true that this carveout does not allow the religious organization to discriminate on other grounds ( such as race or sex ) , but it does allow them to filter out all applicants who do not share the group 's faith . This has a profound impact on the relevant applicant pool and ( along with the First Amendment ) permits employers to require that applicants agree to the organization 's statement of faith . Religious employers are completely exempt from nondiscrimination statutes when hiring and firing `` ministerial '' employees . The ministerial exception may well be the key firewall protecting church from state . Put simply , and as defined by a unanimous Supreme Court in 2012 , both the Free Exercise and Establishment clauses of the First Amendment work together to remove the state\u2014including all nondiscrimination laws\u2014from the ministerial selection process . On Title IX , which bans sex discrimination in educational institutions : Religious educational institutions enjoy a right to exempt themselves from Title IX . If there 's a single question I 've received more than any other , it 's this : Does Bostock mean that religious schools will now have to alter policies regarding dorm rooms or sexual conduct to comply with federal prohibitions against sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination ? The short answer is no . The longer answer is nope , not unless they choose to be subject to Title IX\u2026 To be clear , Bostock is an employment case ( and thus the sections above apply to employment at religious schools ) , but one would expect that the definition of `` sex '' applied in Title VII would also extend to Title IX , thus preventing sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in , for example , codes of conduct , dorm placements , and athletic programs . . But Title IX contains a special carveout : [ T ] his section shall not apply to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization . The exemption is not automatic . Schools have to choose to opt out ( either proactively or in response to a Title IX complaint ) , and a number of religious schools have taken advantage of this provision . Many have not , but it is their choice , and that choice is plainly and clearly embedded in federal law .\nFrench also covers a wide range of other issues , including discrimination against religious groups and organizations in access to public facilities , protections against employment discrimination targeting religious employees , and the extensive protection the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) gives to religious freedom by mandating religious exceptions to many `` generally applicable '' federal laws . I would that 21 states have enacted state RFRAs , which provide similar religious exemptions from state laws . Anyone interested in this topic should read French 's article in full . In most areas , religious liberty today enjoys broader protection than at any time in American history .\nThe big exception to French 's relatively optimistic conclusion is immigration law . Thanks to the Supreme Court 's badly flawed ruling in the 2018 travel ban case , the federal government is allowed to engage in religion-based discrimination in immigration law that would be forbidden in virtually any other context . As I explained in this article , evidence of unconstitutional discriminatory motivation in the travel ban case was substantially stronger than that presented in the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision , which the Supreme Court issued just a few weeks earlier . Yet the Court struck down the government action in the latter case , while upholding it in the former , because of the doctrine of special deference to the President and Congress on immigration policy . As a practical matter , this leaves the president and Congress free to engage in blatant religious discrimination against would-be immigrants , so long as there is even a thin veneer of a nondiscriminatory rationalization for their policy\u2014even a transparently bogus one , as in the travel ban case itself .\nThis sad state of affairs is part of a more general pattern under which the Court has largely exempted immigration restrictions from many of the constitutional constraints that apply to virtually every other exercise of federal power . People who care about religious freedom\u2014and other constitutional rights\u2014should work to change that .\nThe other reservation I have about the state of religious liberty is the pattern of ideological and partisan double standards that all too often surround the issue . Too many on the right care greatly about religious liberty when theologically conservative Christians are the ones in peril , but turn a blind eye ( or worse ) in the travel ban case , and other situations where the group that is threatened is one they have less sympathy with . On the left , many who were rightly outraged by Trump 's travel ban have no such objections to Blaine Amendments that discriminate against religious schools , or recent state and local government policies that treat religious meetings and demonstrations far more harshly than secular protests that liberals have greater sympathy for . I criticized such double standards in greater detail here .\nIn the short and even medium term , such inconsistency is unlikely to undermine legal protection for religious liberty too much . But , in the long run , a society where most political activists and elites care about religious freedom only when it affects `` their '' side , is one where religious freedom necessarily rests on weaker foundations than it should .\nI do not claim to be a paragon of virtue or consistency when it comes to religious liberty issues . But , for what it is worth , I was one of the relatively few people who argued that religious liberty claims deserved to prevail in both the travel ban case and also in Masterpiece Cakeshop ( which involved a conservative Christian baker who refused to bake cakes for same-sex weddings ) and the 2014 Hobby Lobby case ( which involved a RFRA claim by a theologically conservative business owner who opposed contraception ) .\nAs an atheist , I do not share the religious beliefs of the Muslim targets of Trump 's travel ban . And I have little sympathy for religious objections to same-sex marriage and contraception , both of which reflect attitudes I decry . But I still think it is essential to protect the liberty of those who hold such views . Just as freedom of speech famously requires freedom for `` the thought that we hate , '' so too religious liberty must apply even to those religious beliefs we have little affinity for or even consider abhorrent .",
