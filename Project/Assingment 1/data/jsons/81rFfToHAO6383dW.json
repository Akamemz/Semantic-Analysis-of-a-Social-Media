    "content": "( CNN ) How do all seven cars and the engine of an Amtrak train jump the rails , sending passengers , luggage , laptops and more flying ?\nAuthorities have n't said what caused the derailment of Amtrak Northeast Regional Train 188 in Philadelphia on Tuesday night , but Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter had harsh words for the train 's engineer .\n`` Clearly it was reckless in terms of the driving by the engineer . There 's no way in the world he should have been going that fast into the curve , '' Nutter told CNN 's `` The Situation Room . ''\nPreliminary data show the train 's speed exceeded 100 mph before the derailment . That would be more than twice the 50 mph speed limit for the curve it was in .\n`` I do n't know what was going on with him ( the engineer ) . I do n't know what was going on in the cab , but there 's really no excuse that can be offered , literally , unless he had a heart attack , '' Nutter said .\nNTSB board member Robert Sumwalt immediately slammed the mayor 's comments as inflammatory .\n`` You 're not going to hear the NTSB making comments like that . We want to get the facts before we start making judgments , '' Sumwalt said .\nThe engineer at the helm of Amtrak Train 188 on Tuesday night , May 13 , 2015 , was identified to CNN as Brandon Bostian , 32 , of New York .\nThe engineer operating the train , identified to CNN as 32-year-old Brandon Bostian from New York , applied full emergency brakes `` just moments '' before the train derailed , according to Sumwalt . The train was traveling about 106 mph as it headed into a left turn . The speed limit immediately before the curve was 80 mph .\nAn official with direct knowledge of the investigation earlier said that authorities were focusing on speed as a possible cause , given the angles of the wreckage and type of damage to the cars . The recorder , or `` black box , '' discovered at the scene could be pivotal by showing just that , former NTSB official John Goglia said .\nPeter Goelz , once a top NTSB figure and now a CNN analyst , predicted that a definitive conclusion could come soon .\n`` I 'm afraid that this train might be going too fast for this turn , '' he said .\nSumwalt has said only that his team will examine things such as the condition of the track and the train , how the signals operated and `` human performance . ''\nEven if it 's determined the train was going too fast , that could be because of the engineer or a mechanical issue , such as faulty brakes .\n`` You have a lot of questions , we have a lot of questions , '' Sumwalt told reporters . `` We intend to answer many of those questions in the next 24 to 48 hours . ''\nSome 238 passengers and five crew members were on the train when it crashed around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday . Authorities said that at least seven people were killed .\nOne of those who died was Jim Gaines , a father of two who worked as a video software architect for The Associated Press , his company said\nHis family asked for privacy , saying : `` Jim was more precious to us than we can adequately express . ''\nAnother was a U.S . Naval Academy midshipman in full uniform heading home to New York on leave from the Annapolis , Maryland , school . A family member described 20-year-old Justin Zemser as a great person and genius whose death has left his parents `` beside themselves . ''\nDerrick Griffith , dean of student affairs for City University of New York Medgar Evers College , was also among the fatalities , according to Jamilah Fraser , a spokeswoman for the university . He lived in Brooklyn .\nHospitals have treated more than 200 others , many of whom have been released . That figure included eight in critical condition at Temple University Hospital -- the closest trauma center to the crash site -- according to Herb Cushing , the hospital 's medical director .\nCushing said many passengers were injured when other passengers or objects fell on them . One of those hurt is the train 's engineer , who received medical treatment and was interviewed by police , Mayor Nutter said .\nBostian , the engineer , initially told Philadelphia police he could not recall his speed , according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation .\nDetectives have since tried to interview the engineer of the train further . They brought him in Wednesday , but he refused to be interviewed , and left with a lawyer , according to a police official .\nPolice are in the process of getting a search warrant for the engineer 's phone records so they can determine whether he was distracted at the time of the crash , the law enforcement official said .\nDetermining Bostian 's blood-alcohol level immediately after the crash would be a normal part of the investigation , according to Sumwalt . Regulations require Amtrak to take a blood sample .\n`` It should have been done , and I have no reason to believe it was not done , '' Sumwalt said .\nAccording to Bostian 's LinkedIn profile , he has been an engineer for Amtrak since 2010 , and was a conductor for four years before that . Prior to Amtrak , Bostian worked as a cashier at Target .\nCNN spoke to a neighbor of the engineer near his home in Forest Hills , New York , who last saw him two weeks ago . Moresh Koya described Bostian as responsible and happy with his job .\nAuthorities have not ruled out the possibility of more victims at the crash site . Nutter noted that not everyone on Amtrak 's manifest has been accounted for . He did n't specify a number .\n`` We are heartbroken by what we 've experienced here , '' the mayor said early Wednesday . `` We have not experienced anything like this in modern times . ''\nThe miracle may be how some escaped relatively unscathed , given the severity of the derailment . A U.S. Department of Transportation representative told CNN that the engine and two cars were left standing upright , three cars were tipped on their sides , and one was nearly flipped over on its roof . The seventh one was `` leaning hard . ''\n`` It is amazing , '' Nutter said . `` I saw some people last night literally walking off that train . I do n't know how they did it .
