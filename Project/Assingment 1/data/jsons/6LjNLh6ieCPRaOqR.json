    "content": "The Department of Justice has released documents used by the government to justify the FISA surveillance warrant against Carter Page , a former campaign adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump .\nThe materials released by the DOJ include an October 2016 application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap Page as well as several renewal applications . It is highly unusual for documents related to FISA wiretap applications to be released .\nThough heavily redacted , the documents show that the infamous and unverified Steele Dossier was a major component of the 2016 surveillance warrant . The dossier , which was opposition research funded by the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign , contains salacious allegations against Trump . It was also a major component used to justify subsequent renewals .\nThe visible sections of the released FISA documents do not indicate the dossier was ever verified . Instead , the FBI claimed that Steele was \u201c reliable \u201d based on his previous work .\nThe FISA records also reveal that a September 2016 Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff was a significant part of the government 's warrant application .\nBut London court records show , and Republicans emphasize , that Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS -- the opposition research firm behind the Steele Dossier .\nThe newly released FISA warrant application , however , seems to indicate the Yahoo News article was an independent piece of corroborating information that justified the surveillance of Carter Page . Republicans question whether the story is an example of circular reporting that merely repeated information from Fusion GPS , the opposition research firm that commissioned former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dossier .\nBased on what is visible , the dossier is not described to the FISA court as a political document , as the Democrats have asserted ; in fact , the FBI speculates to the FISA court that it was commissioned to damage Candidate 1 , who is Donald Trump .\nPage 's denials of the Yahoo News reporting were included in the early renewals to the FISA application . The last renewal in late Spring 2017 is particularly important , because by that point , the FBI had dumped Steele as a source after he misled them over his media contacts .\nOne of the documents reads : \u201c The FBI speculates to the FISA court that the U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit candidate 1 \u2019 s campaign .
