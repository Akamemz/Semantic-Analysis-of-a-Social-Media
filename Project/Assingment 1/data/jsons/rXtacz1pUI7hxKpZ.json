Fix-It . ''\nIn making his closing argument to voters that he should have that chance to take his government tool belt to Washington , Romney has vowed to `` bring people together , '' to govern as president .\n`` I 've got be able to reach across the aisle and get good Democrats and good Republicans to work together , '' the former Massachusetts governor told a crowd in Jacksonville , Florida , on Wednesday .\n`` My legislature was about 85 % Democrat and it was not lost on me that to get anything done at all , and even to have my veto upheld , I had to have people across the aisle I could work with , '' he continued .\nRomney 's critics insist the Republican candidate 's bipartisan overtures are in need of a serious reality check .

But I was a severely conservative Republican governor , '' Romney told the conference .\nThe words `` severely '' and `` conservative '' are no longer part of Romney pitch with the campaign in the home stretch . Asked how Romney 's promises of bipartisanship align with what quickly became a YouTube moment at CPAC last winter , a senior campaign adviser argued the two claims are not mutually exclusive .\n`` As governor , he brought people together to deal with health care . He 's brought people together to deal with a very big deficit that he had when he came into office , '' said Kevin Madden , one of Romney 's top strategists .\n`` The governor has made a point that he is going to try to bring together all of the competing ideas and philosophies in Washington in order to tackle some of the big challenges . Does he recognize there is going to be opposition ? Sure , '' Madden added .\nIn fact , Romney 's aides have quietly begun laying the groundwork for a presidential transition , should he win the White House .

Earlier this year , Reid outraged conservatives when he falsely accused Romney of failing to pay income taxes for a decade .\n`` When he looks at Romney , he sees a weak candidate , a poll-driven politician , someone who lacks any core conviction , '' Reid 's former spokesman Jim Manley said .\nOne potential flashpoint could be any attempt by Romney to make good on a campaign promise to partially privatize the nation 's Medicare system for future seniors .\n`` If he tries to go at core Democratic priorities , like Bush tried to do with his proposal to privatize Social Security , Reid will go at him hammer and tong , just like he and ( Nancy ) Pelosi did with Bush , '' Manley said of former President George W. Bush 's second term initiative to transform the federal retirement program .\nPerhaps the greatest challenge facing a potential Romney administration would be the nation 's mounting debt .
