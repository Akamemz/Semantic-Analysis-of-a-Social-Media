    "content": "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that a Louisiana law requiring that individuals who perform abortions at clinics have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital is unconstitutional , as it places an undue burden on women seeking abortions .\nThe court ruled 5-4 in the case , June Medical Services LLC v. Russo , with Chief Justice John Roberts once again casting a deciding vote by siding with the court 's liberal justices .\nSUPREME COURT SIDES WITH TEXAS GOP OFFICIALS OVER MAIL-IN BALLOTS , TRUMP CALLS IT A 'BIG WIN '\nThe opinion , written by Justice Stephen Breyer , noted that the Louisiana law is `` almost word-for-word identical '' to a Texas law the court ruled was unconstitutional in 2016 's Whole Woman \u2019 s Health v. Hellerstedt . A District Court had rejected the Louisiana law because of that precedent , but a court of appeals ruled otherwise .\n`` We have examined the extensive record carefully and conclude that it supports the District Court \u2019 s findings of fact , '' Breyer wrote . `` Those findings mirror those made in Whole Woman \u2019 s Health in every relevant respect and require the same result . We consequently hold that the Louisiana statute is unconstitutional . ''\nBreyer noted that the District Court found that the law \u201c offers no significant health benefit \u201d and that \u201c conditions on admitting privileges common to hospitals throughout the State have made and will continue to make it impossible for abortion providers to obtain conforming privileges for reasons that have nothing to do with the State \u2019 s asserted interests in promoting women \u2019 s health and safety . \u201d\nUltimately , the majority felt that this case was virtually the same as the 2016 case , and ruled accordingly .\n`` This case is similar to , nearly identical with , Whole Woman \u2019 s Health , '' Breyer wrote . `` And the law must consequently reach a similar conclusion . ''\nRoberts had dissented in the 2016 case and said in a concurring opinion that while he still believes that the past case was wrongly decided , he was ruling with the majority in the present case due to court precedent .\n`` The legal doctrine of stare decisis requires us , absent special circumstances , to treat like cases alike , '' Roberts wrote . `` The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law , for the same reasons . Therefore Louisiana \u2019 s law can not stand under our precedents . ''\nIn dissent , Justice Clarence Thomas wrote , `` Today a majority of the Court perpetuates its ill-founded abortion jurisprudence by enjoining a perfectly legitimate state law and doing so without jurisdiction . ''\nThomas claimed that those performing abortions do not have standing to challenge laws on the basis that they restrict the ability to get an abortion , because it is not their rights that are at issue , but their potential patients ' .\nThomas went on to flatly state that `` abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled . ''\nROBERTS EMBRACES ROLE AS SUPREME COURT SWING JUSTICE , WITH LATEST CHURCH RULING\nJeanne Mancini , president of March for Life , said her organization was `` appalled '' by the Supreme Court 's decision .\n`` The legislation at issue in June Medical Services v.
