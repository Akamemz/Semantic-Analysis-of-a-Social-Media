    "content": "On Thursday , the US House wrapped up a marathon week of public hearings for its impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump . With lawmakers headed home for Thanksgiving break , the question on everyone \u2019 s minds is \u201c what comes next ? \u201d\nIn its rough form , what \u2019 s next is that the House Intelligence Committee and Chair Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) will compile and submit a report of its investigation to the House Judiciary Committee . The Judiciary Committee hasn \u2019 t had jurisdiction on the narrow Ukraine-focused impeachment investigation , but it \u2019 s the body that will decide whether or not to draft articles of impeachment \u2014 the \u201c charges \u201d against Trump .\nThere are no more public hearings on the schedule for now . Of course , this could change if someone else with valuable testimony comes forward . But some Democrats don \u2019 t want to wait long for a star witness like former National Security Adviser John Bolton \u2014 who has said he won \u2019 t testify unless compelled by a court .\n\u201c He blew our timeline up , \u201d Rep. Stephen Lynch ( D-MA ) , a member of the House Oversight Committee told \u2588\u2588\u2588 recently , adding that testimony from other sources about Bolton made it seem like he was opposed to Trump \u2019 s objectives in Ukraine . \u201c When we looked at the evidence we wanted from him , we had other sources . ... He can be prickly at times , and you \u2019 re not sure what he \u2019 s going to come out with . \u201d\nAn Intelligence Committee spokesperson declined to comment on whether there would be additional hearings before or after the Thanksgiving holiday , or when Schiff would submit his report .\nFor a while , the buzz around Capitol Hill has been that the Judiciary Committee could draft articles to send to the full House before Christmas . Some House Democrats have said they \u2019 d like to vote on impeachment by the end of the year , but there \u2019 s still no set timeline . On Thursday , the Washington Post reported Senate Republicans are in talks with senior White House officials to limit a Senate impeachment trial to two weeks , and it \u2019 s likely the earliest a trial could come is January .\nOn Thursday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi left the door open to the possibility of more testimony , but was careful not to put forth any deadlines .\n\u201c All of this is up to the committees of jurisdiction .
