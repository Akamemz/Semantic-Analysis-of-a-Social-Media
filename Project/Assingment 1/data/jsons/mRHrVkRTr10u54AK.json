    "content": "Many Americans in recent days have received emails directing them to start working remotely , or announcing that schools would be canceled for weeks in light of the coronavirus pandemic . Major events are also being called off with a domino-like effect , including Coachella and South by Southwest , March Madness and virtually all sports events , business conferences , even religious services across the country .\nIn many cases , the action is prophylactic \u2014 no one at work or school may be sick yet \u2014 though with each passing day , more of these decisions are being made in response to a community member testing positive for Covid-19 , or the risk that contact with large groups of people could exacerbate transmission of the virus .\nThe closures are a way to enforce social distancing , a crucially important public health intervention that can help stop coronavirus transmission by avoiding crowds and large gatherings such as weddings , concerts , conferences , sporting events , and mass transit . Best practice requires maintaining at least a six-foot distance between yourself and others .\nYou may have already come into contact with an infected person \u2014 the woman who rode the bike before you at SoulCycle , the kindly fellow who coughed while standing next to you in line at Costco , or someone who touched your mail as it made its way to your mailbox . ( At least one study estimates that about 25 percent of transmissions of coronavirus may have occurred in pre-symptomatic stages \u2014 meaning it may be spread by people who don \u2019 t yet know they have the virus . )\nWith Covid-19 , \u201c many people in the US will at some point , either this year or next , get exposed to this virus , \u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2019 s immunization czar announced this month . Social distancing , health authorities argue , can dramatically slow the rate at which the infection is spreading , easing the burden on the health care system .\nTo that end , the CDC is now urging all gatherings of more than 50 people to stop for the next eight weeks . But how should social distancing affect your visits to the gym ? Your weekly manicure ? Play dates for your kids ? Your weekend reservation at the buzzy Michelin-starred omakase spot you \u2019 ve been dying to try ? Are those risky for an ostensibly healthy person like yourself ?\nWhat do you , as a responsible , socially conscious human being , owe to your fellow men and women \u2014 particularly those who are sick , immunocompromised , and older ? Are you breaking the social contract by going to hot yoga ?\nOr , by not going , are you overreacting and hurting the economy ?\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 spoke with six experts in public health , medicine , psychology , and bioethics for answers . ( Please remember that as the Covid-19 landscape transforms week by week , so , too , will the advice . )\nI feel healthy . Why shouldn \u2019 t I get out a little bit to make this time pass easier ?\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Kelsey Piper makes a strong argument for choosing to stay home as much as possible , inconvenient as it may seem , to help your fellow human . \u201c If you are young and healthy , you ought to take precautions because doing so can end up saving someone \u2019 s life , \u201d she writes .\nLeah Lagos , a New York City-based psychologist and author of Heart , Breath , Mind , agrees . \u201c Now is the time to do something for your fellow community members , \u201d she says . Staying home as much as possible , even if you believe you aren \u2019 t infected , is the type of altruistic decision that , when performed en masse , has the potential to slow the infection rate , Lagos says .\nConsidering \u2014 and prioritizing \u2014 the welfare of strangers is difficult , she acknowledges , but it helps to think of them instead as someone else \u2019 s parent , grandparent , or child . \u201c It can be an interesting experiment in compassion for people we don \u2019 t know . \u201d\n\u201c A lot of us might be relatively healthy and think we might be able to withstand the rigors of an infection , \u201d adds Jonathan Kimmelman , director of the Biomedical Ethics Unit at McGill University in Montreal , \u201c but there \u2019 s the concern about spreading it to vulnerable individuals , as well as the pressure this outbreak will place on our health care system . \u201d\nKimmelman invokes the idea of \u201c social solidarity , \u201d saying \u201c we have an ethical obligation to curtail activities , practice social distancing , and substitute activities with safer alternatives , \u201d like teleconferencing instead of in-person work meetings , or changing a first date from a wine bar to a walk outside .\nIf the messages are confusing , understand that \u201c there are different levels of social distancing \u201d in effect around the world , and that local health departments \u2019 recommendations vary currently depending on known cases , says Syra Madad , an NYC-based special pathogens specialist who was featured in Netflix \u2019 s docuseries Pandemic : How to Prevent an Outbreak . In Washington state \u2019 s King County , for example , the current recommendation is that \u201c social interaction is still vitally important to the mental health of young people , and it is still possible for families to have safe gatherings among children and parents. \u201d The county recommends , however , limiting indoor groups to 10 or fewer children and outdoor groups to 50 or fewer , and for residents to avoid parties , retail spaces , and movie theaters .\nStill , Madad notes , \u201c It is better to operate under the pretense that there is transmission in your community already . There \u2019 s going to be disruption to daily life , but we want people to feel empowered by this . The decisions you make will ultimately affect the trajectory of this outbreak . \u201d\nIf I have to go out , how can I do it in the safest way possible \u2014 to protect myself as well as others ?\nKate Vergara , a public health and infectious disease specialist based in Chicago and New York City , has spent time fighting polio in Ethiopia and helping Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone ( without contracting either disease ) . In order to even begin to approach the ethics of social distancing , she says , we must have a firm grip on how the virus is spreading .\n\u201c Covid-19 is not airborne , \u201d she says . \u201c It is transmitted through droplets \u2014 being coughed on , or touching something that someone coughed on , for example , and then touching your face and allowing that pathogen to get into your system through your eyes , nose , or mouth . \u201d\nThe CDC and the WHO recommend several basic measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 : Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds .\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue , then throw the tissue in the trash .\nContact a health worker if you have symptoms ; fever and a dry cough are most common .\ntouch your face . DON \u2019 T travel if you have a fever and cough .\ntravel if you have a fever and cough . DON \u2019 T wear a face mask if you are well . Guidance may change . Stay informed , and stay safe , with \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s guide to Covid-19 .\nIt \u2019 s important to practice good hygiene , like hand-washing \u2014 which protects not only you but others as well . When considering the ethics of spending time out and about , Vergara suggests reframing your view of hand-washing in the following way : \u201c Wash your hands before you go out to protect others , and wash them again after the activity to protect yourself. \u201d If you \u2019 re low-risk and itching to hit the gym , wash your hands first so you \u2019 re touching machines and weights with pristine hands ; that protects others . Then , after your workout , wash them again to scrub off anything you may have picked up . And wipe down your exercise equipment , or anything else you might have touched . The same goes for getting a haircut , visiting the ATM , and the like .\nShould I feel guilty for wanting to go to the gym , or on a date ?\nBetween the relentless news alerts , social media memes , and gossipy texts , it \u2019 s easy to feel overwhelmed , anxious , and scared . We need self-care more than ever , says LaMar Hasbrouck , a public health physician and past medical epidemiologist with the CDC . \u201c It \u2019 s important during these times to hold fast to any sense of normalcy that you can . \u201d\nBut try to find prudent ways to do so . Hasbrouck now picks off-peak hours to exercise to minimize contact with others ; other options include walking , jogging , or biking outdoors . The more ventilated an area , the lower the risk of transmission , plus \u201c if you cough , nobody is around and the droplets just fall and hit the ground , \u201d he says . Better yet : breaking a sweat at home with help from an app or online video .\nGrocery shopping will need to happen , but instead of going at noon on a Saturday when the place is sure to be packed , try going really early on a weekday morning . If it \u2019 s still possible , order online . And wipe down any deliveries , just to be safe .\nShould I keep using grocery delivery services ... and ride-hailing companies \u2026 and restaurants ?\nHasbrouck encourages those who have access to services such as Postmates , Grubhub , Lyft , and Instacart to use them . \u201c It \u2019 s a good way to social distance , \u201d he says , noting that two main factors when it comes to Covid-19 transmission are closeness of contact and duration . \u201c The handoff is five seconds , you go inside and wash your hands . Or just have them leave it at your doorstep. \u201d ( Last week , Instacart introduced a \u201c Leave at My Door Delivery \u201d option . )\nThis poses some ethical questions , however : Having milk and bread delivered is convenient for you , minimizing your exposure to the virus . But what about the person doing your grocery shopping or picking up your Thai food ? Or the Uber driver ferrying you to your significant other \u2019 s apartment ? Is it right to ask them to assume the risk of being out and about ?\nYes , say both Hasbrouck and Vergara . However , contaminated hands pose a risk to drivers and riders , so be ultra-diligent about hand hygiene , washing or sanitizing hands before getting in the car and not touching your face at all . Cracking a window is a smart move for both you and the driver , as it promotes airflow .\nAs for restaurants , honor upcoming reservations or attend gatherings as necessary . Unlike norovirus or hepatitis A , \u201c food isn \u2019 t known to be a way of transmitting this or other respiratory viruses , \u201d says Benjamin Chapman , a professor and food safety extension specialist at North Carolina State University . \u201c You mainly need to be mindful about the surfaces you touch : menus , the table , condiments , things that other patrons might have used. \u201d But the choice to dine out may soon be very limited for many Americans : Governors of several states , including Illinois and Washington , this week ordered all restaurants and bars closed ; major cities such as New York and Los Angeles are following suit .\nChapman , who continues to dine out , says that while he might not know who touched that soy sauce bottle or pepper shaker before him , \u201c I do know I can break the pathway of transmission by using hand sanitizer or washing my hands. \u201d With social distancing in mind , opt for establishments where it \u2019 s easy to keep six to eight feet between yourself and other diners ( maybe save sitting at the packed bar for after the pandemic ends ) and feel free to be \u201c a public health nerd \u201d like Chapman and ask if they \u2019 re using Environmental Protection Agency-approved sanitizing products , which they should be .\nChapman notes that he lives in North Carolina , which is not currently a Covid-19 hot spot . \u201c I \u2019 d have a different response if I was in New Rochelle , New York , or Seattle , \u201d he says , two cities where the risk of transmission is greater due to higher numbers of community-acquired infections . In cities such as those , he would advocate taking advantage of the \u201c great infrastructure we have set up for home delivery of food . \u201d\nShould I cancel play dates ? What are the rules for my kids ?\nIn Ireland , public health officials are encouraging a \u201c no parties , no playdates , no playground \u201d policy , per the Irish Times . Muireann N\u00ed Chr\u00f3n\u00edn , a consultant respiratory pediatrician at Cork University Hospital , told the paper : \u201c Children will get through this no problem . [ But ] remember with corona , children are vectors , not victims . In most epidemics , young children are the transmitters . \u201d\n\u201c The risks of underreaction are so much more catastrophic than the risks of overreaction \u201d\nHere in the US , school closures are smart , Vergara says . \u201c It \u2019 s a responsible practice for schools to shut down . That \u2019 s several hundred kids interacting in close quarters , and kids aren \u2019 t known for washing their hands very well. \u201d But that leaves millions of working parents frantic about career responsibilities , and unsure of whether it \u2019 s appropriate to schedule play dates or try to split child care duties with friends .\nThe experts interviewed for this story had differing opinions about whether play dates should continue in a pandemic . Vergara says that , if following healthy practices , small play dates are feasible , but before the kids come over , use disinfecting wipes to clean high-touch items like doorknobs , remote controls , and the table where they \u2019 ll be playing . Replace the hand towel in the bathroom with a fresh one , and when the visiting kiddos show up , everyone \u2014 your children included \u2014 should wash their hands thoroughly .\nLagos worries that play dates during school closures are essentially \u201c quasi-quarantines , defeating the purpose of social distancing. \u201d Kimmelman concurs , and though he says no one knows the exact right answer , \u201c we don \u2019 t know how things are going to unfold , and from my standpoint , the risks of underreaction are so much more catastrophic than the risks of overreaction . \u201d\nAlyssa F. Westring and Stewart D. Friedman , co-authors of Parents Who Lead , writing in the Harvard Business Review , recommended finding inventive ways for children to play together virtually . \u201c While it may not be feasible to trade-off childcare responsibilities ( depending on quarantine restrictions ) , \u201d they wrote , \u201c consider other ways in which you can make things easier for one another \u2014 whether it \u2019 s sharing creative activities to keep the kids entertained or taking turns grocery shopping . \u2026 Be open to new ways of doing things . \u201d\nThe CDC has issued recommendations for travelers arriving from dozens of countries with widespread cases to stay home for 14 days . If someone at your work or school was definitely exposed , it \u2019 s also time to assess your own risk of exposure , and of spreading the coronavirus . \u201c If you say , \u2018 Well , I know I \u2019 ve been mostly in my office , avoiding meetings and conference rooms , and I \u2019 ve been washing hands a lot , \u2019 you could probably go about your daily routine with some social distancing to protect yourself , not so much to avoid infecting others , \u201d Hasbrouck says .\nBut if you have a fever or receive new information \u2014 that it was John , in the cubicle next to you , who was exposed \u2014 \u201c you \u2019 re going to want to radically change your assessment. \u201d That likely means self-quarantining , because that \u2019 s \u201c the ethical decision and you don \u2019 t want to expose others . It \u2019 s a constant risk assessment , and it \u2019 s more of an art than a science . It \u2019 s about protecting yourself but also being socially responsible . \u201d\n\u201c Look at the trajectory of what \u2019 s happening in Italy . We \u2019 re 11 days behind Italy , \u201d where a national lockdown that began March 10 has curtailed all travel and shuttered nearly all shops , schools , museums , movie theaters , and bars , says Madad . \u201c Measures like travel bans and quarantining entire localities \u2014 you may not see that here , \u201d she says . But we can undertake distancing measures ourselves . \u201c One of the things we \u2019 ve learned from the H1N1 pandemic is that if you educate people , they will listen . You have to give them the facts , and speak with one voice . \u201d\nLeslie Goldman has a master \u2019 s degree in public health and is a health writer based in Chicago .

Friedman, co-authors of Parents Who Lead, writing in the Harvard Business Review, recommended finding inventive ways for children to play together virtually. \u201cWhile it may not be feasible to trade-off childcare responsibilities (depending on quarantine restrictions),\u201d they wrote, \u201cconsider other ways in which you can make things easier for one another \u2014 whether it\u2019s sharing creative activities to keep the kids entertained or taking turns grocery shopping. \u2026 Be open to new ways of doing things.\u201d\n\nWhen should I completely self-quarantine?\n\nThe CDC has issued recommendations for travelers arriving from dozens of countries with widespread cases to stay home for 14 days. If someone at your work or school was definitely exposed, it\u2019s also time to assess your own risk of exposure, and of spreading the coronavirus. \u201cIf you say, \u2018Well, I know I\u2019ve been mostly in my office, avoiding meetings and conference rooms, and I\u2019ve been washing hands a lot,\u2019 you could probably go about your daily routine with some social distancing to protect yourself, not so much to avoid infecting others,\u201d Hasbrouck says.\n\nBut if you have a fever or receive new information \u2014 that it was John, in the cubicle next to you, who was exposed \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re going to want to radically change your assessment.\u201d That likely means self-quarantining, because that\u2019s \u201cthe ethical decision and you don\u2019t want to expose others. It\u2019s a constant risk assessment, and it\u2019s more of an art than a science. It\u2019s about protecting yourself but also being socially responsible.\u201d\n\nHow far should we take social distancing advice?\n\n\u201cLook at the trajectory of what\u2019s happening in Italy. We\u2019re 11 days behind Italy,\u201d where a national lockdown that began March 10 has curtailed all travel and shuttered nearly all shops, schools, museums, movie theaters, and bars, says Madad. \u201cMeasures like travel bans and quarantining entire localities \u2014 you may not see that here,\u201d she says. But we can undertake distancing measures ourselves. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve learned from the H1N1 pandemic is that if you educate people, they will listen. You have to give them the facts, and speak with one voice.\u201d\n\nLeslie Goldman has a master\u2019s degree in public health and is a health writer based in Chicago.
