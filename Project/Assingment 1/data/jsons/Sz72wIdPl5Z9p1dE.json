The show devoted nearly half its airtime to politics in 2007, according to a survey by Pew.\n\nThe show has a decidedly liberal bent, but regularly features conservative politicians and commentators. A 2005 interview with conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly is among the most watched clips on the show's website.\n\nStewart says he isn't sure what's next for him, and who knows if it will involve politics (though the calls for Stewart to run for office in 2016 already have begun).\n\nIn any case, here's a look back at five things Stewart taught America about politics:\n\n1) You can't always pick a side.\n\nLast summer, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel got into it with the one-and-only Donald Trump over the 20-foot-high, glowing letters that spelled out \"TRUMP\" on his new hotel. Emanuel's take: The sign \"scars that architecture, uh, architecture, beauty and taste, with a tasteless sign.\" But to Trump, of course, \"it's a very high quality, very beautiful sign.\"\n\n\"Oh it's a badger fightin' a mongoose!\" Stewart said on the show. \"I just don't know who to cheer for!\"\n\nHe reminded us that sometimes there are no clear winners \u2014 sometimes everyone in the game might be just a little bit off kilter.\n\n2) The banality of the new news cycle.\n\nOne of Stewart's favorite targets is the 24-hour political news cycle \u2014 and the cable networks that are stuck in it. Hasty headlines, quick-to-judge hosts, inaccurate graphics and, of course, the overhyped \"Breaking News.\"\n\n\"We rag on CNN a lot,\" he once said, adding in a mumble \"mostly because they're terrible.\"\n\n\"If we amplify everything, we hear nothing,\" Stewart said at his 2010 Rally to Restore Sanity. It's a sentiment the comedian often echoed on his show. While he poked at the beast, he also gave respectful air time to serious political analysts, journalists and public figures. The Daily Show became a must-stop for authors, the president, members of Congress and more.\n\n3) Politicians are people, too.\n\nStewart was part of a wave that redefined political journalism. He came to host the show in 1999 \u2014 midway through President Clinton's impeachment trial, as the country was debating how much a president's personal life actually matters to his ability to govern. To Stewart, the peripheral, personal foibles are what make politics amazing and hilarious.\n\nMore recently, he has talked about the portraits painted by President George W.

Who knows if they actually voted in the 2010 midterm a few days later, but the high attendance at those rallies shows they engaged, even if for one cold afternoon.\n\n5) Politics can be interesting \u2014 and fun.\n\nOne of the show's appeals to a younger audience was its knack for breaking down the latest Washington scandal by stripping it of Beltway-speak. Here's how Samantha Bee, the show's \"White House Correspondent,\" explained the Valerie Plame spy scandal in 2005:\n\n\"Jon, in Washington, information is power, and is disseminated through a sophisticated network of operatives and contacts, in a system modeled after a sorority house,\" she said.\n\nShe then broke down the scandal and all the players as if it were happening in a sorority house, valley girl accent and all: \"So then Cooper called Rove and he's all like 'Wilson's wife's all CIA!' and Karl was like 'I know, right!
