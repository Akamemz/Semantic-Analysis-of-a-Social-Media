    "content": "This investigation is a collaboration between \u2588\u2588\u2588 and Reveal . Listen to the latest episode of Reveal below for more on this story and to learn more about how Sinduja Rangarajan reported it .\nSamir came to the United States from India in 2006 as a graduate student . He got a master \u2019 s degree in environmental engineering , and after a few internships where he picked up programming skills , he was hired in 2010 by UnitedHealthcare , a Fortune 500 insurance company based in Minnesota . He loved his job streamlining its claims process . \u201c There were days where I worked three days nonstop , no sleep , nothing , because we wanted people to get cured\u2014they need to get the treatment , \u201d he recalls . \u201c I put my soul in there . \u201d\nThe insurance company got him an H-1B , a temporary work visa reserved for high-skilled foreigners who can fill jobs for which there \u2019 s a shortage of American workers . His visa was regularly renewed , and after a few years , his employer sponsored him for a green card and his application was approved . Samir thought he would spend the rest of his life in his adopted country . \u201c I never used to celebrate Christmas back home in India , \u201d he says . \u201c But I did go to church here for the first time , just to see how they celebrate . This country is built on immigrants , right ? I wanted to feel that . \u201d\nIn early 2018 , Samir was transferred to a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group in Dallas . It was a lateral move , but it required him to get his H-1B transferred . A few months later , he learned that US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) , the agency that approves visas , had rejected what should have been a routine approval . Overlooking his eight years of experience , the agency said his education didn \u2019 t line up with his position and determined that he wasn \u2019 t qualified to do it anymore . When his visa was denied , Samir says he lost his job .\nSuddenly , the life that Samir had painstakingly built came crashing down . He and his wife had to explain to their 5-year-old son that they \u2019 d have to move out of their dream house in suburban Dallas\u2014the one they \u2019 d built with most of their savings . They sold it in a rush and moved into a tiny apartment . Samir had a few weeks to find another employer who \u2019 d sponsor his H-1B or he \u2019 d have to leave the country . After 12 years in the United States , he was suddenly faced with the idea that America was no longer home .\nSamir , who asked not to use his real name because he fears his future visas may be denied , is one of thousands of H-1B holders who have found that the Trump administration has upended the once-predictable rules for who gets ( and keeps ) these coveted visas , which are a major source of high-skilled immigrants , particularly from India . Even as President Donald Trump has complained about rules that prevent American companies \u201c from retaining highly skilled and\u2026 totally brilliant people \u201d from abroad , his administration has made sweeping changes to the H-1B program , denying visas to skilled immigrants , some who have been working in the United States for years . USCIS has been denying H-1B petitions at a record rate : 24 percent of first-time H-1B applications were denied through the third quarter of 2019 fiscal year , compared with 6 percent in 2015 . In the 2015 fiscal year , only 3 percent of H-1B transfers and extensions like Samir \u2019 s were denied . In 2019 , 12 percent were . In total , about 50,000 people were denied H-1B visas in the past year .\nThe administration says it \u2019 s tightening H-1B policies to prevent fraud and award visas only to the \u201c most-skilled or highest-paid beneficiaries. \u201d Yet an investigation by \u2588\u2588\u2588 and Reveal has found that the administration has been denying visas to experienced , well-paid workers , many of whom have degrees from American universities and have previously received H-1Bs . Our analysis shows that a record number of H-1B\u2013related federal lawsuits have been filed against USCIS in the past two years . The complaints allege that the agency has been making inconsistent and incorrect decisions , ignoring evidence , and misapplying the law .\nSandra Feist , an immigration attorney in Minneapolis , says navigating the new bureaucratic obstacles for visa holders has been more stressful than any other period in her career . \u201c I was working in the field after 9/11 , and this is infinitely worse , \u201d she says . \u201c And the clients that I work with have been treated with much more skepticism and cynicism than even in that era . \u201d\nImmigration-law experts see the administration \u2019 s restrictions on these specialized visas as part of the larger anti-immigration agenda pushed by hardliners like acting USCIS Director Kenneth Cuccinelli and White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller . \u201c Attacking legal immigration is kind of a stealth strategy , \u201d says Bruce Morrison , a former Congress member from Connecticut who co-sponsored the Immigration Act of 1990 , which established the H-1B program . \u201c People who are just listening to the news are easily seduced into thinking this is all about protecting the border or protecting our security or making sure the people who are here are here legally . But in fact , this is a wholesale isolationist administration . It doesn \u2019 t like anything that isn \u2019 t stamped \u2018 Made in America , \u2019 whether it \u2019 s the individuals , or whether it \u2019 s the products . \u201d\nThe H-1B program annually issues around 85,000 new visas to recipients from around the globe , with the majority going to people from India and China . Though Silicon Valley relies heavily on these \u201c tech visas , \u201d they \u2019 re also used by universities , hospitals , and pharmaceutical companies . Visas are usually issued for three years , followed by three-year extensions . If the visa holder \u2019 s employer files for a green card , they may get unlimited H-1B extensions until their residency is approved . In the past , the process for renewing H-1B visas was relatively predictable , particularly if there were no major changes to the visa holder \u2019 s job .\nPro-labor groups , anti-immigration think tanks , and conservative politicians have called for the program to be reformed . Critics argue that a disproportionate number of H-1B visas go to IT consulting companies that replace American workers with underpaid foreign workers . ( Both \u2588\u2588\u2588 and Reveal have reported on the \u201c body shops \u201d that take advantage of tech workers eager to work in the United States . )\nKey figures in the Trump administration have criticized the H-1B system . In late 2015 , Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) , the future attorney general , described the program as \u201c a tremendous threat \u201d to American workers on Sirius XM \u2019 s Breitbart News Daily podcast . In 2016 , Sessions chaired an immigration subcommittee hearing where witnesses urged Congress and the Obama administration to reform the program , citing examples of large companies that had laid off American workers and substituted them with H1-B holders . Speaking with Steve Bannon on the Breitbart podcast in March 2016 , Stephen Miller , the Sessions aide who would become the architect of Trump \u2019 s immigration policy , said H-1B recipients were not necessarily high-skilled workers . \u201c The reality is we \u2019 re talking about less skilled foreign guest workers that are less educated than Americans , who are paid less than Americans , who know less about the computing industry and about the technology industry than Americans . \u201d\n\u201c The administration is trying to build all kinds of walls . It \u2019 s not just physical walls across the border . \u201d\nAs a recent investigation by Highline details , the new administration quickly got to work on implementing bureaucratic restrictions on all kinds of immigration\u2014an \u201c invisible wall. \u201d In April 2017 , President Trump announced his Buy American Hire American executive order in a speech at a tool company in Wisconsin . \u201c Widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries to fill the same job for sometimes less pay . This will stop , \u201d he declared . The H-1B program needed \u201c long-overdue reform , \u201d he said . \u201c They should be given to the most-skilled and highest-paid applicants , and they should never , ever be used to replace Americans . \u201d\nWhen Trump signed the executive order , Stephen Yale-Loehr , an immigration law professor at Cornell University , thought the administration would implement its proposed changes through the usual rulemaking process . \u201c I guess I was naive , because instead of doing that , they simply reinterpreted the existing regulations more narrowly , \u201d he says . \u201c Normally I \u2019 d ask for more scrutiny of H-1B visas , \u201d says Daniel Costa , director of immigration law and policy at the Economic Policy Institute , a pro-labor think tank . \u201c But this administration , with its anti-immigration bent of mind , is probably not the best one to do it . \u201d\nSince early 2017 , a series of USCIS memos have outlined dramatic changes to how the H-1B program is administered . A memo published a few days before Trump \u2019 s executive order instructed reviewers to examine whether H-1B applicants held jobs that required a college degree and put stringent requirements on which degrees qualify for H-1Bs . An October 2017 memo required every H-1B case to be evaluated without giving any weight , or \u201c deference , \u201d to past approvals . Previously , USCIS officers would not deny an H-1B renewal if the visa had been approved in the past and there was no reason to scrutinize the application . A memo in February 2018 targeted IT staffing companies , some of the heaviest users of the H-1B program .\nThe new rules have shaken up the once-predictable H-1B application process . According to USCIS data , the denial rates for H-1B visas in the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years were the highest of the past decade . One of the largest IT hiring firms , Tata Consultancy Services , has had more than a third of its new visa petitions rejected in 2019 , compared with 6 percent four years earlier . In 2015 , the consulting firm Ernst and Young applied for almost 700 new H-1B visas and received two denials . In 2019 , it applied for 40 percent fewer visas and received 75 denials . IBM applied for 213 new visas in 2015 and two were denied . In 2019 , it applied for around 1,100 and over a third were denied .\nLawyers and immigration experts say the new rules are vague and are being applied unpredictably . \u201c The administration is intentionally giving [ USCIS officers ] much more leeway on how to decide cases , and they are also removing some of the guardrails that prior administrations sought to get consistency in how things were decided , \u201d says Lynden Melmed , an immigration attorney and the former chief counsel of USCIS in the Bush administration . \u201c It \u2019 s very difficult for individuals and families to go through an immigration process where they don \u2019 t know what the rules are , or the rules will change midstream on them . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 re seeing very , very strange and unreasonable and illogical denials , \u201d says Michael Piston , a senior partner at an immigration law firm in Troy , Michigan . \u201c In the past , the agency at least made sense within its own context . You might disagree with their policies , but they usually followed them and what they did made sense within their own worldview . Now it \u2019 s like they \u2019 ve stopped even trying to pretend to be fair or logical or reasonable . \u201d\nWhen a visa application gets rejected , an employer can appeal with USCIS . The number of H-1B\u2013related appeals has shot up under the current administration , as have reversals of its visa decisions . Historically , the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office usually upholds the agency \u2019 s original decisions . Between the 2014 and 2017 fiscal years , it reversed about 3 percent of the H-1B decisions it reviewed . Yet in 2018 and 2019 , it overruled the agency in nearly 14 percent of H-1B appeals . \u201c Previously , deniable cases were being denied and approvable cases were being approved , \u201d says William Stock , a lawyer in Philadelphia who specializes in employment-based visas . \u201c What we are seeing now is that approvable cases are being denied , so what the [ appeals office ] is saying is , \u2018 This is an approvable case , it shouldn \u2019 t have been denied . \u2019 \u201d\nIn an emailed statement , USCIS spokesperson Matthew Bourke said these trends are in line \u201c with a series of agency reforms designed to protect U.S. workers , cut down on frivolous petitions , strengthen the transparency of employment-based visa programs , and improve the integrity of the immigration petition process. \u201d Asked about the impact of these policies on people from India and China , he said that applicants \u2019 \u201c country of citizenship is not a factor \u201d in the agency \u2019 s decisions .\nThe other way to challenge an unfavorable visa ruling is to go to federal court . There \u2019 s been an explosion of H-1B\u2013related federal lawsuits since Trump took office . According to our database of cases , built with professor Yale-Loehr and his student Hun Lee of Cornell Law School , between 2017 and 2019 , nearly 100 of these suits were filed against USCIS , compared with a handful per year over the previous decade . Jonathan Wasden and Bradley Banias , former Justice Department attorneys who now represent plaintiffs suing USCIS , confirm that this is the highest number of H-1B visa lawsuits . The American Immigration Lawyers Association has created a task force to train business-immigration attorneys how to file H-1B lawsuits . Large companies including McKinsey & Company , LexisNexis , and Bristol-Myers Squibb have filed lawsuits on behalf of employees fighting USCIS decisions .\nJill Family , an immigration law professor at Widener University , has also found an uptick in administrative lawsuits challenging USCIS decisions on H-1Bs and other work visas , green cards , and naturalization . \u201c Lots of people are unhappy with how the agency is adjudicating the applications and they feel like they have to turn to the courts for fair adjudication because the agency is failing them , \u201d she says . \u201c The administration is trying to build all kinds of walls . It \u2019 s not just physical walls across the border . It seems like the administration \u2019 s plan is to throw as many roadblocks and then see what the courts do with it . \u201d\nRead more about how we tracked an explosion in lawsuits against Trump \u2019 s immigration policies .\nUSCIS will not comment on pending litigation and won \u2019 t speculate on why the number of lawsuits has risen . Its spokesperson writes that the agency is \u201c efficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits \u201d and \u201c adheres to all applicable laws , regulations , and policies as it carries out its mission . \u201d\nIn nearly 40 percent of the Trump administration \u2019 s H-1B\u2013related lawsuits that we examined , USCIS reversed its denial before a judge could rule . ( The outcomes in these cases aren \u2019 t public , but attorneys have confirmed the reversals . ) In some instances , judges have openly questioned or criticized the agency \u2019 s actions . In a case heard in August 2019 , LexisNexis sued USCIS for denying an H-1B for a data analyst . When the company filed suit , USCIS asked for the same information it already received before rejecting the visa . Judge Emmet Sullivan of the DC district court ordered the agency to reverse its decision . In his opinion , he wrote that USCIS had made \u201c a clear error of judgment \u201d and \u201c abused its discretion . \u201d\nExperts say such rulings are unusual . \u201c We have a general presumption that federal courts should defer to agency expertise , \u201d Yale-Loehr says . \u201c It \u2019 s rare for a court to say , \u2018 No , I \u2019 m not going to defer to the agency . \u2019 \u201d\nAt the center of many of these cases is the Trump administration \u2019 s position that jobs that once qualified for H-1Bs no longer do . Broadly , foreigners who work in \u201c specialty occupations \u201d and have a related degree are eligible for H-1Bs . In March 2017 , USCIS instructed its H-1B adjudicators to take a more obtuse reading of the Department of Labor \u2019 s occupational outlook handbook , long considered the arbiter of which jobs require specialized degrees . The handbook says that a computer programmer position \u201c typically \u201d requires a bachelor \u2019 s degree in engineering or other related fields . In the past , USCIS officers classified the job as a specialty occupation meriting an H-1B visa . Now , they \u2019 re more likely to interpret \u201c typically \u201d to mean a bachelor \u2019 s degree is not required\u2014making this position much harder to qualify for an H-1B .\nThe lawsuits offer many examples of the sometimes baffling and inconsistent logic the agency has used while applying its new policies . In one case , USCIS denied an H-1B to a pathologist with a PhD in pathology and a master \u2019 s degree in forensic medicine . Bristol-Myers Squibb wanted to hire him as its associate director of pathology to assist in \u201c critical drug discovery efforts. \u201d Yet USCIS found that the job did not require a college degree . Another lawsuit involved a venture capital firm that wanted to hire a Singaporean with a PhD in developmental biology from Stanford as a $ 250,000-a-year analyst to evaluate Silicon Valley biotech startups . The petitioner had already qualified for a H-1B1 visa , a temporary work permit for Singaporeans and Chileans that has the same requirements as an H-1B . USCIS asked him for evidence to prove his position was a \u201c specialty occupation , \u201d and then denied his H-1B visa . The case is pending . In another case , a data analytics company said that in one week it had filed H-1B applications for four employees with similar qualifications who were taking similar positions . Three were approved and one was denied . USCIS approved the fourth petition in response to the company \u2019 s lawsuit .\nFeist , the immigration lawyer in Minneapolis , says she regularly receives requests from the agency for additional documentation in applications that would have been straightforward approvals in the past . \u201c I have two cases right now for mechanical engineers requesting additional evidence that the mechanical engineering degree earned in the United States is relevant to the mechanical engineering job , \u201d she says . \u201c Apparently the connection between those two is just not clear. \u201d Bourke , the USCIS representative , says the burden is on the petitioner to prove that their job is a specialty occupation and they \u2019 re qualified to do it .\nA narrow interpretation of \u201c specialty occupation \u201d is not the intent of the law , according to Morrison . \u201c I \u2019 m the author of specialty occupation , \u201d he says . \u201c It was intended to narrow the category of people who were eligible for H-1Bs to people who had at least bachelor \u2019 s degrees that were related to the job. \u201d The administration is \u201c trying to require a connection with the job that is not practical or real but wholly theoretical . And it really doesn \u2019 t stand up except if you think that the goal is to say no. \u201d Cornell \u2019 s Yale-Loehr agrees that the administration is trying to shut the door on more immigrants : \u201c They \u2019 re claiming that they want to go toward merit-based immigration , but it doesn \u2019 t seem that they \u2019 re actually trying to welcome more high-skilled foreign nationals to work in the United States . We see an assault on legal immigration just as vociferously as we \u2019 ve seen the assault on illegal immigration . It \u2019 s really Make America White Again . \u201d\nWhile the lawsuits we reviewed may reflect only the most egregious visa denials , most of these cases do not support Stephen Miller \u2019 s characterization of H-1B recipients as poorly educated \u201c guest workers. \u201d In a majority of the 68 complaints we obtained , the plaintiffs had master \u2019 s degrees or doctorates . In nearly half of the complaints , the visa holders had degrees from American universities including Stanford , Carnegie Mellon , Purdue , Columbia , and Johns Hopkins . The lawsuits contain many examples of the highly educated and highly skilled foreign workers who Trump has said he wants to attract . \u201c When somebody \u2019 s going to Harvard , Yale , Princeton , Penn , Stanford , all the great\u2014and they graduate and not only graduate , but do great and we throw them out of the country , and they can \u2019 t get back in ? I think that \u2019 s terrible , \u201d he told future White House adviser Steve Bannon on Bannon \u2019 s podcast in November 2015 . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to be able to keep great people in the country . \u201d\nFor H-1B visa holders who have lived in the United States for many years and may be on the path to residency , the changes have been unnerving . The uncertainty caused by the policies has worn her clients out , Feist says . One client \u201c looked at me across the table and she said , \u2018 I just feel like garbage . I feel like the government just thinks I \u2019 m garbage , \u2019 \u201d she recalls .\nNot all companies will fight H-1B denials on behalf of their employees . In Samir \u2019 s case , his employer let him go when his visa renewal was denied . In an email , a spokesperson from UnitedHealth Group said it couldn \u2019 t comment on specific personnel matters . \u201c When an employee \u2019 s H1-B visa is denied , we are required by law to terminate the employee immediately , \u201d she wrote . \u201c We empathize with individuals in these situations , but also recognize our responsibility to follow the law . \u201d\nSamir started interviewing for jobs in the United States and India as soon as he lost his old position . He took the first one he could find . The pay was lower than his previous position \u2019 s , but his new employer quickly filed his H-1B petition . This time , USCIS approved his application , even though his qualifications , education , and skills had not changed since he was rejected a few months earlier .\n\u201c We see an assault on legal immigration just as vociferously as we \u2019 ve seen the assault on illegal immigration . It \u2019 s really Make America White Again . \u201d\nSivaprasad Gali , a web developer at Tata Consultancy Services in Houston , was also denied a H-1B visa transfer and extension in 2018 and lost his job . ( Tata did not respond to a request for comment . ) He , his wife , and their two children packed their bags in two weeks and left for India . His job didn \u2019 t qualify as a specialty occupation anymore .\n\u201c I broke my lease , \u201d Gali recalls . \u201c I didn \u2019 t even have the time to sell things on the internet or give it away to friends . I had to throw [ away ] everything. \u201d Gali also had an approved green card petition . He returned to India to look for work .\nWhile immigration attorneys say there \u2019 s no pattern of discrimination against particular nationalities , the new policies disproportionately affect Indians , who hold nearly three quarters of all H-1Bs . ( USCIS says it does not consider country of origin while evaluating applications . ) Many H-1B holders use their visa as a means to establish residency status , a major step toward becoming an American citizen . Every year , thousands of H-1B holders qualify for green cards , yet there \u2019 s a cap on how many green cards can be issued to each nationality . As of May 2018 , nearly 600,000 workers and their families were waiting for employment-based green cards . More than 90 percent are Indians , who receive about 10,000 employment-based green cards a year . This green card backlog is daunting : USCIS is still processing applications from 2009 ; the CATO Institute , a libertarian think tank , estimates the wait time for Indians with advanced degrees is 49 years . While they wait , many rely on H-1B renewals and extensions to remain in the country .\nAs US immigration policies become more unpredictable and inhospitable , many skilled immigrants look beyond its borders for the opportunities they can \u2019 t find here . On a nippy Saturday morning , dozens of people line up outside an English-language school in San Francisco \u2019 s Embarcadero Center . Most are Indians who work in the city or Silicon Valley . Fathers and mothers tend to their kids in strollers as they wait for their spouses to take the language test required to apply for permanent residency in Canada or Australia .\nA record number of people , particularly from India , have immigrated to Canada in the last few years . Canada \u2019 s immigration system has a program for high-skilled workers that awards applicants points on the basis of professional qualifications , English proficiency , age , and other factors . Nearly 40,000 Indians immigrated to Canada through this program in 2018 , a 51 percent increase over the previous year . There are even Canadian businesses that target H-1B holders and \u201c port them \u201d to Canada , where they may continue working for their former American employers .\nVivek , who works at a software company in Palo Alto , says he and his wife are thinking of applying for permanent residence in Canada . \u201c At the end of day , I am willing to stay in any place that respects my talent , where my contribution is valued , where I can lead a peaceful life and there is a sense of belonging , \u201d he says . \u201c It doesn \u2019 t matter whether it is USA , Canada , or India . \u201d\nGaurav , a statistician from India who works at a Fortune 500 financial services company , is waiting for his pregnant wife to take the test . \u201c I have [ a ] sword hanging on my head every three years to renew my H-1 [ B ] and proving that my education still is associated with the work I do , \u201d he says . Pankaj Kumar , an engineer who works in Silicon Valley , is also waiting for his wife , who he says has a PhD in environmental studies but has been unable to work in the United States due to visa issues . They \u2019 re also thinking about moving to Canada . \u201c I don \u2019 t want her to waste her talent , \u201d he says .",

Listen to the latest episode of Reveal below for more on this story and to learn more about how Sinduja Rangarajan reported it.\n\nSamir came to the United States from India in 2006 as a graduate student. He got a master\u2019s degree in environmental engineering, and after a few internships where he picked up programming skills, he was hired in 2010 by UnitedHealthcare, a Fortune 500 insurance company based in Minnesota. He loved his job streamlining its claims process. \u201cThere were days where I worked three days nonstop, no sleep, nothing, because we wanted people to get cured\u2014they need to get the treatment,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI put my soul in there.\u201d\n\nThe insurance company got him an H-1B, a temporary work visa reserved for high-skilled foreigners who can fill jobs for which there\u2019s a shortage of American workers. His visa was regularly renewed, and after a few years, his employer sponsored him for a green card and his application was approved. Samir thought he would spend the rest of his life in his adopted country. \u201cI never used to celebrate Christmas back home in India,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I did go to church here for the first time, just to see how they celebrate. This country is built on immigrants, right? I wanted to feel that.\u201d\n\nIn early 2018, Samir was transferred to a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group in Dallas. It was a lateral move, but it required him to get his H-1B transferred. A few months later, he learned that US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency that approves visas, had rejected what should have been a routine approval. Overlooking his eight years of experience, the agency said his education didn\u2019t line up with his position and determined that he wasn\u2019t qualified to do it anymore. When his visa was denied, Samir says he lost his job.\n\nSuddenly, the life that Samir had painstakingly built came crashing down. He and his wife had to explain to their 5-year-old son that they\u2019d have to move out of their dream house in suburban Dallas\u2014the one they\u2019d built with most of their savings. They sold it in a rush and moved into a tiny apartment. Samir had a few weeks to find another employer who\u2019d sponsor his H-1B or he\u2019d have to leave the country. After 12 years in the United States, he was suddenly faced with the idea that America was no longer home.\n\nSamir, who asked not to use his real name because he fears his future visas may be denied, is one of thousands of H-1B holders who have found that the Trump administration has upended the once-predictable rules for who gets (and keeps) these coveted visas, which are a major source of high-skilled immigrants, particularly from India. Even as President Donald Trump has complained about rules that prevent American companies \u201cfrom retaining highly skilled and\u2026 totally brilliant people\u201d from abroad, his administration has made sweeping changes to the H-1B program, denying visas to skilled immigrants, some who have been working in the United States for years. USCIS has been denying H-1B petitions at a record rate: 24 percent of first-time H-1B applications were denied through the third quarter of 2019 fiscal year, compared with 6 percent in 2015. In the 2015 fiscal year, only 3 percent of H-1B transfers and extensions like Samir\u2019s were denied. In 2019, 12 percent were. In total, about 50,000 people were denied H-1B visas in the past year.\n\nTrump is denying H-1Bs at a record rate\n\nThe administration says it\u2019s tightening H-1B policies to prevent fraud and award visas only to the \u201cmost-skilled or highest-paid beneficiaries.\u201d Yet an investigation by Mother Jones and Reveal has found that the administration has been denying visas to experienced, well-paid workers, many of whom have degrees from American universities and have previously received H-1Bs. Our analysis shows that a record number of H-1B\u2013related federal lawsuits have been filed against USCIS in the past two years. The complaints allege that the agency has been making inconsistent and incorrect decisions, ignoring evidence, and misapplying the law.\n\nSandra Feist, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis, says navigating the new bureaucratic obstacles for visa holders has been more stressful than any other period in her career. \u201cI was working in the field after 9/11, and this is infinitely worse,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the clients that I work with have been treated with much more skepticism and cynicism than even in that era.\u201d\n\nImmigration-law experts see the administration\u2019s restrictions on these specialized visas as part of the larger anti-immigration agenda pushed by hardliners like acting USCIS Director Kenneth Cuccinelli and White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller. \u201cAttacking legal immigration is kind of a stealth strategy,\u201d says Bruce Morrison, a former Congress member from Connecticut who co-sponsored the Immigration Act of 1990, which established the H-1B program. \u201cPeople who are just listening to the news are easily seduced into thinking this is all about protecting the border or protecting our security or making sure the people who are here are here legally. But in fact, this is a wholesale isolationist administration. It doesn\u2019t like anything that isn\u2019t stamped \u2018Made in America,\u2019 whether it\u2019s the individuals, or whether it\u2019s the products.\u201d\n\nThe H-1B program annually issues around 85,000 new visas to recipients from around the globe, with the majority going to people from India and China. Though Silicon Valley relies heavily on these \u201ctech visas,\u201d they\u2019re also used by universities, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies. Visas are usually issued for three years, followed by three-year extensions. If the visa holder\u2019s employer files for a green card, they may get unlimited H-1B extensions until their residency is approved. In the past, the process for renewing H-1B visas was relatively predictable, particularly if there were no major changes to the visa holder\u2019s job.\n\nPro-labor groups, anti-immigration think tanks, and conservative politicians have called for the program to be reformed. Critics argue that a disproportionate number of H-1B visas go to IT consulting companies that replace American workers with underpaid foreign workers. (Both Mother Jones and Reveal have reported on the \u201cbody shops\u201d that take advantage of tech workers eager to work in the United States.)\n\nKey figures in the Trump administration have criticized the H-1B system. In late 2015, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the future attorney general, described the program as \u201ca tremendous threat\u201d to American workers on Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily podcast. In 2016, Sessions chaired an immigration subcommittee hearing where witnesses urged Congress and the Obama administration to reform the program, citing examples of large companies that had laid off American workers and substituted them with H1-B holders. Speaking with Steve Bannon on the Breitbart podcast in March 2016, Stephen Miller, the Sessions aide who would become the architect of Trump\u2019s immigration policy, said H-1B recipients were not necessarily high-skilled workers. \u201cThe reality is we\u2019re talking about less skilled foreign guest workers that are less educated than Americans, who are paid less than Americans, who know less about the computing industry and about the technology industry than Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration is trying to build all kinds of walls. It\u2019s not just physical walls across the border.\u201d\n\nAs a recent investigation by Highline details, the new administration quickly got to work on implementing bureaucratic restrictions on all kinds of immigration\u2014an \u201cinvisible wall.\u201d In April 2017, President Trump announced his Buy American Hire American executive order in a speech at a tool company in Wisconsin. \u201cWidespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries to fill the same job for sometimes less pay. This will stop,\u201d he declared. The H-1B program needed \u201clong-overdue reform,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be given to the most-skilled and highest-paid applicants, and they should never, ever be used to replace Americans.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump signed the executive order, Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University, thought the administration would implement its proposed changes through the usual rulemaking process. \u201cI guess I was naive, because instead of doing that, they simply reinterpreted the existing regulations more narrowly,\u201d he says. \u201cNormally I\u2019d ask for more scrutiny of H-1B visas,\u201d says Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy at the Economic Policy Institute, a pro-labor think tank. \u201cBut this administration, with its anti-immigration bent of mind, is probably not the best one to do it.\u201d\n\nSince early 2017, a series of USCIS memos have outlined dramatic changes to how the H-1B program is administered. A memo published a few days before Trump\u2019s executive order instructed reviewers to examine whether H-1B applicants held jobs that required a college degree and put stringent requirements on which degrees qualify for H-1Bs. An October 2017 memo required every H-1B case to be evaluated without giving any weight, or \u201cdeference,\u201d to past approvals. Previously, USCIS officers would not deny an H-1B renewal if the visa had been approved in the past and there was no reason to scrutinize the application. A memo in February 2018 targeted IT staffing companies, some of the heaviest users of the H-1B program.\n\nThe new rules have shaken up the once-predictable H-1B application process. According to USCIS data, the denial rates for H-1B visas in the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years were the highest of the past decade. One of the largest IT hiring firms, Tata Consultancy Services, has had more than a third of its new visa petitions rejected in 2019, compared with 6 percent four years earlier. In 2015, the consulting firm Ernst and Young applied for almost 700 new H-1B visas and received two denials. In 2019, it applied for 40 percent fewer visas and received 75 denials. IBM applied for 213 new visas in 2015 and two were denied. In 2019, it applied for around 1,100 and over a third were denied.\n\nCompanies see \u201ctech visa\u201d denials spike\n\n\n\n\n\nLawyers and immigration experts say the new rules are vague and are being applied unpredictably. \u201cThe administration is intentionally giving [USCIS officers] much more leeway on how to decide cases, and they are also removing some of the guardrails that prior administrations sought to get consistency in how things were decided,\u201d says Lynden Melmed, an immigration attorney and the former chief counsel of USCIS in the Bush administration. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for individuals and families to go through an immigration process where they don\u2019t know what the rules are, or the rules will change midstream on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing very, very strange and unreasonable and illogical denials,\u201d says Michael Piston, a senior partner at an immigration law firm in Troy, Michigan. \u201cIn the past, the agency at least made sense within its own context. You might disagree with their policies, but they usually followed them and what they did made sense within their own worldview. Now it\u2019s like they\u2019ve stopped even trying to pretend to be fair or logical or reasonable.\u201d\n\nWhen a visa application gets rejected, an employer can appeal with USCIS. The number of H-1B\u2013related appeals has shot up under the current administration, as have reversals of its visa decisions. Historically, the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office usually upholds the agency\u2019s original decisions. Between the 2014 and 2017 fiscal years, it reversed about 3 percent of the H-1B decisions it reviewed. Yet in 2018 and 2019, it overruled the agency in nearly 14 percent of H-1B appeals. \u201cPreviously, deniable cases were being denied and approvable cases were being approved,\u201d says William Stock, a lawyer in Philadelphia who specializes in employment-based visas. \u201cWhat we are seeing now is that approvable cases are being denied, so what the [appeals office] is saying is, \u2018This is an approvable case, it shouldn\u2019t have been denied.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement, USCIS spokesperson Matthew Bourke said these trends are in line \u201cwith a series of agency reforms designed to protect U.S. workers, cut down on frivolous petitions, strengthen the transparency of employment-based visa programs, and improve the integrity of the immigration petition process.\u201d Asked about the impact of these policies on people from India and China, he said that applicants\u2019 \u201ccountry of citizenship is not a factor\u201d in the agency\u2019s decisions.\n\nH-1B decisions are being overturned at a record rate\n\nThe other way to challenge an unfavorable visa ruling is to go to federal court. There\u2019s been an explosion of H-1B\u2013related federal lawsuits since Trump took office. According to our database of cases, built with professor Yale-Loehr and his student Hun Lee of Cornell Law School, between 2017 and 2019, nearly 100 of these suits were filed against USCIS, compared with a handful per year over the previous decade. Jonathan Wasden and Bradley Banias, former Justice Department attorneys who now represent plaintiffs suing USCIS, confirm that this is the highest number of H-1B visa lawsuits. The American Immigration Lawyers Association has created a task force to train business-immigration attorneys how to file H-1B lawsuits. Large companies including McKinsey & Company, LexisNexis, and Bristol-Myers Squibb have filed lawsuits on behalf of employees fighting USCIS decisions.\n\nH-1B decisions are being challenged at a record rate\n\n\n\nJill Family, an immigration law professor at Widener University, has also found an uptick in administrative lawsuits challenging USCIS decisions on H-1Bs and other work visas, green cards, and naturalization. \u201cLots of people are unhappy with how the agency is adjudicating the applications and they feel like they have to turn to the courts for fair adjudication because the agency is failing them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe administration is trying to build all kinds of walls. It\u2019s not just physical walls across the border. It seems like the administration\u2019s plan is to throw as many roadblocks and then see what the courts do with it.\u201d\n\nRead more about how we tracked an explosion in lawsuits against Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nUSCIS will not comment on pending litigation and won\u2019t speculate on why the number of lawsuits has risen. Its spokesperson writes that the agency is \u201cefficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits\u201d and \u201cadheres to all applicable laws, regulations, and policies as it carries out its mission.\u201d\n\nIn nearly 40 percent of the Trump administration\u2019s H-1B\u2013related lawsuits that we examined, USCIS reversed its denial before a judge could rule. (The outcomes in these cases aren\u2019t public, but attorneys have confirmed the reversals.) In some instances, judges have openly questioned or criticized the agency\u2019s actions. In a case heard in August 2019, LexisNexis sued USCIS for denying an H-1B for a data analyst. When the company filed suit, USCIS asked for the same information it already received before rejecting the visa. Judge Emmet Sullivan of the DC district court ordered the agency to reverse its decision. In his opinion, he wrote that USCIS had made \u201ca clear error of judgment\u201d and \u201cabused its discretion.\u201d\n\nOutcomes of H-1B lawsuits\n\n\n\nExperts say such rulings are unusual. \u201cWe have a general presumption that federal courts should defer to agency expertise,\u201d Yale-Loehr says. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a court to say, \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to defer to the agency.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the center of many of these cases is the Trump administration\u2019s position that jobs that once qualified for H-1Bs no longer do. Broadly, foreigners who work in \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d and have a related degree are eligible for H-1Bs. In March 2017, USCIS instructed its H-1B adjudicators to take a more obtuse reading of the Department of Labor\u2019s occupational outlook handbook, long considered the arbiter of which jobs require specialized degrees. The handbook says that a computer programmer position \u201ctypically\u201d requires a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering or other related fields. In the past, USCIS officers classified the job as a specialty occupation meriting an H-1B visa. Now, they\u2019re more likely to interpret \u201ctypically\u201d to mean a bachelor\u2019s degree is not required\u2014making this position much harder to qualify for an H-1B.\n\nThe lawsuits offer many examples of the sometimes baffling and inconsistent logic the agency has used while applying its new policies. In one case, USCIS denied an H-1B to a pathologist with a PhD in pathology and a master\u2019s degree in forensic medicine. Bristol-Myers Squibb wanted to hire him as its associate director of pathology to assist in \u201ccritical drug discovery efforts.\u201d Yet USCIS found that the job did not require a college degree. Another lawsuit involved a venture capital firm that wanted to hire a Singaporean with a PhD in developmental biology from Stanford as a $250,000-a-year analyst to evaluate Silicon Valley biotech startups. The petitioner had already qualified for a H-1B1 visa, a temporary work permit for Singaporeans and Chileans that has the same requirements as an H-1B. USCIS asked him for evidence to prove his position was a \u201cspecialty occupation,\u201d and then denied his H-1B visa. The case is pending. In another case, a data analytics company said that in one week it had filed H-1B applications for four employees with similar qualifications who were taking similar positions. Three were approved and one was denied. USCIS approved the fourth petition in response to the company\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nFeist, the immigration lawyer in Minneapolis, says she regularly receives requests from the agency for additional documentation in applications that would have been straightforward approvals in the past. \u201cI have two cases right now for mechanical engineers requesting additional evidence that the mechanical engineering degree earned in the United States is relevant to the mechanical engineering job,\u201d she says. \u201cApparently the connection between those two is just not clear.\u201d Bourke, the USCIS representative, says the burden is on the petitioner to prove that their job is a specialty occupation and they\u2019re qualified to do it.\n\nA narrow interpretation of \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d is not the intent of the law, according to Morrison. \u201cI\u2019m the author of specialty occupation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was intended to narrow the category of people who were eligible for H-1Bs to people who had at least bachelor\u2019s degrees that were related to the job.\u201d The administration is \u201ctrying to require a connection with the job that is not practical or real but wholly theoretical. And it really doesn\u2019t stand up except if you think that the goal is to say no.\u201d Cornell\u2019s Yale-Loehr agrees that the administration is trying to shut the door on more immigrants: \u201cThey\u2019re claiming that they want to go toward merit-based immigration, but it doesn\u2019t seem that they\u2019re actually trying to welcome more high-skilled foreign nationals to work in the United States. We see an assault on legal immigration just as vociferously as we\u2019ve seen the assault on illegal immigration. It\u2019s really Make America White Again.\u201d\n\nWhile the lawsuits we reviewed may reflect only the most egregious visa denials, most of these cases do not support Stephen Miller\u2019s characterization of H-1B recipients as poorly educated \u201cguest workers.\u201d In a majority of the 68 complaints we obtained, the plaintiffs had master\u2019s degrees or doctorates. In nearly half of the complaints, the visa holders had degrees from American universities including Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Purdue, Columbia, and Johns Hopkins. The lawsuits contain many examples of the highly educated and highly skilled foreign workers who Trump has said he wants to attract. \u201cWhen somebody\u2019s going to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Penn, Stanford, all the great\u2014and they graduate and not only graduate, but do great and we throw them out of the country, and they can\u2019t get back in? I think that\u2019s terrible,\u201d he told future White House adviser Steve Bannon on Bannon\u2019s podcast in November 2015. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to keep great people in the country.\u201d\n\nFor H-1B visa holders who have lived in the United States for many years and may be on the path to residency, the changes have been unnerving. The uncertainty caused by the policies has worn her clients out, Feist says. One client \u201clooked at me across the table and she said, \u2018I just feel like garbage. I feel like the government just thinks I\u2019m garbage,\u2019\u201d she recalls.\n\nNot all companies will fight H-1B denials on behalf of their employees. In Samir\u2019s case, his employer let him go when his visa renewal was denied. In an email, a spokesperson from UnitedHealth Group said it couldn\u2019t comment on specific personnel matters. \u201cWhen an employee\u2019s H1-B visa is denied, we are required by law to terminate the employee immediately,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe empathize with individuals in these situations, but also recognize our responsibility to follow the law.\u201d\n\nSamir started interviewing for jobs in the United States and India as soon as he lost his old position. He took the first one he could find. The pay was lower than his previous position\u2019s, but his new employer quickly filed his H-1B petition. This time, USCIS approved his application, even though his qualifications, education, and skills had not changed since he was rejected a few months earlier.\n\n\u201cWe see an assault on legal immigration just as vociferously as we\u2019ve seen the assault on illegal immigration. It\u2019s really Make America White Again.\u201d\n\nSivaprasad Gali, a web developer at Tata Consultancy Services in Houston, was also denied a H-1B visa transfer and extension in 2018 and lost his job. (Tata did not respond to a request for comment.) He, his wife, and their two children packed their bags in two weeks and left for India. His job didn\u2019t qualify as a specialty occupation anymore.\n\n\u201cI broke my lease,\u201d Gali recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have the time to sell things on the internet or give it away to friends. I had to throw [away] everything.\u201d Gali also had an approved green card petition. He returned to India to look for work.\n\nWhile immigration attorneys say there\u2019s no pattern of discrimination against particular nationalities, the new policies disproportionately affect Indians, who hold nearly three quarters of all H-1Bs. (USCIS says it does not consider country of origin while evaluating applications.) Many H-1B holders use their visa as a means to establish residency status, a major step toward becoming an American citizen. Every year, thousands of H-1B holders qualify for green cards, yet there\u2019s a cap on how many green cards can be issued to each nationality. As of May 2018, nearly 600,000 workers and their families were waiting for employment-based green cards. More than 90 percent are Indians, who receive about 10,000 employment-based green cards a year. This green card backlog is daunting: USCIS is still processing applications from 2009; the CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank, estimates the wait time for Indians with advanced degrees is 49 years. While they wait, many rely on H-1B renewals and extensions to remain in the country.\n\nThe green card backlog\n\n\n\nLooking north\n\nAs US immigration policies become more unpredictable and inhospitable, many skilled immigrants look beyond its borders for the opportunities they can\u2019t find here. On a nippy Saturday morning, dozens of people line up outside an English-language school in San Francisco\u2019s Embarcadero Center. Most are Indians who work in the city or Silicon Valley. Fathers and mothers tend to their kids in strollers as they wait for their spouses to take the language test required to apply for permanent residency in Canada or Australia.\n\nA record number of people, particularly from India, have immigrated to Canada in the last few years. Canada\u2019s immigration system has a program for high-skilled workers that awards applicants points on the basis of professional qualifications, English proficiency, age, and other factors. Nearly 40,000 Indians immigrated to Canada through this program in 2018, a 51 percent increase over the previous year. There are even Canadian businesses that target H-1B holders and \u201cport them\u201d to Canada, where they may continue working for their former American employers.\n\nVivek, who works at a software company in Palo Alto, says he and his wife are thinking of applying for permanent residence in Canada. \u201cAt the end of day, I am willing to stay in any place that respects my talent, where my contribution is valued, where I can lead a peaceful life and there is a sense of belonging,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether it is USA, Canada, or India.\u201d\n\nGaurav, a statistician from India who works at a Fortune 500 financial services company, is waiting for his pregnant wife to take the test. \u201cI have [a] sword hanging on my head every three years to renew my H-1[B] and proving that my education still is associated with the work I do,\u201d he says. Pankaj Kumar, an engineer who works in Silicon Valley, is also waiting for his wife, who he says has a PhD in environmental studies but has been unable to work in the United States due to visa issues. They\u2019re also thinking about moving to Canada. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to waste her talent,\u201d he says.",
