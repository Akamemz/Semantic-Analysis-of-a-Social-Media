    "content": "But a series of liberal decisions by the conservative-led Supreme Court this week is showcasing the shakiness of such promises , in an era when candidates of both parties are making increasingly explicit pledges to name justices who will faithfully carry out their agenda .\nTwo Republican-appointed members of the court , including Trump \u2019 s first pick , Neil M. Gorsuch , and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , have made clear that their opinions will not always be predictable when it comes to issues important to Republicans . They each joined with liberal justices to defeat Trump administration priorities this week .\nThe court has also refused to take up cases for the next term that had been championed by conservatives , including cases on gun rights and California \u2019 s sanctuary cities law .\nThese twists have deeply frustrated conservatives . \u201c The left and the right are playing to a different set of rules , \u201d said Ralph Reed , chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition , a conservative religious group , after the Gorsuch ruling on Monday . \u201c They seem to be able to appoint people who largely if not universally hew to the party line . On the right it feels sometimes that at best you are batting .500 sometimes . \u201d\nThe surprises have prompted both Trump and his Democratic opponents to redouble their arguments , as they head toward Election Day , on the need to build as big a court majority as possible . At the same time , they are injecting more anxiety and uncertainty into the process .\nThe stakes are high , with conservatives holding a narrow 5-4 majority on the court and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , 87 , widely expected to retire in the next few years , possibly along with other colleagues . That could give the next president the opportunity to influence the court for a generation .\nThe moves by Roberts and Gorsuch have also served to bolster the case , long made in public by Roberts , that the courts are not simple extensions of the political branches of government . \u201c We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges , Bush judges or Clinton judges , \u201d Roberts said in 2018 , after Trump verbally criticized a federal judge .\nDemocratic court-watchers caution that this week \u2019 s rulings may not define the court term . The court is expected to issue opinions as soon as next week that could favor Trump and the Republican Party on questions regarding the release of Trump \u2019 s tax returns , abortion restrictions in Louisiana , religious exemptions to contraception mandates and the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think that people should form judgments yet about the trajectory of this conservative majority yet until these rulings are out , \u201d said Brian Fallon , executive director of Demand Justice , a progressive group that has supported restructuring the court to weaken the conservative influence .\nFor advocates on the right , however , the shocks of this week revive previous traumas that dates back to the presidencies of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan , who appointed justices who repeatedly ruled against the conservative movement \u2019 s priorities , especially later in their careers .\nThe decision by Gorsuch to chart his own course is particularly painful for some conservatives , given that he was vetted for Trump by a small network of conservative legal scholars , including leaders of the Federalist Society , who offered public assurances of their credentials .\nAfter this week \u2019 s ruling on gay rights , conservative writer Varad Mehta despaired of the years-long push to elevate conservative justices .\n\u201c The whole point of the Federalist Society Judicial project , the whole point of electing Trump to implement it , was to deliver Supreme Court victories to social conservatives , \u201d he tweeted . \u201c If they can \u2019 t deliver anything that basic , there \u2019 s no point to either . \u201d\nBut other conservatives cautioned against overinterpreting the recent opinions , which amounted to a small slice of the decisions issued by the court this term . \u201c Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were the most-vetted justices in history by a Republican president . Their records were robust and the process was thorough , \u201d said Carrie Severino , president of the Judicial Crisis Network , a conservative group . \u201c That said , I \u2019 m sure the process can be improved even further \u2014 as it has in the last several decades \u2014 for the sake of advancing the rule of law even more so . \u201d\nTrump , during the 2016 campaign , announced a list of potential appointees to assure conservatives that he would pick someone to their liking , an apparently successful effort to persuade some on the right who were otherwise uncomfortable with Trump to support him .\nIn response to the rulings this week , Trump promised to double down on the strategy , though he has not yet publicly acknowledged that it was Gorsuch \u2019 s vote the undermined his administration \u2019 s fight to prevent workplace protections for gay , lesbian and transgender employees .\n\u201c These horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives , \u201d Trump wrote on Twitter . \u201c Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn \u2019 t like me ? \u201d\nThe Trump campaign has argued the court debate will once again work to its benefit this year .\n\u201c The President \u2019 s record appeals to conservatives who supported him in 2016 , \u201d Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said . \u201c Contrast that with the vision of Joe Biden , who has proven he will bend to the will of the extreme left , and has even been endorsed by Planned Parenthood , which supports abortion-on-demand . \u201d\nBut Democratic voters , long thought to care less about the court than their GOP counterparts , may have begun to close the gap in their interest in judicial selection .\n\u201c Progressives are galvanized on this issue of the courts like never before , \u201d said Nan Aron , president of the Alliance for Justice , a liberal group focused on judicial selection .\nOne galvanizing episode was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2019 s refusal to allow a hearing for former president Barack Obama \u2019 s final Supreme Court pick , Merrick Garland . That kept the spot open until Trump won , allowing him to appoint Gorsuch instead and seal the court \u2019 s conservative majority .\nDemocrats were upset enough by the conservative strength on the court that several candidates in the recently concluded presidential primaries embraced plans to remake the structure of the court , by expanding its membership or rotating justices off the bench .\nBiden did not embrace those plans , though he did back down from his past opposition to \u201c litmus tests \u201d around court picks . As a senator , he voted against the confirmations of Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas and in favor of the more liberal justices on the court .\nBiden praised Friday \u2019 s decision , on procedural grounds , to allow the continuation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which allows undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to stay in the country .\n\u201c The Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored , \u201d Biden said . \u201c As Justice Roberts said , the Trump administration \u2019 s action was capricious and arbitrary . \u201d\nDuring his 2016 campaign , Trump was explicit in promising policy outcomes from his Supreme Court picks . During a presidential debate , he predicted that Roe v. Wade would be overturned \u201c automatically \u201d if he was able to appoint two or three justices to the court . Since he took office , he has been able to appoint two justices to fill seats that had previously been filled by Republican nominees .\nAnother court pick is likely during the president \u2019 s next term .

Many court-watchers expect her to step down during the next presidential term .\nRepublican strategists , who credit the 2018 confirmation of Justice Brett M.
