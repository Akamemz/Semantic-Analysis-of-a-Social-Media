''\nSpeaking at Memorial Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery , Obama said he worries that the country 's servicemen and women are n't being fully appreciated in an era in which `` most Americans are not directly touched by war . ''\nHe said he could n't explain that phenomenon but said it might have something to do with the all-volunteer military force and advanced technology that now permits the United States to accomplish some military missions with far fewer personnel .\nHe said that some troops and military families `` mention to me their concern about whether the country fully appreciates '' them .\nObama 's Memorial Day appearance at the venerable Arlington burial grounds came four days after he declared in a major national security address that the U.S. has taken down the al-Qaida terrorist organization , particularly in the aftermath of the killing of leader Osama bin Laden , although terrorist threats remain and the country can not afford to let its vigilance slide .\nObama spoke on a sun-splashed morning at the amphitheater of Arlington National Cemetery after he placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns . That was preceded by a playingof the National Anthem and followed by the placing of `` Taps .
