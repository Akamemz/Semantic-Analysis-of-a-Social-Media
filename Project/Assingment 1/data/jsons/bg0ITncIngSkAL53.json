''\nThe Justice Department leaders reached that conclusion , Barr wrote , without regard to the `` constitutional considerations '' that surround whether the department can seek an indictment of a sitting president .\nTrump talked with reporters as he prepared to return from Florida to the White House , calling the investigation `` an illegal take-down that failed . ''\n`` It was just announced there was no collusion with Russia , the most ridiculous thing I 've ever heard . There was no obstruction , and it was a complete and total exoneration , '' Trump said before boarding Air Force One . `` It 's a shame our country had to go through this , and to be honest , it 's a shame your president had to go through this . ''\nTrump also said : `` Hopefully someone 's going to look at the other side , '' seeming to revive suggestions that he wanted an investigation into his 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton , which he has called for several times .\nAt Trump 's rallies , there are frequent chants of `` Lock her up ! '' FBI Director James Comey announced in 2016 that Clinton would not be charged .\nTrump 's outside attorneys , including Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow , released a statement on Sunday hailing what they said was `` a complete and total vindication of the president . ''\nTop Republicans also seized on the news , arguing that Trump has now been absolved .\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , who played golf on Sunday afternoon in Florida with the president , said in a statement : `` Good day for the rule of law . Great day for President Trump and his team . ''\n`` The cloud hanging over President Trump has been removed by this report , '' Graham added . `` Bad day for those hoping the Mueller investigation would take President Trump down . ''\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. said : `` It is abundantly clear , without a shadow of a doubt , there was no collusion ... This case is closed . ''\nGeorgia Rep. Doug Collins , the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , said Barr 's letter should `` assure every American there was no collusion between Russia and Donald Trump or his campaign . ''\n`` The special counsel 's investigation was long , thorough and conclusive : There was no collusion . There is no constitutional crisis , '' Collins added . `` As the report states , 'the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference . ' ``\nCollins also urged House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler , D-N.Y. , to `` rethink '' the committee 's ongoing investigations and shift to focus on issues such as immigration and criminal justice reform .\nNadler , however , was more cautious and seized on the language by Barr that suggests Mueller 's report left in limbo the question of whether Trump obstructed justice .\n`` Mueller clearly and explicitly is not exonerating the President , and we must hear from AG Barr about his decision making and see all the underlying evidence for the American people to know all the facts , '' Nadler tweeted .\nHe continued : `` There must be full transparency in what Special Counsel Mueller uncovered to not exonerate the President from wrongdoing . DOJ owes the public more than just a brief synopsis and decision not to go any further in their work . ''\nNadler also argued that given the 22 months Mueller spent investigating Trump , the two days that Barr spent boiling down his work is not sufficient .\nThe House Judiciary Committee chairman said he intends to call Barr to testify soon before a hearing .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer waited more than two hours after the letter 's release to issue a statement , writing that it `` raises as many questions as it answers '' and continuing to call for the report 's full release .\nThe Democratic leaders echoed Nadler in pointing out that Barr 's letter notes that Mueller did not exonerate Trump on the question of obstruction .\nThey wrote it `` demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay . Given Mr. Barr 's public record of bias against the Special Counsel 's inquiry , he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report . ''\nBarr wrote that Mueller interviewed about 500 witnesses , made requests to 13 foreign governments for evidence and obtained more than 230 orders for communications records .\nHe also said that Mueller has n't recommended indictments against anyone else and that there are no sealed indictments that have yet to be made public .\nThe news about no more charges was part of the announcement on Friday when Mueller notified the leaders of the Justice Department that he had completed his work , which began in May 2017 .\nFor much of the weekend , Washington has been anticipating the conclusions from Barr , who spent Saturday and Sunday in his office , along with Rosenstein .\nAccording to a senior Justice Department official , Barr 's chief of staff called White House lawyer Emmet Flood at 3 p.m. to give him a `` readout '' of the letter .\nMueller has not been at the Justice Department this weekend , and he `` was not consulted on this letter , '' according to the department .\nThe Justice Department is not giving a timeline as to when it may release additional material from the Mueller investigation , and it will review the report and materials for grand jury information and for information that could implicate ongoing investigations .\nCalls have been nearly universal and bipartisan for Mueller 's original report to be released and for the public or Congress to access its findings and its underlying source material .\nMany Republicans and Democrats agree that they will not be content only with a Barr-drafted synopsis of the report .\n`` It needs to be released to the Congress , and it needs to be released to the American people , '' Sen.
