    "content": "The most surprising aspect of the furor surrounding the infamous unsigned New York Times Op-Ed , ostensibly written by a member of the Trump administration , is that anyone believes its author is a senior official . Assuming this person isn \u2019 t an employee of the Times , and it is by no means unknown for the Gray Lady \u2019 s journalists to fabricate quotes and attribute them to anonymous \u201c officials , \u201d the author of this hit piece is at most a mid-level staffer . Indeed , if this character is actually employed in the Trump administration , it is almost certainly at a level of insignificance verging on invisibility .\nHow is it possible to be so sure ? First , the editors of the Times are virulently anti-Trump . Their assurances about the prominence of this furtive functionary simply can \u2019 t be trusted . Moreover , as Phelim McAleer at Townhall points out , the nation \u2019 s \u201c newspaper of record \u201d has a long history of exaggerating the seniority of officials it quotes anonymously . He highlights a lengthy anti-fracking article that purported to quote \u201c senior \u201d oil industry insiders and federal analysts describing the extraction process as a colossal scam . It was eventually discovered that all the quotes had in reality come from an intern .\nNot coincidentally , the solipsistic voice and callow perspective that \u201c Anonymous \u201d brings to the Op-Ed tends to undermine the claim that it was written by a high-ranking official in any administration . Most senior members of the Trump administration are over 50 years old and many are well beyond 60 . Yet , throughout the entire essay , there is an unmistakable thread of historical illiteracy and presentism that one would normally associate with a Millennial . This is evident in its very first sentence : \u201c President Trump is facing a test to his presidency unlike any faced by a modern American leader. \u201d Really ?\nThis means one of two things : Either \u201c Anonymous \u201d believes that the modern era began a couple of decades ago or that the Cold War , the Cuban Missile Crisis , the Vietnam War , the Watergate scandal , the OPEC Embargo , the Iran Hostage Crisis , the fall of the Soviet Union , the Clinton impeachment , the 9-11 attacks , and the Iraq War were all relatively minor events for the relevant presidential administrations . It strains credulity to the limit to suggest that a senior official of the Trump administration would compose the hopelessly na\u00efve sentence quoted above and permit it to be published in the New York Times .\nThe opening sentence isn \u2019 t the only indication that the author of the Op-Ed is a junior time server languishing in the bowels of the Eisenhower Office building . The piece consists primarily of shopworn clich\u00e9s that can be heard in any bar in any college town in America ( or on CNN if you \u2019 re stuck in an airport ) . This self-styled \u201c defender of our democratic institutions \u201d solemnly states that \u201c President Trump \u2019 s impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic , \u201d that he \u201c shows a preference for autocrats and dictators , \u201d that \u201c the country is bitterly divided , \u201d and that the \u201c root of the problem is the president \u2019 s amorality . \u201d\nNone of this is original . Nor is it accurate . But it does contain a revealing clich\u00e9 that serves as an indicator of the author \u2019 s lack of seniority \u2014 the tired trope concerning how Trump has bitterly divided the country . It \u2019 s only possible to believe this nonsense if you are too young to remember the deep divisions in public opinion over Vietnam , the Nuclear Freeze movement , the Clinton impeachment , and Iraq . It is not merely inaccurate to blame Trump for today \u2019 s political divisions , it \u2019 s also na\u00efve to believe that polarization is always bad . As David W. Brady and Hahrie Han wrote in the Washington Post in 2014 :\nAlthough many contemporary political observers decry polarization and yearn for an era of bipartisanship , the opposite was true in the immediate post-war era .

Nor would it be surprising that a relatively new presidential administration can be pretty chaotic . But the youthful hubris of our anonymous genius is such that it obscures the reality that Trump \u2019 s successes were actually accomplished by the President and his loyal aides : \u201c There are bright spots.\u2026 But these successes have come despite \u2014 not because of \u2014 the president \u2019 s leadership style. \u201d In other words , \u201c Anonymous \u201d has saved the nation from Trump \u2019 s \u201c misguided impulses. \u201d Mark Penn , a veteran of the Clinton administration , puts such delusions into perspective :\nAides have felt they know better than their leaders since Joseph and the Pharaoh.\u2026 Arriving from Arkansas , the Clintons were as alien to Washington as the Trumps .
