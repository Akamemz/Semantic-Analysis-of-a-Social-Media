    "content": "CNN star Van Jones has a habit of upsetting his fellow Black activists , progressive policy advocates , and liberal Democrats by cozying up to the Trump White House .\nHe did it again late last month , during the flap over a Black bird watcher in Central Park and a white Hillary Clinton voter who dialed 911 after refusing his pleas to leash her dog . Jones enraged Hillary loyalists\u2014already exasperated by his willingness to concede her flaws as a 2016 presidential candidate in televised food nights with Trump acolyte Kayleigh McEnany\u2014when he compared Clinton supporters unfavorably to the Klan .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not the racist white person who \u2019 s in the Ku Klux Klan that we have to worry about , \u201d Jones said on CNN \u2019 s New Day . \u201c It \u2019 s the white liberal Hillary Clinton supporter walking her dog in Central Park\u2026 But the minute she sees a Black man , who she does not respect , or has a slight thought against , she weaponized race like she had been trained by the Aryan Nation . \u201d\nMore recently , on June 16 , the 51-year-old Jones\u2014a Yale Law School-trained attorney and former green energy jobs adviser in the Obama administration\u2014provoked even more liberal distress and anger when he ladled praise on a so-called police reform initiative by President Donald Trump .\nJones went on CNN \u2019 s Inside Politics with John King and Anderson Cooper 360 to enthusiastically commend Trump \u2019 s executive order\u2014even as it was being criticized as cynical and unproductive by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and \u201c delusional \u201d by the Color of Change , an influential racial justice organization that Jones himself co-founded in 2005 .\nCNN viewers weren \u2019 t informed that he had actually participated in secret discussions with his new friend Jared Kushner on ways to frame the presidential project .\n\u201c In a tough situation Van has shown me that he \u2019 s got true character . He \u2019 s focused on the right things . \u201d \u2014 Jared Kushner to The \u2588\u2588\u2588\nAccording to a knowledgeable White House source , who expressed satisfaction that there were zero leaks , Jones and California human rights attorney Jessica Jackson , who runs # cut50 , a prison-reform group that Jones also founded , actively participated with law enforcement officials and White House staffers to help fashion the order and guide the politics of the discussion to what they considered \u201c the sweet spot \u201d between law enforcement and \u201c the reasonable middle \u201d and \u201c the reasonable left . \u201d\nSkyping from his Los Angeles home , with a biography of Nelson Mandela and a Black Panther graphic novel visible on the bookshelf behind him , Jones told viewers of CNN \u2019 s noon show Inside Politics : \u201c The executive order is a good thing , mainly because you saw the support of law enforcement there ... There is movement in the direction of a database for bad cops . We have never had a federal database for bad cops , that \u2019 s why all these cops go all over the place doing bad stuff\u2026 The chokeholds , that \u2019 s common ground now between Nancy Pelosi and Trump . Good stuff there . \u201d\nHours later , Jones doubled down on Anderson Cooper 360\u2014again without disclosing his role advising the Trump White House . \u201c What do you make of this executive order ? \u201d Cooper asked him .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s pushing in the right direction , \u201d Jones told the CNN anchor . \u201c What you got today is , I think , a sign that we are winning , \u201d he added . \u201c Donald Trump has put himself on record saying we need to reform the police department\u2026 We are winning ! Donald Trump had no plan a month ago to work on this issue at all . The fact that we are now in the direction of moving forward , I think , is good . \u201d\nAfter the publication of this story , Jones denied that he was involved in crafting the police reform order , tweeting : \u201c I have never been included in any meetings about police reform ( not by phone , zoom , nada ) . I didn \u2019 t know what was in the EO until the day it was released . \u201d\nJones additionally claimed the article was \u201c false \u201d because he hasn \u2019 t been to D.C. since before the coronavirus pandemic . \u201c The accusation that I attended White House meetings on police reform but failed to disclose them is doubly false , and it should be corrected , \u201d he wrote .\nBut the White House source with knowledge said that \u201c just recently , on the police reform executive order , Van and Jessica and the Reform Alliance , had been working with a lot of the families of people who had been killed by police officers , and we worked very closely with them on the EO . \u201d\nThe source added : \u201c On the EO , I would say he and Jessica were very helpful . \u201d\n\u201c Van worked with us on fashioning things , \u201d the source continued . \u201c Having Van \u2019 s and Jessica \u2019 s perspective , they knew where the crazy people on the left were , they knew where the reasonable people on the left were , and everywhere in between . And they were helpful in guiding us to a sweet spot where we were able to speak with law enforcement but also do something that a lot of reasonable people in the middle and the reasonable left thought was a major step forward . \u201d\nDuring a Rose Garden ceremony that was actually a Trump campaign event\u2014at which the president defended the police , touted his commitment to \u201c law and order , \u201d boasted about the stock market and the pre-coronavirus economy , and attacked Joe Biden\u2014Trump was flanked by uniformed officers and police union officials as he signed the executive order in response to the pandemic of unjustified killings of unarmed Black Americans by white cops .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was quick to call the event \u201c a photo op \u201d and the executive order \u201c seriously short of what is required \u201d ; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer panned it as \u201c weak tea \u201d and the Rev . Al Sharpton\u2014a longtime ally of Jones going back to the 1990s , when Jones was a self-avowed \u201c radical \u201d and social justice activist in Oakland\u2014derided it as \u201c toothless and meaningless \u201d because it gives lip service , but no legal mandate , to banning chokeholds ( unless officers decide their lives are at risk ) , improving police training , making use of mental health professionals , and keeping a national registry of bad cops .\n\u201c I did not think the executive order was worth the paper it was written on , \u201d Sharpton told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Van \u2019 s experiment with Trump is a case of him having more faith than I have , but I \u2019 m not going to attack him for doing it\u2026I think he \u2019 s well-intentioned , but I think he totally underestimates the kind of guy he \u2019 s dealing with . I just disagree that the people he \u2019 s dealing with have a sincere bone in their body . But I can \u2019 t fault him for trying . \u201d\nAmong Jones \u2019 many critics on the left , actor Jeffrey Wright was at once harsh and perceptive as he watched Jones compliment Trump \u2019 s policing initiative : \u201c Smells like Van Jones helped Kushner craft this exec order , so he touts it . \u2018 You ca n't polish this turd , \u2019 he said of Trump \u2019 s delinquency , yet here he is with boot black & rag , \u201d Wright tweeted .\n\u201c Jones \u2019 job appears to be making Republican policy palatable to black people . So expect him to call this new proposal progress , \u201d wrote Jones detractor Stephen A. Crockett Jr. , a columnist for The Root . Quoting Malcom X , Crockett added sarcastically : \u201c \u2018 Hey look , the knife went from being 9 inches in your back to being only 6 inches in your back , \u2019 ( Van Jones \u2019 voice ) . \u201d\nNeither Sherrilyn Ifill , president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund , nor Rashad Robinson , executive director of Color of Change , responded to interview requests . Jones , meanwhile , declined to speak to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 before publication of this story . A member of his public relations staff explained that \u201c due to his contractual obligations with CNN/Turner , he \u2019 s limited in what press he can do outside of their network . \u201d\nCNN , meanwhile , wouldn \u2019 t comment on the network \u2019 s failure to disclose Jones \u2019 s behind-the-scenes advisory role in shaping Trump \u2019 s executive order while offering accolades for an initiative he helped create .\nThe circumstance was similar in kind , if not in degree , to an infamous incident 40 years ago in which Washington Post columnist George F. Will praised Ronald Reagan \u2019 s debate performance against President Jimmy Carter without disclosing that Will had helped coach the then-Republican nominee in debate practice sessions .\n\u201c I find that in politics , people get in uncomfortable situations , and that \u2019 s when you get to see what a person \u2019 s character really is , \u201d Kushner told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 during a brief phone conversation . \u201c And in a tough situation Van has shown me that he \u2019 s got true character . He \u2019 s focused on the right things . \u201d\n\u201c [ Van ] Jones \u2019 job appears to be making Republican policy palatable to black people . \u201d \u2014 Stephen A. Crockett Jr. , columnist for The Root\nBy one knowledgeable account , it was CNN \u2019 s politics czar , Sam Feist , the network \u2019 s Washington bureau chief and senior vice president , who introduced Kushner to Jones ; at the time Jones was oscillating between making positive noises about Trump , who happens to be Kushner \u2019 s father-in-law , and trashing the new president .\n\u201c Donald Trump is a horrific jackass , \u201d Jones said during a February 2017 speech at John Jay College \u2019 s Center on Media , Crime and Justice . \u201c He \u2019 s one of the worst people ever born . He is . You can \u2019 t be any worse than him , unless you like chopping the heads off of small kittens every day . I don \u2019 t know what you could do to be worse . \u201d\nBarely a week later , Jones effusively praised a moment in Trump \u2019 s first State of the Union address when he led a lengthy standing ovation for the widow of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens\u2014who was killed in a botched and ill-planned military adventure in Yemen ( a failure for which Trump had typically blamed Barack Obama ) .\n\u201c He became president of the United States in that moment . Period , \u201d Jones claimed . \u201c [ T ] hat was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics . Period\u2026For people who had been hoping that he would become unifying , hoping that he might find some way to become presidential , they should be happy with that moment. \u201d ( In an interview last year with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Marlow Stern , Jones declared defiantly that he remains \u201c proud \u201d of that wildly hyperbolic and hardly prophetic assessment . )\nKushner\u2014who became interested in criminal justice and prison reform after his father , New Jersey real estate magnate Charles Kushner , was sent to the federal pen in 2005 for campaign finance violations , tax evasion , and witness tampering\u2014told CNN \u2019 s Feist that the White House was planning to roll out a criminal justice reform policy initiative and pleaded for fair coverage from CNN .\nFeist recommended that he speak to Jones , telling Kushner that the CNN personality was passionate about the issue .\n\u201c He was someone I \u2019 d seen on television , so I was deeply skeptical , \u201d Kushner told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c But I said I \u2019 d be happy to speak to him , and we had a good chat . And then we just started working together . And what I saw , with him , was that he had a lot of courage , when other people play politics . \u201d\nBy most accounts , Kushner and Jones became fast friends ; Jones has been an occasional dinner guest of Jared and Ivanka Trump at their mansion in Washington \u2019 s posh Kalorama neighborhood , and Kushner introduced Jones to Kim Kardashian West , a longtime pal\u2014along with her husband Kanye\u2014of Ivanka \u2019 s .\nIn May 2018 , Kardashian West had successfully lobbied Trump to pardon Alice Marie Johnson , a 63-year-old Black woman who had spent more than two decades in prison while serving a life sentence on nonviolent drug charges . In short order Jones\u2014 who beyond being a talented communicator is a world-class networker\u2014befriended the reality television star , encouraged her interest in prison reform and arranged for her to study law , with an eye toward taking the California bar exam , under the tutelage of # cut50 \u2019 s Jessica Jackson .\n\u201c I met Van several years ago and I \u2019 m honored to call him both a friend and mentor , \u201d Kardashian West told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 in a statement . \u201c I \u2019 ve seen firsthand his commitment to helping those in need and his dedication , as founder of The Dream Corps [ Jones \u2019 umbrella non-profit ] , to empowering the most vulnerable in our society . Van has encouraged my passion on prison reform and he \u2019 s one of the first people I call for advice . I will forever be inspired by Van \u2019 s selfless work . \u201d\nOver the years , Jones had made friends with a glittering list of celebrities , including Jay-Z , Rosario Dawson , and Prince ( a financial backer of Jones \u2019 s projects ; Jones shed tears during several television appearances memorializing the iconic rock star who died in April 2016 ) .\nJones also has counted among his pals Meghan McCain , Kayleigh McEnany , Mike Huckabee , and his former partners on CNN \u2019 s brief reboot of Crossfire in 2013 , former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the right-leaning yet Trump-loathing cable personality S.E . Cupp .\n\u201c Van is solution-oriented , \u201d Cupp told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c So he \u2019 s not all that interested in the politics of where that solution comes from , or even optics\u2026Very few of us in the pundit space can claim actual policy wings , so I think his willingness to hear anyone out is a virtue . \u201d\nIndeed , South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott , the Senate \u2019 s only Black Republican , consulted with Jones as he drafted police reform legislation , the so-called \u201c Justice Act , \u201d that Democratic critics have called woefully inadequate and effectively killed in the Senate .\n\u201c They did talk during the process of putting our police reform legislation together , \u201d Scott \u2019 s spokesperson emailed , \u201c and Van shared ideas for our team to consider . The JUSTICE Act was truly built up from bipartisan goals , and Van \u2019 s input was certainly a part of the process as we constructed the bill . \u201d\n\u201c I will forever be inspired by Van \u2019 s selfless work . \u201d \u2014 Kim Kardashian West to The \u2588\u2588\u2588\nSeveral associates of Jones , who asked not to be identified so they could speak freely , speculated to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Jones , a divorced father of two , is motivated as much by personal advancement , fame and access to power and money as by altruism .\nOne former colleague described a vehicle dubbed the \u201c Van Jones Media Machine , \u201d in which Jones owns and operates his own production company , Magic Labs Media LLC , writes books , gives paid speeches , and oversees an array of non-profits as chief executive of the REFORM Alliance , which Jones \u2019 s official bio describes as \u201c an initiative founded by Jay-Z , Meek Mill and six billionaires to transform the criminal justice system . \u201d\nFor the past three years , Jones \u2019 s media career has been managed by the Jay-Z-founded entertainment company , Roc Nation LLC . Apparently he has been doing well enough financially with all his entrepreneurial enterprises to give up his salary as president of Dream Corps , which paid him $ 209,469 in 2016 , $ 145,541 in 2017 and nothing in 2018 , according to the tax-exempt nonprofit \u2019 s public financial information .\nJones \u2019 s brief tenure in 2009 as special adviser on green jobs with Obama \u2019 s Council on Environmental Quality ended abruptly with his resignation after then-Fox News personality Glenn Beck relentlessly attacked him for his post-law school past as a radical leftist who honored Maoist ideology\u2014a phase Jones ultimately rejected to work within the mainstream political system .\nBeck probably did Jones a huge favor by making him a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre . Jones , by some accounts , had been frustrated at being a mere cog in the Obama White House , and was acutely annoyed that White House senior environmental adviser Brian Deese , a younger man who happened to be white , had more clout with the first Black president than Jones did . Deese , these days a managing director and global head of sustainable investing for the asset-management behemoth BlackRock , didn \u2019 t respond to a request for comment .\nIronically , Jones has enjoyed far greater access to Donald Trump and his most powerful adviser , Jared Kushner , than he ever did to Barack Obama and Obama \u2019 s top aides .\n\u201c He goes places where others fear to go , and he is crucified in many ways for the decisions that he makes , but understands that this work is the work of our Creator , \u201d said prison reform activist Topeka Sam , who met Jones at a Google event and began to work with him in 2016 after serving three years of a 10-year sentence on a federal non-violent drug conspiracy conviction . \u201c We have to work with each other in order to get things changed , and have a better and just society . \u201d\nYet Sam , too , initially resisted Jones \u2019 s invitation to join him in meetings at the Trump White House : \u201c When Van invited me to the White House , I did not go the first time because people said don \u2019 t go , you don \u2019 t work with this administration , and nothing \u2019 s going to come of it\u2026I didn \u2019 t go the first time because people I look up to told me , \u2018 Don \u2019 t go. \u2019 They told me it would hurt my career and any aspirations that I had of my own . \u201d\nSam ultimately rejected that advice and participated in a White House panel with Jones , Kushner , Jessica Jackson and others , and shared her insights about prison reform .\n\u201c For me , going into the Trump White House looked like the backyards of the families I lived next door to , \u201d said Sam , who grew up in the only black family in a suburban Long Island neighborhood . \u201c People might say , \u2018 that \u2019 s not my president , \u2019 but the reality is Donald Trump is the president of the United States . \u201d\nJones \u201c understands that when you \u2019 re going against the grain , you \u2019 re going to get pushback , you \u2019 re going to get attacked , \u201d she said . \u201c It unfortunately is the way of the world . \u201d\nNY1 anchor Errol Louis\u2014who talked with Jones about his upbringing and religious traditions during the John Jay College event at which Jones was honored as a Justice Trailblazer\u2014said his motivations are less complicated , and perhaps purer , than some would believe .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a Bible-believing Christian , \u201d Louis told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , citing Jones \u2019 speech in which he talked about his sheltered small-town childhood in Jackson , Tennessee , the son of educators ; he described himself as a bookish \u201c nerd \u201d who weighed 87 pounds and wore glasses ; his resolve to fight injustice , he told the audience , came from his experience of being bullied .\nHe never drank alcohol or did drugs , he said , and he was so shocked when he got to Yale and witnessed his law school classmates doing so much of both , among other things , that he phoned his grandmother\u2014because he was too afraid to talk about it with his strict and straitlaced father\u2014to ask what he should do about such rampant sinning .\nJones also noted the hypocrisy that allowed elite Yale students to engage in such activities with impunity , while Black kids in New Haven \u2019 s inner city were arrested and received harsh jail time for the same behavior .\nVan Jones is not a journalist , he \u2019 s an activist and advocate . He made no secret of working with the Trump White House and members of Congress to pass the criminal justice and prison reform legislation known as \u201c The First Step Act . \u201d\n\u201c The Messy Truth \u201d \u2014to use the title of one of the CNN programs that Jones has hosted over the years\u2014is that the cable outlet has repeatedly blurred the lines by placing him in journalistic roles , as when he grilled newsmakers and pop culture celebrities on The Van Jones Show , which ran every other Saturday night for 43 episodes on the cable outlet starting in January 2018 , or when he conducted a softball interview with Kushner at the CNN Citizen conference in October 2018 .\n\u201c Van Jones was a tremendously important ally in getting the First Step Act over the finish line and signed into law , \u201d New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries , a principal author of the law along with Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c During the process of trying to move the bill forward in the House , there were some in the progressive community who strongly disagreed with the effort to find common ground with the Trump administration because of inherent distrust of the president . \u201d\nJeffries noted that he and Jones , among others\u2014including such House Democrats as Reps. Karen Bass and Cedric Richmond\u2014 \u201c took a lot of criticism from some quarters on the left for being foolish enough to think that we could actually get something done . But we did . And at the end of the day , the legislation was supported by the ACLU and the Koch brothers , the NAACP and the Heritage Foundation . \u201d\nJeffries added : \u201c Van Jones worked the phones and talked to House Democrats . He \u2019 s particularly close to Keith Ellison and Tulsi Gabbard \u201d \u2014the former Minneapolis congressman , now Minnesota \u2019 s attorney general , and the Hawaii congresswoman , respectively , who were both dubious of the effort . \u201c He talked to them and helped facilitate their support , which was incredibly important , \u201d Jeffries said .\nGabbard , who has become an especially close friend and sat for an interview on The Van Jones Show , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 in a statement : \u201c Van is a deeply caring and compassionate person who is actually genuinely concerned about other people and the future of our country . He 's more concerned about helping people than the politics of who gets credit for helping them . \u201d\nKushner , for his part , said : \u201c We would not have been able to make this a bipartisan deal had it not been for Van . \u201d\n\u201c I think [ Van ] is well-intentioned [ to work with Trump ] , but I think he totally underestimates the kind of guy he \u2019 s dealing with . \u201d \u2014 Rev . Al Sharpton to The \u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u201c It was a step in the right direction , \u201d said Sharpton , who recalled , however , that when Jones encouraged him to attend the Oval Office signing ceremony , \u201c I said , \u2018 I \u2019 m not going to the White House with Donald Trump , \u2019 and Van said , \u2018 No , he won \u2019 t embarrass you , \u2019 and I said , \u2018 Why put yourself in that position ? \u2019 \u201d\nOn Dec. 21 , 2018 , Jones stood behind the Resolute Desk , amid a crowd of Republican and Democratic lawmakers along with Kushner and Ivanka Trump , for the bill signing ceremony .\nWhen the president called on him to speak , Jones delivered an impassioned sermon on the theme of freedom : \u201c In a country that is a democracy , we have the right to disagree\u2026.And where we disagree\u2014on immigration , on climate change , on foreign policy\u2014we should fight hard . But we have a responsibility\u2014where we do agree\u2014to work together hard\u2026And when you \u2019 re trying to help people on the bottom , sir , I will work with or against any Democrat , with or against any Republican , because there is nothing more important than freedom . So thank you , sir . \u201d\nSharpton recalled : \u201c True to form , two or three weeks later , Trump attacked Van and me . That \u2019 s Trump . You can \u2019 t trust Trump . He \u2019 s a con man . I \u2019 m not giving a photo op to Trump , and I \u2019 m not going to take back that I think he \u2019 s a racist . \u201d\nIn a stream-of-consciousness October 2019 speech to a sympathetic audience at a White House summit for young Black leadership , Trump trashed Sharpton\u2014 \u201c Al \u2019 s a con man , we all know that\u2026sort of a third-rate con guy \u201d \u2014and complained at meandering length that Jones , while listing various people who had helped pass criminal justice reform , had failed to credit and thank him for signing the First Step Act 10 months earlier .\n\u201c I kept waiting for my name , \u201d Trump told the group , adding that he called out to Melania as he watched Jones on TV , \u201c Darling come over here , I \u2019 m gon na have a great little name-mention\u2026He didn \u2019 t name me ! I \u2019 m the one that did it ! I called up Jared\u2014right , Jared ? \u2014and said what the hell is this ? \u201d\nTrump then recounted how Jones had called for his defeat in 2020 . \u201c And then he spoke to Jared and he apologized , didn \u2019 t he ? \u201d Trump claimed .\n\u201c But I don \u2019 t accept those apologies , \u201d the president said . \u201c Van Jones ! He \u2019 s another beauty . \u201d\nUPDATE : This story has been updated to include Jones \u2019 denial ; the phrase \u201c White House meetings \u201d has been replaced with \u201c discussions , \u201d to account for that denial . In addition , we have included further quotes on the role of Jones and his organization in the development of the police reform executive order , from the White House source with direct knowledge of the development of that document .",
    "content_original": "CNN star Van Jones has a habit of upsetting his fellow Black activists, progressive policy advocates, and liberal Democrats by cozying up to the Trump White House.\n\nHe did it again late last month, during the flap over a Black bird watcher in Central Park and a white Hillary Clinton voter who dialed 911 after refusing his pleas to leash her dog. Jones enraged Hillary loyalists\u2014already exasperated by his willingness to concede her flaws as a 2016 presidential candidate in televised food nights with Trump acolyte Kayleigh McEnany\u2014when he compared Clinton supporters unfavorably to the Klan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the racist white person who\u2019s in the Ku Klux Klan that we have to worry about,\u201d Jones said on CNN\u2019s New Day. \u201cIt\u2019s the white liberal Hillary Clinton supporter walking her dog in Central Park\u2026 But the minute she sees a Black man, who she does not respect, or has a slight thought against, she weaponized race like she had been trained by the Aryan Nation.\u201d\n\nMore recently, on June 16, the 51-year-old Jones\u2014a Yale Law School-trained attorney and former green energy jobs adviser in the Obama administration\u2014provoked even more liberal distress and anger when he ladled praise on a so-called police reform initiative by President Donald Trump.\n\nIn this instance, however, he was slyly applauding himself.\n\nJones went on CNN\u2019s Inside Politics with John King and Anderson Cooper 360 to enthusiastically commend Trump\u2019s executive order\u2014even as it was being criticized as cynical and unproductive by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and \u201cdelusional\u201d by the Color of Change, an influential racial justice organization that Jones himself co-founded in 2005.\n\nCNN viewers weren\u2019t informed that he had actually participated in secret discussions with his new friend Jared Kushner on ways to frame the presidential project.\n\n\u201c In a tough situation Van has shown me that he\u2019s got true character. He\u2019s focused on the right things. \u201d \u2014 Jared Kushner to The Daily Beast\n\nAccording to a knowledgeable White House source, who expressed satisfaction that there were zero leaks, Jones and California human rights attorney Jessica Jackson, who runs #cut50, a prison-reform group that Jones also founded, actively participated with law enforcement officials and White House staffers to help fashion the order and guide the politics of the discussion to what they considered \u201cthe sweet spot\u201d between law enforcement and \u201cthe reasonable middle\u201d and \u201cthe reasonable left.\u201d\n\nSkyping from his Los Angeles home, with a biography of Nelson Mandela and a Black Panther graphic novel visible on the bookshelf behind him, Jones told viewers of CNN\u2019s noon show Inside Politics: \u201cThe executive order is a good thing, mainly because you saw the support of law enforcement there... There is movement in the direction of a database for bad cops. We have never had a federal database for bad cops, that\u2019s why all these cops go all over the place doing bad stuff\u2026 The chokeholds, that\u2019s common ground now between Nancy Pelosi and Trump. Good stuff there.\u201d\n\nHours later, Jones doubled down on Anderson Cooper 360\u2014again without disclosing his role advising the Trump White House. \u201cWhat do you make of this executive order?\u201d Cooper asked him.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pushing in the right direction,\u201d Jones told the CNN anchor. \u201cWhat you got today is, I think, a sign that we are winning,\u201d he added. \u201cDonald Trump has put himself on record saying we need to reform the police department\u2026 We are winning! Donald Trump had no plan a month ago to work on this issue at all. The fact that we are now in the direction of moving forward, I think, is good.\u201d\n\nAfter the publication of this story, Jones denied that he was involved in crafting the police reform order, tweeting: \u201cI have never been included in any meetings about police reform (not by phone, zoom, nada). I didn\u2019t know what was in the EO until the day it was released.\u201d\n\nJones additionally claimed the article was \u201cfalse\u201d because he hasn\u2019t been to D.C. since before the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe accusation that I attended White House meetings on police reform but failed to disclose them is doubly false, and it should be corrected,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut the White House source with knowledge said that \u201cjust recently, on the police reform executive order, Van and Jessica and the Reform Alliance, had been working with a lot of the families of people who had been killed by police officers, and we worked very closely with them on the EO.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cOn the EO, I would say he and Jessica were very helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cVan worked with us on fashioning things,\u201d the source continued. \u201cHaving Van\u2019s and Jessica\u2019s perspective, they knew where the crazy people on the left were, they knew where the reasonable people on the left were, and everywhere in between. And they were helpful in guiding us to a sweet spot where we were able to speak with law enforcement but also do something that a lot of reasonable people in the middle and the reasonable left thought was a major step forward.\u201d\n\nDuring a Rose Garden ceremony that was actually a Trump campaign event\u2014at which the president defended the police, touted his commitment to \u201claw and order,\u201d boasted about the stock market and the pre-coronavirus economy, and attacked Joe Biden\u2014Trump was flanked by uniformed officers and police union officials as he signed the executive order in response to the pandemic of unjustified killings of unarmed Black Americans by white cops.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was quick to call the event \u201ca photo op\u201d and the executive order \u201cseriously short of what is required\u201d; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer panned it as \u201cweak tea\u201d and the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2014a longtime ally of Jones going back to the 1990s, when Jones was a self-avowed \u201cradical\u201d and social justice activist in Oakland\u2014derided it as \u201ctoothless and meaningless\u201d because it gives lip service, but no legal mandate, to banning chokeholds (unless officers decide their lives are at risk), improving police training, making use of mental health professionals, and keeping a national registry of bad cops.\n\n\u201cI did not think the executive order was worth the paper it was written on,\u201d Sharpton told The Daily Beast. \u201cVan\u2019s experiment with Trump is a case of him having more faith than I have, but I\u2019m not going to attack him for doing it\u2026I think he\u2019s well-intentioned, but I think he totally underestimates the kind of guy he\u2019s dealing with. I just disagree that the people he\u2019s dealing with have a sincere bone in their body. But I can\u2019t fault him for trying.\u201d\n\nAmong Jones\u2019 many critics on the left, actor Jeffrey Wright was at once harsh and perceptive as he watched Jones compliment Trump\u2019s policing initiative: \u201cSmells like Van Jones helped Kushner craft this exec order, so he touts it. \u2018You can't polish this turd,\u2019 he said of Trump\u2019s delinquency, yet here he is with boot black & rag,\u201d Wright tweeted.\n\n\u201cJones\u2019 job appears to be making Republican policy palatable to black people. So expect him to call this new proposal progress,\u201d wrote Jones detractor Stephen A. Crockett Jr., a columnist for The Root. Quoting Malcom X, Crockett added sarcastically: \u201c\u2018Hey look, the knife went from being 9 inches in your back to being only 6 inches in your back,\u2019 (Van Jones\u2019 voice).\u201d\n\nNeither Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, nor Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, responded to interview requests. Jones, meanwhile, declined to speak to The Daily Beast before publication of this story. A member of his public relations staff explained that \u201cdue to his contractual obligations with CNN/Turner, he\u2019s limited in what press he can do outside of their network.\u201d\n\nCNN, meanwhile, wouldn\u2019t comment on the network\u2019s failure to disclose Jones\u2019s behind-the-scenes advisory role in shaping Trump\u2019s executive order while offering accolades for an initiative he helped create.\n\nThe circumstance was similar in kind, if not in degree, to an infamous incident 40 years ago in which Washington Post columnist George F. Will praised Ronald Reagan\u2019s debate performance against President Jimmy Carter without disclosing that Will had helped coach the then-Republican nominee in debate practice sessions.\n\n\u201cI find that in politics, people get in uncomfortable situations, and that\u2019s when you get to see what a person\u2019s character really is,\u201d Kushner told The Daily Beast during a brief phone conversation. \u201cAnd in a tough situation Van has shown me that he\u2019s got true character. He\u2019s focused on the right things.\u201d\n\n\u201c [Van] Jones\u2019 job appears to be making Republican policy palatable to black people. \u201d \u2014 Stephen A. Crockett Jr., columnist for The Root\n\nBy one knowledgeable account, it was CNN\u2019s politics czar, Sam Feist, the network\u2019s Washington bureau chief and senior vice president, who introduced Kushner to Jones; at the time Jones was oscillating between making positive noises about Trump, who happens to be Kushner\u2019s father-in-law, and trashing the new president.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a horrific jackass,\u201d Jones said during a February 2017 speech at John Jay College\u2019s Center on Media, Crime and Justice. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the worst people ever born. He is. You can\u2019t be any worse than him, unless you like chopping the heads off of small kittens every day. I don\u2019t know what you could do to be worse.\u201d\n\nBarely a week later, Jones effusively praised a moment in Trump\u2019s first State of the Union address when he led a lengthy standing ovation for the widow of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens\u2014who was killed in a botched and ill-planned military adventure in Yemen (a failure for which Trump had typically blamed Barack Obama).\n\n\u201cHe became president of the United States in that moment. Period,\u201d Jones claimed. \u201c[T]hat was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics. Period\u2026For people who had been hoping that he would become unifying, hoping that he might find some way to become presidential, they should be happy with that moment.\u201d (In an interview last year with The Daily Beast\u2019s Marlow Stern, Jones declared defiantly that he remains \u201cproud\u201d of that wildly hyperbolic and hardly prophetic assessment.)\n\nKushner\u2014who became interested in criminal justice and prison reform after his father, New Jersey real estate magnate Charles Kushner, was sent to the federal pen in 2005 for campaign finance violations, tax evasion, and witness tampering\u2014told CNN\u2019s Feist that the White House was planning to roll out a criminal justice reform policy initiative and pleaded for fair coverage from CNN.\n\nFeist recommended that he speak to Jones, telling Kushner that the CNN personality was passionate about the issue.\n\n\u201cHe was someone I\u2019d seen on television, so I was deeply skeptical,\u201d Kushner told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut I said I\u2019d be happy to speak to him, and we had a good chat. And then we just started working together. And what I saw, with him, was that he had a lot of courage, when other people play politics.\u201d\n\nBy most accounts, Kushner and Jones became fast friends; Jones has been an occasional dinner guest of Jared and Ivanka Trump at their mansion in Washington\u2019s posh Kalorama neighborhood, and Kushner introduced Jones to Kim Kardashian West, a longtime pal\u2014along with her husband Kanye\u2014of Ivanka\u2019s.\n\nIn May 2018, Kardashian West had successfully lobbied Trump to pardon Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old Black woman who had spent more than two decades in prison while serving a life sentence on nonviolent drug charges. In short order Jones\u2014 who beyond being a talented communicator is a world-class networker\u2014befriended the reality television star, encouraged her interest in prison reform and arranged for her to study law, with an eye toward taking the California bar exam, under the tutelage of #cut50\u2019s Jessica Jackson.\n\n\u201cI met Van several years ago and I\u2019m honored to call him both a friend and mentor,\u201d Kardashian West told The Daily Beast in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve seen firsthand his commitment to helping those in need and his dedication, as founder of The Dream Corps [Jones\u2019 umbrella non-profit], to empowering the most vulnerable in our society. Van has encouraged my passion on prison reform and he\u2019s one of the first people I call for advice. I will forever be inspired by Van\u2019s selfless work.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Jones had made friends with a glittering list of celebrities, including Jay-Z, Rosario Dawson, and Prince (a financial backer of Jones\u2019s projects; Jones shed tears during several television appearances memorializing the iconic rock star who died in April 2016).\n\nJones also has counted among his pals Meghan McCain, Kayleigh McEnany, Mike Huckabee, and his former partners on CNN\u2019s brief reboot of Crossfire in 2013, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the right-leaning yet Trump-loathing cable personality S.E. Cupp.\n\n\u201cVan is solution-oriented,\u201d Cupp told The Daily Beast. \u201cSo he\u2019s not all that interested in the politics of where that solution comes from, or even optics\u2026Very few of us in the pundit space can claim actual policy wings, so I think his willingness to hear anyone out is a virtue.\u201d\n\nIndeed, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate\u2019s only Black Republican, consulted with Jones as he drafted police reform legislation, the so-called \u201cJustice Act,\u201d that Democratic critics have called woefully inadequate and effectively killed in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThey did talk during the process of putting our police reform legislation together,\u201d Scott\u2019s spokesperson emailed, \u201cand Van shared ideas for our team to consider. The JUSTICE Act was truly built up from bipartisan goals, and Van\u2019s input was certainly a part of the process as we constructed the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201c I will forever be inspired by Van\u2019s selfless work. \u201d \u2014 Kim Kardashian West to The Daily Beast\n\nSeveral associates of Jones, who asked not to be identified so they could speak freely, speculated to The Daily Beast that Jones, a divorced father of two, is motivated as much by personal advancement, fame and access to power and money as by altruism.\n\nOne former colleague described a vehicle dubbed the \u201cVan Jones Media Machine,\u201d in which Jones owns and operates his own production company, Magic Labs Media LLC, writes books, gives paid speeches, and oversees an array of non-profits as chief executive of the REFORM Alliance, which Jones\u2019s official bio describes as \u201can initiative founded by Jay-Z, Meek Mill and six billionaires to transform the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nFor the past three years, Jones\u2019s media career has been managed by the Jay-Z-founded entertainment company, Roc Nation LLC. Apparently he has been doing well enough financially with all his entrepreneurial enterprises to give up his salary as president of Dream Corps, which paid him $209,469 in 2016, $145,541 in 2017 and nothing in 2018, according to the tax-exempt nonprofit\u2019s public financial information.\n\nJones\u2019s brief tenure in 2009 as special adviser on green jobs with Obama\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality ended abruptly with his resignation after then-Fox News personality Glenn Beck relentlessly attacked him for his post-law school past as a radical leftist who honored Maoist ideology\u2014a phase Jones ultimately rejected to work within the mainstream political system.\n\nBeck probably did Jones a huge favor by making him a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre . Jones, by some accounts, had been frustrated at being a mere cog in the Obama White House, and was acutely annoyed that White House senior environmental adviser Brian Deese, a younger man who happened to be white, had more clout with the first Black president than Jones did. Deese, these days a managing director and global head of sustainable investing for the asset-management behemoth BlackRock, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIronically, Jones has enjoyed far greater access to Donald Trump and his most powerful adviser, Jared Kushner, than he ever did to Barack Obama and Obama\u2019s top aides.\n\n\u201cHe goes places where others fear to go, and he is crucified in many ways for the decisions that he makes, but understands that this work is the work of our Creator,\u201d said prison reform activist Topeka Sam, who met Jones at a Google event and began to work with him in 2016 after serving three years of a 10-year sentence on a federal non-violent drug conspiracy conviction. \u201cWe have to work with each other in order to get things changed, and have a better and just society.\u201d\n\nYet Sam, too, initially resisted Jones\u2019s invitation to join him in meetings at the Trump White House: \u201cWhen Van invited me to the White House, I did not go the first time because people said don\u2019t go, you don\u2019t work with this administration, and nothing\u2019s going to come of it\u2026I didn\u2019t go the first time because people I look up to told me, \u2018Don\u2019t go.\u2019 They told me it would hurt my career and any aspirations that I had of my own.\u201d\n\nSam ultimately rejected that advice and participated in a White House panel with Jones, Kushner, Jessica Jackson and others, and shared her insights about prison reform.\n\n\u201cFor me, going into the Trump White House looked like the backyards of the families I lived next door to,\u201d said Sam, who grew up in the only black family in a suburban Long Island neighborhood. \u201cPeople might say, \u2018that\u2019s not my president,\u2019 but the reality is Donald Trump is the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nJones \u201cunderstands that when you\u2019re going against the grain, you\u2019re going to get pushback, you\u2019re going to get attacked,\u201d she said. \u201cIt unfortunately is the way of the world.\u201d\n\nNY1 anchor Errol Louis\u2014who talked with Jones about his upbringing and religious traditions during the John Jay College event at which Jones was honored as a Justice Trailblazer\u2014said his motivations are less complicated, and perhaps purer, than some would believe.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Bible-believing Christian,\u201d Louis told The Daily Beast, citing Jones\u2019 speech in which he talked about his sheltered small-town childhood in Jackson, Tennessee, the son of educators; he described himself as a bookish \u201cnerd\u201d who weighed 87 pounds and wore glasses; his resolve to fight injustice, he told the audience, came from his experience of being bullied.\n\nHe never drank alcohol or did drugs, he said, and he was so shocked when he got to Yale and witnessed his law school classmates doing so much of both, among other things, that he phoned his grandmother\u2014because he was too afraid to talk about it with his strict and straitlaced father\u2014to ask what he should do about such rampant sinning.\n\nShe said \u201cpray,\u201d Jones recounted.\n\nJones also noted the hypocrisy that allowed elite Yale students to engage in such activities with impunity, while Black kids in New Haven\u2019s inner city were arrested and received harsh jail time for the same behavior.\n\nVan Jones is not a journalist, he\u2019s an activist and advocate. He made no secret of working with the Trump White House and members of Congress to pass the criminal justice and prison reform legislation known as \u201cThe First Step Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Messy Truth\u201d\u2014to use the title of one of the CNN programs that Jones has hosted over the years\u2014is that the cable outlet has repeatedly blurred the lines by placing him in journalistic roles, as when he grilled newsmakers and pop culture celebrities on The Van Jones Show, which ran every other Saturday night for 43 episodes on the cable outlet starting in January 2018, or when he conducted a softball interview with Kushner at the CNN Citizen conference in October 2018.\n\n\u201cVan Jones was a tremendously important ally in getting the First Step Act over the finish line and signed into law,\u201d New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a principal author of the law along with Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins, told The Daily Beast. \u201cDuring the process of trying to move the bill forward in the House, there were some in the progressive community who strongly disagreed with the effort to find common ground with the Trump administration because of inherent distrust of the president.\u201d\n\nJeffries noted that he and Jones, among others\u2014including such House Democrats as Reps. Karen Bass and Cedric Richmond\u2014\u201ctook a lot of criticism from some quarters on the left for being foolish enough to think that we could actually get something done. But we did. And at the end of the day, the legislation was supported by the ACLU and the Koch brothers, the NAACP and the Heritage Foundation.\u201d\n\nJeffries added: \u201cVan Jones worked the phones and talked to House Democrats. He\u2019s particularly close to Keith Ellison and Tulsi Gabbard\u201d\u2014the former Minneapolis congressman, now Minnesota\u2019s attorney general, and the Hawaii congresswoman, respectively, who were both dubious of the effort. \u201cHe talked to them and helped facilitate their support, which was incredibly important,\u201d Jeffries said.\n\nGabbard, who has become an especially close friend and sat for an interview on The Van Jones Show, told The Daily Beast in a statement: \u201cVan is a deeply caring and compassionate person who is actually genuinely concerned about other people and the future of our country. He's more concerned about helping people than the politics of who gets credit for helping them.\u201d\n\nKushner, for his part, said: \u201cWe would not have been able to make this a bipartisan deal had it not been for Van.\u201d\n\n\u201c I think [Van] is well-intentioned [to work with Trump], but I think he totally underestimates the kind of guy he\u2019s dealing with. \u201d \u2014 Rev. Al Sharpton to The Daily Beast\n\n\u201cIt was a step in the right direction,\u201d said Sharpton, who recalled, however, that when Jones encouraged him to attend the Oval Office signing ceremony, \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to the White House with Donald Trump,\u2019 and Van said, \u2018No, he won\u2019t embarrass you,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Why put yourself in that position?\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 21, 2018, Jones stood behind the Resolute Desk, amid a crowd of Republican and Democratic lawmakers along with Kushner and Ivanka Trump, for the bill signing ceremony.\n\nWhen the president called on him to speak, Jones delivered an impassioned sermon on the theme of freedom: \u201cIn a country that is a democracy, we have the right to disagree\u2026.And where we disagree\u2014on immigration, on climate change, on foreign policy\u2014we should fight hard. But we have a responsibility\u2014where we do agree\u2014to work together hard\u2026And when you\u2019re trying to help people on the bottom, sir, I will work with or against any Democrat, with or against any Republican, because there is nothing more important than freedom. So thank you, sir.\u201d\n\nSharpton recalled: \u201cTrue to form, two or three weeks later, Trump attacked Van and me. That\u2019s Trump. You can\u2019t trust Trump. He\u2019s a con man. I\u2019m not giving a photo op to Trump, and I\u2019m not going to take back that I think he\u2019s a racist.\u201d\n\nIn a stream-of-consciousness October 2019 speech to a sympathetic audience at a White House summit for young Black leadership, Trump trashed Sharpton\u2014\u201cAl\u2019s a con man, we all know that\u2026sort of a third-rate con guy\u201d\u2014and complained at meandering length that Jones, while listing various people who had helped pass criminal justice reform, had failed to credit and thank him for signing the First Step Act 10 months earlier.\n\n\u201cI kept waiting for my name,\u201d Trump told the group, adding that he called out to Melania as he watched Jones on TV, \u201cDarling come over here, I\u2019m gonna have a great little name-mention\u2026He didn\u2019t name me! I\u2019m the one that did it! I called up Jared\u2014right, Jared?\u2014and said what the hell is this?\u201d\n\nTrump then recounted how Jones had called for his defeat in 2020. \u201cAnd then he spoke to Jared and he apologized, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Trump claimed.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t accept those apologies,\u201d the president said. \u201cVan Jones! He\u2019s another beauty.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: This story has been updated to include Jones\u2019 denial; the phrase \u201cWhite House meetings\u201d has been replaced with \u201cdiscussions,\u201d to account for that denial. In addition, we have included further quotes on the role of Jones and his organization in the development of the police reform executive order, from the White House source with direct knowledge of the development of that document.",
