Read Part 1 HERE .\nPart 1 developed the following : Hillary \u2019 s campaign , lax on cybersecurity and working with the DNC to make sure Sanders did not have a chance of winning , invited multiple attacks from both hackers on the outside and from leakers on the inside .\nPart 2 makes clear the multiple hacks and multiple leaks that plagued Hillary \u2019 s 2016 presidential campaign came from multiple sources .\nThe breakthrough in this series of articles is the attempt to apply intelligence analytical techniques to sort out the various known cybersecurity attacks on the Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign to determine the rogue agent responsible for each separate known cybersecurity attack .\nWASHINGTON , D.C. \u2013 Hillary \u2019 s 2016 presidential campaign was hit by so many hack attacks and so many leaks , the CSI problem is almost impossible to decipher .\nBy election day , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s electronic campaign began to resemble a corpse killed by multiple gunshot wounds .\nThe pattern of wounds upon wounds evident in the corpse were so combined and so confused , it is today hard to tell \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 how precisely many shooters there were or who fired the fatal round .\nTo sort this out , we begin with the first hack attack on Clinton emails , the hack that began with Guccifer in March 2013 .\nIn March 2013 , a Romanian hacker Marcel Lazar , who went by the username \u201c Guccifer , \u201d a combination of \u201c Gucci \u201d and \u201c Lucifer , \u201d shocked the world by the revelation Hillary Clinton had utilized a private email server while secretary of state .\nOn March 15 , 2013 , the Smoking Gun broke the story , disclosing that Guccifer had spent the past several months \u201c breaking into the e-mail accounts of family , friends , and political allies of the Bush family , \u201d only to \u201c cross party lines \u201d and illegally access the AOL account of a former senior White House advisor to former President Bill Clinton , then 64-year-old Sidney Blumenthal , a longtime confident of Hillary Clinton .\nGuccifer entertained himself by reading the cache of Blumenthal emails that went back to 2005 , with emails sent to \u201c an array of Washington insiders , including political operatives , journalists , and government officials . \u201d\nWhen he realized some of the emails between Blumenthal and Hillary involved an email address Hillary used , [ email protected ] \u2014 causing Guccifer a \u201c WOW \u201d moment when he realized the initials matched Clinton \u2019 s maiden name , Hillary Diane Rodham \u2013 and the email address \u201c clintonemail.com \u201d revealed the use of a private , unsecured email server .\nDuring an interview given in Romania in 2015 , Guccifer then in prison commented to a reporter that he accessed in Hillary \u2019 s hacked emails memos that Clinton got as secretary of state , with CIA briefings attached .\n\u201c I used to read her memos for six or seven hours then I \u2019 d get up and do the gardening in the yard , \u201d Guccifer said .\nGuccifer never published a trove of Clinton emails , tending to be more malicious than politically motivated , as demonstrated in March 2013 , when he hacked Colin Powell \u2019 s AOL email account and defaced Powell \u2019 s Facebook page with an anti-Bush diatribe .\nIn June 2013 , after Clinton had left office as secretary of state , the private server was moved from the Clintons \u2019 Chappaqua home to a data center in northern New Jersey , where it was maintained by Platte River Networks in Denver ; in early 2014 , Platte River Network staff uploads Hillary \u2019 s emails to a Gmail account and then transfers them over to a Platte River Network server .\nThat Hillary had used a private server at the State Department was largely ignored until the New York Times ran a front page article on March 2 , 2015 , reporting that Clinton had turned over 55,000 pages of emails from her personal server to comply with federal record-keeping practices as required by the Federal Records Act .\nIn the period March 25-31 , 2015 , Platte River Staff member Paul Combetta realized he forgot to wipe Hillary \u2019 s email archive from the Platte River Network server , as he had been advised to do by Hillary aide Monica Hanley the previous December .\nNow desperate , Combetta decided to use BleachBit software to wipe Hillary \u2019 s emails from the Platte River Network server , despite a subpoena Hillary received from the House Select Committee on Benghazi on March 4 , 2015 , instructing Clinton to preserve and deliver all emails from her personal servers .\nThe thousands of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s State Department emails that have been made public have resulted not from Guccifer \u2019 s hacking efforts in 2013 , or from the private email server Pagliano set up for Clinton in Chappaqua , or from the Platte River Network server ) to which Hillary \u2019 s State Department-era emails were transferred .\nAll Hillary Clinton emails from her term as Secretary of State that are public today have come either from Judicial Watch FOIA requests , or from various subpoenas Clinton was issued in Congressional investigations .\nThe Clinton emails that have been made public were archived as they were being released on the Judicial Watch website and on the U.S. Department of State website .\nGuccifer was arrested in Romania on Jan. 22 , 2014 , and convicted to four years in prison , where he remained until he was extradited to the United States in March 2016 to face U.S. federal criminal charges .\nOn Sept. 1 , 2016 , a U.S. district judge in Alexandria , Virginia , sentenced Guccifer to four years in federal prison , after he pleaded guilty to one count each of aggravated identity theft and unauthorized access to a protected computer .\nWhat this timeline makes clear is that the Podesta emails dating through May 25 , 2015 , published by WikiLeaks starting in October 2016 , could not possibly have resulted from Guccifer \u2019 s 2013 hacking efforts , if only because Guccifer/Marcel Lazar has been in prison non-stop since he was arrested in Romania in January 2014 .\nIt should also be clear that the source of the Podesta emails published by WikiLeaks in October 2016 could not have resulted from someone hacking the Pagliano server .\nThe Pagliano server remained unplugged in storage in New Jersey from June 2013 until the FBI seized it in August 2015 .\nIn late-March 2015 , the Platte River Network servers were scrubbed of all Hillary emails making it impossible for Podesta emails dated in May 2015 to have been hacked from that source .\nOn June 14 , 2016 , the Washington Post reported Russian government hackers had penetrated the DNC computer network , gaining access to the entire database of opposition research on GOP candidates \u2013 an article that cited unnamed \u201c U.S . officials \u201d who claimed the intrusion into the DNC was one of several targeting \u201c American political organizations , \u201d including the computer networks of the Clinton and the Trump campaign \u201c targeted by Russian spies , \u201d as well as computers of various GOP PACs .\n\u201c I completely rule out a possibility that the ( Russian ) government or the government bodies have been involved in this , \u201d Dmitry Peskov , the Kremlin spokesman told Reuters in Moscow , on the same date .\nThe next day , June 15 , 2016 , cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike , Inc. posted a notice on its website that two separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries began hacking DNC computers in May 2016 .\nThe CrowdStrike posting noted that on June 15 , 2016 , a blog post to a WordPress site \u201c authored by an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 \u201d claimed credit for breaching the DNC .\n\u201c Whether or not this posting is part of a Russian Intelligence disinformation campaign , we are exploring the documents \u2019 authenticity and origin , \u201d CrowdStrike commented .\n\u201c Regardless , these claims do nothing to lessen our findings relating to the Russian government \u2019 s involvement , portions of which we have documented for the public and the greater security community , \u201d CrowdStrike concluded .\nIn the June 15 , 2016 posting on WordPress , Guccifer 2.0 revealed he had advance warning of the CrowdStrike conclusions ready to be posted the next day .\n\u201c Worldwide known cyber security company CrowdStrike announced that the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) servers had been hacked by \u2018 sophisticated \u2019 hacker groups , \u201d Guccifer 2.0 wrote under the heading \u201c DNC \u2019 s Servers Hacked by Lone Hacker . \u201d\nGuccifer 2.0 bragged that hacking the DNC \u2019 s servers was \u201c easy , very easy . \u201d\n\u201c Guccifer ( Marcel Lazar ) may have been the first one who penetrated Hillary Clinton \u2019 s and other Democrats \u2019 mail servers , \u201d Guccifer 2.0 noted . \u201c But he certainly wasn \u2019 t the last . No wonder any other hacker could easily get access to the DNC \u2019 s servers . \u201d\nThen Guccifer 2.0 bragged : \u201c Shame on CrowdStrike : Do you think I \u2019 ve been in the DNC \u2019 s networks for almost a year and saved only 2 documents ? Do you really believe it ? Here are just a few docs from the many thousands I extracted when hacking into the DNC \u2019 s networks . \u201d\nOn June 15 , 2016 , Guccifer 2.0 published on WordPress an opposition research report the DNC wrote on Donald Trump , marked \u201c Confidential , \u201d and dated Dec. 19 , 2015 ; several pages of donor lists , suggesting Guccifer 2.0 may have breached the NGP database ; but no emails .\nGuccifer 2.0 claimed he sent the main part of the hacked documents , \u201c thousands of files and mails , \u201d to WikiLeaks , bragging that WikiLeaks \u201c will publish them soon . \u201d\nFrom June 15 , 2015 , through Oct. 18 , 2016 , Guccifer 2.0 published a series of documents , making it clear he had extensive access to DNC internal memorandums and donor lists .\nBut what was missing in the Guccifer 2.0 publication of DNC hacked documents were emails , suggesting Guccifer 2.0 had not penetrated the DNC email server , or the private email archives of John Podesta and other Clinton campaign officials .\nAlso absent from the Guccifer 2.0 publications of DNC hacked documents were any documents prepared by the Clinton campaign .\nThe Guccifer 2.0 controversy flared again when the Wall Street Journal published on May 25 , 2017 , published an article claiming Guccifer 2.0 had sent Aaron Nevins , a GOP Republican consultant in Florida , 2.5 gigabytes of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( housed in the same building with the DNC ) documents , some of which Nevins published on a blog HelloFLA.com that Nevins ran using a pseudonym .\nNevins told the Wall Street Journal he set up a Dropbox account \u201c so whoever was using the Guccifer 2.0 name could send large amounts of material . \u201d\nThis episode confirms that Guccifer 2.0 had hacked only the DNC computers , the donor data in the VAN computer servers in Massachusetts , and the data in the NPG computer servers in Washington .\nGuccifer 2.0 confirms this in a post to his WordPress site posted on Jan. 12 , 2017 , in which Guccifer 2.0 wrote the following : \u201c I already explained at The Future of Cyber Security Europe conference that took place in London in last September , I had used a different way to breach into the DNC network . I found a vulnerability in the NGP VAN software installed in the DNC system . \u201d\nNote also that Guccifer 2.0 is a different person than the first Guccifer , Marcel Lazar , whose hacking capabilities have been severely limited during his continuing imprisonment that began with his arrest in Romania in January 2014 .\nGive that the WikiLeaks publication of hacked documents that began in October 2016 \u2013 the hacked document dump the Clinton campaign , the FBI , and the U.S. intelligence agencies want to blame on Russia \u2013 consists almost entirely of emails from Podesta and others related to the Clinton campaign and/or the Clinton Foundation , it is extremely unlikely Guccifer 2.0 was the source , regardless how many assertions U.S. intelligence makes that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian agent \u2013 something Guccifer 2.0 continues to deny .\nThe CrowdStrike post dated June 15 , 2016 , explained their experts had identified the \u201c sophisticated adversaries \u201d attacking the DNC computers as \u201c Cozy Bear \u201d and \u201c Fancy Bear \u201d \u2013 both identified by CrowdStrike as \u201c Russian-based . \u201d\nOn Jan. 6 , 2017 , the office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report entitled , \u201c Background to \u2018 Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections \u2019 : The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution . \u201d\nThis report concluded \u201c with high confidence \u201d that Russian military intelligence \u201c used the Guccifer 2.0 persona \u201d to release the Podesta files to WikiLeaks , but the report also admitted the identification of the origin of a cybersecurity attack was \u201c difficult \u201d based only on \u201c tradecraft \u201d that relies on circumstantial evidence at best , presuming a hacker leaves a signature , such that cyberattacks like \u201c Cozy Bear \u201d and \u201c Fancy Bear \u201d can be reliably be attributed to Russian intelligence operatives .\nOn March 7 , 2017 , WikiLeaks released 8,761 documents on the CIA \u2019 s \u201c global covert hacking program \u201d that included documents from a project called \u201c Umbrage \u201d proving the CIA could launch \u201c false flag \u201d cyberattacks and make them look as if they originated from other countries , such as Russia .\n\u201c The CIA \u2019 s Remote Devices Branch \u2019 s UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques \u2018 stolen \u2019 from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation , \u201d WikiLeaks noted .\n\u201c When UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA can not only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the \u2018 fingerprints \u2019 of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from , \u201d WikiLeaks continued .\nIn December 2016 , after Clinton had lost the election , John Podesta said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d that the first time he was contacted by the FBI was two days after Oct. 7 , 2016 , the date WikiLeaks started dropping his emails .\nIf the FBI had no reason to believe the then-known hacks of Clinton \u2019 s private email server and the DNC had also breached Podesta \u2019 s email files until after WikiLeaks began publishing Podesta \u2019 s emails , this strongly suggests the person who leaked Podesta \u2019 s emails was not Guccifer , Guccifer 2.0 , \u201c Cozy Bear , \u201d or \u201c Fancy Bear , \u201d but a separate and distinct incident , likely carried off by someone not previously identified .\nYet , to date , the U.S. intelligence agencies have insisted on lumping together all hacks of the Democrats during the 2016 presidential , blaming the Russians for every hacking incident , regardless of the content released by the hack or the target data source known to have been hacked .\nWhat seems likely is the FBI had no idea Podesta emails had been hacked ( or leaked ) until WikiLeaks started publishing them .\nYet , despite this intelligence failure , U.S. intelligence agencies took their fallback position , concluding the Russians must have hacked Podesta \u2019 s emails too .\nOn Dec. 30 , 2016 , after the presidential election was over , then-President Obama took a step to implant the \u201c Russian interference \u201d meme into the U.S. mainstream media , by expelling 35 Russians from the United States and ordered sweeping new sanctions as retaliation , stressing that U.S. intelligence services believe Russia had ordered cyberattacks on the DNC .\nInterestingly , there was an earlier expulsion of Russian diplomats during the 2016 presidential convention .\nOn July 8 , 2016 , the Obama administration expelled two Russian diplomats from the United States supposedly in retaliation for a Russian police guard who had tackled a U.S. diplomat outside the American Embassy in Moscow in a scuffle that was captured on security footage and broadcast on Russian television .\nAnonymous , in a video released May 24 , 2015 , provides an alternative explanation why these two diplomats were expelled .\nAnonymous claimed Mikhail Fradkov , the head of Russia \u2019 s SVR intelligence agency from Oct. 6 , 2006 to Oct. 5 , 2016 , authorized an emergency contact with the U.S. State Department on July 7 , 2016 , to reveal the details of Seth Rich \u2019 s breach of Podesta \u2019 s emails and the subsequent danger to his life , only to find themselves expelled immediately .\nFox News host Sean Hannity got suspended over the Memorial Day holiday following a series of broadcasts beginning March 12 , 2017 , in which Hannity appeared to be advancing what is being termed the \u201c WikiLeaks \u2019 conspiracy theory . \u201d\nThis theory suggests U.S. intelligence agencies hacked Hillary \u2019 s email server , the DNC , the VGP-VAN database , and Podesta \u2019 s emails , in a \u201c false flag \u201d that used tradecraft leaving cyberattack \u201c fingerprints \u201d that traced back to the Russians .\nOn the broadcast March 12 , 2017 , two former U.S. intelligence operatives , Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer and former NSA official William Binney , told Hannity that retired NSA intelligence officers were responsible for hacking the DNC .\n\u201c Sean , we did it [ hack the DNC ] , not me , but our guys\u2014former members of NSA , retired intelligence officers used these tools to break in there and get the information out . That \u2019 s what the Democrats don \u2019 t want to talk about because it doesn \u2019 t fit their narrative , \u201d Shaffer explained .\nThe U.S. Intelligence agencies have assumed the Russian government hacked the Democrats because Vladimir Putin wanted Donald Trump to win .\nBut there is well-documented proof the Russians had been paying Hillary Clinton through the Clinton Foundation for her decision as secretary of state to support the Frank Giustra ploy that resulted in Russia getting control of 20 percent of the uranium in the United States , while Russia was using a shell company in the Netherlands to pay Podesta in stock for supporting the \u201c technology transfer \u201d to Russia the Obama administration had authorized under Secretary Clinton \u2019 s \u201c reset \u201d initiative .\nHow would Russia know in advance that hacking Hillary , Podesta , and the DNC would turn up sufficiently damaging documentary evidence to throw the election for Trump ?\nWhy would Putin want Trump to be president , when the Russians had invested millions during the Obama administration to establish their blackmail potential to control the actions of both Clinton and Podesta , starting the minute Hillary took the oath of office as president of the United States ?\nDespite all the U.S. intelligence and Democratic Party hoopla , the fact remains there is no irrefutable proof the Russians hacked Hillary Clinton or the DNC during the 2016 presidential campaign , nor is there any proof the Russians accessed John Podesta \u2019 s email account .\nSo far , the \u201c Russian Collusion \u201d meme implicating Trump in a supposed Russian hacking scheme is nothing more than a lame Clinton excuse for losing .\nIn the final analysis , if Hillary and the DNC had not conspired to steal the nomination from Sanders , and if Podesta \u2019 s emails were not so filled with dark brooding and scheming ( often aimed at HRC herself ) , it would not have mattered their documents were hacked , leaked , and published .\nThe dark , dirty truth is that Hillary Clinton could not sustain the revelation to the American people of the truth Podesta and the DNC spoke in private , almost every day , as they schemed to put Hillary in the White House .\nHillary even today refuses to acknowledge the problems that continue to dog her White House ambitions , ranging from Benghazi , to the Clinton Foundation , to her handling of classified material transmitted over her private email server , to name just a few .",

Russian government hackers had penetrated the DNC computer network, gaining access to the entire database of opposition research on GOP candidates \u2013 an article that cited unnamed \u201cU.S. officials\u201d who claimed the intrusion into the DNC was one of several targeting \u201cAmerican political organizations,\u201d including the computer networks of the Clinton and the Trump campaign \u201ctargeted by Russian spies,\u201d as well as computers of various GOP PACs.\n\n\u201cI completely rule out a possibility that the(Russian) government or the government bodies have been involved in this,\u201d Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman told Reuters in Moscow, on the same date.\n\nThe next day, June 15, 2016, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, Inc. posted a notice on its website that two separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries began hacking DNC computers in May 2016.\n\nThe CrowdStrike posting noted that on June 15, 2016, a blog post to a WordPress site \u201cauthored by an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0\u201d claimed credit for breaching the DNC.\n\n\u201cWhether or not this posting is part of a Russian Intelligence disinformation campaign, we are exploring the documents\u2019 authenticity and origin,\u201d CrowdStrike commented.\n\n\u201cRegardless, these claims do nothing to lessen our findings relating to the Russian government\u2019s involvement, portions of which we have documented for the public and the greater security community,\u201d CrowdStrike concluded.\n\nIn the June 15, 2016 posting on WordPress, Guccifer 2.0 revealed he had advance warning of the CrowdStrike conclusions ready to be posted the next day.\n\n\u201cWorldwide known cyber security company CrowdStrike announced that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) servers had been hacked by \u2018sophisticated\u2019 hacker groups,\u201d Guccifer 2.0 wrote under the heading \u201cDNC\u2019s Servers Hacked by Lone Hacker.\u201d\n\nGuccifer 2.0 bragged that hacking the DNC\u2019s servers was \u201ceasy, very easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuccifer (Marcel Lazar) may have been the first one who penetrated Hillary Clinton\u2019s and other Democrats\u2019 mail servers,\u201d Guccifer 2.0 noted. \u201cBut he certainly wasn\u2019t the last. No wonder any other hacker could easily get access to the DNC\u2019s servers.\u201d\n\nThen Guccifer 2.0 bragged: \u201cShame on CrowdStrike: Do you think I\u2019ve been in the DNC\u2019s networks for almost a year and saved only 2 documents? Do you really believe it? Here are just a few docs from the many thousands I extracted when hacking into the DNC\u2019s networks.\u201d\n\nOn June 15, 2016, Guccifer 2.0 published on WordPress an opposition research report the DNC wrote on Donald Trump, marked \u201cConfidential,\u201d and dated Dec. 19, 2015; several pages of donor lists, suggesting Guccifer 2.0 may have breached the NGP database; but no emails.\n\nGuccifer 2.0 claimed he sent the main part of the hacked documents, \u201cthousands of files and mails,\u201d to WikiLeaks, bragging that WikiLeaks \u201cwill publish them soon.\u201d\n\nFrom June 15, 2015, through Oct. 18, 2016, Guccifer 2.0 published a series of documents, making it clear he had extensive access to DNC internal memorandums and donor lists.\n\nBut what was missing in the Guccifer 2.0 publication of DNC hacked documents were emails, suggesting Guccifer 2.0 had not penetrated the DNC email server, or the private email archives of John Podesta and other Clinton campaign officials.\n\nAlso absent from the Guccifer 2.0 publications of DNC hacked documents were any documents prepared by the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe Guccifer 2.0 controversy flared again when the Wall Street Journal published on May 25, 2017, published an article claiming Guccifer 2.0 had sent Aaron Nevins, a GOP Republican consultant in Florida, 2.5 gigabytes of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (housed in the same building with the DNC) documents, some of which Nevins published on a blog HelloFLA.com that Nevins ran using a pseudonym.\n\nNevins told the Wall Street Journal he set up a Dropbox account \u201cso whoever was using the Guccifer 2.0 name could send large amounts of material.\u201d\n\nThis episode confirms that Guccifer 2.0 had hacked only the DNC computers, the donor data in the VAN computer servers in Massachusetts, and the data in the NPG computer servers in Washington.\n\nGuccifer 2.0 confirms this in a post to his WordPress site posted on Jan. 12, 2017, in which Guccifer 2.0 wrote the following: \u201cI already explained at The Future of Cyber Security Europe conference that took place in London in last September, I had used a different way to breach into the DNC network. I found a vulnerability in the NGP VAN software installed in the DNC system.\u201d\n\nNote also that Guccifer 2.0 is a different person than the first Guccifer, Marcel Lazar, whose hacking capabilities have been severely limited during his continuing imprisonment that began with his arrest in Romania in January 2014.\n\nGive that the WikiLeaks publication of hacked documents that began in October 2016 \u2013 the hacked document dump the Clinton campaign, the FBI, and the U.S. intelligence agencies want to blame on Russia \u2013 consists almost entirely of emails from Podesta and others related to the Clinton campaign and/or the Clinton Foundation, it is extremely unlikely Guccifer 2.0 was the source, regardless how many assertions U.S. intelligence makes that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian agent \u2013 something Guccifer 2.0 continues to deny.\n\nU.S. intelligence blames WikiLeaks on Russians\n\nThe CrowdStrike post dated June 15, 2016, explained their experts had identified the \u201csophisticated adversaries\u201d attacking the DNC computers as \u201cCozy Bear\u201d and \u201cFancy Bear\u201d \u2013 both identified by CrowdStrike as \u201cRussian-based.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2017, the office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report entitled, \u201cBackground to \u2018Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections\u2019: The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution.\u201d\n\nThis report concluded \u201cwith high confidence\u201d that Russian military intelligence \u201cused the Guccifer 2.0 persona\u201d to release the Podesta files to WikiLeaks, but the report also admitted the identification of the origin of a cybersecurity attack was \u201cdifficult\u201d based only on \u201ctradecraft\u201d that relies on circumstantial evidence at best, presuming a hacker leaves a signature, such that cyberattacks like \u201cCozy Bear\u201d and \u201cFancy Bear\u201d can be reliably be attributed to Russian intelligence operatives.\n\nOn March 7, 2017, WikiLeaks released 8,761 documents on the CIA\u2019s \u201cglobal covert hacking program\u201d that included documents from a project called \u201cUmbrage\u201d proving the CIA could launch \u201cfalse flag\u201d cyberattacks and make them look as if they originated from other countries, such as Russia.\n\n\u201cThe CIA\u2019s Remote Devices Branch\u2019s UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques \u2018stolen\u2019 from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation,\u201d WikiLeaks noted.\n\n\u201cWhen UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the \u2018fingerprints\u2019 of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from,\u201d WikiLeaks continued.\n\nIn December 2016, after Clinton had lost the election, John Podesta said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the first time he was contacted by the FBI was two days after Oct. 7, 2016, the date WikiLeaks started dropping his emails.\n\nIf the FBI had no reason to believe the then-known hacks of Clinton\u2019s private email server and the DNC had also breached Podesta\u2019s email files until after WikiLeaks began publishing Podesta\u2019s emails, this strongly suggests the person who leaked Podesta\u2019s emails was not Guccifer, Guccifer 2.0, \u201cCozy Bear,\u201d or \u201cFancy Bear,\u201d but a separate and distinct incident, likely carried off by someone not previously identified.\n\nYet, to date, the U.S. intelligence agencies have insisted on lumping together all hacks of the Democrats during the 2016 presidential, blaming the Russians for every hacking incident, regardless of the content released by the hack or the target data source known to have been hacked.\n\nWhat seems likely is the FBI had no idea Podesta emails had been hacked (or leaked) until WikiLeaks started publishing them.\n\nYet, despite this intelligence failure, U.S. intelligence agencies took their fallback position, concluding the Russians must have hacked Podesta\u2019s emails too.\n\nOn Dec. 30, 2016, after the presidential election was over, then-President Obama took a step to implant the \u201cRussian interference\u201d meme into the U.S. mainstream media, by expelling 35 Russians from the United States and ordered sweeping new sanctions as retaliation, stressing that U.S. intelligence services believe Russia had ordered cyberattacks on the DNC.\n\nInterestingly, there was an earlier expulsion of Russian diplomats during the 2016 presidential convention.\n\nOn July 8, 2016, the Obama administration expelled two Russian diplomats from the United States supposedly in retaliation for a Russian police guard who had tackled a U.S. diplomat outside the American Embassy in Moscow in a scuffle that was captured on security footage and broadcast on Russian television.\n\nAnonymous, in a video released May 24, 2015, provides an alternative explanation why these two diplomats were expelled.\n\nAnonymous claimed Mikhail Fradkov, the head of Russia\u2019s SVR intelligence agency from Oct. 6, 2006 to Oct. 5, 2016, authorized an emergency contact with the U.S. State Department on July 7, 2016, to reveal the details of Seth Rich\u2019s breach of Podesta\u2019s emails and the subsequent danger to his life, only to find themselves expelled immediately.\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity got suspended over the Memorial Day holiday following a series of broadcasts beginning March 12, 2017, in which Hannity appeared to be advancing what is being termed the \u201cWikiLeaks\u2019 conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nThis theory suggests U.S. intelligence agencies hacked Hillary\u2019s email server, the DNC, the VGP-VAN database, and Podesta\u2019s emails, in a \u201cfalse flag\u201d that used tradecraft leaving cyberattack \u201cfingerprints\u201d that traced back to the Russians.\n\nOn the broadcast March 12, 2017, two former U.S. intelligence operatives, Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer and former NSA official William Binney, told Hannity that retired NSA intelligence officers were responsible for hacking the DNC.\n\n\u201cSean, we did it [hack the DNC], not me, but our guys\u2014former members of NSA, retired intelligence officers used these tools to break in there and get the information out. That\u2019s what the Democrats don\u2019t want to talk about because it doesn\u2019t fit their narrative,\u201d Shaffer explained.\n\nThe U.S. Intelligence agencies have assumed the Russian government hacked the Democrats because Vladimir Putin wanted Donald Trump to win.\n\nBut there is well-documented proof the Russians had been paying Hillary Clinton through the Clinton Foundation for her decision as secretary of state to support the Frank Giustra ploy that resulted in Russia getting control of 20 percent of the uranium in the United States, while Russia was using a shell company in the Netherlands to pay Podesta in stock for supporting the \u201ctechnology transfer\u201d to Russia the Obama administration had authorized under Secretary Clinton\u2019s \u201creset\u201d initiative.\n\nHow would Russia know in advance that hacking Hillary, Podesta, and the DNC would turn up sufficiently damaging documentary evidence to throw the election for Trump?\n\nWhy would Putin want Trump to be president, when the Russians had invested millions during the Obama administration to establish their blackmail potential to control the actions of both Clinton and Podesta, starting the minute Hillary took the oath of office as president of the United States?\n\nDespite all the U.S. intelligence and Democratic Party hoopla, the fact remains there is no irrefutable proof the Russians hacked Hillary Clinton or the DNC during the 2016 presidential campaign, nor is there any proof the Russians accessed John Podesta\u2019s email account.\n\nSo far, the \u201cRussian Collusion\u201d meme implicating Trump in a supposed Russian hacking scheme is nothing more than a lame Clinton excuse for losing.\n\nIn the final analysis, if Hillary and the DNC had not conspired to steal the nomination from Sanders, and if Podesta\u2019s emails were not so filled with dark brooding and scheming (often aimed at HRC herself), it would not have mattered their documents were hacked, leaked, and published.\n\nThe dark, dirty truth is that Hillary Clinton could not sustain the revelation to the American people of the truth Podesta and the DNC spoke in private, almost every day, as they schemed to put Hillary in the White House.\n\nHillary even today refuses to acknowledge the problems that continue to dog her White House ambitions, ranging from Benghazi, to the Clinton Foundation, to her handling of classified material transmitted over her private email server, to name just a few.",
