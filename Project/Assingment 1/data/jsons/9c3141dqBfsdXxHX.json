The segregated schools , the no-go theaters , the colored-only water fountains . The white supremacist siege of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery , Alabama , where Martin Luther King , Jr. , was trapped inside , and Harbison was , too . The white folks telling his mother she couldn \u2019 t vote unless she could answer how many beans were in a jar , or how wet water was .\nHarbison is now a Democratic state senator from Georgia , and the Deep South has changed radically in his 72 years on its soil . Sometimes , though , he reflects on how it hasn \u2019 t changed\u2014like when he reflects on the high-profile race for governor pitting Stacey Abrams , a progressive African-American Democrat who used to run a voting rights nonprofit , against Brian Kemp , the conservative white Republican secretary of state who is mired in multiple voting rights controversies . Harbison is rooting for Abrams to become the first black woman governor of any American state , and Kemp \u2019 s efforts to purge voter rolls and challenge voter registrations in ways that disproportionately affect minorities bring back painful memories of the bad old days . \u201c It \u2019 s a different time , but it feels like the same game plan , \u201d Harbison told me after an Abrams rally at Columbus State University .\nGeorgia is at the epicenter of a national movement for stricter voting rules in Republican-controlled states , and its battles over the ballot have become a national story about race and power in the South . But while Harbison is concerned that Republicans may be disenfranchising some black voters , perhaps even enough to swing a too-close-to-call governor \u2019 s race to Kemp , he thinks far more black voters disenfranchise themselves , sitting out elections they suspect are pre-determined to ratify the white power structure \u2019 s status quo . He tells his constituents , especially young ones , about the blood that \u2019 s been spilled to secure their right to vote , but many of them don \u2019 t believe their vote will count .\n\u201c We need a fully operational electorate if we want things to change , \u201d he says . \u201c Too many people say : \u2018 Aw , what \u2019 s the use , it \u2019 s gon na be what it \u2019 s gon na be . \u2019 \u201d\nJim Crow no longer rules Georgia , and despite media coverage that has made it sound like Bull Connor is patrolling the polls , the vast majority of Georgians who want to cast a vote this fall will be able to do so . The state has expansive online registration , early voting , and vote-by-mail ; the bean-counting days are over . Kemp did spark a national uproar by suspending the registrations of 53,000 Georgians , mostly African-Americans , through an \u201c exact match \u201d system that flags even minor typos and missing hyphens , but those voters can still cast legal ballots if they show up to the polls with proper ID\u2014and on Friday , a federal judge ordered Kemp to make sure that 3,000 of them flagged as non-citizens can vote if they prove their citizenship . Kemp has also culled more than 10 percent of the names on Georgia \u2019 s rolls since 2016 , some through a \u201c use it or lose it \u201d rule that eliminates voters who don \u2019 t show up at the polls or respond to mailings for seven years . But Democrats have launched the largest voter protection operation in state history , and so far fears that hundreds of thousands of voters would be blocked at the polls seem wildly overblown .\nEven Abrams , who constantly denounces Kemp as an architect of voter suppression , \u201c doing everything in his power to rig the game in his favor , \u201d makes it clear that she \u2019 s even more concerned about self-suppression in a climate of fear and confusion . \u201c We lose elections not because people can \u2019 t vote , \u201d she said at a rally last week at Valdosta State College , \u201c but because they don \u2019 t know why they should vote . \u201d\nSo far , minority turnout is shattering records for a midterm election , which is both a political problem for Kemp and a talking point in his defense against allegations of disenfranchisement . But Georgia has been at the vanguard of a new national push to create barriers to voting , a push justified by warnings of rampant voter fraud that seems to exist only in Republican imaginations . It was one of the first two states to try to adopt strict voter ID rules in 2006 , and it has been among the most aggressive of the 24 states that have tightened access to the ballot in recent years . Ever since the Supreme Court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 , rolling back federal scrutiny of election rules in seven southern states with histories of discrimination , the trend in Georgia has been toward fewer polling places and more rigorous demands for documentation before ballots can be cast . Kemp even pursued investigations of several activist groups that register minority voters , including the New Georgia Project founded by Abrams herself .\nKemp is not the only Republican secretary of state presiding over his own bid for higher office . Kris Kobach , the driving force behind President Donald Trump \u2019 s short-lived voter fraud commission that failed to produce evidence of voter fraud , is running for governor of Kansas , while Jon Husted , who also aggressively purged his state \u2019 s voter rolls , is running for lieutenant governor of Ohio . But the combination of Kemp \u2019 s tight race against an outspoken African American voting activist along with a continuing flurry of lawsuits and other controversies have turned him into the symbolic leader of the Republican crusade for voting restrictions . Just this week , another federal judge sided with civil rights groups over Kemp to stop county officials from rejecting mail-in ballots with mismatched signatures , ruling they should err on the side of counting every vote . A recent report on the state \u2019 s restrictions by New York University \u2019 s Brennan Center for Justice was titled : What \u2019 s the Matter with Georgia ?\nKemp insists that nothing is the matter with Georgia . He dismisses the furor over the franchise as \u201c ridiculous , \u201d \u201c a farce , \u201d \u201c a fabricated story \u201d designed to fire up Abrams voters . He says the overwhelming majority of purged registrations were people who moved , died , or never existed ; he told me one voter who didn \u2019 t make the cut gave his name as \u201c Jesus \u201d and address as \u201c Heaven Street. \u201d He said it \u2019 s ironic that Abrams is blaming him for the problems with mismatched registrations when \u201c her own group couldn \u2019 t get people to fill out forms correctly , \u201d and he emphasizes that county officials run the actual election . He \u2019 s a laconic guy with an easy drawl , but he \u2019 s furious that national reporters keep parachuting into Georgia to raise alarms about voter suppression and racial discrimination . He prefers to focus on his staunch check-every-box conservatism , and his opponent \u2019 s unusually liberal views for a statewide candidate in the South on issues like guns , taxes and immigration\u2014as well as her support from out-of-state donors like Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer .\n\u201c This race isn \u2019 t about black and white , \u201d he told me after a speech at a barbecue joint in rural Nahunta . \u201c It \u2019 s about who \u2019 s going to put Georgia first , versus billionaire socialists from New York and California . \u201d\nAcademic studies have suggested that the direct impact of vote suppression on vote totals tends to be modest , which may well be the case again here . But like interference in elections by foreign governments , a problem doesn \u2019 t have to swing an election to be a problem . Yes , anyone with a state-issued ID should be able to vote in Georgia , but it \u2019 s also true that low-income people of color are less likely to have drivers licenses or other forms of ID . And one thing that was clear after following Abrams and Kemp on dueling bus tours through rural southern Georgia was that no matter how many voters encounter problems at the polls , this race is very much about black and white . The predominantly black voters who came to see Abrams and the almost exclusively white voters who watched Kemp seemed to live in two parallel realities , one where black Georgians lament systemic injustice , the other where white Georgians believe race relations are fine . It \u2019 s no accident that Oprah Winfrey and former President Barack Obama were just in Georgia to help Abrams rally her base , or that Vice President Mike Pence just stumped with Kemp , with Trump coming to help on Sunday .\n\u201c This is a battle for the soul of our state , \u201d Kemp tells his supporters .\n\u201c We can change Georgia and the South , \u201d Abrams tells hers .\nIt feels like William Faulkner , was half right : The past is never dead , even if it actually is past .\nGwendolyn Thompson was in sixth grade when she integrated her elementary school in the town of Thomaston , too young to understand the hatred that was hurled at her every day . Why did white kids call her \u201c darky \u201d and worse ? Why did they hug the opposite wall when she walked down the hall , as if she had a virulent disease ? Thompson went on to build a good life in the Atlanta suburbs , raising three kids and adjudicating disability cases , enjoying the diversity of life in the home of Coca-Cola , CNN and the civil rights movement . But she would never forget the sting of racism , and she would always wonder what her older white colleagues were thinking but not saying about racial issues . When she returned to rural Thomaston a few years ago to care for her sick father , she found that her worst bully at school was running ( unsuccessfully , it turned out ) for probate judge . \u201c It was such a kick in the gut , \u201d Thompson recalls . \u201c He used to spit in my food . \u201d\nI met Thompson in the pews of a packed Methodist church in her hometown in Georgia \u2019 s black belt , shortly before Abrams showed up to preach early voting . To Thompson , Abrams represents a glimmer of hope for a state where racism has outlived Jim Crow ; she recounted how her son , an electrical engineer who was his firm \u2019 s first black employee , was assigned to train a younger and less qualified white man to be his boss . She sees voter suppression as the logical response of a ruling class in a fast-changing red state where minorities are on track to become the majority in the 2020s .\n\u201c They see us advancing , and they \u2019 re panicking , \u201d she said . \u201c They want to keep their feet on our necks . \u201d\nAt a series of Abrams rallies in south Georgia , where crowds ranged from 60 percent to 90 percent black , her supporters repeatedly cited racial gaps in education , income , and policing as the facts of their daily lives . In the city of Albany , an early cradle of the civil rights movement , a 41-year-old social worker named Dedrick Thomas told me the wrenching advice he recently gave his teenage son : \u201c If a cop says \u2018 Nigger , bark like a dog , \u2019 you bark like a dog . I need you home alive. \u201d In the agricultural town of Cuthbert in Randolph County , where local officials recently tried to shut down seven of nine polling places before backing down after a political firestorm , a 66-year-old retired teacher named Sandra Willis said she \u2019 s waited all her life for a governor who looked like her and cared about her .\n\u201c A lot of white folks still think we should be picking cotton , \u201d she said . \u201c They \u2019 re afraid for us to get a piece of what they \u2019 ve had for years . \u201d\nAbrams joked in Cuthbert that she doesn \u2019 t look like a typical Georgia politician : \u201c I \u2019 m a little taller. \u201d But she \u2019 s serious about her message of a new Georgia , with a government that looks out for everyone rather than a favored few , promoting the dynamism and tolerance that \u2019 s already associated with Atlanta while expanding Medicaid and investing in public education for ordinary people throughout the state . She talks about how she and her five siblings grew up poor , eating orange government cheese , and how she later racked up debt supporting her ailing parents . She tells a story about her first visit to the governor \u2019 s mansion for a ceremony honoring high school valedictorians , when a security guard blocked her at the gate and told her it was a private event . \u201c I don \u2019 t remember meeting the governor , \u201d she says . \u201c I remember that man telling me I didn \u2019 t belong . \u201d\nAbrams portrays Kemp as an electoral version of that security guard , using his power to obstruct access to the levers of power . \u201c He believes voter suppression is his path to victory , \u201d she says . \u201c He \u2019 s not new to it , but he \u2019 s true to it. \u201d She uses the issue to rally her base , framing it as a test of whether Georgia will be a symbol of the Old or New South , urging crowds to fight back by voting . \u201c Mr . Kemp knows how to count , \u201d she told me in Albany . \u201c He knows this is a changing state , and I \u2019 m building a multi-racial , multi-ethnic coalition . He \u2019 s demonstrated that he \u2019 s not interested in the evolution of our state . He intends to support those who remind him of himself . \u201d\nThe rhetoric around the right to vote does get heated ; it \u2019 s an emotional issue , with a lot of historical baggage . Voter fraud is exceedingly rare\u2014a Brennan Center study found only 0.0001 percent of votes cast in 2016 resulted in investigations\u2014so civil rights advocates are skeptical that it \u2019 s the real motivation for the bureaucratic squeeze on eligibility in Republican states . \u201c Jim Crow with a billy club has been changed to James Crow Esquire with a briefcase , \u201d says Richard Rose , the head of the Atlanta NAACP . Andrea Young , the director of the Georgia branch of the American Civil Liberties Union , is the daughter of the legendary activist Andrew Young , and she feels like she \u2019 s constantly trying to plug a legal dam her father \u2019 s generation built .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just a nonstop onslaught , and it \u2019 s really discouraging , \u201d she says . \u201c There \u2019 s so much concern out there that the system is rigged , and it \u2019 s not an irrational fear . \u201d\nThe danger for Abrams is that this kind of talk will discourage her voters , and she tries to balance her attacks on Kemp for rigging the system with assurances that showing up to vote can be the best revenge : \u201c Voter suppression isn \u2019 t a bug in the system . It \u2019 s the system ! But we can beat the system. \u201d And : \u201c Make them tell you no . Don \u2019 t tell yourself no. \u201d And : \u201c Disenfranchisement works not just by taking your vote but by taking your spirit . We need to spirit up ! \u201d She often notes that Kemp was caught on tape expressing concern that he could lose if minorities exercise their right to vote in large numbers , which would be a banal observation about turnout for a Georgia Republican who didn \u2019 t happen to be overseeing elections as secretary of state .\nBlacks are 32 percent of registered voters in Georgia , but in 2014 barely a third of them turned out , lagging far behind whites , and Abrams needs them to spirit up . The mantra from the civil rights community has been that if voting didn \u2019 t matter , there wouldn \u2019 t be so many schemes to stop it\u2014and so far , blacks are on pace to more than double their early vote from 2014 . But I also heard a lot of dispirited grousing about rumors that Georgia \u2019 s antiquated electronic voting machines , which Kemp has resisted updating or supplementing with a paper trail , have been flipping D votes to R. \u201c They can make them machines do what they want to do , \u201d said Claudette Fagan , a 75-year-old retired nanny from Thomaston . \u201c It \u2019 s like Jim Crow all over again . \u201d\nThat kind of fatalism can be deadly to Democrats ; depressed black turnout in 2016 helped swing Florida and key Rust Belt states from Obama to Trump . Dexter Sharper , an African-American state representative who came to support Abrams in Valdosta , says he \u2019 s tired of the victim mentality that blames voter suppression for predictable defeats instead of doing the hard work necessary to win an uphill battle .\n\u201c I hear so many excuses : \u2018 It \u2019 s a Republican state , everything is rigged , nothing \u2019 s gon na change , \u2019 Sharper said . \u201c OK , sure , blacks have to work harder to get ahead . So work harder ! \u201d\nCarl Fortson doesn \u2019 t want to hear about how hard blacks have to work , how hard it is for blacks to vote , or how hard blacks have it in general . \u201c I \u2019 m tired of all that racial mumbo-jumbo , \u201d the 69-year-old retired building official told me at a Kemp rally behind the Carrolls Sausage country store in Ashburn . I asked him whether the history of mistreatment of blacks in the South affected his thinking at all , and he scoffed that the history was just that .\n\u201c Have you ever owned a slave ? \u201d Fortson asked . \u201c I haven \u2019 t . \u201d\nI attended a half-dozen of Kemp \u2019 s events in southern Georgia , and I never saw more than one black face in the crowd , although several Indian-Americans did attend a rally in Kingsland near the Florida border , including one local hotel owner on stage . None of the white people I met thought racism was a big problem in Georgia , and all of them thought the controversy over voting rights was fake news ginned up to help Abrams . \u201c This ain \u2019 t the 1950s , \u201d said Colt Ford , a 27-year-old taxidermist who showed up to a Kemp event in rural Nashville in camouflage . \u201c The media pursues the racial divide , but everyone around here gets along. \u201d Josh Taylor , the police chief in Enigma , agreed racial tensions are overblown , and said he \u2019 s never seen a Black Lives Matters protester in his tiny town : \u201c It \u2019 s all smoke and mirrors . \u201d\nChuck Lanham , a 77-year-old retiree who wore a Make America Great Again cap to the Kingsland rally , said Obama nearly ruined race relations in this country , but blacks and whites in his neighborhood still get along fine : \u201c They don \u2019 t call me cracker and I don \u2019 t call them darky. \u201d He did complain that Abrams wants to take down some prominent Confederate statues ; he says they \u2019 re part of the South \u2019 s heritage , and he doesn \u2019 t believe blacks are truly offended by them . \u201c You never heard about this stuff until ten years ago , \u201d Lanham said . \u201c People just need something to complain about . \u201d\nThis racial disconnect seems just as intense on ballot issues . Gayle Henningfeld , a 72-year-old retired property manager who watched Kemp speak in the cotton town of Cordele\u2014at a history museum where the photographs were all of white faces\u2014said the entire fight over voter suppression was a manufactured racial controversy . \u201c Give me a break : If they can prove who they are , they \u2019 ll get to vote , \u201d she said . \u201c Isn \u2019 t it funny that they can find an ID to get cigarettes and alcohol ? \u201d\n\u201c And EBT ! \u201d added her friend Beth Slocum , using shorthand for food stamps .\nThe Kemp supporters I met consistently described the election in ideological terms , a battle of capitalism against socialism , business against government , makers against takers . \u201c We \u2019 ve all worked hard for what we have , and we want to keep it , \u201d Fortson told me . \u201c Abrams wants to take it away to support people who don \u2019 t work. \u201d Lace Futch , an 80-year-old Atkinson County commissioner who wore overalls to hear Kemp speak in his Trump-loving corner of the state , described the race as \u201c a choice between solvency and bankruptcy , between a conservative and a nut . \u201d\nBut Futch acknowledged that there \u2019 s a tribal shirts-and-skins element to politics these days , and that Abrams doesn \u2019 t wear his team \u2019 s jersey . He said the blacks who blame vote suppression for their lack of power in Georgia ought to blame demographics and basic math : \u201c They \u2019 re only 25 percent of the state ! Of course they \u2019 re gon na be outvoted ! That \u2019 s the name of the game ! \u201d\nWhen I asked Kemp about the whiteness of his base at a Nahunta barbecue joint , he said he rejected my premise , and mentioned a recent \u201c diversity press conference \u201d and \u201c diversity call center night \u201d featuring non-white supporters . He told me his pro-business message is much better for minorities than the big-government Abrams message , \u201c if they \u2019 re really willing to be open-minded and listen. \u201d But he \u2019 s polling in the low single digits among blacks , and his leaked comments that he could lose the election if they come out to vote in huge numbers were clearly correct . On the trail , Kemp warns his supporters that Democrats are hoping to reach presidential-year turnout in an off-year election , and that he believes they \u2019 ll do it .\n\u201c They \u2019 re motivated , \u201d he said in Ashburn . \u201c We \u2019 re literally fighting the rest of the country , and they \u2019 re counting on you to be complacent . It \u2019 s us against them . \u201d\nJimmy Lockett got out of jail on Father \u2019 s Day , finally clean after 30 years of addiction . But he had no job , no place to live , and no ID , which made it even harder to find a job or a place to live . \u201c I felt like an alien , like E.T.\u2014except at least E.T . could phone home , \u201d Lockett told me before the Abrams rally in Columbus . He didn \u2019 t even have a birth certificate , so he couldn \u2019 t get a Georgia ID , until a non-profit called Spread the Vote tracked it down ; Lockett had always thought he was a Louisiana native , but it turned out he was born in Tennessee . He \u2019 s now working at IHOP , while serving as a peer mentor for the formerly incarcerated with a group called Don \u2019 t Count Me Out . He also voted last week for the first time , and persuaded a friend to join him . \u201c It \u2019 s part of taking my life back and rejoining society , \u201d he says .\nSpread the Vote has helped more than 500 Georgians get IDs over the last year , and state director Fallon McClure says watching Lockett vote was a highlight . \u201c The smile on his face was everything , \u201d she told me . But she says the ID bureaucracy is often absurdly unwieldy ; for example , the vital statistics office where applicants can track down their records requires ID at the entrance . She sees these obstacles as outgrowths of white privilege , just like Georgia \u2019 s efforts to limit early voting on Sundays when black churches run Souls to the Polls , or various county efforts to close polling stations accessible by public transit . McClure is a 31-year-old attorney , but when she goes to court , she invariably gets mistaken for a defendant even though she wears a suit and carries a briefcase . \u201c I even wear glasses to look more like a lawyer , \u201d she says with a rueful chuckle . \u201c Some things don \u2019 t seem to change . \u201d\nIn the 2013 decision that rolled back the Voting Rights Act , Chief Justice John Roberts concluded that decades of racial progress\u2014including the election of an African-American president\u2014had eliminated the need for \u201c extraordinary measures \u201d by the federal government to ensure unbiased state elections in states like Georgia . There is no doubt that , as Roberts wrote , \u201c our country has changed , \u201d but race has always been at the heart of the American story , and there is obviously a stark divide over how much it has changed . The ballot is still a battlefield , not only in Georgia but North Dakota , where voter ID laws that require street addresses seem targeted at Native Americans who live on reservations without them , or Kansas , where white officials in majority-Hispanic Dodge City moved the only polling place out of town , or 21 other states where Republican officials have prioritized eliminating voter fraud over maximizing voter participation . Voting is supposed to be how Americans resolve differences\u2014leaders of both parties chide uncivil protesters who harass politicians in restaurants\u2014but the drumbeat of stories about voting restrictions inevitably reduces confidence that voting can make a difference .\nThe current leader of the Republican Party , to put it mildly , has never been eager to bridge racial divisions . President Trump got his start in politics by questioning his black predecessor \u2019 s citizenship , and he loves riling up his white supporters with culture-war attacks on prominent African-Americans like LeBron James , Don Lemon , Maxine Waters , NFL players who protest police brutality , and even the civil rights hero John Lewis , who was also inside the First Baptist Church in Montgomery during the siege . Trump has tweeted that Abrams is \u201c crime-loving \u201d and \u201c totally unqualified , \u201d an odd criticism to make of a Yale Law School graduate who served as the Democratic leader in the state assembly . And many GOP politicians are fashioning themselves in his politically incorrect image ; in his primary , Kemp ran an ad suggesting he might use his own pickup truck to round up illegal immigrants in Georgia , which helped earn him Trump \u2019 s endorsement .\nThe midterms will help determine whether Republicans pay any price for pushing these envelopes , which will help determine whether the envelope-pushing continues . And in some states , the ballot itself will be on the ballot ; there are an unprecedented number of voter referendums this year designed to expand voting rights and make the eligibility process easier , including a measure restoring the right of felons to vote after completing their sentence in Florida , and provisions creating automatic registration in Nevada , Michigan and Maryland . \u201c You could see a really transformative backlash against this multi-year effort to restrict democracy , \u201d says Wendy Weiser , who runs the Brennan Center \u2019 s voting rights program .\nIn Georgia , voters are voting , and turnout was up 146 percent over 2014 through Wednesday , with more than a third of the early vote from first-time voters . The Democratic voter hotline is getting about 300 calls a day , and some long lines discouraged voters in the first few days\u2014in part because counties closed more than 200 polling stations on Kemp \u2019 s watch\u2014but there have not been widespread new reports of irregularities that would indicate Kemp \u2019 s thumb on the scale .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think they can steal this one , \u201d a 64-year-old equipment operator named Hildredge Bush told me before the Abrams speech at the Thomaston church . Bush is a Navy veteran with a political science degree , and he \u2019 s felt all his life that the racist vestiges of Jim Crow have held him back from reaching his full potential . But now he believes the forces of progress are on the march . At least he hopes so .\n\u201c We shall overcome the suppression , and we shall overcome it with politics , \u201d he said . \u201c There really isn \u2019 t any other way to overcome . \u201d",
    "content_original": "Michael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ga.\u2014Ed Harbison remembers Jim Crow. The segregated schools, the no-go theaters, the colored-only water fountains. The white supremacist siege of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where Martin Luther King, Jr., was trapped inside, and Harbison was, too. The white folks telling his mother she couldn\u2019t vote unless she could answer how many beans were in a jar, or how wet water was.\n\nHarbison is now a Democratic state senator from Georgia, and the Deep South has changed radically in his 72 years on its soil. Sometimes, though, he reflects on how it hasn\u2019t changed\u2014like when he reflects on the high-profile race for governor pitting Stacey Abrams, a progressive African-American Democrat who used to run a voting rights nonprofit, against Brian Kemp, the conservative white Republican secretary of state who is mired in multiple voting rights controversies. Harbison is rooting for Abrams to become the first black woman governor of any American state, and Kemp\u2019s efforts to purge voter rolls and challenge voter registrations in ways that disproportionately affect minorities bring back painful memories of the bad old days. \u201cIt\u2019s a different time, but it feels like the same game plan,\u201d Harbison told me after an Abrams rally at Columbus State University.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGeorgia is at the epicenter of a national movement for stricter voting rules in Republican-controlled states, and its battles over the ballot have become a national story about race and power in the South. But while Harbison is concerned that Republicans may be disenfranchising some black voters, perhaps even enough to swing a too-close-to-call governor\u2019s race to Kemp, he thinks far more black voters disenfranchise themselves, sitting out elections they suspect are pre-determined to ratify the white power structure\u2019s status quo. He tells his constituents, especially young ones, about the blood that\u2019s been spilled to secure their right to vote, but many of them don\u2019t believe their vote will count.\n\n\u201cWe need a fully operational electorate if we want things to change,\u201d he says. \u201cToo many people say: \u2018Aw, what\u2019s the use, it\u2019s gonna be what it\u2019s gonna be.\u2019\u201d\n\nJim Crow no longer rules Georgia, and despite media coverage that has made it sound like Bull Connor is patrolling the polls, the vast majority of Georgians who want to cast a vote this fall will be able to do so. The state has expansive online registration, early voting, and vote-by-mail; the bean-counting days are over. Kemp did spark a national uproar by suspending the registrations of 53,000 Georgians, mostly African-Americans, through an \u201cexact match\u201d system that flags even minor typos and missing hyphens, but those voters can still cast legal ballots if they show up to the polls with proper ID\u2014and on Friday, a federal judge ordered Kemp to make sure that 3,000 of them flagged as non-citizens can vote if they prove their citizenship. Kemp has also culled more than 10 percent of the names on Georgia\u2019s rolls since 2016, some through a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d rule that eliminates voters who don\u2019t show up at the polls or respond to mailings for seven years. But Democrats have launched the largest voter protection operation in state history, and so far fears that hundreds of thousands of voters would be blocked at the polls seem wildly overblown.\n\nEven Abrams, who constantly denounces Kemp as an architect of voter suppression, \u201cdoing everything in his power to rig the game in his favor,\u201d makes it clear that she\u2019s even more concerned about self-suppression in a climate of fear and confusion. \u201cWe lose elections not because people can\u2019t vote,\u201d she said at a rally last week at Valdosta State College, \u201cbut because they don\u2019t know why they should vote.\u201d\n\nSo far, minority turnout is shattering records for a midterm election, which is both a political problem for Kemp and a talking point in his defense against allegations of disenfranchisement. But Georgia has been at the vanguard of a new national push to create barriers to voting, a push justified by warnings of rampant voter fraud that seems to exist only in Republican imaginations. It was one of the first two states to try to adopt strict voter ID rules in 2006, and it has been among the most aggressive of the 24 states that have tightened access to the ballot in recent years. Ever since the Supreme Court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, rolling back federal scrutiny of election rules in seven southern states with histories of discrimination, the trend in Georgia has been toward fewer polling places and more rigorous demands for documentation before ballots can be cast. Kemp even pursued investigations of several activist groups that register minority voters, including the New Georgia Project founded by Abrams herself.\n\nKemp is not the only Republican secretary of state presiding over his own bid for higher office. Kris Kobach, the driving force behind President Donald Trump\u2019s short-lived voter fraud commission that failed to produce evidence of voter fraud, is running for governor of Kansas, while Jon Husted, who also aggressively purged his state\u2019s voter rolls, is running for lieutenant governor of Ohio. But the combination of Kemp\u2019s tight race against an outspoken African American voting activist along with a continuing flurry of lawsuits and other controversies have turned him into the symbolic leader of the Republican crusade for voting restrictions. Just this week, another federal judge sided with civil rights groups over Kemp to stop county officials from rejecting mail-in ballots with mismatched signatures, ruling they should err on the side of counting every vote. A recent report on the state\u2019s restrictions by New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice was titled: What\u2019s the Matter with Georgia?\n\nKemp insists that nothing is the matter with Georgia. He dismisses the furor over the franchise as \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201ca farce,\u201d \u201ca fabricated story\u201d designed to fire up Abrams voters. He says the overwhelming majority of purged registrations were people who moved, died, or never existed; he told me one voter who didn\u2019t make the cut gave his name as \u201cJesus\u201d and address as \u201cHeaven Street.\u201d He said it\u2019s ironic that Abrams is blaming him for the problems with mismatched registrations when \u201cher own group couldn\u2019t get people to fill out forms correctly,\u201d and he emphasizes that county officials run the actual election. He\u2019s a laconic guy with an easy drawl, but he\u2019s furious that national reporters keep parachuting into Georgia to raise alarms about voter suppression and racial discrimination. He prefers to focus on his staunch check-every-box conservatism, and his opponent\u2019s unusually liberal views for a statewide candidate in the South on issues like guns, taxes and immigration\u2014as well as her support from out-of-state donors like Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer.\n\n\u201cThis race isn\u2019t about black and white,\u201d he told me after a speech at a barbecue joint in rural Nahunta. \u201cIt\u2019s about who\u2019s going to put Georgia first, versus billionaire socialists from New York and California.\u201d\n\nAcademic studies have suggested that the direct impact of vote suppression on vote totals tends to be modest, which may well be the case again here. But like interference in elections by foreign governments, a problem doesn\u2019t have to swing an election to be a problem. Yes, anyone with a state-issued ID should be able to vote in Georgia, but it\u2019s also true that low-income people of color are less likely to have drivers licenses or other forms of ID. And one thing that was clear after following Abrams and Kemp on dueling bus tours through rural southern Georgia was that no matter how many voters encounter problems at the polls, this race is very much about black and white. The predominantly black voters who came to see Abrams and the almost exclusively white voters who watched Kemp seemed to live in two parallel realities, one where black Georgians lament systemic injustice, the other where white Georgians believe race relations are fine. It\u2019s no accident that Oprah Winfrey and former President Barack Obama were just in Georgia to help Abrams rally her base, or that Vice President Mike Pence just stumped with Kemp, with Trump coming to help on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis is a battle for the soul of our state,\u201d Kemp tells his supporters.\n\n\u201cWe can change Georgia and the South,\u201d Abrams tells hers.\n\nIt feels like William Faulkner, was half right: The past is never dead, even if it actually is past.\n\n\n\n***\n\nGwendolyn Thompson was in sixth grade when she integrated her elementary school in the town of Thomaston, too young to understand the hatred that was hurled at her every day. Why did white kids call her \u201cdarky\u201d and worse? Why did they hug the opposite wall when she walked down the hall, as if she had a virulent disease? Thompson went on to build a good life in the Atlanta suburbs, raising three kids and adjudicating disability cases, enjoying the diversity of life in the home of Coca-Cola, CNN and the civil rights movement. But she would never forget the sting of racism, and she would always wonder what her older white colleagues were thinking but not saying about racial issues. When she returned to rural Thomaston a few years ago to care for her sick father, she found that her worst bully at school was running (unsuccessfully, it turned out) for probate judge. \u201cIt was such a kick in the gut,\u201d Thompson recalls. \u201cHe used to spit in my food.\u201d\n\nI met Thompson in the pews of a packed Methodist church in her hometown in Georgia\u2019s black belt, shortly before Abrams showed up to preach early voting. To Thompson, Abrams represents a glimmer of hope for a state where racism has outlived Jim Crow; she recounted how her son, an electrical engineer who was his firm\u2019s first black employee, was assigned to train a younger and less qualified white man to be his boss. She sees voter suppression as the logical response of a ruling class in a fast-changing red state where minorities are on track to become the majority in the 2020s.\n\n\u201cThey see us advancing, and they\u2019re panicking,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to keep their feet on our necks.\u201d\n\nAt a series of Abrams rallies in south Georgia, where crowds ranged from 60 percent to 90 percent black, her supporters repeatedly cited racial gaps in education, income, and policing as the facts of their daily lives. In the city of Albany, an early cradle of the civil rights movement, a 41-year-old social worker named Dedrick Thomas told me the wrenching advice he recently gave his teenage son: \u201cIf a cop says \u2018Nigger, bark like a dog,\u2019 you bark like a dog. I need you home alive.\u201d In the agricultural town of Cuthbert in Randolph County, where local officials recently tried to shut down seven of nine polling places before backing down after a political firestorm, a 66-year-old retired teacher named Sandra Willis said she\u2019s waited all her life for a governor who looked like her and cared about her.\n\n\u201cA lot of white folks still think we should be picking cotton,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid for us to get a piece of what they\u2019ve had for years.\u201d\n\nAbrams joked in Cuthbert that she doesn\u2019t look like a typical Georgia politician: \u201cI\u2019m a little taller.\u201d But she\u2019s serious about her message of a new Georgia, with a government that looks out for everyone rather than a favored few, promoting the dynamism and tolerance that\u2019s already associated with Atlanta while expanding Medicaid and investing in public education for ordinary people throughout the state. She talks about how she and her five siblings grew up poor, eating orange government cheese, and how she later racked up debt supporting her ailing parents. She tells a story about her first visit to the governor\u2019s mansion for a ceremony honoring high school valedictorians, when a security guard blocked her at the gate and told her it was a private event. \u201cI don\u2019t remember meeting the governor,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember that man telling me I didn\u2019t belong.\u201d\n\nAbrams portrays Kemp as an electoral version of that security guard, using his power to obstruct access to the levers of power. \u201cHe believes voter suppression is his path to victory,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s not new to it, but he\u2019s true to it.\u201d She uses the issue to rally her base, framing it as a test of whether Georgia will be a symbol of the Old or New South, urging crowds to fight back by voting. \u201cMr. Kemp knows how to count,\u201d she told me in Albany. \u201cHe knows this is a changing state, and I\u2019m building a multi-racial, multi-ethnic coalition. He\u2019s demonstrated that he\u2019s not interested in the evolution of our state. He intends to support those who remind him of himself.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric around the right to vote does get heated; it\u2019s an emotional issue, with a lot of historical baggage. Voter fraud is exceedingly rare\u2014a Brennan Center study found only 0.0001 percent of votes cast in 2016 resulted in investigations\u2014so civil rights advocates are skeptical that it\u2019s the real motivation for the bureaucratic squeeze on eligibility in Republican states. \u201cJim Crow with a billy club has been changed to James Crow Esquire with a briefcase,\u201d says Richard Rose, the head of the Atlanta NAACP. Andrea Young, the director of the Georgia branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, is the daughter of the legendary activist Andrew Young, and she feels like she\u2019s constantly trying to plug a legal dam her father\u2019s generation built.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a nonstop onslaught, and it\u2019s really discouraging,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much concern out there that the system is rigged, and it\u2019s not an irrational fear.\u201d\n\nThe danger for Abrams is that this kind of talk will discourage her voters, and she tries to balance her attacks on Kemp for rigging the system with assurances that showing up to vote can be the best revenge: \u201cVoter suppression isn\u2019t a bug in the system. It\u2019s the system! But we can beat the system.\u201d And: \u201cMake them tell you no. Don\u2019t tell yourself no.\u201d And: \u201cDisenfranchisement works not just by taking your vote but by taking your spirit. We need to spirit up!\u201d She often notes that Kemp was caught on tape expressing concern that he could lose if minorities exercise their right to vote in large numbers, which would be a banal observation about turnout for a Georgia Republican who didn\u2019t happen to be overseeing elections as secretary of state.\n\nBlacks are 32 percent of registered voters in Georgia, but in 2014 barely a third of them turned out, lagging far behind whites, and Abrams needs them to spirit up. The mantra from the civil rights community has been that if voting didn\u2019t matter, there wouldn\u2019t be so many schemes to stop it\u2014and so far, blacks are on pace to more than double their early vote from 2014. But I also heard a lot of dispirited grousing about rumors that Georgia\u2019s antiquated electronic voting machines, which Kemp has resisted updating or supplementing with a paper trail, have been flipping D votes to R. \u201cThey can make them machines do what they want to do,\u201d said Claudette Fagan, a 75-year-old retired nanny from Thomaston. \u201cIt\u2019s like Jim Crow all over again.\u201d\n\nThat kind of fatalism can be deadly to Democrats; depressed black turnout in 2016 helped swing Florida and key Rust Belt states from Obama to Trump. Dexter Sharper, an African-American state representative who came to support Abrams in Valdosta, says he\u2019s tired of the victim mentality that blames voter suppression for predictable defeats instead of doing the hard work necessary to win an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cI hear so many excuses: \u2018It\u2019s a Republican state, everything is rigged, nothing\u2019s gonna change,\u2019 Sharper said. \u201cOK, sure, blacks have to work harder to get ahead. So work harder!\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nCarl Fortson doesn\u2019t want to hear about how hard blacks have to work, how hard it is for blacks to vote, or how hard blacks have it in general. \u201cI\u2019m tired of all that racial mumbo-jumbo,\u201d the 69-year-old retired building official told me at a Kemp rally behind the Carrolls Sausage country store in Ashburn. I asked him whether the history of mistreatment of blacks in the South affected his thinking at all, and he scoffed that the history was just that.\n\n\u201cHave you ever owned a slave?\u201d Fortson asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI attended a half-dozen of Kemp\u2019s events in southern Georgia, and I never saw more than one black face in the crowd, although several Indian-Americans did attend a rally in Kingsland near the Florida border, including one local hotel owner on stage. None of the white people I met thought racism was a big problem in Georgia, and all of them thought the controversy over voting rights was fake news ginned up to help Abrams. \u201cThis ain\u2019t the 1950s,\u201d said Colt Ford, a 27-year-old taxidermist who showed up to a Kemp event in rural Nashville in camouflage. \u201cThe media pursues the racial divide, but everyone around here gets along.\u201d Josh Taylor, the police chief in Enigma, agreed racial tensions are overblown, and said he\u2019s never seen a Black Lives Matters protester in his tiny town: \u201cIt\u2019s all smoke and mirrors.\u201d\n\nChuck Lanham, a 77-year-old retiree who wore a Make America Great Again cap to the Kingsland rally, said Obama nearly ruined race relations in this country, but blacks and whites in his neighborhood still get along fine: \u201cThey don\u2019t call me cracker and I don\u2019t call them darky.\u201d He did complain that Abrams wants to take down some prominent Confederate statues; he says they\u2019re part of the South\u2019s heritage, and he doesn\u2019t believe blacks are truly offended by them. \u201cYou never heard about this stuff until ten years ago,\u201d Lanham said. \u201cPeople just need something to complain about.\u201d\n\nThis racial disconnect seems just as intense on ballot issues. Gayle Henningfeld, a 72-year-old retired property manager who watched Kemp speak in the cotton town of Cordele\u2014at a history museum where the photographs were all of white faces\u2014said the entire fight over voter suppression was a manufactured racial controversy. \u201cGive me a break: If they can prove who they are, they\u2019ll get to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it funny that they can find an ID to get cigarettes and alcohol?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd EBT!\u201d added her friend Beth Slocum, using shorthand for food stamps.\n\nThe Kemp supporters I met consistently described the election in ideological terms, a battle of capitalism against socialism, business against government, makers against takers. \u201cWe\u2019ve all worked hard for what we have, and we want to keep it,\u201d Fortson told me. \u201cAbrams wants to take it away to support people who don\u2019t work.\u201d Lace Futch, an 80-year-old Atkinson County commissioner who wore overalls to hear Kemp speak in his Trump-loving corner of the state, described the race as \u201ca choice between solvency and bankruptcy, between a conservative and a nut.\u201d\n\nBut Futch acknowledged that there\u2019s a tribal shirts-and-skins element to politics these days, and that Abrams doesn\u2019t wear his team\u2019s jersey. He said the blacks who blame vote suppression for their lack of power in Georgia ought to blame demographics and basic math: \u201cThey\u2019re only 25 percent of the state! Of course they\u2019re gonna be outvoted! That\u2019s the name of the game!\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Kemp about the whiteness of his base at a Nahunta barbecue joint, he said he rejected my premise, and mentioned a recent \u201cdiversity press conference\u201d and \u201cdiversity call center night\u201d featuring non-white supporters. He told me his pro-business message is much better for minorities than the big-government Abrams message, \u201cif they\u2019re really willing to be open-minded and listen.\u201d But he\u2019s polling in the low single digits among blacks, and his leaked comments that he could lose the election if they come out to vote in huge numbers were clearly correct. On the trail, Kemp warns his supporters that Democrats are hoping to reach presidential-year turnout in an off-year election, and that he believes they\u2019ll do it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re motivated,\u201d he said in Ashburn. \u201cWe\u2019re literally fighting the rest of the country, and they\u2019re counting on you to be complacent. It\u2019s us against them.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nJimmy Lockett got out of jail on Father\u2019s Day, finally clean after 30 years of addiction. But he had no job, no place to live, and no ID, which made it even harder to find a job or a place to live. \u201cI felt like an alien, like E.T.\u2014except at least E.T. could phone home,\u201d Lockett told me before the Abrams rally in Columbus. He didn\u2019t even have a birth certificate, so he couldn\u2019t get a Georgia ID, until a non-profit called Spread the Vote tracked it down; Lockett had always thought he was a Louisiana native, but it turned out he was born in Tennessee. He\u2019s now working at IHOP, while serving as a peer mentor for the formerly incarcerated with a group called Don\u2019t Count Me Out. He also voted last week for the first time, and persuaded a friend to join him. \u201cIt\u2019s part of taking my life back and rejoining society,\u201d he says.\n\nSpread the Vote has helped more than 500 Georgians get IDs over the last year, and state director Fallon McClure says watching Lockett vote was a highlight. \u201cThe smile on his face was everything,\u201d she told me. But she says the ID bureaucracy is often absurdly unwieldy; for example, the vital statistics office where applicants can track down their records requires ID at the entrance. She sees these obstacles as outgrowths of white privilege, just like Georgia\u2019s efforts to limit early voting on Sundays when black churches run Souls to the Polls, or various county efforts to close polling stations accessible by public transit. McClure is a 31-year-old attorney, but when she goes to court, she invariably gets mistaken for a defendant even though she wears a suit and carries a briefcase. \u201cI even wear glasses to look more like a lawyer,\u201d she says with a rueful chuckle. \u201cSome things don\u2019t seem to change.\u201d\n\nIn the 2013 decision that rolled back the Voting Rights Act, Chief Justice John Roberts concluded that decades of racial progress\u2014including the election of an African-American president\u2014had eliminated the need for \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d by the federal government to ensure unbiased state elections in states like Georgia. There is no doubt that, as Roberts wrote, \u201cour country has changed,\u201d but race has always been at the heart of the American story, and there is obviously a stark divide over how much it has changed. The ballot is still a battlefield, not only in Georgia but North Dakota, where voter ID laws that require street addresses seem targeted at Native Americans who live on reservations without them, or Kansas, where white officials in majority-Hispanic Dodge City moved the only polling place out of town, or 21 other states where Republican officials have prioritized eliminating voter fraud over maximizing voter participation. Voting is supposed to be how Americans resolve differences\u2014leaders of both parties chide uncivil protesters who harass politicians in restaurants\u2014but the drumbeat of stories about voting restrictions inevitably reduces confidence that voting can make a difference.\n\nThe current leader of the Republican Party, to put it mildly, has never been eager to bridge racial divisions. President Trump got his start in politics by questioning his black predecessor\u2019s citizenship, and he loves riling up his white supporters with culture-war attacks on prominent African-Americans like LeBron James, Don Lemon, Maxine Waters, NFL players who protest police brutality, and even the civil rights hero John Lewis, who was also inside the First Baptist Church in Montgomery during the siege. Trump has tweeted that Abrams is \u201ccrime-loving\u201d and \u201ctotally unqualified,\u201d an odd criticism to make of a Yale Law School graduate who served as the Democratic leader in the state assembly. And many GOP politicians are fashioning themselves in his politically incorrect image; in his primary, Kemp ran an ad suggesting he might use his own pickup truck to round up illegal immigrants in Georgia, which helped earn him Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\nThe midterms will help determine whether Republicans pay any price for pushing these envelopes, which will help determine whether the envelope-pushing continues. And in some states, the ballot itself will be on the ballot; there are an unprecedented number of voter referendums this year designed to expand voting rights and make the eligibility process easier, including a measure restoring the right of felons to vote after completing their sentence in Florida, and provisions creating automatic registration in Nevada, Michigan and Maryland. \u201cYou could see a really transformative backlash against this multi-year effort to restrict democracy,\u201d says Wendy Weiser, who runs the Brennan Center\u2019s voting rights program.\n\nIn Georgia, voters are voting, and turnout was up 146 percent over 2014 through Wednesday, with more than a third of the early vote from first-time voters. The Democratic voter hotline is getting about 300 calls a day, and some long lines discouraged voters in the first few days\u2014in part because counties closed more than 200 polling stations on Kemp\u2019s watch\u2014but there have not been widespread new reports of irregularities that would indicate Kemp\u2019s thumb on the scale.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they can steal this one,\u201d a 64-year-old equipment operator named Hildredge Bush told me before the Abrams speech at the Thomaston church. Bush is a Navy veteran with a political science degree, and he\u2019s felt all his life that the racist vestiges of Jim Crow have held him back from reaching his full potential. But now he believes the forces of progress are on the march. At least he hopes so.\n\n\u201cWe shall overcome the suppression, and we shall overcome it with politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any other way to overcome.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Letter From Georgia",
