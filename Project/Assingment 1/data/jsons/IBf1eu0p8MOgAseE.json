'' But that statement did not contain any apology .\nThe new statement said : `` We are deeply sorry for the publication of an anti-Semitic political cartoon last Thursday in the print edition of The New York Times that circulates outside of the United States , and we are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again . ''\n`` Such imagery is always dangerous , and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide , it 's all the more unacceptable , '' it continued .\nThe paper said the decision to run the syndicated cartoon was made by a single editor working without adequate oversight .\n`` The matter remains under review , and we are evaluating our internal processes and training , '' said the statement . `` We anticipate significant changes . ''\n`` The image was offensive , and it was an error of judgment to publish it .
