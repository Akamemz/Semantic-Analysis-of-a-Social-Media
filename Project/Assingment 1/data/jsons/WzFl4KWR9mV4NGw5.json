''\nA second Israeli woman joined in the verbal barrage , complaining that her taxes should n't be paying for Palestinian treatment .\nTwo other Israeli women came over to comfort the Palestinian mother . But she is in no mood for reconciliation and retorted : `` What good will your apologies do ? ''\nMy NPR colleague Daniel Estrin witnessed this exchange and it reflects the lack of empathy in Israel , the West Bank and Gaza these days , even in the few communities where Jews and Arabs mix like Jerusalem .\nMenachem Klein , a Bar Ilan University professor of political science and one-time adviser to the Israeli negotiating team back in 2000 , says the abstract view many Jews and Arabs have of one another has brought the conflict to a new low , one that 's about ethnicity rather than statehood or disputed borders .\n`` It 's very easy to move from a person that you know , that you see the face and the suffering and everyday care and concerns \u2014 a human being like you like me \u2014 and an abstract , a general enemy , a demon , '' he explains .\nKlein says the perception is something that has been reinforced by Israel 's policy of separation , which started during the first Palestinian uprising or intifada nearly a quarter century ago when Israel started setting up road blocks .\nIt mandated a permit system on Palestinians in particular , whose movements within their own territory and to and from Israel and even Jordan and Egypt were strictly controlled by Israeli authorities , the professor says .\nThe segregation intensified during the second intifada that began in 2000 , leaving Israel , Gaza and the West Bank physically isolated from each other , often by heavily guarded fences and walls .\nBig red signs were erected on borders to Palestinian territory warning Israelis that it 's illegal for them to go there , Klein says .\n`` So for safety of the Israeli Jews , the regulation came in force , '' he said . `` The problem is that it cuts off many connections personal relations between Israelis and Palestinians . ''\nHind Khoury , who is a former Palestinian Authority Minister of Jerusalem Affairs , says most younger Palestinians have never interacted with Israeli Jews other than soldiers . Nor have they traveled to any cities or towns where Israel controls the borders , even though some are only a short drive away .\n`` I know for a fact that in Bethlehem , we have a whole generation of young people who do n't know East Jerusalem , which is ( less than five miles ) away , I mean who do n't know the holy sites '' other than from a book , she says , adding : `` This is 'Absurdistan ' in its full sense . ''\nThe separation affected the workplace as well . As Israel shut the door on Palestinians , it brought in other foreign workers to do the agricultural and construction work Palestinians once did .\nIsrael 's Central Bureau of Statistics shows the 116,000 work permits issued to Palestinians in 1992 dropped to 11,500 in 2005 .\nIt did rise somewhat in 2012 \u2013 the most recent number available \u2013 to 30,000 .\nIsraelis continue to want that separation , says Tamar Hermann an Israel Democracy Institute senior fellow who specializes in public opinion polling .\n`` When we ask if peace prevails , would you like to see Palestinians come back ? And they say 'no , ' '' she said .\n`` My own children , I suppose , they have never met a Palestinian , '' Hermann adds . `` They 've never visited a Palestinian village , they never went to Ramallah they never went to Jericho . And this is why they imagine things and this imagination normally is not positive under the circumstances of conflict , a protracted conflict in particular . ''\nKhoury , meanwhile , criticizes what she sees as a collective Israeli disinterest in connecting with the Palestinian side .\n`` I call them the 'Road 6 Israelis , ' '' she said . `` They cross Road 6 , which goes along the Green Line ( dividing Israel and the West Bank ) and the wall that was built to separate us . ''\nKhoury accuses these Israelis of being completely unaware of what Palestinian life is like .\n`` They have their holidays , their consumption , their good life and their beautiful homes . So what does it matter that we have practically no homes left or no lands left , '' she complains .\nBack in Jerusalem , the generational difference in empathy for the other side is striking in the walled Old City , which has Arab and Jewish neighborhoods .\nJamila is a 48-year-old Arab homemaker , and fearing retribution , asks NPR not to give her or her children 's last name .\nThe air is thick with tension in the crowded alley of the Muslim Quarter , where stern Israeli policemen keep watch and settler flags flutter off several rooftops .\nJamila says she 's worried about the current ethnic tension , but views her relationship with Jewish residents of the city as `` normal . ''\nShe even chats on the phone with her 23-year-old son Sami 's Jewish girlfriend \u2013 a relationship considered scandalous on both sides here .\nJamila says while she does n't have Jewish friends , she shops at Jewish-run stores and goes to Jewish doctors . She says hello in Hebrew to her settler neighbors .\nHer daughter Nadia says she does n't speak Hebrew and avoids contact with Israeli Jews .
