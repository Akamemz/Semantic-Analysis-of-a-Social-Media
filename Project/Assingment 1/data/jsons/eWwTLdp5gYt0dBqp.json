We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us . ''\nTonight , VP-Elect Mike Pence attended # HamiltonBway .

Apologize ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 19 , 2016\nPublic reaction was similarly mixed : liberals cheered the cast of Hamilton for exercising their free speech rights to stand up on behalf of marginalized Americans who have every \u2588\u2588\u2588 to fear a Trump presidency , while conservatives lamented the disrespect shown the vice president .\nBut libertarians appear split , too . Libertarian economist and author Steve Horwitz echoed my political-correctness-backlash-aided-Trump theory in his post on the Hamilton kerfuffle , writing on Facebook : `` Want to understand one big \u2588\u2588\u2588 why Trump won ? Just look at what the cast of Hamilton did when they discovered Pence was in attendance last night . There is your urban/professional media consumers elitism right there . ''\nMy point in the Hamilton post was not that I disagree with the cast 's concerns , but that when leftists do things like that , it 's exactly what makes many people feel like they are being condescended to and treated like rubes for having voted a certain way or thinking a certain way . Or because they do n't think everything should be politicized . You piss them off at your own peril . They do n't respond well to seeing elected officials disrespected too , even if I 'm all in favor of it .\nMeanwhile , libertarian comedian Jeremy McLellan complained about libertarians who believe , `` Trump won because of some stuff I already thought before he won . Truly an amazing coincidence . '' ( Yeah , he considers me to be one of those libertarians . ) On Hamilton and Pence , he writes :\nOne of the most common characteristics of abusers that I noticed when I worked with people with disabilities was the attitude that the client 's resistance to the abuse was itself thought of as justification for the abuse . Once that feedback loop is established , control is justified through both acquiescence and resistance , and there 's nothing the client can do ( behavior wise ) to escape . The same holds true for abusive relationships , prisons , police , or any other kind of authoritarian regime . The broader message is `` Your resistance to my behavior is the \u2588\u2588\u2588 I behave this way in the first place . '' Remember this over the next four years when you hear the trope `` See this is why Trump won . '' If you call his appointees racist , that 's why Trump won . If you boo Mike Pence , that 's why Trump won . If you protest in the streets , that 's why Trump won . If you insult him or his supporters , that 's why Trump won . It 's a rhetorical tool for neutering resistance . Always ask what function it serves .\n1 . This should go without saying , but it 's absolutely fine for actors to use their platform to criticize the president or vice president after a performance . This is n't bullying . You ca n't really bully the second most powerful person in the country . He always has more power than you .\n2 . The actor 's statement was n't even particularly mean-spirited . Rather , it expressed well-founded concerns about the kinds of policies President Trump has vowed to enact . Trump has promised to deport immigrants , bar Muslims from entering the country , and generally sides with the police over communities of color . It 's perfectly legitimate for members of those groups to be worried\u2014and for their allies to be worried , on their behalf .\n3 . As evidence of the fact that the statement was n't `` offensive '' ( and who cares if it was ? ) , I would cite the fact that Pence was n't offended .\n4 . Trump 's tweets about the incident were revealing in that they appropriate the language of leftist grievance mongering . Trump said Pence was `` harassed '' and that the theater should be a safe space . If you think it 's pathetic when students complain about their delicate feelings being hurt by inappropriate Halloween costumes , you should probably also roll your eyes at the idea of the most-powerful man in the country feeling micro-aggressed by an encore .\n5 . The fact that Trump complains about this sort of thing is yet more evidence of a disturbing truth : he is vastly more easily offended than the average politician . No one should actually expect Trump to destroy political correctness : he is just as offended by hard truths and defined by identity politics as the leftists he defeated in the election .\n6 . One more thing about Trump : narcissism , thin skin , and a penchant for authoritarian solutions are quite the toxic mixture .\n7 . All that said , it could still be the case that people are wrong to be outraged about Hamilton standing up to Pence , but are outraged , nevertheless . Perhaps some people are sick of the relentless politicization of all facets of life . Maybe they think they should be able to attend a play , or watch an awards show , or sit through a Thanksgiving dinner without being constantly lectured about how wrong and stupid they are .\n8 . Like Horwitz , I would prefer to live in a world where elected officials were shown less respect , because people who want to take away our rights ( and that 's nearly all of them ) do n't deserve it . But supporters of individual liberty have to be tactical . If Hamilton-esque demonstrations actually drive people into the arms of Trump , there may be cause to eschew such theatrics on purely pragmatic grounds .\n9 . Many people , including many libertarians ( McLellan , for instance ) think this thesis is fundamentally wrong , or at least unproven : political correctness is n't a significant factor that explains Trump 's win . Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting points out that most of the people promoting this explanation\u2014Bill Maher , Jonathan Haidt , George Will , David Brooks , Damon Linker , and yours truly\u2014 '' hated identity politics to begin with '' and are thus guilty of confirmation bias . It 's true that we do n't know exactly what 's in the hearts and minds of Trump voters , and there are no comprehensive polls asking them why they did what they did . So yes , the political correctness theory is a bit speculative , and is being advanced by people who were already concerned about political correctness . But it 's not hard to connect the dots : when surveys of Trump voters are done , political correctness invariably comes up . Personally , I have received emails from Trump voters who told me that political correctness was exactly why they voted the way they did . If there 's a danger in making too much of this theory , there 's also a danger in writing it off .\n10 . That 's because virtually no one in the media saw Trump 's win coming , and political correctness has something to do with that . The polls were wrong ( partly ) because people who planned to vote for Trump did not admit this to pollsters . The kind of person who supported Trump is someone who believes that he could n't be honest or vocal about what he thinks , and saved his rebellion against political correctness for the ballot box . This left foes of Trump less prepared for what was coming . The `` unbearable smugness '' of the liberal media , as CBS 's Will Rahn describes it , blinded us to reality .\nLibertarians and other advocates of a free society should recognize that those inclined to resist Trump and Pence are allies , and that includes the cast of Hamilton\u00ad . But such tactics deserve serious scrutiny , even if they are justified . The point is to stop Trump , not just feel better about having made some futile gesture of resistance .",
