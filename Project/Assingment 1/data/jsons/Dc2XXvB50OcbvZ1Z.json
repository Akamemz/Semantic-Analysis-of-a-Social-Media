Mark Pocan , Wisconsin Democrat . \u201c Not even a lukewarm slingshot . \u201d\nMr. Pocan is a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , which held a hearing Wednesday to take testimony from State Department officials , including one who was one the ground in Libya during the attack , which killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans .\nWhile Republicans on the panel raised questions about the Obama administration \u2019 s handling of the attack and its aftermath , many Democrats in their questions rushed to the administration \u2019 s defense .\nDemocratic Rep. John Tierney of Massachusetts said the House Intelligence Committee had already looked at the issue of controversial \u201c talking points \u201d prepared by officials a few days after the attack .\nReferences to al Qaeda \u2019 s possible involvement in the attack were struck from the document , leading Republicans to charge that the White House had engineered the changes to hide al Qaeda \u2019 s involvement and help the president \u2019 s reelection campaign .\n\u201c Gen . Petraeus , the former head of the CIA , made it clear that the change was made to protect classified sources of information \u2014 not to spin it , not to politicize it \u2014 and it wasn \u2019 t done at the direction of the White House , \u201d Mr. Tierney insisted .\nSEE RELATED : Benghazi \u2018 talking points \u2019 altered , White House and State Dept . officials say\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday he could not immediately respond to live testimony from the House hearing on the 2012 Benghazi attack .\n\u201c What I can tell you is that it was the assessment of our intelligence community that the attacks were participated in by extremists , \u201d he told reporters at a regular daily briefing . \u201c That \u2019 s what I \u2019 ve said . That \u2019 s what Ambassador [ Susan E. ] Rice said . She said on that Sunday that extremists were involved . What we didn \u2019 t know is what their exact affiliation was . \u201d\nOn several occasions during Tuesday \u2019 s hearing , Republicans on the House Oversight Committee sought to re-examine U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice \u2019 s appearances on Sunday talk shows after the Benghazi attacks .\nDuring the appearances , Mrs. Rice argued that the attacks had grown out of a spontaneous demonstration against a U.S.-made anti-Islam video , as similar demonstrations had been occuring in other Mideast cities at the time .\nHouse Republicans have accused the Obama White House and senior State Department officials of omitting references to al Qaeda , or terrorism in talking points that were given to Mrs. Rice , despite believing that the Benghazi attack had been carried out by Islamist extremists linked to al Qaeda .\nSuch omissions , the Republicans have argued , were made for political reasons ahead of last November \u2019 s presidential election \u2014 in order to protect Mr. Obama from being criticized for failing to prevent a terrorist attack that had killed Americans in Libya .\nDuring one exchange on Tuesday , Rep. Trey Gowdy , South Carolina Republican , also homed in on the fact that Mrs. Rice \u2019 s talkshow remarks directly contradicted statements made the same day by Libyan President Mohammed Magariaf , who described the attacks as being carried out by Islamic extremists with possible terrorist links .\nMr. Gowdy asked Gregory N. Hicks , who had been the State Department \u2019 s Deputy Chief of Mission for the U.S. in Libya at the time of the attacks , whether Mrs. Rice had spoken with him prior to appearing \u201c on five Sunday talk shows ? \u201d\n\u201c No sir , \u201d answered Mr. Hicks , who was then the second highest-ranking U.S. official in Libya .\n\u201c So Ambassador Rice directly contradicts the evidence on the ground in Libya . She directly contradicts the president of Libya . She directly contradicts the last statement uttered by Ambassador Stevens , \u201d said Mr. Gowdy , who then asked Mr. Hicks : \u201c Who is Beth Jones ? \u201d\nMr. Hicks responded that Mrs. Jones is \u201c the acting assistant secretary for near eastern affairs at the State Department . \u201d\nIn a moment of rich theater for the hearing , Mr. Gowdy then went on to read an excerpt from an email , which he claimed that Mrs. Jones had sent to others at the State Department \u2014 several days before Mrs. Rice appeared on the talkshows .\nIn the email , according to Mr. Gowdy , Mrs. Jones wrote that she had spoken with the Libyan ambassador to Washington and \u201c I told him that the group that conducted the attacks , Ansar al-Sharia , is affiliated with Islamic terrorists . \u201d\n\u201c Let me say that again , \u201d said Mrs. Gowdy . \u201c She told him , the State Department , on September 12 , days before our ambassador went on national television , is telling the ambassador to Libya the group that conducted teh attacks , Ansar al-Sharia , is affiliated with terrorists . \u201d\nIn light of the email , Mr. Gowdy added , \u201c why in the world would Susan Rice go on five Sunday talk shows and perpetuate a demonstrably false narrative ? \u201d\nMr. Hicks responded that he could not provide an answer to the question , but that perhaps Mr. Gowdy should ask Mrs. Rice .\n\u201c I would love the opportunity to do just that , \u201d said Mr. Gowdy .\nFormer Secretary of State Hilary R. Clinton was the only person empowered by law to authorize the occupation of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Libya before the deadly terror attacks there last year , because the buildings did not meet State Department security standards , a House hearing heard Wednesday .\n\u201c It \u2019 s my understanding only the secretary of state could waive those requirements , \u201d said Eric Nordstrom , who was regional security officer for the embassy in Libya until a few months before the attack .\nThe security standards were introduced after the bombing attacks against U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 , he said .\n\u201c We did not meet any of those standards , \u201d he said of the building in Benghazi , which was overrun and set ablaze by heavily armed extremists on Sept. 11 last year .\nHe spoke at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , which heard testimony from State Department officials who were on the ground in Libya before and during the attacks .\nHe said the State Department-chartered investigation , known as an Accountability Review Board or ARB , had failed to interview senior-enough officials .\n\u201c It stopped short of the very people it should have asked \u2014 Undersecretary for Management [ Patrick ] Kennedy and above , \u201d he said .\nDuring his moment-by-moment account of the attack , Gregory N. Hicks \u2014 the State Department \u2019 s Deputy Chief of Mission for the U.S. in Libya at the time \u2014 said mortar rounds that rained down on the CIA annex in Benghazi were \u201c terribly precise . \u201d\nAfter Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens had gone missing , a group of Americans fleeing the besieged U.S. consulate building in the city had arrived at the CIA annex a few miles away .\n\u201c Shortly after they arrived at the annex , the mortars came in , \u201d said Mr. Hicks , adding that the \u201c first mortar round was long , \u201d or off-target , as it landed among a group of Libyans , who had just helped to transport the Americans to the facility .\n\u201c The next was short , \u201d he said . \u201c The next three landed on the roof . \u201d\nThose were the rounds that killed former Navy SEALS Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods and severly wounded another American , Mr. Hicks said .\n\u201c They didn \u2019 t know whether any more mortars were going to come in , \u201d he said . \u201c The accuracy was terribly precise . The call was , the next one is coming through the roof , maybe , if it hit . \u201d\nHe added that two Americans who \u2019 d rushed from Tripoli to Benghazi on the night of the attack then \u201c climbed up on the roof . \u201d\n\u201c They carried Glen \u2019 s body and Tyrone \u2019 s body down , \u201d said Mr. Hicks , adding that another American on the roof was also wounded .\n\u201c One guy \u2026 [ in ] combat gear , climbed up there , strapped David \u2026 who \u2019 s a large man , to his back , carried him down the ladder , saved him , \u201d he said .\nIt was not immediately clear during the testimony whether Mr. Hicks was referring to David McFarland , whom he earlier said was serving as the State Department \u2019 s political section chief in Libya at the time of the attacks .\nProviding a moment-by-moment account of the Benghazi attack during the hearing , Gregory N. Hicks \u2014 the State Department \u2019 s deputy chief of Mission for the U.S. in Libya at the time \u2014 said once it was clear U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was separated from other Americans , the immediate concern was that he had fallen into the hands of a group known to sympathize with al Qaeda .\nMr. Hicks said U.S. officials scrambling to figure out what was happening began to get information from sources around Benghazi about the attacks .\n\u201c We began to hear also that the ambassador \u2019 s been taken to a hospital , \u201d he said . \u201c We learn that it is in a hospital which is controlled by Ansar al-Shariah , the group that Twitter feeds had identified as leading the attack on the consulate . \u201d\nThe information came in as a \u201c response team \u201d was arriving at the Benghazi airport from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli , Mr. Hicks said .\n\u201c At this point , this response team looks like it may be a hostage rescue team , \u201d he said . \u201c We are going to need to send them to try to save the ambassador who is in the hospital that is , as far as we know , under enemy control . \u201d\nHe added that he and other officials began to worry whether they were being \u201c baited into a trap . \u201d\nThe U.S. special forces personnel who were told to stand down from a relief mission to Benghazi after the terror attacks there last year would have been used to secure the airport , not to defend U.S. facilities , which were already being evacuated , lawmakers were told Wednesday .\nA hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee heard testimony from Gregory N. Hicks , the man who took over from U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens after the ambassador and three other Americans perished in the attacks .\n\u201c We wanted to send a second team to secure the airport , \u201d said Mr. Hicks , adding the four special forces personnel were \u201c furious \u201d they were not allowed to go .\nHe said the order to stand down came early in the morning , when the first phase of the attack was over and the second just about to begin . By the time the Libyan military plane that would have carried them took off on schedule for Benghazi at 6 a.m. , the second phase was also over .\nBy that time , the U.S. buildings in Benghazi had all been evacuated and the personnel were en route to the airport .\nLibyan security personnel were also killed in the terror attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi , Libya last year , lawmakers were reminded Wednesday .\nGregory N. Hicks , the man who took over from U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens after the ambassador and three other Americans perished in the attacks , said Libyan personnel had escorted a small reinforcement team from Benghazi airport to the CIA building known as the annex , arriving just before 5 am .\nWithin minutes , while the Libyans were still outside the building , the second phase of the attack began , when extremists rained mortar rounds down on the annex .\nOne of the first shots landed among the Libyan security personnel , Mr. Hicks said .\nDuring opening testimony , Gregory N. Hicks , who was the State Department \u2019 s Deputy Chief of Mission for the U.S. in Libya and was in Tripoli at the time of the Benghazi attacks , gave a moment-by-moment account of the night on which U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was killed .\nMr. Hicks said he had spoken on the telephone early in the evening with Mr. Stevens and that there were no signs of unusual activity in Benghazi . Closing up shop for the evening in Tripoli , Mr. Hicks said he headed to a villa where he was staying and began relaxing and watching television .\nAlerted by staff during the evening that an attack had begun in Benghazi , Mr. Hicks said he checked his cell phone and saw there were two missed calls , one from the Mr. Stevens \u2019 cell phone and another from a number he didn \u2019 t recognize .\nMr. Hicks said he quickly called back the number he didn \u2019 t recognize and Mr. Stevens answered .\n\u201c Greg ! We \u2019 re under attack ! \u201d said the ambassador , according to Mr. Hicks .\nDuring his own opening statement , Rep. Elija E. Cummings , Maryland Democrat and the House Oversight Committee \u2019 s ranking member shot back that Mr. Issa has willfully leveled a host partisan and \u201c false accusations \u201d at the Obama administration regarding Benghazi .\n\u201c What we have seen over the past two weeks is a full-scale media campaign that is not designed to investigate what happened in a responsible and bipartisan manner , but rather to launch unfounded accusations and to smear public officials , \u201d Mr. Cummings said .\n\u201c Chairman Issa has accused the administration of intentionally withholding military assets , which could have helped save lives on the night of the attacks , for political reasons , \u201d he said . \u201c Of all the irresponsible allegations leveled over the past two weeks , this is the most troubling , and based on what our military commanders have told us , this allegation is false . \u201d\nMr. Issa opened the hearing by saying that his goal was a simple one : \u201c To make certain that our government learns the proper lessons from this tragedy so that it never happens again . \u201d\nMr. Issa shot back at Democratic claims that this is all politically driven by claiming that time and again over the past eight months the minority side has \u201c sat silent \u201d while Republicans sought answers from the administration about Benghazi .\nNews photographers and camera crews swarm the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing room in anticipation of whistle-blower testimony into the deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi , Libya . The hearing is set to begin in moments .\nIt \u2019 s standing room only in the hearing room , with a line of 50 people standing outside the door . Reporters are jockeying with congressional staffers for seats .\nSenior White House and State Department officials played a much larger role than they acknowledged in drafting erroneous administration \u201c talking points \u201d about the Sept. 11 terrorist attack in Benghazi , Libya , according to congressional investigators preparing for a dramatic hearing Wednesday in the House .\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform committee at 11:30 a.m. will hear from the man who took charge of the U.S. mission to Libya after the Benghazi attack left Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans dead .\nThe Obama administration \u2019 s handling of the assault , and the way top officials first characterized the assault as a protest rather than a terrorist attack , will come under new scrutiny .",
