Rand Paul , the eye doctor turned politician , officially kicked off his long-awaited campaign for the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday in his home state of Kentucky , intent on waging a 50-state campaign that marries the small-government libertarianism championed by his father and the millennial generation with the traditional forces of the Republican Party .\n\u201c I am running for president to return our country to the principles of liberty and limited government , \u201d Sen. Paul said Tuesday in his official campaign kickoff .\nThe scope of the challenge and the ambition of the candidate displayed themselves in full Monday when the first-term Kentucky senator released his campaign slogan \u2014 \u201c Defeat the Washington machine . Unleash the American dream \u201d \u2014 designed to position him as an anti-Washington crusader able to attract new voters to the traditional Republican coalition .\nCampaign advisers also told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Mr. Paul planned to compete in every primary election and caucus in all 50 states , all five territories and the District of Columbia , a feat that only two GOP candidates achieved in 2012 .\n\u201c It \u2019 s time for a new way . A new set of ideas . A new leader , one you can trust . One who works for you and , above all , it \u2019 s time for a new president , \u201d Mr. Paul said in a video released by his campaign as a prelude to Tuesday \u2019 s announcement .\nThe Kentucky senator \u2019 s \u201c all-chips-in \u201d message was enhanced by his winning preliminary commitment from his home state GOP to convert Kentucky \u2019 s planned presidential preference primary next May into a presidential caucus earlier in the calendar .\nSEE ALSO : Rand Paul unveils presidential preview : It \u2019 s time for a new leader , \u2018 a new set of ideas \u2019\nThe move will allow Mr. Paul to circumvent Kentucky \u2019 s election law requirement that a candidate \u2019 s name may appear on the ballot for only one office . He plans to seek nomination for a second Senate term in case his presidential aspirations go south on him .\nThe state party , not the state government , runs the caucus .\nAnd the challenge for a politician bred in the shadows of his famous father , former Texas congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul , also came into clearer focus . The elder Mr. Paul gained enormous popularity among millennials but struggled to gain mainstream support from traditional Republicans , who worried about some of his views on eliminating some government agencies and his reluctance to intervene militarily abroad .\nLibertarians like the elder Mr. Paul have been distrusted on issues like gay marriage by social conservatives , who are key to the Iowa caucuses , as well as war hawks , who fear the anti-interventionist agenda \u2014 shared by populists like Pat Buchanan and many libertarians \u2014 would force the U.S. to shrink from its role as the world \u2019 s superpower .\nThe younger Mr. Paul has sought to blunt these expected attacks , openly discussing his Christian faith , traveling to Israel to show his support for an ally that both Christians and war hawks champion and penning an op-ed insisting he would not be an isolationist as president .\nBut like his father , the younger Paul clearly champions the smaller-government , anti-Washington sentiments that have made both Pauls popular among college students and young adults . Rand Paul won the last three straw polls at the Conservative Political Action Conference , where younger voters tend to dominate .\nHe \u2019 ll get to test the popularity of his message of reining in Washington and unleashing American ingenuity on wider audiences this week during his five-state tour , which will take him from his home state to the first four presidential nomination contest states : Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada and South Carolina .\nGetting his name on the Republican presidential nomination ballot in all 50 U.S. states and territories would be no small feat . History suggests it \u2019 s likely to be most presidential nomination aspirants \u2019 toughest row to hoe .\nIt takes hordes of volunteers , separate staffs and leaders for organizations in place on the ground in each of the states and territories , money to finance it all and the know-how to pull it off .\nIt also takes organization and a long head start to compete successfully in states that hold presidential preference caucuses instead of primary elections to award delegates to the Republican presidential nominating convention , to be held next summer in Cleveland .\nOnly two GOP presidential nomination candidates managed to have their names on the ballots ( or to be fully prepared for the logistic challenge of caucuses ) in every state and territory in 2012 .\nOne was former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney , who had more money available than anyone else in the field and a full-blown national campaign organization . The only other 50-state-plus competitor was Ron Paul , the senator \u2019 s father . The libertarian conservative had the advantage of twin followings \u2014 tens of thousands of millennials belonging to the ubiquitous Young Americans for Liberty chapters on college campuses , and older voters whose highest political priority was to get the government off their backs and out of their bedrooms .\nGetting on the ballot became a headline issue only occasionally in the last presidential cycle .\nMr. Paul and Mr. Romney were the only candidates that appeared on the ballot in Virginia \u2019 s March 6 primary \u2014 one of the Super Tuesday contests that year . Former Sen. Rick Santorum , Pennsylvania Republican and a favorite of many religious conservatives , never filed in the state .\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich did file , but his paperwork fell short of state requirements .
