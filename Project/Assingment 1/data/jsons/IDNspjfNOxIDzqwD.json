Egypt \u2019 s military said it had found personal belongings and parts of the wreckage 180 miles north of the coastal city of Alexandria .\nThe plane was carrying 56 passengers and 10 crew : two cockpit crew , five cabin crew and three security personnel . The airline said two babies and one child were on board .\nThe nationalities of the passengers were as follows : 30 Egyptians , 15 French citizens , two Iraqis and one person each from Britain , Belgium , Sudan , Chad , Canada , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Portugal and Algeria .\nAn Airbus A320 , which is considered a safe and reliable plane .
