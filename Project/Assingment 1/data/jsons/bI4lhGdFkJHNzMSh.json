Sign up for the Overcorrection newsletter to receive updates in this series as soon as they publish .\nBAKERSFIELD , Calif. \u2014 Shackled at the wrists and ankles , Christine Taylor followed a red line on the basement floor directing her to the elevator at Kern County \u2019 s central jail . She heard groans and cries from among the hundred people locked above , a wail echoing through the shaft .\nIt was minutes before daybreak on a Monday morning in May 2017 as the elevator lifted her toward the voices . Jail staff had assigned Taylor to something called \u201c suicide watch , \u201d a block of single cells where she \u2019 d be alone 24 hours a day . The sound of other people would soon become a luxury .\nEarlier , she had argued with jail staff during her booking at the downtown jail . Have you ever attempted suicide , a deputy asked . Taylor glared back , her hands trembling . She had never been in serious trouble with law enforcement , and she considered her arrest that night a gross misunderstanding .\n\u201c Do you think I \u2019 m going to try to kill myself with my shirt ? \u201d Taylor responded , flippantly . \u201c Maybe . \u201d\nHer answer got her a glimpse of how the jail handles people it perceives as suicide risks .\nIf you or someone you know needs help , here are a few resources : Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline : 1-800-273-8255\nText the Crisis Text Line from anywhere in the U.S. to reach a crisis counselor : 741741\nWithin minutes , deputies moved Taylor into a changing room on the third floor and had her strip naked . They handed her just two items : paper-thin clothes that come apart under pressure and a blue yoga mat .\nExhausted and scared , she followed orders , walked down a hall and stepped into a bathroom-sized isolation cell . The door slammed behind her . The floors felt colder inside , and a mold smell came up from the toilet-sink fixture . A bed was mounted to the brick wall . Hazy fluorescent lights reflected off the ash-white paint . And , as Taylor soon learned , jail staff never turned them off .\nTo shield herself , she crawled under the bed and put the yoga mat over her torso like a blanket .\nShe pressed her eyelids shut but couldn \u2019 t block the glare or the rush of tears .\nEach year , the Kern County Sheriff \u2019 s Office sends hundreds of people into this kind of suicide watch isolation . Inmates awaiting trial spend weeks and sometimes months in solitary , according to state and county records . When those cells fill up , deputies place people into \u201c overflow \u201d areas , rooms with nothing more than four rubberized walls and a grate in the floor for bodily fluids . They receive no mental health treatment , only a yoga mat to rest on .\nKern County sheriff \u2019 s officials say they turned to isolation rooms to help prevent deaths after a spate of jail suicides that started in 2011 .\nThis wasn \u2019 t what state lawmakers envisioned when they undertook a sweeping criminal justice overhaul nearly a decade ago to alleviate what the U.S. Supreme Court deemed the \u201c cruel and unusual \u201d conditions for people in overcrowded state prisons . Those prisoners , the court found , would languish for months , even years , in \u201c telephone-booth-sized cages \u201d without treatment , resulting in \u201c needless suffering and death . \u201d\nCalifornia \u2019 s reforms , dubbed \u201c realignment , \u201d diverted thousands of offenders to county jails so , among other things , the corrections system could see to basic health needs and meet minimum constitutional requirements . That shift also transferred billions of dollars to local sheriffs to better run jails .\nSome , like Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood , have rejected warnings from the state to improve the outdated and often brutal forms of isolation that helped trigger the state \u2019 s prison crisis .\nThe state can \u2019 t do much about it , a McClatchy and \u2588\u2588\u2588 investigation found . The California Board of State and Community Corrections , which is supposed to maintain minimum jail standards and inspect local facilities , has no legal authority to force local lockups to meet those standards or ensure inmates are physically safe and mentally sound .\nLast year , for instance , a state board inspector called out the Kern County Sheriff \u2019 s Office for 27 violations , a majority of them for using yoga mats instead of mattresses in suicide watch cells . But his letter read more like an invitation than a warning . \u201c If you choose to address the noncompliant issues , \u201d he wrote , \u201c please provide your corrective plan to the BSCC for documentation in your inspection file . \u201d\nThe sheriff \u2019 s office disregarded the findings and bought more than 100 additional mats this year , agency records show .\n\u201c It \u2019 s completely unethical , and counter to clinical evidence for what people need , \u201d Homer Venters , the former chief medical officer of New York City jails , said of Kern County \u2019 s suicide watch . \u201c For any human , that represents punishment and humiliation . \u201d\nIsolation practices save lives , Kern County officials argue . But records show the strategy didn \u2019 t work ; inmates continued to kill themselves .\nIn one case , an inmate hanged himself in a suicide watch cell , after grabbing an extension cord that guards left within reach . Since 2011 , 11 others have taken their lives in other parts of the jail . During the past four years , Kern County had the highest suicide rate of the state \u2019 s 10 largest jail systems , with 5.61 deaths per 100,000 bookings , close to twice the statewide rate , an analysis by \u2588\u2588\u2588 and McClatchy found . Overall , inmate suicides declined slightly in California county jails over that period .\nThe state \u2019 s board has no authority to investigate deaths in local lockups . The agency answers to the Legislature , which has not held a single hearing about jail inspections or the dozens of gruesome deaths in facilities across the state in the past eight years .\nTexas and New Jersey , meanwhile , have boards that regularly examine such deaths .\n\u201c California is flying blind without a state regulatory agency that has meaningful enforcement authority . It \u2019 s time to correct this institutional failure , \u201d said Ross Mirkarimi , the former San Francisco sheriff who is now a jail consultant . \u201c It is a perfect opportunity for the governor to arc from the era of realignment into a new period of reform for California jails . \u201d\n`` I felt like a dog . '' On suicide watch for days in a California jail Sohail Al-Jamea/McClatchy , John Walker/Fresno Bee\nSen. Nancy Skinner , D-Berkeley , chairs the California Senate Public Safety Committee . She voted in support of realignment in 2011 , when she was in the Assembly . Skinner said \u201c there \u2019 s a lot of frustration \u201d about how passive the state board has been in overseeing county jails .\n\u201c The sheriffs do have the authority here , and they could do the right thing , \u201d Skinner said in an interview . \u201c We as the state definitely have to improve our oversight . \u201d\nGov . Gavin Newsom \u2019 s office , in a written statement , said Kern County \u2019 s jail practices are unacceptable , and local officials should reform their policies .\n\u201c County jails should not hold people in their custody in isolation indefinitely , no matter what the situation is , \u201d the governor \u2019 s statement reads . \u201c This is troubling , and it is this Administration \u2019 s hope that the findings in the reports issued by the Board of State and Community Corrections will catalyze change and reforms at the local level , where authority to make those changes ultimately resides . \u201d\nMany local jails across the country use variations of suicide watch to remove hazards and increase monitoring of vulnerable inmates . But Kern County uses isolation far more aggressively , and often exclusively , to prevent suicide deaths . \u201c In my career , this is how suicide watch is done , \u201d said Chief Deputy Tyson Davis , the jails \u2019 top administrator . \u201c They go into a cell by themselves with as few points to hurt themselves on as possible . \u201d\nThat runs counter to best practices advocated by mental health experts , who are increasingly critical of isolating and stripping people considering suicide . A growing body of research shows the practice can harm a person \u2019 s mental health and actually increase their suicide risk once they are released from watch .\nYoungblood , the sheriff , declined multiple interview requests , and his office declined to discuss specific cases , including Taylor \u2019 s .\nAfter McClatchy and \u2588\u2588\u2588 asked questions about Kern County \u2019 s isolation practices and its use of yoga mats , the sheriff \u2019 s office replaced the mats with blankets that are resistant to rips . And Davis said in September that he is working to add mental health specialists to inmate screening , which deputies alone have long conducted . The new clinical positions are not funded yet .\nBill Walker , Kern County \u2019 s behavioral health director , is in charge of mental health care in the jails . When asked in August if isolation without clinical treatment is harmful , Walker replied , \u201c I would be the first to agree with you. \u201d However , he continued , Kern County \u2019 s suicide watch is better than the indifference institutions inflicted decades ago on the people they detained .\n\u201c We used to bury people in the state hospitals in unmarked graves , \u201d Walker said . \u201c The humanity of safety is to keep them alive . \u201d\nThis account is based on interviews with Kern County \u2019 s top jail administrators and deputies , county behavioral health directors , former inmates and families of the deceased . The sheriff \u2019 s office took reporters on tours of its jail facilities and to see the suicide watch cells . McClatchy and \u2588\u2588\u2588 also reviewed and analyzed state inspection documents , autopsy reports , court filings , jail purchasing records and state data on in-custody deaths .\nA suicide watch cell at Kern County Justice Facility . ( John Walker/The Fresno Bee )\nIn 2011 , Lorena Diaz tried to end her life by jumping off a highway bridge . She survived , and a county mental health clinic released her , apparently no more stable than before .\nDesperate , her mother called Diaz \u2019 s parole agent to ask for help , to find a place where her daughter would be safe . The agent alerted local police , who promptly arrested and booked Diaz into the downtown Bakersfield jail , according to sheriff \u2019 s office records . But within two days of her arrival , staff found the 29-year-old mother hanging from a bed sheet tied to a wall vent .\nThe death was the first in a string of suicides over the next year : A 42-year-old man charged with crashing into a sheriff \u2019 s patrol car cut his wrist with a razor and bled out while his cellmates slept . A 20-year-old murder defendant who told deputies he heard voices hanged himself in an isolation cell .\nIn response to the suicides , Youngblood and his jail staff began sending far more people to suicide watch cells , records show . The practice continues to this day .\n\u201c The tripwire to get on suicide watch is fairly light , \u201d said Lt. Ian Silva , who oversees many of the jails \u2019 day-to-day operations . \u201c We don \u2019 t want to take any chances . \u201d\nThe sheriff \u2019 s office also added a new feature to its suicide protocol . In March 2012 , the agency purchased 25 blue yoga mats , finance records show , and ordered 109 more in July of that year . The mats are a half-inch of foam designed to cushion people doing floor exercises .\nThey became the only thing Kern County \u2019 s suicidal inmates got to sleep on , besides the cement floor or metal bunk . They were also a signal that isolation was no longer a fleeting experience . People began spending longer periods of time on suicide watch .\nIn state prisons , at-risk inmates receive mattresses . Silva said the sheriff \u2019 s office chose to give yoga mats instead to ensure inmates can not impede deputies from entering cells . \u201c Our big concern with full mattresses is barricading , \u201d Silva said .\nBecause people with suicidal thoughts often spend their time searching for methods to end their lives , jail experts say suicide watch cells should not contain anything a person can use to asphyxiate or cut themselves .\nKern County deputies violated that rule in August 2013 , after deputies booked Luis Campos on a stack of domestic violence charges . Campos had tried to kill himself before , so deputies put him in the watch cell closest to their desk .\nThe aging facility \u2019 s air-conditioning system regularly faltered in the summer , internal investigation records show . So deputies rigged up a portable fan with an extension cord and duct tape to blow air at their watch station as the afternoon heat topped 90 degrees .\nThey found Campos dead during morning rounds two days later , dangling from the cell bars , an extension cord noosed around his neck .\nUntil last year , the sheriff \u2019 s office had only 11 specialized suicide watch cells across its three jail facilities , and they were always full . So deputies began using what are called safety cells as suicide watch overflow .\nA safety cell at Kern County Justice Facility . ( Jason Pohl/The Sacramento Bee )\nSafety cells are closet-sized rooms with nothing but four walls and a grate in the floor . No bed . No water fountain or toilet . They \u2019 re temporary storage boxes for people who \u2019 ve lost control .\nCalifornia jail standards say safety cells should only hold inmates who are damaging the building or showing an active intent to hurt themselves or others . Medical staff members are required to evaluate each inmate within 12 hours , and a jail administrator needs to reapprove holding them in the safety cell every 24 hours thereafter .\nBy early 2015 , Kern County \u2019 s jail deputies were sending nearly three dozen people a week to suicide watch , a 29 % increase from a year earlier . Some were removed from watch in hours . Others stayed for days .\nStill , elsewhere in the jails , the suicides continued . That January , a 31-year-old man hanged himself . He \u2019 d first tried to kill himself days earlier , a nearby inmate later told detectives . The following September , a 25-year-old man with a history of depression died the same way in a group cell after telling his parents he would kill himself if they did not bail him out .\nDeputies said they were unaware that either posed a suicide risk , according to autopsy records .\nMeanwhile , state inspectors from the corrections board made their routine tours of Kern County \u2019 s jails and reviewed their internal records every two years . By the time an inspector arrived in June 2016 , 10 inmates had taken their lives in 5 1/2 years . The inspector did not mention the deaths in the reports . And in evaluating safety cells , one of the reports simply noted \u201c documentation for the use of those cells were good . \u201d\nTwo more men hanged themselves in January and February 2017 , as deputies sent upward of 36 inmates a week to isolation cells .\nKeys banging on the door woke her that first morning .\n\u201c Taylor ! \u201d the deputy making the morning rounds shouted . She crawled from underneath the cell bed , where she had been hiding from the lights , and moved toward the metal door . She looked out the smudged plexiglass window . It was like peering through a porthole on a space shuttle , she said .\nThe person on the other side wouldn \u2019 t open the door . Kern County jail staff almost never do during these routine cell checks and brief behavioral health evaluations . So Taylor crouched on her knees and spoke to the specialist through the food-tray slot in the door . She said she was not suicidal . She was only on suicide watch , she pleaded , because she hadn \u2019 t cooperated with deputies during intake .\n\u201c When am I going to get out ? \u201d Taylor asked as the staffer walked away .\nPolice had arrested her on suspicion of elder abuse . Her father , who suffers from Alzheimer \u2019 s disease , claimed that she attacked him during a middle-of-the-night disagreement . But Taylor , then 47 , had video showing the opposite ; in fact , officers had responded to similar calls at their home before , for offenses imagined or badly misunderstood . This time , deputies refused to watch the tape .\nNow Taylor was alone , a dozen yards from the deputy desk . She tried to sleep . It was the only thing to do \u2014 inmates on suicide watch in Kern County don \u2019 t get books to read or recreation time to interact with other inmates because even that could be too dangerous , sheriff \u2019 s officials said .\nSo she covered her eyes from the light with her clothes and rolled up her yoga mat to use as a pillow . About four hours crawled by after she entered the jail when staff returned to the door and said they were moving her .\nFor a moment , Taylor felt a rush of excitement . She thought about all the things this might mean : a pillow , a toothbrush , a shower , maybe even a cellmate , someone to talk to .\nDeputies instead led her around the corner to another suicide watch cell , next to a deputy \u2019 s desk . The furnishings were the same : bed , toilet and yoga mat . But the move shortened the distance the deputies had to walk as they signed off on the required twice-every-30-minutes checks . And she could see staff and inmates walking out of the elevators past the window . There were people around , Taylor thought , people to hear about how she \u2019 d been wronged .\n\u201c Innocent until proven guilty ! \u201d she screamed , calling out to other inmates to join her protest . No one did . \u201c I didn \u2019 t get my phone call ! I didn \u2019 t get my phone call ! \u201d Taylor chanted .\nHer confusion had given way to resentment . There was nothing the jailers could do to her that would be worse than being in that cell , she thought , so Taylor vowed to make everybody in earshot hear her outrage . She \u2019 d become part of the collective wail that greeted her just hours earlier .\nTaylor tried another tactic : She ripped a piece of material from her paper-thin shirt and fashioned it into a small nooselike loop . She said she dangled it in the porthole window . ( Jail staff wrote that she put it around her neck , sheriff \u2019 s office records show . ) Deputies stormed the cell and restrained her , Taylor said , and records show staff replaced the clothes with a hunter green , tear-resistant suicide smock .\nThe following day , around noon on Tuesday , jail records show deputies transferred her to a punishment cell , known as administrative segregation .\nKern County \u2019 s behavioral health department doesn \u2019 t provide treatment to inmates on suicide watch , aside from dispensing medication for previously diagnosed conditions , said Walker , the department \u2019 s director . Last year , the county agency doubled its jail staff , which now employs about 40 caregivers .\nCounties usually have a written agreement with the behavioral health provider working in the jails . The contract \u2014 among the most foundational parts of jail-medical operations \u2014 dictates what the provider will do , as well as the consequences for failing to deliver services . But in Kern County , the jail has had no such agreement for \u201c several years , \u201d Walker said . That means there \u2019 s no written accountability for when things go wrong . County officials maintain a contract isn \u2019 t necessary .\nThe behavioral health department does not reliably track how many people have attempted suicide in the cells , why people were placed in isolation or how long they stayed , he said . It also does not keep data on inmates sent to outside hospitals because of mental illness .\nAfter every death of a mentally ill inmate , behavioral health and jail staff meet to review the case and determine if there are ways to prevent similar fatalities in the future . However , officials have not examined the jails \u2019 suicide deaths as a whole at any point since 2011 , Silva and Walker confirmed .\nDuring an interview in August , the county \u2019 s top behavioral health officials demurred when asked why Kern County \u2019 s jail suicide deaths had increased dramatically .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think I have an answer I could give you at the moment , \u201d Walker said . Deputies don \u2019 t send all suicidal inmates to behavioral health staff . Greg Gonzales , head of correctional care , said suicide prevention can not keep all inmates safe . \u201c If they \u2019 re committed , it \u2019 s hard to stop them , \u201d he said .\nAt the sheriff \u2019 s office , Silva partly attributed the increased deaths to \u201c bad luck . \u201d\nThe behavioral health department provides inmates the best care it can afford , Gonzales said .\nOver the past two decades , researchers have examined suicides in local jails , where death rates are often higher than among the general public and in prisons . They \u2019 ve consistently opposed the use of isolation , saying it increases the likelihood that inmates will attempt to hurt themselves . A guide from the World Health Organization states , \u201c Prisoners at risk should not be left alone , but observation and companionship should be provided . \u201d\nThe key to keeping people safe in local jails is paying attention , said Sheriff Tom Dart from Cook County , Illinois , whose Chicago-area jails are increasingly a model for humane practices . Dart said he eliminated isolation as punishment when his department \u2019 s data showed the practice actually led to more rule violations and security problems .\n\u201c If you value something as a society , you study it , \u201d Dart said . \u201c You analyze it . You spend money on the data . If you don \u2019 t care about something , you don \u2019 t study it . \u201d\nA 2014 statistical analysis of New York City \u2019 s jail inmates found serious mental illness and solitary confinement were the strongest factors in suicide attempts .\nLindsay Hayes , a national expert on correctional suicide prevention , said jails use isolation with good intentions . \u201c I truly believe that correctional officials and mental health and medical officials and leadership are not intentionally trying to punish people , to create tortuous types of environments , \u201d Hayes said . \u201c They \u2019 re just being extremely careful and , in many ways , over-protective and over-reactive . \u201d\nTaylor felt worlds away from another human being . In the punishment cell , around the corner from suicide watch , no one walked by . She couldn \u2019 t hear voices or the clatter of activity . Distance muted everything .\n\u201c It was the loneliest feeling I \u2019 ve ever had , \u201d she said . \u201c That feeling is what made me decide that I wanted to be good and go back to the cell behind the deputies . \u201d\nRead More A Year After an Inmate Was Choked to Death in Jail , a Murder Charge but Few Details Lorenzo Herrera , 19 , was found dead in a Fresno County Jail cell in March 2018 . A man has been charged , but detectives say they \u2019 re still trying to determine if there are additional suspects .\nThe \u201c lonely cell , \u201d as she called it , broke her in less than a day . She apologized . She told deputies she \u2019 d learned her lesson . More importantly , Taylor said , \u201c I was just being quiet . \u201d\nDeputies moved her back to the suicide watch cell by the desk that Wednesday morning , two days after being booked into the facility , according to jail records .\nShe tried to measure the hour by watching how much sunlight streamed onto the jail hallway floor . Peering through the window , she learned to tell time by making mental notes about when one deputy \u2019 s shift ended and another person \u2019 s began .\nShe marked the hours with scraps of food and shreds of a paper plate , but it was all guesswork . The constant light triggered sleep deprivation and confusion . Taylor had lost track of just how long she \u2019 d been in Kern County \u2019 s jail .\nTo bolster oversight of county jails and distribute funds in the realignment era , state lawmakers created the corrections board . Every two years , it sends an inspector to each facility to make sure sheriffs and their officers are following the rules .\nSteven Wicklander , an inspector for the state board , arrived at the Kern County jails in June 2018 , a year after Taylor \u2019 s arrest . The central receiving jail was in the midst of a bedbug infestation . The sheriff \u2019 s staff was not regularly cleaning cell mattresses , Wicklander wrote in his notes . They handed out dirty beds and only washed them when the mattresses were \u201c contaminated . \u201d\nConditions weren \u2019 t much better in the newest jail , opened last year and built with $ 100 million in state funds to cope with an influx of inmates serving longer sentences in county facilities under realignment . Its expansive infirmary is primarily for suicide prevention , and its 14 isolation cells were constantly full .\nOver three days , Wicklander toured the suicide watch halls at each jail facility . He saw maxed-out cells and deputies putting suicide watch inmates in safety cells for more than a week straight .\n\u201c The safety cell can not be used as a substitution for treatment , \u201d Wicklander wrote in his final report in August 2018 .\nThere were violations at every stop . Kern County jails are so understaffed the sheriff \u2019 s office requires deputies to work overtime to cover the shifts , causing deputies to fall behind on safety and security checks . Suicide watch and safety cell practices , particularly the yoga mats , were against the rules .\nAgency officials do not have authority to make county leaders change and generally see themselves as partners , not regulators , said Allison Ganter , deputy director overseeing the inspection team .\nKern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood speaking at a news conference on Sep. 13 , 2018 . ( The Fresno Bee file photo )\nYoungblood and his staff waited eight months to respond to Wicklander \u2019 s report .\nThey wrote back this April and rejected the board \u2019 s findings that yoga mats violated the standards . The sheriff \u2019 s office spent $ 4,500 to buy 60 more mats the same month , finance records show .\nYoga mats , they wrote , provide people on suicide watch \u201c the comfort of padding , albeit minimal , in an environment which is uncomfortable by design . \u201d\nAs the week went on , Taylor tried to talk to anyone who walked by her cell . Once , a woman sat near her window , and they chatted briefly about being arrested and their legal cases . \u201c She was telling me her story , which was almost like my story , \u201d Taylor recalled .\nShe tried to get the staff talking . Taylor said she noticed a picture of a puppy on a deputy \u2019 s monitor and complimented the pet \u2019 s cuteness . The deputy scolded her and turned the screen away .\n\u201c The most exciting part of the day was when they would give me my food because there was actually somebody there , \u201d Taylor said .\nSaturday marked her sixth day in the jail . That morning , a different behavioral health specialist met with Taylor and decided that her suicide risk \u2014 however deputies calculated it initially \u2014 was gone . She moved to a space with the rest of the inmates in the jail \u2019 s general population ward , where she was thrilled to receive a toothbrush , soap , clothes and a mattress .\nDeputies also gave her access to a phone for the first time since she \u2019 d been put on suicide watch early Monday morning . Taylor called her mom , who helped arrange for her to post the $ 35,000 bond . ( Two weeks later , prosecutors dropped the charges . Taylor sued the county for wrongful detention , but the suit was dismissed . )\nThe sheriff \u2019 s office said it is not permitted to discuss her case under state law and would not answer reporters \u2019 questions about her time in jail .\nIt can take hours to be formally released from custody , and oftentimes inmates are released in the middle of the night without reliable transportation . Late Sunday , the doors of the downtown Bakersfield jail swung open for Taylor . A 4-mile walk in the dark awaited her .\nShe had been in sweats when police arrested her and didn \u2019 t have a bra to wear for the trek home . Taylor asked if she could borrow one of the jail-issued ones .\n\u201c It \u2019 s bad luck to take anything home from here , \u201d a deputy replied .",

Sign up for the Overcorrection newsletter to receive updates in this series as soon as they publish.\n\nBAKERSFIELD, Calif. \u2014 Shackled at the wrists and ankles, Christine Taylor followed a red line on the basement floor directing her to the elevator at Kern County\u2019s central jail. She heard groans and cries from among the hundred people locked above, a wail echoing through the shaft.\n\nIt was minutes before daybreak on a Monday morning in May 2017 as the elevator lifted her toward the voices. Jail staff had assigned Taylor to something called \u201csuicide watch,\u201d a block of single cells where she\u2019d be alone 24 hours a day. The sound of other people would soon become a luxury.\n\nWhat a stupid mistake, Taylor fumed.\n\nEarlier, she had argued with jail staff during her booking at the downtown jail. Have you ever attempted suicide, a deputy asked. Taylor glared back, her hands trembling. She had never been in serious trouble with law enforcement, and she considered her arrest that night a gross misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to try to kill myself with my shirt?\u201d Taylor responded, flippantly. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\nHer answer got her a glimpse of how the jail handles people it perceives as suicide risks.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, here are a few resources: Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255\n\nText the Crisis Text Line from anywhere in the U.S. to reach a crisis counselor: 741741\n\nWithin minutes, deputies moved Taylor into a changing room on the third floor and had her strip naked. They handed her just two items: paper-thin clothes that come apart under pressure and a blue yoga mat.\n\nExhausted and scared, she followed orders, walked down a hall and stepped into a bathroom-sized isolation cell. The door slammed behind her. The floors felt colder inside, and a mold smell came up from the toilet-sink fixture. A bed was mounted to the brick wall. Hazy fluorescent lights reflected off the ash-white paint. And, as Taylor soon learned, jail staff never turned them off.\n\nTo shield herself, she crawled under the bed and put the yoga mat over her torso like a blanket.\n\nShe pressed her eyelids shut but couldn\u2019t block the glare or the rush of tears.\n\n\u201cCruel and Unusual\u201d Punishment; No Limits\n\nEach year, the Kern County Sheriff\u2019s Office sends hundreds of people into this kind of suicide watch isolation. Inmates awaiting trial spend weeks and sometimes months in solitary, according to state and county records. When those cells fill up, deputies place people into \u201coverflow\u201d areas, rooms with nothing more than four rubberized walls and a grate in the floor for bodily fluids. They receive no mental health treatment, only a yoga mat to rest on.\n\nKern County sheriff\u2019s officials say they turned to isolation rooms to help prevent deaths after a spate of jail suicides that started in 2011.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t what state lawmakers envisioned when they undertook a sweeping criminal justice overhaul nearly a decade ago to alleviate what the U.S. Supreme Court deemed the \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d conditions for people in overcrowded state prisons. Those prisoners, the court found, would languish for months, even years, in \u201ctelephone-booth-sized cages\u201d without treatment, resulting in \u201cneedless suffering and death.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s reforms, dubbed \u201crealignment,\u201d diverted thousands of offenders to county jails so, among other things, the corrections system could see to basic health needs and meet minimum constitutional requirements. That shift also transferred billions of dollars to local sheriffs to better run jails.\n\nSome, like Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood, have rejected warnings from the state to improve the outdated and often brutal forms of isolation that helped trigger the state\u2019s prison crisis.\n\nThe state can\u2019t do much about it, a McClatchy and ProPublica investigation found. The California Board of State and Community Corrections, which is supposed to maintain minimum jail standards and inspect local facilities, has no legal authority to force local lockups to meet those standards or ensure inmates are physically safe and mentally sound.\n\nLast year, for instance, a state board inspector called out the Kern County Sheriff\u2019s Office for 27 violations, a majority of them for using yoga mats instead of mattresses in suicide watch cells. But his letter read more like an invitation than a warning. \u201cIf you choose to address the noncompliant issues,\u201d he wrote, \u201cplease provide your corrective plan to the BSCC for documentation in your inspection file.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Overcorrection Newsletter Subscribe, and we\u2019ll send you updates from our ongoing investigation into California\u2019s jails whenever we publish them.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office disregarded the findings and bought more than 100 additional mats this year, agency records show.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely unethical, and counter to clinical evidence for what people need,\u201d Homer Venters, the former chief medical officer of New York City jails, said of Kern County\u2019s suicide watch. \u201cFor any human, that represents punishment and humiliation.\u201d\n\nIsolation practices save lives, Kern County officials argue. But records show the strategy didn\u2019t work; inmates continued to kill themselves.\n\nIn one case, an inmate hanged himself in a suicide watch cell, after grabbing an extension cord that guards left within reach. Since 2011, 11 others have taken their lives in other parts of the jail. During the past four years, Kern County had the highest suicide rate of the state\u2019s 10 largest jail systems, with 5.61 deaths per 100,000 bookings, close to twice the statewide rate, an analysis by ProPublica and McClatchy found. Overall, inmate suicides declined slightly in California county jails over that period.\n\nThe state\u2019s board has no authority to investigate deaths in local lockups. The agency answers to the Legislature, which has not held a single hearing about jail inspections or the dozens of gruesome deaths in facilities across the state in the past eight years.\n\nTexas and New Jersey, meanwhile, have boards that regularly examine such deaths.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is flying blind without a state regulatory agency that has meaningful enforcement authority. It\u2019s time to correct this institutional failure,\u201d said Ross Mirkarimi, the former San Francisco sheriff who is now a jail consultant. \u201cIt is a perfect opportunity for the governor to arc from the era of realignment into a new period of reform for California jails.\u201d\n\n\"I felt like a dog.\" On suicide watch for days in a California jail Sohail Al-Jamea/McClatchy, John Walker/Fresno Bee\n\nSen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, chairs the California Senate Public Safety Committee. She voted in support of realignment in 2011, when she was in the Assembly. Skinner said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of frustration\u201d about how passive the state board has been in overseeing county jails.\n\n\u201cThe sheriffs do have the authority here, and they could do the right thing,\u201d Skinner said in an interview. \u201cWe as the state definitely have to improve our oversight.\u201d\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office, in a written statement, said Kern County\u2019s jail practices are unacceptable, and local officials should reform their policies.\n\n\u201cCounty jails should not hold people in their custody in isolation indefinitely, no matter what the situation is,\u201d the governor\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThis is troubling, and it is this Administration\u2019s hope that the findings in the reports issued by the Board of State and Community Corrections will catalyze change and reforms at the local level, where authority to make those changes ultimately resides.\u201d\n\nMany local jails across the country use variations of suicide watch to remove hazards and increase monitoring of vulnerable inmates. But Kern County uses isolation far more aggressively, and often exclusively, to prevent suicide deaths. \u201cIn my career, this is how suicide watch is done,\u201d said Chief Deputy Tyson Davis, the jails\u2019 top administrator. \u201cThey go into a cell by themselves with as few points to hurt themselves on as possible.\u201d\n\nThat runs counter to best practices advocated by mental health experts, who are increasingly critical of isolating and stripping people considering suicide. A growing body of research shows the practice can harm a person\u2019s mental health and actually increase their suicide risk once they are released from watch.\n\nYoungblood, the sheriff, declined multiple interview requests, and his office declined to discuss specific cases, including Taylor\u2019s.\n\nAfter McClatchy and ProPublica asked questions about Kern County\u2019s isolation practices and its use of yoga mats, the sheriff\u2019s office replaced the mats with blankets that are resistant to rips. And Davis said in September that he is working to add mental health specialists to inmate screening, which deputies alone have long conducted. The new clinical positions are not funded yet.\n\nBill Walker, Kern County\u2019s behavioral health director, is in charge of mental health care in the jails. When asked in August if isolation without clinical treatment is harmful, Walker replied, \u201cI would be the first to agree with you.\u201d However, he continued, Kern County\u2019s suicide watch is better than the indifference institutions inflicted decades ago on the people they detained.\n\n\u201cWe used to bury people in the state hospitals in unmarked graves,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe humanity of safety is to keep them alive.\u201d\n\nThis account is based on interviews with Kern County\u2019s top jail administrators and deputies, county behavioral health directors, former inmates and families of the deceased. The sheriff\u2019s office took reporters on tours of its jail facilities and to see the suicide watch cells. McClatchy and ProPublica also reviewed and analyzed state inspection documents, autopsy reports, court filings, jail purchasing records and state data on in-custody deaths.\n\nA suicide watch cell at Kern County Justice Facility. (John Walker/The Fresno Bee)\n\nAn Uptick in Suicides, Then Yoga Mats\n\nIn 2011, Lorena Diaz tried to end her life by jumping off a highway bridge. She survived, and a county mental health clinic released her, apparently no more stable than before.\n\nDesperate, her mother called Diaz\u2019s parole agent to ask for help, to find a place where her daughter would be safe. The agent alerted local police, who promptly arrested and booked Diaz into the downtown Bakersfield jail, according to sheriff\u2019s office records. But within two days of her arrival, staff found the 29-year-old mother hanging from a bed sheet tied to a wall vent.\n\nThe death was the first in a string of suicides over the next year: A 42-year-old man charged with crashing into a sheriff\u2019s patrol car cut his wrist with a razor and bled out while his cellmates slept. A 20-year-old murder defendant who told deputies he heard voices hanged himself in an isolation cell.\n\nIn response to the suicides, Youngblood and his jail staff began sending far more people to suicide watch cells, records show. The practice continues to this day.\n\n\u201cThe tripwire to get on suicide watch is fairly light,\u201d said Lt. Ian Silva, who oversees many of the jails\u2019 day-to-day operations. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take any chances.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office also added a new feature to its suicide protocol. In March 2012, the agency purchased 25 blue yoga mats, finance records show, and ordered 109 more in July of that year. The mats are a half-inch of foam designed to cushion people doing floor exercises.\n\nThey became the only thing Kern County\u2019s suicidal inmates got to sleep on, besides the cement floor or metal bunk. They were also a signal that isolation was no longer a fleeting experience. People began spending longer periods of time on suicide watch.\n\nIn state prisons, at-risk inmates receive mattresses. Silva said the sheriff\u2019s office chose to give yoga mats instead to ensure inmates cannot impede deputies from entering cells. \u201cOur big concern with full mattresses is barricading,\u201d Silva said.\n\nBecause people with suicidal thoughts often spend their time searching for methods to end their lives, jail experts say suicide watch cells should not contain anything a person can use to asphyxiate or cut themselves.\n\nKern County deputies violated that rule in August 2013, after deputies booked Luis Campos on a stack of domestic violence charges. Campos had tried to kill himself before, so deputies put him in the watch cell closest to their desk.\n\nThe aging facility\u2019s air-conditioning system regularly faltered in the summer, internal investigation records show. So deputies rigged up a portable fan with an extension cord and duct tape to blow air at their watch station as the afternoon heat topped 90 degrees.\n\nThey found Campos dead during morning rounds two days later, dangling from the cell bars, an extension cord noosed around his neck.\n\nUntil last year, the sheriff\u2019s office had only 11 specialized suicide watch cells across its three jail facilities, and they were always full. So deputies began using what are called safety cells as suicide watch overflow.\n\nA safety cell at Kern County Justice Facility. (Jason Pohl/The Sacramento Bee)\n\nSafety cells are closet-sized rooms with nothing but four walls and a grate in the floor. No bed. No water fountain or toilet. They\u2019re temporary storage boxes for people who\u2019ve lost control.\n\nCalifornia jail standards say safety cells should only hold inmates who are damaging the building or showing an active intent to hurt themselves or others. Medical staff members are required to evaluate each inmate within 12 hours, and a jail administrator needs to reapprove holding them in the safety cell every 24 hours thereafter.\n\nBy early 2015, Kern County\u2019s jail deputies were sending nearly three dozen people a week to suicide watch, a 29% increase from a year earlier. Some were removed from watch in hours. Others stayed for days.\n\nStill, elsewhere in the jails, the suicides continued. That January, a 31-year-old man hanged himself. He\u2019d first tried to kill himself days earlier, a nearby inmate later told detectives. The following September, a 25-year-old man with a history of depression died the same way in a group cell after telling his parents he would kill himself if they did not bail him out.\n\nDeputies said they were unaware that either posed a suicide risk, according to autopsy records.\n\nMeanwhile, state inspectors from the corrections board made their routine tours of Kern County\u2019s jails and reviewed their internal records every two years. By the time an inspector arrived in June 2016, 10 inmates had taken their lives in 5 1/2 years. The inspector did not mention the deaths in the reports. And in evaluating safety cells, one of the reports simply noted \u201cdocumentation for the use of those cells were good.\u201d\n\nTwo more men hanged themselves in January and February 2017, as deputies sent upward of 36 inmates a week to isolation cells.\n\nChristine Taylor was soon among those on suicide watch.\n\n\u201cWhen Am I Going to Get Out?\u201d\n\nKeys banging on the door woke her that first morning.\n\n\u201cTaylor!\u201d the deputy making the morning rounds shouted. She crawled from underneath the cell bed, where she had been hiding from the lights, and moved toward the metal door. She looked out the smudged plexiglass window. It was like peering through a porthole on a space shuttle, she said.\n\nThe person on the other side wouldn\u2019t open the door. Kern County jail staff almost never do during these routine cell checks and brief behavioral health evaluations. So Taylor crouched on her knees and spoke to the specialist through the food-tray slot in the door. She said she was not suicidal. She was only on suicide watch, she pleaded, because she hadn\u2019t cooperated with deputies during intake.\n\n\u201cWhen am I going to get out?\u201d Taylor asked as the staffer walked away.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she heard, \u201cwe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nPolice had arrested her on suspicion of elder abuse. Her father, who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, claimed that she attacked him during a middle-of-the-night disagreement. But Taylor, then 47, had video showing the opposite; in fact, officers had responded to similar calls at their home before, for offenses imagined or badly misunderstood. This time, deputies refused to watch the tape.\n\nNow Taylor was alone, a dozen yards from the deputy desk. She tried to sleep. It was the only thing to do \u2014 inmates on suicide watch in Kern County don\u2019t get books to read or recreation time to interact with other inmates because even that could be too dangerous, sheriff\u2019s officials said.\n\nSo she covered her eyes from the light with her clothes and rolled up her yoga mat to use as a pillow. About four hours crawled by after she entered the jail when staff returned to the door and said they were moving her.\n\nFor a moment, Taylor felt a rush of excitement. She thought about all the things this might mean: a pillow, a toothbrush, a shower, maybe even a cellmate, someone to talk to.\n\nChristine Taylor (John Walker/The Fresno Bee)\n\nDeputies instead led her around the corner to another suicide watch cell, next to a deputy\u2019s desk. The furnishings were the same: bed, toilet and yoga mat. But the move shortened the distance the deputies had to walk as they signed off on the required twice-every-30-minutes checks. And she could see staff and inmates walking out of the elevators past the window. There were people around, Taylor thought, people to hear about how she\u2019d been wronged.\n\n\u201cInnocent until proven guilty!\u201d she screamed, calling out to other inmates to join her protest. No one did. \u201cI didn\u2019t get my phone call! I didn\u2019t get my phone call!\u201d Taylor chanted.\n\nHer confusion had given way to resentment. There was nothing the jailers could do to her that would be worse than being in that cell, she thought, so Taylor vowed to make everybody in earshot hear her outrage. She\u2019d become part of the collective wail that greeted her just hours earlier.\n\nJail staff ignored her.\n\nTaylor tried another tactic: She ripped a piece of material from her paper-thin shirt and fashioned it into a small nooselike loop. She said she dangled it in the porthole window. (Jail staff wrote that she put it around her neck, sheriff\u2019s office records show.) Deputies stormed the cell and restrained her, Taylor said, and records show staff replaced the clothes with a hunter green, tear-resistant suicide smock.\n\nThe following day, around noon on Tuesday, jail records show deputies transferred her to a punishment cell, known as administrative segregation.\n\n\u201cIf They\u2019re Committed, It\u2019s Hard to Stop Them\u201d\n\nKern County\u2019s behavioral health department doesn\u2019t provide treatment to inmates on suicide watch, aside from dispensing medication for previously diagnosed conditions, said Walker, the department\u2019s director. Last year, the county agency doubled its jail staff, which now employs about 40 caregivers.\n\nCounties usually have a written agreement with the behavioral health provider working in the jails. The contract \u2014 among the most foundational parts of jail-medical operations \u2014 dictates what the provider will do, as well as the consequences for failing to deliver services. But in Kern County, the jail has had no such agreement for \u201cseveral years,\u201d Walker said. That means there\u2019s no written accountability for when things go wrong. County officials maintain a contract isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nThe behavioral health department does not reliably track how many people have attempted suicide in the cells, why people were placed in isolation or how long they stayed, he said. It also does not keep data on inmates sent to outside hospitals because of mental illness.\n\nAfter every death of a mentally ill inmate, behavioral health and jail staff meet to review the case and determine if there are ways to prevent similar fatalities in the future. However, officials have not examined the jails\u2019 suicide deaths as a whole at any point since 2011, Silva and Walker confirmed.\n\nDuring an interview in August, the county\u2019s top behavioral health officials demurred when asked why Kern County\u2019s jail suicide deaths had increased dramatically.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have an answer I could give you at the moment,\u201d Walker said. Deputies don\u2019t send all suicidal inmates to behavioral health staff. Greg Gonzales, head of correctional care, said suicide prevention cannot keep all inmates safe. \u201cIf they\u2019re committed, it\u2019s hard to stop them,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the sheriff\u2019s office, Silva partly attributed the increased deaths to \u201cbad luck.\u201d\n\nThe behavioral health department provides inmates the best care it can afford, Gonzales said.\n\nOver the past two decades, researchers have examined suicides in local jails, where death rates are often higher than among the general public and in prisons. They\u2019ve consistently opposed the use of isolation, saying it increases the likelihood that inmates will attempt to hurt themselves. A guide from the World Health Organization states, \u201cPrisoners at risk should not be left alone, but observation and companionship should be provided.\u201d\n\nThe key to keeping people safe in local jails is paying attention, said Sheriff Tom Dart from Cook County, Illinois, whose Chicago-area jails are increasingly a model for humane practices. Dart said he eliminated isolation as punishment when his department\u2019s data showed the practice actually led to more rule violations and security problems.\n\n\u201cIf you value something as a society, you study it,\u201d Dart said. \u201cYou analyze it. You spend money on the data. If you don\u2019t care about something, you don\u2019t study it.\u201d\n\nA 2014 statistical analysis of New York City\u2019s jail inmates found serious mental illness and solitary confinement were the strongest factors in suicide attempts.\n\nLindsay Hayes, a national expert on correctional suicide prevention, said jails use isolation with good intentions. \u201cI truly believe that correctional officials and mental health and medical officials and leadership are not intentionally trying to punish people, to create tortuous types of environments,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThey\u2019re just being extremely careful and, in many ways, over-protective and over-reactive.\u201d\n\nA \u201cLonely Cell\u201d and Endless Daylight\n\nTaylor felt worlds away from another human being. In the punishment cell, around the corner from suicide watch, no one walked by. She couldn\u2019t hear voices or the clatter of activity. Distance muted everything.\n\n\u201cIt was the loneliest feeling I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she said. \u201cThat feeling is what made me decide that I wanted to be good and go back to the cell behind the deputies.\u201d\n\nRead More A Year After an Inmate Was Choked to Death in Jail, a Murder Charge but Few Details Lorenzo Herrera, 19, was found dead in a Fresno County Jail cell in March 2018. A man has been charged, but detectives say they\u2019re still trying to determine if there are additional suspects.\n\nThe \u201clonely cell,\u201d as she called it, broke her in less than a day. She apologized. She told deputies she\u2019d learned her lesson. More importantly, Taylor said, \u201cI was just being quiet.\u201d\n\nDeputies moved her back to the suicide watch cell by the desk that Wednesday morning, two days after being booked into the facility, according to jail records.\n\nShe tried to measure the hour by watching how much sunlight streamed onto the jail hallway floor. Peering through the window, she learned to tell time by making mental notes about when one deputy\u2019s shift ended and another person\u2019s began.\n\nShe marked the hours with scraps of food and shreds of a paper plate, but it was all guesswork. The constant light triggered sleep deprivation and confusion. Taylor had lost track of just how long she\u2019d been in Kern County\u2019s jail.\n\nBedbugs, Yoga Mats and a Shrug\n\nIn California, this kind of isolation is entirely permissible.\n\nTo bolster oversight of county jails and distribute funds in the realignment era, state lawmakers created the corrections board. Every two years, it sends an inspector to each facility to make sure sheriffs and their officers are following the rules.\n\nSteven Wicklander, an inspector for the state board, arrived at the Kern County jails in June 2018, a year after Taylor\u2019s arrest. The central receiving jail was in the midst of a bedbug infestation. The sheriff\u2019s staff was not regularly cleaning cell mattresses, Wicklander wrote in his notes. They handed out dirty beds and only washed them when the mattresses were \u201ccontaminated.\u201d\n\nConditions weren\u2019t much better in the newest jail, opened last year and built with $100 million in state funds to cope with an influx of inmates serving longer sentences in county facilities under realignment. Its expansive infirmary is primarily for suicide prevention, and its 14 isolation cells were constantly full.\n\nOver three days, Wicklander toured the suicide watch halls at each jail facility. He saw maxed-out cells and deputies putting suicide watch inmates in safety cells for more than a week straight.\n\n\u201cThe safety cell cannot be used as a substitution for treatment,\u201d Wicklander wrote in his final report in August 2018.\n\nThere were violations at every stop. Kern County jails are so understaffed the sheriff\u2019s office requires deputies to work overtime to cover the shifts, causing deputies to fall behind on safety and security checks. Suicide watch and safety cell practices, particularly the yoga mats, were against the rules.\n\nAgency officials do not have authority to make county leaders change and generally see themselves as partners, not regulators, said Allison Ganter, deputy director overseeing the inspection team.\n\n\u201cWe are not enforcement,\u201d she said.\n\nKern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood speaking at a news conference on Sep. 13, 2018. (The Fresno Bee file photo)\n\nYoungblood and his staff waited eight months to respond to Wicklander\u2019s report.\n\nThey wrote back this April and rejected the board\u2019s findings that yoga mats violated the standards. The sheriff\u2019s office spent $4,500 to buy 60 more mats the same month, finance records show.\n\nYoga mats, they wrote, provide people on suicide watch \u201cthe comfort of padding, albeit minimal, in an environment which is uncomfortable by design.\u201d\n\nA New Caregiver, and a Long Walk Home\n\nAs the week went on, Taylor tried to talk to anyone who walked by her cell. Once, a woman sat near her window, and they chatted briefly about being arrested and their legal cases. \u201cShe was telling me her story, which was almost like my story,\u201d Taylor recalled.\n\nShe tried to get the staff talking. Taylor said she noticed a picture of a puppy on a deputy\u2019s monitor and complimented the pet\u2019s cuteness. The deputy scolded her and turned the screen away.\n\n\u201cThe most exciting part of the day was when they would give me my food because there was actually somebody there,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nSaturday marked her sixth day in the jail. That morning, a different behavioral health specialist met with Taylor and decided that her suicide risk \u2014 however deputies calculated it initially \u2014 was gone. She moved to a space with the rest of the inmates in the jail\u2019s general population ward, where she was thrilled to receive a toothbrush, soap, clothes and a mattress.\n\nDeputies also gave her access to a phone for the first time since she\u2019d been put on suicide watch early Monday morning. Taylor called her mom, who helped arrange for her to post the $35,000 bond. (Two weeks later, prosecutors dropped the charges. Taylor sued the county for wrongful detention, but the suit was dismissed.)\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said it is not permitted to discuss her case under state law and would not answer reporters\u2019 questions about her time in jail.\n\nIt can take hours to be formally released from custody, and oftentimes inmates are released in the middle of the night without reliable transportation. Late Sunday, the doors of the downtown Bakersfield jail swung open for Taylor. A 4-mile walk in the dark awaited her.\n\nShe had been in sweats when police arrested her and didn\u2019t have a bra to wear for the trek home. Taylor asked if she could borrow one of the jail-issued ones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad luck to take anything home from here,\u201d a deputy replied.\n\n\u201cGood advice,\u201d she said.",
