    "content": "On Monday , the Supreme Court refused to take on the issue of gay marriage \u2013 and by doing so , essentially greenlit same-sex marriage across the nation , encouraging low-level courts to continue knocking down traditional marriage laws across the country . Challenges to pro-same-sex marriage rulings in Indiana , Oklahoma , Utah , Virginia and Wisconsin have been rejected , placing all of those states on notice that they must begin issuing marriage licenses to two men or two women .\nThe Court clearly wants to wait until a majority of states have been forced to embrace same-sex marriage by lower-level appeals courts . Then they can determine that a \u201c trend-line \u201d has been established , suggest that society has \u201c evolved , \u201d and declare that a new standard must be enshrined . That , of course , was the logic of Lawrence v. Texas ( 2003 ) , in which the Court waited 17 years to overrule Bowers v. Hardwick ( 1986 ) , stating that anal penetration was a hard-fought Constitutional right ; the Court in that case stated that Bowers no longer applied because of \u201c an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex. \u201d Justice Scalia rightly pointed out that the Court \u2019 s statement was false \u2013 the state , he explained , still regulates \u201c prostitution , adult incest , adultery , obscenity , and child pornography. \u201d And Scalia also pointed out that \u201c Constitutional entitlements do not spring into existence because some States choose to lessen or eliminate criminal sanctions on certain behavior . \u201d\nThey will wait until the time is right , then declare same-sex marriage the law of the land . They have already given lower courts precisely the tools with which to create an \u201c emerging consensus. \u201d Last year , the Court ruled that state attorneys general could simply refuse to defend state laws in favor of traditional marriage , thereby allowing the executive branch of state government to completely destroy law it doesn \u2019 t like .
