    "content": "Ford cars roll off the assembly line in Flat Rock , Mich. , in 2015 . ( Rebecca Cook/Reuters )\nFunny thing about American manufacturing : The good news about what \u2019 s happening at American factories often sounds like bad news to politicians .\nAmerican factories are one of the wonders of the world , and , in spite of what President Donald Trump , Senator Bernie Sanders , and other lightly informed populists claim , they are humming . U.S. manufacturing output is about 68 percent higher today in real terms ( meaning inflation-adjusted terms ) than it was before NAFTA was enacted ; manufacturing output is about double in real terms what it was in the 1980s and more than three times what it was in the 1950s . As our factories grow more efficient , output per man-hour has grown , too , which is what troubles the populists and demagogues : Our factories employ a much smaller share of the U.S. work force than they once did .\nBut it is important to keep in mind : That growth in manufacturing output did not come in spite of the decline in factory employment but partly because of it . Automation not only makes current production more efficient but also makes it easier to improve efficiency in the future : More heavily automated factory processes are much easier to upgrade than are those heavily dependent on human labor .\nThe complaint usually goes something like this : \u201c What good is that increased output if it comes at the expense of good manufacturing jobs ? \u201d Often , this will be accompanied by fictitious claims about Henry Ford \u2019 s paying his workers more so that they could afford to buy his cars , a complete invention that is one of the favorite myths of economic populists of Left and Right .\nHere , we need a little bit less Milton Friedman and a little more Marcus Aurelius : \u201c What is this thing in itself ? What is its purpose ? What does it do ? \u201d\nThe purpose of an automobile factory is not to \u201c create jobs , \u201d as the politicians like to say . Its function is not to add to the employment rolls with good wages and UAW benefits , adding to the local tax base and helping to sustain the community \u2014 as desirable as all those things are . The purpose of an automobile factory is not to create jobs \u2014 it is to create automobiles . Jobs are a means , not an end . Human labor is valuable to the extent that it contributes to human prosperity and human flourishing , not in and of itself as a matter of abstraction .\nThere are cases in which this is so obvious that practically everybody understands it . When we talk about building new pipelines ( and good on the Trump administration for getting out of the way of getting that done ) , our progressive friends sometimes sniff that many of the new jobs associated with that work are \u201c temporary. \u201d ( \u201c Temporary jobs \u201d is a phrase usually delivered with a distinct sniff . ) Here is a little something to consider : Unless you are building the Second Avenue Subway in New York City , all construction jobs are temporary \u2014 buildings get built . Projects come to completion , and work gets finished . It is in the nature of construction jobs to come to an end . And it is not only construction : A technology-industry friend attending the recent \u2588\u2588\u2588 Ideas Summit in Washington bluntly shared the view from Silicon Valley : \u201c All jobs are temporary . \u201d\nConsider this thought experiment : Say that a Star Trek fan manages to invent something like the replicator from that science-fiction series , meaning that all purely material desires can be more or less fulfilled instantly : \u201c Tea , Earl Grey , hot ! \u201d and that \u2019 s that . Such an invention would be devastating for the employment prospects of billions of people , including pretty much everyone on Earth not working in a purely service-oriented or intellectual capacity along with a great many people working in service jobs , too : There are no chai wallahs on the Enterprise .\nBut we would be enormously better off in real terms . There would be no expensive prescription drugs , no shortage of Pappy Van Winkle , no scarcity of ordinary consumable goods at all . Presumably , you could have Michelangelo \u2019 s Piet\u00e0 \u2014 arguably the most beautiful thing made by a man so far \u2014 in your backyard , provided you could figure out a way to move it there .
