Control of the Senate rests in part on what voters think of the president of the United States , but it will also be determined by local disputes and regional quirks\u2014demographics and issues , but also myth-making and self-conception . In this series of articles\u2014this is the fourth\u2014\u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine asked an expert on a state with a crucial statewide race to explain what matters there that doesn \u2019 t matter anywhere else .\nWhen Catherine Cortez Masto became the first Latina elected to the United States Senate , some of Nevada \u2019 s political class called her \u201c the senator from Clark County. \u201d Her victory map from November 2016 looked like a cupful of water at the tip of an upturned gas can . Clark was the only county Cortez Masto won . It \u2019 s home to the Las Vegas Valley , 2.2 million people , and 70 percent of the state \u2019 s electorate . By running up the score in Clark , she did enough to overcome losses in rural counties and a narrow defeat in Washoe County , which encompasses Reno .\nDuring the 2016 presidential election , down-ticket Republicans in other battleground states benefited from Donald Trump \u2019 s wildfire success on issues like trade and immigration . In the diverse city of Las Vegas , Trump \u2019 s rhetoric didn \u2019 t play so well . Hillary Clinton won Nevada . Harry Reid \u2019 s Senate seat went to his chosen successor . Democrats took over the state Legislature . And progressive ballot measures on gun control and recreational marijuana succeeded .\nThe Democrats \u2019 sweeping victory in Nevada proved to be an outlier nationally , and it may be remembered as a local anomaly , too . The race was tight . Cortez Masto , a former state attorney general , defeated Republican congressman Joe Heck by 2.4 percentage points , which is about how close incumbent Republican Senator Dean Heller and his challenger , Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen , are in the latest midterm polls .\nHeller is the only Senate Republican up for reelection in a state Clinton won in 2016 . But the Silver State is still purple . And it takes more than a strong performance in Las Vegas for a Democrat to win Nevada .\nIt \u2019 s already been a strange year in Nevada \u2019 s desert . Brothel owner Dennis Hof , star of the HBO series Cathouse , was poised to join the state Assembly by branding himself \u201c The Trump of Pahrump , \u201d and then died in his sleep after an Oct. 15 birthday rally attended by Joe Arpaio , Grover Norquist , and porn star Ron Jeremy . Hof will remain on the ballot . He is expected to achieve his political dream posthumously , which would force the county to appoint a Republican replacement .\nHof defeated a three-term incumbent in a GOP primary . Whatever aversion voters had to sending a self-identified pimp to the legislature in 2016 , when Hof ran as a Libertarian , seemed to evaporate in the sparsely populated desert enclaves after another reality-star businessman took office . Although 87 percent of Nevada voters live in Clark and Washoe counties , rural enthusiasm for Trump 's agenda can offset Republican losses in Las Vegas if the race is close .\nAnd , as Hof \u2019 s candidacy suggests , Nevada takes pride in its \u201c live and let live \u201d ethos . But campaigns offer competing visions for what that ethos means as political arguments move from rugged mining towns to rural brothels to Sin City .\nTwo years into Trump \u2019 s presidency , it \u2019 s almost unseemly how perfect a microcosm the Las Vegas Strip is of American politics . Trump has his name on the skyline . His friend Steve Wynn , the resort mogul , served as the Republican National Committee finance chair until he resigned in January amid sexual harassment and assault allegations . The most active Republican donor in the country , billionaire Sheldon Adelson , owns the palatial Venetian resort . And then you have the hotel maids , bartenders , cooks , bellhops and cocktail waitresses who make up the Culinary Union , perhaps the most potent force for Nevada Democrats to galvanize voters each election cycle .\n\u201c The army on the ground is fueled by labor , \u201d says Megan Jones , a political consultant and former Harry Reid adviser . \u201c The unions know how to knock on doors and have conversations with voters on issues they care about and translate that into action . But Nevada in general is a transient place . Walking door-to-door is not always as easy as it is in places like Iowa . We have to do a lot of layering in communication\u2014that means TV , mail , radio , phone calls , texts and canvassing door to door . \u201d\n\u201c You go into every race knowing it \u2019 s going to be a 2-point deal one way or the other , \u201d says Jeremy Hughes , a Republican campaign strategist . \u201c It \u2019 s hard to get noticed , I think due to it being a 24/7 place with lots going on . You have to do a lot of work . Washoe County is going to be a shoe-leather deal , Vegas you got to be on TV , then the rural areas are where Republicans can rack up votes . \u201d\nHeller hopes to rekindle the mystique he showed in 2012 , when Nevada split its ticket between the Republican moderate and then President Barack Obama . In 2016 , Heller said he was \u201c 100 percent against Clinton , 99 percent against Trump. \u201d He needs Trump \u2019 s base , though , and the president has said that despite early differences , the two men \u201c love each other \u201d now .\nAfter Heller blocked efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act , which many Nevadans rely on , Trump asked whether he \u201c wants to remain a senator \u201d at a televised luncheon in 2017 . Then Heller voted for the \u201c skinny repeal , \u201d a shift Democrats have used to label him \u201c Senator Spineless. \u201d Libertarians , voters concerned about gun rights and federal land use , evangelical Christians , Mormons , and the business community are his bedrock support .\nRosen is a former computer programmer and a first-term congresswoman whose district includes Henderson , a critical swing suburb of Las Vegas . Yet her polling with the Democratic base is underwhelming . Cortez Masto had support from 69 percent of Hispanics in October of 2016 , while Rosen is at 52 percent . Women favor her by 1 percent . She may need \u201c The Reid Machine , \u201d the coalition of union members , their families , and former campaign aides to Harry Reid who are actively canvassing in Reno and Las Vegas , to outdo itself .\n\u201c In 2008 , Obama brought in a digital guru , and through the dark magic of voter targeting had a record win , \u201d says Steve Sebelius , a longtime Nevada political analyst , referring to a Democrat-over-Republican advantage in voter registration . There are 1.56 million registered voters in the state , and Democrats now hold a 75,000-person advantage .\n\u201c Reid had the infrastructure , and Obama poured the nitrous oxide into the engine , and they really supercharged that thing , \u201d Sebelius says . \u201c The question now becomes , with some of that Reid infrastructure still there , is it going to perform as well ? We saw in 2016 Hillary Clinton won the state\u2014it performed somewhat well\u2014but is it going to energize the base this time around ? \u201d\nVeterans issues have dominated ads from Heller , who hopes to win over the state \u2019 s 225,000 retired service members . The Air Force Thunderbirds and the Navy \u2019 s elite fighter pilot program , Top Gun , use the mountainous desert terrain for combat exercises and as a bomb range . Drone missions are piloted out of Clark County . The active-duty population is only about 10,000 members , but military veterans often retire to Nevada whether it \u2019 s their final posting or not . \u201c Retirees in general like to move to Southern Nevada for the climate , health concerns , and the region \u2019 s affordability , \u201d says Sebelius . Rosen is courting seniors by vowing to protect Medicare , Medicaid and the Obamacare provisions regarding pre-existing conditions .\nThen there \u2019 s the question of Latino turnout . Fernando Romero , president of Hispanics in Politics , still remembers the hug he received from Harry Reid in 2010 , the midterm year Democrats took a \u201c shellacking , \u201d as Obama put it .
