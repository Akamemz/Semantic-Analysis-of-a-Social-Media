    "content": "Other Republican lawmakers appeared mortified about the growing size of the spending bill , bickering over which policies to remove and warning that miscalculations could allow Democrats to seize control of the White House and Senate in November .\n\u201c What in the hell are we doing , \u201d Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Tex . ) asked his colleagues at the lunch with White House officials , according to several participants who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the exchange . Cruz was incensed at the push among his colleagues to boost spending levels even more .\nThe whole process now appears likely to spill into August , something the White House and congressional Democrats had hoped to avoid , because it would mean more than 20 million Americans would lose emergency unemployment benefits when they expire at the end of this month . They have not mapped out a plan for what would happen to these people as the pandemic \u2019 s turmoil continues to weigh on the U.S. economy .\nThe White House did not go into the talks with a preset strategy or a list of proposals that they knew GOP lawmakers would rally behind . This miscalculation created immediate problems . Numerous demands the White House had tried to formulate over the weekend were erased within hours .\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday that the goal was to keep the spending bill around $ 1 trillion , but by Tuesday he had abandoned that mantra . White House officials also backed away from demands for cuts to testing and health funds , and they retreated after a barrage of criticism of President Trump \u2019 s tax cut demand .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 re going to spend what we need to spend , and we \u2019 re going to make sure we don \u2019 t spend more than that , \u201d Mnuchin said .\nDemocrats pointed fingers at the Republican infighting and said the White House and GOP leaders were unprepared to handle the country \u2019 s mounting economic and health care challenges . House Democrats passed a $ 3 trillion spending bill in May that would send another round of stimulus checks , provide more money to states , and help hospitals , among other things , but the White House has vowed to block it .\n\u201c Republicans are in complete disarray , \u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) said . \u201c Totally incompetent . Totally in disarray . Totally at war with one another . \u201d\nIn an effort to bridge differences , Mnuchin , White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow met with Senate Republicans over lunch . But that led to little progress , as Republicans made clear to Mnuchin and Meadows that they were not supportive of Trump \u2019 s insistence on a payroll tax cut or curbed funding for coronavirus tests and the CDC . Mnuchin on Monday had insisted the payroll tax idea was in the bill , but he didn \u2019 t even bring it up during the lunch as the opposition snowballed , two people briefed on the interaction said .\n\u201c We haven \u2019 t reached a conclusion on anything , \u201d Sen. John Neely Kennedy ( R-La . ) said when the lunch ended .\nMeadows acknowledged the discontent , telling reporters , \u201c Well as you can imagine , any time you have Senate Republicans there , you have a number of different thoughts on what should or should not happen . \u201d\nThe White House and Senate Republican leaders had tried over the weekend to put together a joint deal to bring to Democrats , but those efforts did not lead to a unified GOP position . Talks bogged down over Trump \u2019 s insistence for the tax cut , something he has pushed since last year to force into law without any success . Some also bristled at Trump \u2019 s insistence for curbing coronavirus testing funds and a new requirement that aid to schools would be contingent on reopening plans .\nUnderlying the confusion surrounding the GOP stimulus package are tensions among Trump administration officials about their priorities .\nTrump is being represented on Capitol Hill by Mnuchin and Meadows , a tandem that hasn \u2019 t brokered a deal jointly with Congress before . Trump has for months privately worried that Mnuchin , his chief negotiator with Democrats , was giving away too much to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) , leading conservative lawmakers to push for Meadows to have a more active role in the current round of talks . Before joining the White House , Meadows was a congressman and leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus . Mnuchin , meanwhile , has a background as a banker and a Hollywood producer with few ties to the conservative movement .\nOn Tuesday , Meadows sat toward the back of the room and deferred to Mnuchin as he led the conversation with the GOP senators , according to two people aware of the meeting granted anonymity to share private conversations . Mnuchin discussed the importance of sending another round of stimulus checks and providing more money for the Paycheck Protection Program .\nMnuchin also told reporters it was important for lawmakers to reach an agreement before the supplemental increase in unemployment benefits runs out by the end of this month . Republican lawmakers , including Trump , have consistently bashed that benefit increase because they believe it makes it more lucrative for workers to stay home than reenter the labor market , but Mnuchin stressed the importance of providing some financial cushion for the jobless .\n\u201c Our objective is to try to get something done before the enhanced unemployment insurance expires . There \u2019 s a lot of people who are still out of work , \u201d Mnuchin said . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) told reporters , though , that it was very unlikely a deal would be reached by the end of next week , laughing and saying \u201c no \u201d when asked if that was possible .\nWithin hours on Tuesday , it became clear the White House was already backpedaling on several of their demands \u2014 before negotiations with Democrats had even begun . Mnuchin and Meadows met with Senate Republican appropriators in the morning and appeared convinced to reverse course on the funding curbs , as Republicans had sought $ 25 billion for states for testing and tracing that the administration had initially opposed .\n\u201c We \u2019 re moving in the right direction on all fronts ... We are making good progress , \u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt ( R-Mo . ) , a senior Appropriations Committee member , when asked about the disagreement over money for testing .\nParticipants cautioned talks were ongoing and nothing had been finalized .\nWhite House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that the White House is seeking \u201c targeted \u201d money for testing , saying that \u201c we \u2019 re willing to put in money for targeted testing that makes sense , not just dumping money into a pot that contains $ 10 billion . \u201d\nSome experts said lawmakers should both approve more money and have the administration send it out more quickly .\n\u201c States have been using some of this money , but the problem is that it \u2019 s not enough and easy for the states to draw down , \u201d said Sam Hammond , a policy expert at the Niskanen Center , a think tank that has been working with Senate Republicans on bolstering testing . \u201c The scale of the problem will require a lot more money than they have so far . \u201d\nThese programs are just one part of what the administration and McConnell had envisioned as a $ 1 trillion package that is likely to be the last major coronavirus relief bill before the election .\nAfter attending the Senate Republican conference lunch the White House envoys met with Pelosi and Schumer .\n\u201c We will begin our conversations today . It is my hope that we can resolve our differences and have a bill by the end of next week , \u201d Pelosi told fellow Democrats on a conference call Tuesday morning , according to a person on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal conversations .\nThere has been little GOP enthusiasm for the payroll tax cut plan , even though Trump has said he might not sign a bill that doesn \u2019 t include it . And GOP leaders are expecting a hard sell Tuesday but appear unwavering . Only a small handful of Senate Republicans \u2014 including Sens . Lindsey O. Graham ( S.C. ) and Steve Daines ( Mont . ) have endorsed the payroll tax cut as a sound policy .\nBut multiple senators and aides said Mnuchin didn \u2019 t even talk about the payroll tax cut in the Senate GOP lunch . Instead he was confronted by multiple complaints about the size of the emerging package , with some lawmakers who had voted for the $ 2 trillion Cares Act in March saying they couldn \u2019 t support the new package if it exceeds $ 1 trillion .\nInside the lunch , GOP senators voiced discontent over several components of the emerging aid package , whether it involved provisions pushed by the administration and the apparent ballooning size of the plan , according to multiple officials directly familiar with the private gathering . All of the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the closed-door discussion .\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley ( R-Iowa ) argued against the payroll tax cut , making the case that no voters would notice the tax relief and that he was skeptical that the policy changes could even be implemented before October .\nThough the payroll tax cut remains a top priority of Trump , his top lieutenants inside the meeting made little apparent effort to sell the policy on Republican senators , who largely remain opposed to the proposal .\nElectoral politics were also in consideration .

So spending a bit more money now in a rescue bill that would aid Republicans in their races would be cheaper in the long run , he argued . Cotton is also up for reelection this November but is not considered to be in a competitive race .\nBut Cotton \u2019 s viewpoint appeared to clash with that of Cruz , who vigorously warned against spending too much money over on the package .\nCruz said the GOP should be focused on a safe restart of the economy and warned that if the economy remains shuttered in November , that Democrats will win both the White House and the Senate and that Republican senators , who usually meet in the ornate Mansfield room in the Capitol , will \u201c be meeting in a much smaller lunch room . \u201d\nMnuchin , who met with Republican senators before he was to huddle with the Democratic leaders , stressed to the GOP lawmakers that he will not launch into negotiations this afternoon with Democrats and that he would be in more of a listening mode with them .\nEarlier , McConnell gave some details of the emerging GOP plan Tuesday in remarks on the Senate floor .\nHe said it would include $ 105 billion to help schools reopen , another round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses , more stimulus checks to individual Americans , incentives for hiring and retaining workers , and reimbursement for businesses to establish safety measures .\n\u201c The American job market needs another shot of adrenaline , \u201d McConnell said . \u201c Senate Republicans are laser-focused on getting American workers their jobs back . \u201d\nTrump has already enacted four laws that provided close to $ 3 trillion in new tax cuts and spending to try to help the economy and health-care industry navigate the coronavirus pandemic .
