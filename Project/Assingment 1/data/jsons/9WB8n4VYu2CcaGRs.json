    "content": "With less than a week to go until another potential partial federal government shutdown begins on Friday , bipartisan compromise talks on funding for President Trump 's proposed border wall have completely broken down , sources tell Fox News .\nThe sudden development again raised the possibility that Trump will declare a national emergency to access previously appropriated funds to initiate construction on a border wall . The White House agreed to a temporary spending bill late last month to end a historic 35-day government shutdown , although Trump said at the time that the move was not a `` concession '' and that he would not relent on his demands for a wall .\n`` Talks have broken down because Senate Republicans are refusing to compromise on limits to the Trump administration \u2019 s cruel immigration policies , '' a senior Democratic aide told Fox News on Sunday . `` A deal that includes new physical barriers must also include limits on the number of ICE detention beds . If Senate Republicans won \u2019 t compromise with us on both , we can \u2019 t reach a deal . \u201d\nAdded a GOP source : `` The wall is a red herring for the Democrats . We got stuck on an interior enforcement cap . '' Such a cap would effectively limit ICE 's ability to house illegal immigrants caught domestically by reducing the number of available beds in detention centers . The goal , Democrats say , is to force the Trump administration to prioritize arresting and deporting only violent criminals and dangerous offenders .\nFox News is told if negotiators can \u2019 t resolve the situation soon , they are likely looking at trying to pass another temporary continuing resolution to try to avoid a shutdown .\nSpeaking on `` Fox News Sunday , '' Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby , R-Ala. , who is leading negotiations on border wall funding , said Republicans do n't want to offer concessions on ICE enforcement .\n\u201c I think the talks are stalled right now . I \u2019 m hoping we can get off the dime later today or in the morning , because time is ticking away , but we \u2019 ve got some problems with the Democrats dealing with ICE , that is detaining criminals that come into the U.S. and they want a cap on them , '' Shelby said . `` We don \u2019 t want a cap on that . ''\nIn response to the news , Trump suggested on Sunday that Democrats are hoping to force another shutdown .\n`` I don \u2019 t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal , '' Trump wrote , referring to the bipartisan congressional committee working on a compromise . `` They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now , out of the blue , want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention ! ''\nTrump added : `` It was a very bad week for the Democrats , with the GREAT economic numbers , The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address . Now , with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee , I actually believe they want a Shutdown . They want a new subject ! ''\nAs recently as last Friday , congressional negotiators said they expected a deal to be made , although some key players were pessimistic and Democrats indicated that money for physical barriers would likely end up well below the $ 5.7 billion that Trump has sought to begin construction of the wall .\nDEMS PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED FAR MORE EXPENSIVE SECURE FENCE ACT -- WHAT CHANGED ?\nThe amount discussed hovered much closer to $ 1.6 billion , participants in the negotiations said , a figure that was in a bipartisan Senate bill last year .\n`` That 's what we 're working toward , '' said California Democratic Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard .\nSpeaking separately to `` Fox News Sunday , '' Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said that an emergency declaration might not be required .\n`` There are other funds of money that are available to [ Trump ] through something called reprogramming , there is money he can get at and is legally allowed to spend , '' Mulvaney said , noting that some funds were available even without declaring an emergency . `` And I think it needs to be said again and again this is going to be legal -- - there are statutes on the book as to how any president can do this . ''\nStill , Mulvaney asserted that a national emergency was `` absolutely on the table '' and said that a wall will be built , one way or another .\n`` The president is going to build the wall , '' Mulvaney said . `` You saw what the Vice President said there , and that \u2019 s our attitude at this point , is we will take as much money as you can give us and then we will go find money someplace else legally in order to secure that southern barrier . But this is going to get built with or without Congress . ''\nEarlier this weekend , Democrats seemed to draw a firm line on spending .\n`` Throughout the talks , Democrats have insisted that a border security compromise not be overly reliant on physical barriers , '' said Evan Hollander , spokesman for Democrats who control the House Appropriations Committee . `` We will not agree to $ 2 billion in funding for barriers . ''\nThe White House has previously offered a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) recipients , in exchange for the $ 5.7 billion Trump has been seeking for a barrier along the nation 's southern border with Mexico . The offered deal would also extend protections for 300,000 recipients of the Temporary Protected Status ( TPS ) program -- which protects immigrants from designated countries with conditions that prevent nationals from returning safely .\nBut Democrats have called the border wall nothing more than a political stunt that they will never agree to fund , while Republicans point to what they have called a `` crisis '' at the border . Central Americans are increasingly entering the United States illegally in groups of at least 100 people in rugged , remote stretches of the Mexican border , authorities said Friday upon releasing January figures that show total arrests fell for a second straight month .\nTRUMP TO PELOSI : IF WALLS ARE IMMORAL , WHY NOT TEAR DOWN EXISTING WALLS TOO ?\n`` The president is going to build the wall . '' \u2014 Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\nA group of 325 Central Americans surrendered to agents Thursday near Lukeville , Ariz. , according to Customs and Border Protection . Migrants told authorities that buses and trucks dropped them off throughout the night on a nearby Mexican highway that runs parallel to the border and they entered the U.S. together to wait for agents to find them . There were nearly 150 children , including 32 who were traveling alone .\nThe Border Patrol has encountered groups of at least 100 people 60 times since Oct. 1 , compared to 13 during the entire 2018 fiscal year and two in the 2017 fiscal year , officials said . Many are in the desolate New Mexico Bootheel and Arizona deserts .\nIt is unclear what 's driving the sudden uptick of large groups in remote areas , but families , many of them Central American asylum seekers , make up a large and growing percentage of arrests across the border .\nU.S. authorities arrested or stopped people for immigration violations 58,207 times in January , down 4 percent from 60,779 in December but up 62 percent from 35,905 in January 2018 .
