Vince Warren ?\nVINCENT WARREN : Yeah , those three executive orders are pretty much right out of the National Fraternal Order of Police playbook . The sum total of those three orders means massive new resources going to law enforcement on the federal , state and local level . The order that has to deal with police officers , that you were mentioning , really is the beginnings of what we \u2019 re calling a blue lives matter regime . We \u2019 ve been seeing this in states where there are increased penalties that people\u2014criminal penalties for assaulting , sometimes even insulting , police officers , the idea that\u2014built on the idea that if you \u2019 re black or if you \u2019 re gay or if you \u2019 re a woman and someone assaults you , that it is worse and there should be penalty enhancement for that . We \u2019 re seeing that for police officers , which doesn \u2019 t make sense .\nThe other piece that I think is significant is in the\u2014one of the executive orders that you mentioned , where the attorney general is to look at crime reduction . Crime is not going up . It hasn \u2019 t been going up for 30 , 40 years . It \u2019 s going down . The other part of that executive order was talking about restoring public safety , as if we don \u2019 t have public safety now . But significantly\u2014and you pointed this out\u2014the attorney general has to look at rising crime in three areas : drug trafficking , violent crime and then illegal immigration . This is the first time that I have seen the status of being undocumented looked at as a crime that has to be reduced through enhanced punishment , through enhanced things like that . That \u2019 s the big problem that we need to keep our eye on .\nAMY GOODMAN : And that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re going to look at next , a woman who , in the midst of all this , who \u2019 s lived here for 21 years , the mom of two American-born children in Arizona , was deported yesterday .
