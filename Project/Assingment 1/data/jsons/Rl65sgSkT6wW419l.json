    "content": "Paul Manafort , who reportedly was a recipient of $ 12.7m in Ukraine , helped Viktor Yanukovych to victory . Could he do the same for Trump ?\nThe scene was Ostroh , western Ukraine , on the eve of parliamentary elections .\nA tall figure bounded on to a stage to cheers from a crowd of elderly flag-waving supporters . They chanted : \u201c Yan-u-kov-ych , Yan-u-kov-ych . \u201d\nThe man addressing them was Viktor Yanukovych , who at this point \u2013 autumn 2007 \u2013 was Ukraine \u2019 s pro-Russian prime minister . Three years earlier he had tried to cheat his way to victory in the country \u2019 s presidential election , triggering the pro-democracy uprising known as the Orange Revolution , which swept Yanukovych \u2019 s rival Viktor Yushchenko into power .\nTrump chair Paul Manafort : 'mercenary ' lobbyist and valuable asset Read more\nNow , barely three years later , Yanukovych was back , and his Party of Regions was ahead in the polls .\nThe person who masterminded Yanukovych \u2019 s unlikely political comeback was not \u2013 as might have been expected \u2013 a Russian , like the advisers dispatched by Vladimir Putin to mastermind Yanukovych \u2019 s disastrous 2004 presidential bid .\nIt was an American , and his name was Paul Manafort \u2013 previously a consultant for Ronald Reagan , George HW Bush and Bob Dole , and today the campaign chairman for Donald Trump .\nManafort \u2019 s years in Ukraine have come under renewed scrutiny during the current US presidential campaign . On Monday , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign leapt on a report in the New York Times that handwritten ledgers found in the Ukraine show $ 12.7m in undisclosed payments to Manafort from the Party of Regions .\n\u201c This is a serious matter and there are real concerns about the pro-Kremlin interests engaged with the Trump team , \u201d said Clinton \u2019 s campaign manager , Robby Mook .\nManafort has denied any wrongdoing . A source who worked with him in Ukraine said on Tuesday : \u201c If there was cash I would have known about it and seen it . I was going in and out of the Party of Regions HQ every day . \u201d\nEven before the latest allegations , Trump \u2019 s links to Russia have raised eyebrows : Manafort \u2019 s candidate has expressed admiration for Putin , encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails , and appeared unaware that Russian troops had seized the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea .\nIf he can make Yanukovych president , I \u2019 m sure he can do it with Trump Oleg Voloshin\nMeanwhile , the Trump campaign was reportedly instrumental in rewriting the new Republican platform to remove calls for the donation of weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forces .\nIt remains unclear how much of this was down to Manafort . What is indisputable is that at the same time as he was advising Yanukovych , Manafort was also building personal business links with some of the most powerful figures in the post-Soviet world .\nBefore his arrival in Kiev , Manafort had long specialised in taking on unsavoury clients , such as Ferdinand Marcos , the Filipino dictator , and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire , and subtly retooling their public reputations .\nHe was recruited to work in Ukraine in the summer of 2005 by the oligarch Rinat Akhmetov \u2013 the main financial backer of Yanukovych \u2019 s Party of Regions .\nThat autumn , Manafort and his team \u2013 including longtime aide Rick Gates , another future Trump hire \u2013 began work for the Party of Regions . They rented an anonymous office at number 4 Sophia Street in Kiev , opposite the stop for the 16 and 18 trolley buses . Typically , its white blinds were drawn .\nThe Americans kept a low profile , but Manafort \u2019 s efforts didn \u2019 t go entirely unnoticed . In a 2006 cable to the state department in Washington , US diplomats reported that the Party of Regions had undergone a mysterious transformation . \u201c Long a haven for Donetsk-based mobsters and oligarchs it is in the midst of an \u2018 extreme makeover \u2019 , \u201d they observed .\nThe party had enlisted \u201c help and advice from veteran K street political tacticians \u201d , the diplomats said , referring to Washington DC \u2019 s lobbying district . Manafort \u2019 s firm \u2013 Davis , Manafort & Freedman \u2013 was busy \u201c nipping and tucking \u201d . Its goal was to rid the party of its gangster image and to change it into a \u201c legitimate political force \u201d .\nI met Manafort in September 2007 , on the eve of the Ostroh rally . This was just before the parliamentary elections , and Yanukovych was frantically touring the regions on a campaign helicopter .\nClose up , Manafort looked every inch the classic Washington lobbyist . He wore an expensive suit and tie and exuded seriousness . He also bore a faint physical resemblance to his client \u2013 even their hairstyles were similar . ( Manafort , I was told later , had instructed Yanukovych to blow-dry his hair . Manafort \u2019 s camp denies this . )\nThe American had an interesting story to tell \u2013 one which may sound familiar to observers of Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign \u2013 of how his candidate had been almost wilfully misunderstood by the west , especially by its media .\nThe new Yanukovych was nothing like the old one , Manafort suggested . He had absorbed the lessons of his previous defeats , was studying English \u2013 and was even playing tennis with the US ambassador .\n\u201c People are still looking at the political system in this country through the prism of 2004 , \u201d Manafort told me . \u201c That \u2019 s not at all the situation here . \u201d\nYanukovych was no puppet of Putin , Manafort said ; he wanted a pragmatic foreign policy \u2013 good relations with Russia and the EU .\n\u201c As a person , he [ Yanukovych ] is growing , \u201d Manafort assured me . \u201c I think the time out of power helped him . \u201d\nManafort introduced professional techniques . He gathered polling data , worked on messaging and distributed talking points . His efforts were at least partially successful : Yanukovych \u2019 s Party of Regions won the 2007 parliamentary elections , and in 2010 Yanukovych beat his rival Yulia Tymoshenko in a presidential runoff . Within a few months , it had become clear that he was hellbent on reversing the modest democratic gains of the Orange Revolution .\nYanukovych moved quickly to consolidate all instruments of power : the courts , parliament , the prosecutor \u2019 s office , the media and TV . Tymoshenko was charged with corruption and jailed ; Yankovych repeatedly shrugged off western calls for her release .\nIn late 2013 , Yanukovych was due to sign an association agreement with the European Union , but at the last minute he dumped the plan and instead accepted a $ 15bn Kremlin bailout .\nPro-EU demonstrators flooded the Maidan , Kiev \u2019 s main square , and protests turned violent after a brutal crackdown by security forces .\nIn February 2014 , riot police shot dead 100 people in downtown Kiev . Yanukovych abandoned his palace on the outskirts of town , Mezhyhirya \u2013 a Versailles of sorts with a pirate-themed restaurant and private zoo \u2013 and escaped to Russia .\nPutin exploited this crisis to seize Crimea and launch a covert military invasion of eastern Ukraine . The consequences \u2013 10,000 dead , a civilian jet shot down , a country chopped up \u2013 haunt the region to this day . Earlier this month , Russia claimed Ukrainian agents had attacked Crimea , further fueling tensions in the region .\nThose who worked with Manafort say that he can not be blamed for the Ukrainian disaster . Oleg Voloshin , a former aide to Kostyantyn Gryshchenko , Yanukovych \u2019 s 2010-12 foreign minister who now works as a political consultant , says Manafort urged Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda .\nVoloshin still has ties with the ex-Party of Regions , which Manafort rebranded in 2014 as the Opposition Bloc . ( Manafort \u2019 s consultancy in Ukraine continued until at least parliamentary elections in 2014 . )\nHe suggests that Yanukovych \u201c listened to what Paul said \u201d between 2007-2010 , but then , once he became president , stopped listening \u2013 with catastrophic results .\nManafort \u2019 s advice was always non-ideological , Voloshin recalls . He would calmly explain : \u201c These people won \u2019 t vote for you , don \u2019 t bother with them , \u201d and then suggest he \u201c promote this message , promote that message \u201d . \u201c It was a very American approach . Do this , do that. \u201d And , crucially : \u201c He was the person dragging Yanukovych to the west . \u201d\nAccording to Voloshin , Manafort was an advocate of US interests and promoted American oil companies such as Chevron \u2013 so much so that the joke inside the Party of Regions was that Manafort was actually from the CIA . \u201c You can blame him for whatever . The only thing you can \u2019 t blame him for is lack of will in lobbying for American interests in Ukraine in the commercial sphere . \u201d\nVoloshin insists that it was Manafort who persuaded Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda , arguing that it would counter Yanukovych \u2019 s sagging ratings . Manafort also strongly objected to Tymoshenko \u2019 s imprisonment , telling Yanukovych bluntly : \u201c You are going to have very bad times with the west . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s not Paul \u2019 s fault that Yanukovych didn \u2019 t listen to him . If it weren \u2019 t for Paul , Ukraine would have gone under Russia much earlier , \u201d Voloshin claims .\nDuring the period that he was advising Yanukovych , Manafort \u2019 s interests in the post-Soviet world were not restricted to politics .\nIn 2007 , he set up a private equity firm called Pericles Emerging Partners LP .\nBased offshore in the Caymans , the firm had three American partners \u2013 Manafort , Rick Gates and Rick Davis . Davis had cofounded Davis Manafort , Manfort \u2019 s lobbying company in Delaware . The new firm \u2019 s aim was to make investments in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev , Odessa and Mariupol . It would acquire small companies , consolidate them into larger national enterprises , then sell them on .\nOne of those tempted by this prospectus was the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska , an aluminum baron and close friend of Putin , who stumped up almost $ 19m . Gates , Manafort \u2019 s right-hand man , sealed the agreement in trips to Moscow .\nWhat happened next was strange indeed . Only one investment by Pericles was ever made , in a Ukrainian telecoms company called Black Sea Cable . According to court documents , the cash was funnelled into various offshore companies , including one called CardMan ImpEx Corp , registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands . The trail wound through other opaque shell firms , including Cascado AG , set up by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca .\nA search of the Panama Papers leak gives a few details . Cascado has two Latvian directors , Erik Vanagels and Stan Gorin . In reality , they are mere nominees . The pair have been linked on paper to a network of offshore companies and multimillion-dollar scams involving Ukrainian state assets .\nWhen the global financial crisis hit in 2008 , Deripaska wanted out \u2013 and his cash back . In 2011 , the Americans emailed to say that it was proving tricky to sell Deripaska \u2019 s stake because of \u201c market conditions \u201d . Further emails went unanswered .\n\u201c It appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have simply disappeared , \u201d Deripaska \u2019 s frustrated lawyers wrote , in a 2014 petition to have Manafort \u2019 s firm wound up .\nIt \u2019 s unclear if Deripaska ever got his money . Either way , the episode illustrates Manafort \u2019 s personal links to figures close to Putin .\nLater , Manafort introduced Deripaska to Senator John McCain , when the oligarch was having problems travelling to the US . ( In 2006 , the US had revoked Deripaska \u2019 s visa , citing alleged \u201c criminal associations \u201d . Deripaska denies the allegation , and his visa was subsequently reinstated . )\nThis wasn \u2019 t the only embarrassing legal scrape arising from Manafort \u2019 s capitalist adventures . In November 2011 , Tymoshenko unsuccessfully sued him and several of her political opponents in the district court in New York . Her lengthy writ alleged that Manafort \u201c played a key role in [ a ] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise \u201d to launder cash for Yanukovych \u2019 s oligarch friends and invest it in New York real estate .\nIn particular , she pointed the finger at Dmitry Firtash , a Ukrainian businessman whose generous contributions helped Yanukovych . Firtash is a shareholder and public face for RosUkrEnergo , an intermediary company co-owned by Gazprom , which imports gas from Russia and resells it to Ukraine . Tymoshenko tried unsuccessfully to get rid of it .\nThe RusUkrEnergo scheme was a mechanism for corruption , she alleged in legal filings . Its real owner , she claimed , was Semyon Mogilevich , a Ukrainian-Russian mobster , and one of the FBI \u2019 s top fugitives . Firtash denies this .\nAccording to her writ , Firtash and his companies and associates were able to skim billions of dollars from gas transactions . The cash was laundered \u201c through a labyrinth of shell companies \u201d . It was then returned to Ukraine , with the money used to bribe Ukrainian officials .\nManafort sells the unsellable product . If you have a dead horse and you need to sell it , you call him Alex Kovzhun\n\u201c Defendant Paul J Manafort is a well-known Washington D.C. lobbyist and political consultant . He is the senior partner in the firm Davis , Manafort and Freedman . Manafort also worked in Ukraine on various political campaigns , including the successful 2010 presidential campaign of Victor Yanukovych , who is the president of Ukraine at present . Manafort played a key role in the defendants \u2019 conspiracy and racketeering enterprise , \u201d the writ said .\nFirtash , who declined to be interviewed for this article , denies the claims . In 2014 , a federal judge threw out Tymoshenko \u2019 s lawsuit , saying that she had failed to show that Firtash and other defendants had laundered money in the U.S to help pay off Yanukovych \u2019 s supporters in Ukraine . The judge also said the allegations were outside US jurisdiction .\nCaught between Russia and the US ? The curious case of Ukraine 's Dmytro Firtash Read more\nThat same year Firtash was arrested on a US warrant in Vienna , accused of bribing Indian officials over a titanium deal . But an Austrian judge denied a US extradition request and agreed with Firtash that it was politically motivated . The US is appealing , and Firtash remains in Austria .\nFirtash did invest money in Manafort \u2019 s real estate projects , however . The two met in 2008 . Manafort \u2019 s plan was to buy the site of the demolished Drake Hotel in Manhattan and to redevelop it at a cost of almost $ 900m . Firtash transferred at least $ 25m to the project . Tymoshenko alleged that the plan was never serious , with the cash merely transferred for the purposes of money laundering .\n\u201c Group DF and Firtash never had any intention to purchase the Drake property , but instead used the real estate project as a vehicle for investing $ 25 million in New York bank accounts , \u201d her writ stated .\nManafort did not respond to a request by \u2588\u2588\u2588 for comment on Deripaska \u2019 s loan or the Drake Hotel allegations .\nIn the run-up to November \u2019 s vote , Trump \u2019 s own real estate transactions have been extensively investigated , but it remains unclear if any Russian cash has actually been leveraged in these deals .\nIn a statement on Monday , Manafort denied that he had received any irregular payments in Ukraine . \u201c The simplest answer is the truth : I am a campaign professional . It is well known that I do work in the United States and have done work on overseas campaigns as well . I have never received a single \u2018 off-the-books cash payment \u2019 as falsely \u2018 reported \u2019 by The New York Times , nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia . \u201d\nTrump 's new right-hand man has history of controversial clients and deals Read more\nBut Manafort \u2019 s critics in Kiev are scathing . \u201c He \u2019 s an evil genius , \u201d Alex Kovzhun , who spent a decade working for Tymoshenko , beginning in 2001 , said . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t work statesmen . He works dictators and all-round bastards . He sells the unsellable product . If you have a dead horse and you need to sell it , you call him .\nManafort \u2019 s specialism , according to Kovzhun , is running expensive campaigns and targeting the \u201c great unwashed \u201d .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the same element who voted for Putin , supported Brexit , back Erdo\u011fan and who will vote for Trump . Manafort works the lowest common denominator . I find him repulsive and his message ugly . He leaves destruction in his wake . \u201d\nKovzhun said he recognised the same \u201c moves \u201d in Manafort \u2019 s campaigns for Yanukovych and Trump . He gets his clients to do \u201c corny stuff \u201d , Kovzhun added , with \u201c bland political slogans \u201d and \u201c uncreative Soviet-style imagery \u201d . \u201c With Yanukovych it was : \u2018 I \u2019 ll hear everyone. \u2019 With Trump , it \u2019 s : \u2018 Make America great again . \u2019 \u201d\nIn contrast , Voloshin portrays the decade Manafort spent in Ukraine as a success . \u201c In 2004 , Yanukovych was seen as a Russian puppet . He was dead . Paul resurrected him . \u201d\nCan Manafort work his magic one more time ? \u201c The tougher the client you have , the the greater success you get . It isn \u2019 t about the money . It \u2019 s about ambition . If he can make Yanukovych president , I \u2019 m sure he can do it with Trump . \u201d",

(Manafort\u2019s consultancy in Ukraine continued until at least parliamentary elections in 2014.)\n\nHe suggests that Yanukovych \u201clistened to what Paul said\u201d between 2007-2010, but then, once he became president, stopped listening \u2013 with catastrophic results.\n\nManafort\u2019s advice was always non-ideological, Voloshin recalls. He would calmly explain: \u201cThese people won\u2019t vote for you, don\u2019t bother with them,\u201d and then suggest he \u201cpromote this message, promote that message\u201d. \u201cIt was a very American approach. Do this, do that.\u201d And, crucially: \u201cHe was the person dragging Yanukovych to the west.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Voloshin, Manafort was an advocate of US interests and promoted American oil companies such as Chevron \u2013 so much so that the joke inside the Party of Regions was that Manafort was actually from the CIA. \u201cYou can blame him for whatever.

Manafort also strongly objected to Tymoshenko\u2019s imprisonment, telling Yanukovych bluntly: \u201cYou are going to have very bad times with the west.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Paul\u2019s fault that Yanukovych didn\u2019t listen to him. If it weren\u2019t for Paul, Ukraine would have gone under Russia much earlier,\u201d Voloshin claims.\n\nDuring the period that he was advising Yanukovych, Manafort\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet world were not restricted to politics.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, he set up a private equity firm called Pericles Emerging Partners LP.\n\n\n\nBased offshore in the Caymans, the firm had three American partners \u2013 Manafort, Rick Gates and Rick Davis. Davis had cofounded Davis Manafort, Manfort\u2019s lobbying company in Delaware. The new firm\u2019s aim was to make investments in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev, Odessa and Mariupol.

The pair have been linked on paper to a network of offshore companies and multimillion-dollar scams involving Ukrainian state assets.\n\n\n\nWhen the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Deripaska wanted out \u2013 and his cash back. In 2011, the Americans emailed to say that it was proving tricky to sell Deripaska\u2019s stake because of \u201cmarket conditions\u201d. Further emails went unanswered.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko alleged that Manafort \u2018played a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u2019. Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have simply disappeared,\u201d Deripaska\u2019s frustrated lawyers wrote, in a 2014 petition to have Manafort\u2019s firm wound up.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Deripaska ever got his money. Either way, the episode illustrates Manafort\u2019s personal links to figures close to Putin.\n\nLater, Manafort introduced Deripaska to Senator John McCain, when the oligarch was having problems travelling to the US. (In 2006, the US had revoked Deripaska\u2019s visa, citing alleged \u201ccriminal associations\u201d. Deripaska denies the allegation, and his visa was subsequently reinstated.)\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only embarrassing legal scrape arising from Manafort\u2019s capitalist adventures. In November 2011, Tymoshenko unsuccessfully sued him and several of her political opponents in the district court in New York. Her lengthy writ alleged that Manafort \u201cplayed a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u201d to launder cash for Yanukovych\u2019s oligarch friends and invest it in New York real estate.\n\nIn particular, she pointed the finger at Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian businessman whose generous contributions helped Yanukovych. Firtash is a shareholder and public face for RosUkrEnergo, an intermediary company co-owned by Gazprom, which imports gas from Russia and resells it to Ukraine. Tymoshenko tried unsuccessfully to get rid of it.\n\nThe RusUkrEnergo scheme was a mechanism for corruption, she alleged in legal filings. Its real owner, she claimed, was Semyon Mogilevich, a Ukrainian-Russian mobster, and one of the FBI\u2019s top fugitives. Firtash denies this.\n\nAccording to her writ, Firtash and his companies and associates were able to skim billions of dollars from gas transactions. The cash was laundered \u201cthrough a labyrinth of shell companies\u201d. It was then returned to Ukraine, with the money used to bribe Ukrainian officials.\n\nManafort sells the unsellable product. If you have a dead horse and you need to sell it, you call him Alex Kovzhun\n\n\u201cDefendant Paul J Manafort is a well-known Washington D.C. lobbyist and political consultant. He is the senior partner in the firm Davis, Manafort and Freedman. Manafort also worked in Ukraine on various political campaigns, including the successful 2010 presidential campaign of Victor Yanukovych, who is the president of Ukraine at present. Manafort played a key role in the defendants\u2019 conspiracy and racketeering enterprise,\u201d the writ said.\n\nFirtash, who declined to be interviewed for this article, denies the claims. In 2014, a federal judge threw out Tymoshenko\u2019s lawsuit, saying that she had failed to show that Firtash and other defendants had laundered money in the U.S to help pay off Yanukovych\u2019s supporters in Ukraine. The judge also said the allegations were outside US jurisdiction.\n\nCaught between Russia and the US? The curious case of Ukraine's Dmytro Firtash Read more\n\nThat same year Firtash was arrested on a US warrant in Vienna, accused of bribing Indian officials over a titanium deal. But an Austrian judge denied a US extradition request and agreed with Firtash that it was politically motivated. The US is appealing, and Firtash remains in Austria.\n\nFirtash did invest money in Manafort\u2019s real estate projects, however. The two met in 2008. Manafort\u2019s plan was to buy the site of the demolished Drake Hotel in Manhattan and to redevelop it at a cost of almost $900m. Firtash transferred at least $25m to the project. Tymoshenko alleged that the plan was never serious, with the cash merely transferred for the purposes of money laundering.\n\n\n\n\u201cGroup DF and Firtash never had any intention to purchase the Drake property, but instead used the real estate project as a vehicle for investing $25 million in New York bank accounts,\u201d her writ stated.\n\nManafort did not respond to a request by the Guardian for comment on Deripaska\u2019s loan or the Drake Hotel allegations.\n\nIn the run-up to November\u2019s vote, Trump\u2019s own real estate transactions have been extensively investigated, but it remains unclear if any Russian cash has actually been leveraged in these deals.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Manafort denied that he had received any irregular payments in Ukraine. \u201cThe simplest answer is the truth: I am a campaign professional. It is well known that I do work in the United States and have done work on overseas campaigns as well. I have never received a single \u2018off-the-books cash payment\u2019 as falsely \u2018reported\u2019 by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia.\u201d\n\nTrump's new right-hand man has history of controversial clients and deals Read more\n\nBut Manafort\u2019s critics in Kiev are scathing. \u201cHe\u2019s an evil genius,\u201d Alex Kovzhun, who spent a decade working for Tymoshenko, beginning in 2001, said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t work statesmen. He works dictators and all-round bastards. He sells the unsellable product. If you have a dead horse and you need to sell it, you call him.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe works bad guys. They pay more, of course.\u201d\n\nManafort\u2019s specialism, according to Kovzhun, is running expensive campaigns and targeting the \u201cgreat unwashed\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same element who voted for Putin, supported Brexit, back Erdo\u011fan and who will vote for Trump. Manafort works the lowest common denominator. I find him repulsive and his message ugly. He leaves destruction in his wake.\u201d\n\n\n\nKovzhun said he recognised the same \u201cmoves\u201d in Manafort\u2019s campaigns for Yanukovych and Trump. He gets his clients to do \u201ccorny stuff\u201d, Kovzhun added, with \u201cbland political slogans\u201d and \u201cuncreative Soviet-style imagery\u201d. \u201cWith Yanukovych it was: \u2018I\u2019ll hear everyone.\u2019 With Trump, it\u2019s: \u2018Make America great again.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Voloshin portrays the decade Manafort spent in Ukraine as a success. \u201cIn 2004, Yanukovych was seen as a Russian puppet. He was dead. Paul resurrected him.\u201d\n\nCan Manafort work his magic one more time? \u201cThe tougher the client you have, the the greater success you get. It isn\u2019t about the money. It\u2019s about ambition. If he can make Yanukovych president, I\u2019m sure he can do it with Trump.\u201d\n\n",
