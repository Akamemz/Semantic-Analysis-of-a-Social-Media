    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a lower court opinion that struck down a Boise , Idaho , law aimed at the homeless that regulates camping and sleeping in public spaces .\nIn an unsigned order with no noted dissents , the court declined to take up Boise 's appeal to reinstate its law allowing officers to ticket individuals sleeping and camping on sidewalks and parks .\nThe city argued the ordinance was necessary to `` ensure that these areas remain safe , accessible and sanitary . ''\nBut the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals had blocked the law as it applies to homeless individuals with no access to an alternative shelter as a violation of the Constitution 's bar on cruel and unusual punishment .\n`` We conclude that a municipality can not criminalize such behavior consistently with the Eighth Amendment when no sleeping space is practically available in any shelter , '' the court ruled at the time .\nThe case could impact towns and cities across the country that have similar laws . In asking the Supreme Court to take up the case , lawyers for Boise argued that the lower court opinion has created a `` defacto constitutional right to live on sidewalks and in parks '' that will `` cripple '' the 1,600 municipalities within the jurisdiction of the 9th Circuit , which covers most of the western US .\n`` Public encampments , now protected by the Constitution under the Ninth Circuit 's decision , have spawned crime and violence , incubated disease , and created environmental hazards that threaten the lives and well-being both of those living on the streets and the public at large , '' the lawyers wrote .\nCalifornia , which will have to abide by the lower court ruling , has expressed particular alarm because nearly half of all homeless people in the country live in the state , according to some reports .\n`` No one doubts the severity of the nation 's homelessness crisis or the need for more housing and support , '' lawyers for 33 California counties and cities wrote in a brief supporting Boise , but they note they have developed `` creative and effective solutions and devoted extraordinary resources to provide temporary shelter and social services .
