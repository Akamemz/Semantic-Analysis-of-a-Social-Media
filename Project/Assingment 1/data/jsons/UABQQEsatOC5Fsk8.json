Charles Boustany , R-La. , a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee , after learning that the videos were recorded at IRS offices in New Carrollton , Md. , outside Washington , D.C .\nThe latest recording cost about $ 1,600 and was produced to be shown at the end of a 2010 training and leadership conference held in Anaheim , Calif. , said IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge . At a time when most government agencies are coping with across-the-board spending cuts by furloughing workers and finding other savings , that conference has become the target of a report a Treasury inspector general plans to release next week .\nThe report , called `` Collected and Wasted : The IRS Spending Culture and Conference Abuses , '' will be the subject of a hearing Thursday by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , that panel said Friday .\n`` Whether it is the tens of thousands of hard-earned taxpayer dollars spent to produce frivolous entertainment for agency bureaucrats , or the IRS \u2019 s own admission that it targeted the American people based on their personal beliefs , the outrage toward the IRS is only growing stronger , '' Boustany said in a statement .\n`` Clearly this is an agency where abuse and waste is the norm and not the exception . It is clear that this is a broken agency that is empowered by a broken tax code . We need to fix this and make not only the agency , but the tax code , more effective and efficient . \u201d\nIn a written statement , the IRS said the video was `` unacceptable and an inappropriate use of government funds . '' It said the agency has new policies in place `` to ensure that taxpayer funds are being used appropriately . ''\nIn the video , various workers comment as colleagues practice their dancing in the background to music that sounds like `` Cupid Shuffle , '' a 2007 hit by the performer Cupid . In the version obtained by The Associated Press , IRS employees ' names have been erased .\nAt one point , one woman says , `` And I thought doing the 'Star Trek ' video was humiliating . ''\nThat `` Star Trek '' video was produced for the same 2010 conference . The agency called the `` Star Trek '' video , which lasted six minutes and featured employees dressed as characters from the popular show , a mistake .\nThe `` Star Trek '' and `` Gilligan 's Island '' videos cost about $ 60,000 combined to make , the IRS said in March .\nThe `` Gilligan 's Island '' parody was used at the beginning of a 12-hour video the IRS used in 2011 to train its workers on various tax issues , Eldridge said . The entire video was used to train 1,900 workers who assist taxpayers over the phone and in offices around the country , she said .\nIn a separate statement , Danny Werfel , the IRS ' new acting commissioner , called the 2010 conference `` an unfortunate vestige from a prior era . ''\nHe added , `` While there were legitimate reasons for holding the meeting , many of the expenses associated with it were inappropriate and should not have occurred .
