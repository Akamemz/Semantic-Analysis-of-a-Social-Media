It comes amid a growing call for elite institutions to regain the trust of a skeptical public by prioritizing equity and transparency . With lower-income and less-educated families representing the fastest-growing supply of students , many campuses are starting to rethink long-standing practices . And as the public gains more insight into how admissions have typically worked at elite institutions \u2013 through the Harvard admissions trial , for instance \u2013 selective colleges are facing more scrutiny about legacy and other special admissions categories that have tended to favor the wealthy .\n\u201c The real questions are a ) Is it fair ? and b ) Can we afford it as a nation when it means we are doing less than we could be to make college realistic , accessible , and affordable ? \u201d says Jerome Lucido , executive director of the Center for Enrollment Research , Policy , and Practice at the University of Southern California ( USC ) .\nA 2019 national survey found that about three-quarters of the most selective institutions consider legacy . A cluster of notable exceptions includes the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California system .\nEach college understandably takes pride in its individuality and wants to encourage alumni children to attend , Professor Lucido acknowledges . At the same time , he says , \u201c admission deans across the country have been saying quietly , \u2018 We have to do things differently , \u2019 but they often feel like they can \u2019 t , because the structure is all in place to admit alumni [ relatives ] , to give donor preferences . ... \u201d\nThe Harvard admissions trial also stirred up concerns about legacy preferences , and student groups from the Ivy League and other elite universities have urged their campuses to ditch them . They point to a 2010 study by then-Harvard doctoral student Michael Hurwitz , which analyzed 30 institutions and concluded that students with a parent who attended the school were about three times more likely to be admitted .\nDropping legacy admissions isn \u2019 t the only explanation for Johns Hopkins becoming more socioeconomically diverse . A record-breaking $ 1.8 billion gift in 2018 has helped the school offer debt-free financial aid packages , for instance . But the admissions change \u201c has accelerated our work of recruiting and matriculating students from all walks of life who demonstrate the academic rigor and exceptional talent we expect \u2026 , \u201d spokeswoman Karen Lancaster wrote in an email to the Monitor .\nAmong Hopkins alumni , \u201c I \u2019 m sure there are those that say , \u2018 Wait a minute , my kid \u2019 s a [ high school ] junior ; now I lose this benefit ? \u2019 \u201d says Emmi Harward , executive director of the Association of College Counselors in Independent Schools . But she adds that \u201c even those who may benefit from unearned privilege can often still understand why that privilege needs to go away . \u201d\nAny potential domino effect from Hopkins \u2019 move may hinge on whether more research challenges the long-held notion that legacy preferences boost colleges \u2019 bottom line .

The liberal arts campus in Pennsylvania has about 20 % Pell-eligible students , and about 20 % who are the first generation in their family to attend college . Both categories have grown 5 percentage points in recent years .\n\u201c You can be a first-generation legacy at our institution , which I think may surprise people , \u201d Mr. Bock says . The school considers both parents and siblings , so \u201c you can have an older sibling and a younger sibling who are both still within the first generation to attend college . And that person may or may not receive preference , but that \u2019 s something we would note in the application . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s important to understand that published rates of legacy enrollment on a campus \u2013 about 16 % at Swarthmore \u2013 usually include everyone who reports any family tie to alumni , but not all of those students are eligible for an admissions boost , Mr. Bock says . Those whose grandparents or cousins attended Swarthmore , for instance , get no extra consideration , but they may apply and enroll .\nStill , the word \u201c legacy \u201d tends to carry a connotation of privilege . \u201c It \u2019 s a tremendously creative and socially sensitive way of doing things , \u201d USC \u2019 s Professor Lucido says of Swarthmore \u2019 s approach , but it should maybe be adjusted and renamed , rather than used as a reason to keep a wider legacy policy .\nJohns Hopkins delayed its public announcement partly so it could \u201c watch the impact of this change , and ensure we could make this practice effective and sustainable , \u201d Ms. Lancaster says in her email .\nThat explanation didn \u2019 t satisfy Felicia Petterway , a first-generation low-income ( FLI ) senior who told the student-run Johns Hopkins News-Letter that she thought more FLI students might have applied in recent years if they had known . \u201c I thought that no matter how good my grades were , or how moving my essays were , my spot could easily be taken by a legacy student , and this prevented me from even applying to several top ranked institutions , \u201d she said in an email to the News-Letter .\nBut by waiting until they could release information on the impact of the changes , Hopkins leaders made a strong case that they didn \u2019 t have to use legacy preferences \u201c to still meet all the goals that they needed to meet , \u201d says Stacey Kostell , who manages enrollment at the University of Vermont and is the incoming CEO of The Coalition for College ( a group of more than 150 institutions , including Johns Hopkins , that aims to improve college access for historically underrepresented students ) .\nMore admissions professionals are grappling with how to pull back the curtain on what they do , including by attending conferences like the recent \u201c Reclaiming Public Trust in Admissions and Higher Education \u201d at USC . \u201c Nothing we do in admission and recruitment should be a secret , \u201d Professor Lucido says . \u201c Every admissions space should be available to all without influence . ...
