    "content": "As I said on Friday , last week was a rough one for Democrats ' presumptive presidential nominee . A Q-poll of voters in the swing states of Colorado , Virginia and Iowa showed her upside-down by substantial margins on trust , empathy and overall favorability . A new NBC/WSJ survey confirms Quinnipiac 's favorability findings , measuring Mrs. Clinton 's ratings approximately 20 points underwater in two early battleground states . Meet the Press host Chuck Todd opened yesterday 's program by describing the numbers as `` dismal '' and `` troubling '' for the Clinton camp :\nShe 's at ( 37/56 ) favorable vs. unfavorable in Iowa , and ( 37/57 ) in New Hampshire . Todd also called Friday 's news that two Inspectors General have requested a DOJ investigation into Hillary 's improper email server and usage `` incredibly significant . '' MSM tastemaker Mark Halperin agreed , casting the development as a `` disaster `` for her campaign -- if a criminal probe moves forward : In this clip , Halperin and his co-host outline the Clinton camp 's response to the New York Times ' reporting , which has entailed quite a lot of highly Clintonian parsing . It 's unclear whether the IG referrals to DOJ were explicitly criminal in nature , or if that determination has not yet been made -- plus , the investigation may focus on 'those responsible ' for Hillary 's emails , not necessarily Hillary herself . It 's worth noting that Hillary ordered the ( scandalously under-secured ) server to be set up in the first place , misused it , then ordered its contents culled prior to putting on a belated smoke-and-mirrors show of `` complying '' with records-keeping requirements . Mrs. Clinton is responsible for Mrs. Clinton 's email . And while we 're on the subject of responsibility , read Gabriel Malor 's quick Twitter primer on the implications of her classified `` spillage '' problem . Aside from her lying about it , that is , which is hardly unusual for her anyway . A few key take-aways :\nAny gov't employee with a 10 % spillage rate would be fired immediately and have their life turned upside down looking for other spills . \u2014 Gabriel Malor ( @ gabrielmalor ) July 25 , 2015\nTwo facts : 1 .
