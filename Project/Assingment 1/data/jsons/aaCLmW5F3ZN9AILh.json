From Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama , Iowa \u2019 s esoteric caucus system is a crucible where a long shot without much money and a lot of time to shake hands can make it onto the nation \u2019 s radar screen .\nIt \u2019 s easy to grouse about Iowa \u2019 s outsize role . It forces candidates who never stood in a cornfield to pay homage to farm subsidies of questionable merit . It skews Republicans \u2019 stances to the evangelical right , and Democrats \u2019 to the far left , given its vigorous progressive element . Its system of caucuses , in which precinct voters turn up in a school gym or social hall to vote under arcane rules , is not a traditional primary at all and isn \u2019 t even called one .\nBut Iowa matters , particularly for this year \u2019 s national front-runners . In an election whose subtext is the anger of the fringes in both parties , Iowa is the epicenter of disaffection . For Hillary Clinton , just a hair ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders and still twitchy at her third-place finish in 2008 , the state is a psychological test . Many Iowans again seem to have doubts about her , and she \u2019 s virtually tied with Mr. Sanders , a 74-year-old whose backers insist he \u2019 s a fresh face . A big turnout will boost Mr. Sanders , who needs young people and independents to win . His surprising challenge has prompted a big change in Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s game . She has adopted a more forceful , up-close-and-personal approach . That could help her in a race that promises to be a longer slog than she anticipated .\nThe Republican candidates who see themselves as mainstream compared with Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz , like Jeb Bush and Gov .
