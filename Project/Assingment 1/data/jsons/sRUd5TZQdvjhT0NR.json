    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she wants to move `` expeditiously '' on the impeachment inquiry into whether President Donald Trump abused his power by pushing Ukraine to investigate his political rival , Joe Biden .\nAt the center of the inquiry , which was launched last week , is a complaint from an unidentified intelligence agency official . The complaint accuses Trump of having `` used the power of his office '' to solicit foreign interference to discredit Biden , the 2020 Democratic frontrunner . It also alleges that White House officials sought to `` lock down '' records of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the president urged Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son , Hunter , who once had business interests in Ukraine .\nTrump contends he did nothing improper and accuses Democrats of wanting to overturn the results of the 2016 election .\nSome lawmakers want the House to decide whether to file articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving , a timeline that could avoid having the issue spill over into the 2020 election year .\nHere 's what we know about the process , what 's happening next and the key players :\nBasically , an impeachment inquiry is the fact-finding stage of the impeachment process and largely what House Democrats have been doing for months on various other matters involving Trump .\nSince taking over the House after the 2018 midterms , six House committees have been investigating a series of allegations against the president , including whether Trump obstructed justice in special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election , whether he profited unconstitutionally from his namesake business while in office and whether he violated campaign laws by paying hush money to a porn actress before the election .\nAnd Pelosi has said the Ukraine matter would be the primary target of any possible impeachment charges .\nThe plan for now , according to lawmakers , is to prioritize the Ukraine investigation , which is being led by the House Intelligence Committee , while other panels wrap up their probes and send their best cases to the House Judiciary Committee .\nThen lawmakers will decide whether to bring forward articles of impeachment , which would require a full House vote . If it passes , Trump would be impeached \u2013 sort of like a criminal indictment .\nThe process then would shift to the Senate , where an impeachment trial would take place . Basically , House lawmakers would act as prosecutors and senators as the jury for a trial deciding whether to remove Trump from office . After the trial , senators would take a vote . A two-thirds majority is needed for Trump to be removed from office .\nWhile the Constitution puts the responsibility of holding an impeachment trial in the hands of the Senate , there has been some speculation that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might refuse to hold a trial .\nMcConnell was asked last March by NPR \u2013 before the Ukraine allegation surfaced \u2013 about what he saw as the Senate 's responsibility . McConnell said at the time that he thought the Senate would have `` no choice '' on the matter , saying if articles pass the House it would move to the Senate and it `` immediately goes into a trial . ''\nDespite Congress going on a two-week recess , things are moving rapidly . A series of depositions are scheduled with some of the figures wrapped up in the Ukraine scandal , one hearing is scheduled and a host of new subpoenas could be filed next week , not to mention the first subpoena in the matter being sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday .\nThe chairmen of the Foreign Affairs , Intelligence and Oversight and Reform committees gave Pompeo until Oct. 4 to hand over documents about Trump 's July phone call with Ukraine President Zelensky .\nThe chairmen \u2013 Rep. Eliot Engel , D-N.Y. ; Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif. ; and Rep. Elijah Cummings , D-Md . \u2013 also plan depositions for five State Department officials over the break : ( more on these players below )\n\u2022Oct . 2 : Ambassador Marie \u201c Masha \u201d Yovanovitch , former ambassador to Ukraine .\n\u2022Oct . 3 : Kurt Volker , a special representative for Ukraine who played a role arranging meetings between Giuliani and Zelensky \u2019 s representatives .\n\u2022Oct . 8 : Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl , who listened to the Ukraine call , according to the whistleblower complaint .\n\u2022Oct . 10 : Ambassador Gordon Sondland , ambassador to the European Union .\nAlong with the depositions , which will be taken in private , the House Intelligence Committee also scheduled a hearing on Oct. 4 with Michael Atkinson , the inspector general for the intelligence community , who received the whistleblower 's complaint about Trump and deemed it credible and urgent . The hearing will also take place behind closed doors .\nOther hearings could be scheduled but Schiff told reporters Friday the panel has to determine who else will testify voluntarily and who will require a subpoena .\nAll of the movement in Washington will happen as most of Congress is back home on a two-week break . Some lawmakers voiced concern about the timing of the recess , noting that getting to the bottom of this was urgent , momentum was building on the investigation and leaving the Capitol could shift focus .\nBut , House leadership said the break was an important chance for lawmakers to explain to their constituents what was happening and why , especially in swing districts and for members who flipped seats from conservative grasp in the midterm election .\n`` I think it 's very important that members go home to their constituents and explain what they are thinking , '' said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md . `` This is a matter of grave importance and the American people need to understand what is occurring .
