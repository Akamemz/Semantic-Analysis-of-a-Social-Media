    "content": "But there \u2019 s no reason to keep this up . For one thing , it doesn \u2019 t seem especially true . It can \u2019 t really be that we think Cruz has a sophisticated mind , given that the only thoughts he produces are angry pants-on-fire platitudinous drivel . Even those who lavish praise on his oratory seem to agree that his heat-to-light ratio nears the infinite , and that \u201c thoughtfulness \u201d and Ted Cruz can not exist in the same room . His only memorable quotes appear to be cheap jokes , and the most notable speech of his entire career is not his own , but Dr. Seuss \u2019 . Nobody who has witnessed a few minutes of Cruz \u2019 s piece of senatorial performance art would have thought to label him a thinker , were it not for the preexisting consensus that he is one .\nCruz likely finds all of this very pleasing indeed . In his interview with Toobin , Cruz quotes Sun Tzu , saying that \u201c every battle is won before it \u2019 s fought . It \u2019 s won by choosing the terrain on which it will be fought. \u201d In getting those who despise him to genuflect to his intelligence , Ted Cruz has already won one battle . Jeffrey Toobin may lace his piece with dismissive sneers , yet somehow he still contributes to the ever-growing heap of liberal respect for Cruz \u2019 s mental acuity .\nEven Ted Cruz 's critics seem to concur on one point : whatever else you might say about him , the man is very smart . Mother Jones magazine has called him the \u201c thinking man 's tea partier. \u201d Josh Marshall , in a mostly withering assessment , made the same obligatory concession to his being an \u201c incredibly bright guy. \u201d Jeffrey Toobin \u2019 s recent , ostensibly critical New Yorker profile of Cruz is full of quotes about his being \u201c the smartest guy in the room , \u201d his \u201c sophisticated \u201d constitutional views , and the \u201c extraordinary \u201d erudition of his senior thesis .\nCruz has become notorious for using distortive , misleading rhetoric that no sober-minded individual could apply . Cruz says Obamacare \u2019 s \u201c intent is to destroy the private insurance business , \u201d despite the fact that the whole progressive complaint about Obamacare is that it is a massive windfall to insurers . He says a campaign finance amendment attempting to rein in spending literally \u201c repeals the First Amendment. \u201d But even more alarming are the straightforward factual errors . He has mistakenly claimed that most premiums have risen under the Affordable Care Act and that states with gun control have the highest murder rates , among other elementary blunders that earned him a rating on PolitiFact of 10 falsehoods for every one truth .\nOne may respond that Cruz is shrewd and knows better , that these are calculated political lies by a devious plotter . But for a savant merely playing an imbecile on television , Cruz is strangely inept when it comes to policymaking . He has alienated all of his colleagues , and wants to revive the gay marriage fight at a time when it couldn \u2019 t be more unwise . His major act of strategic maneuvering over the government shutdown proved a colossal high-profile failure , the result of which was that as his name recognition improves , his favorability ratings actually drop . Even the Wall Street Journal has labeled him part of a \u201c kamikaze caucus \u201d that is dooming conservatives \u2019 prospects . If Ted Cruz \u2019 s misstatements are deft politicking rather than idiocy , then where , one might ask , are the successes ?\nUltimately , though , the most damning evidence against Cruz 's intelligence may actually come from his law school roommate and college debating partner , David Panton . \u201c Ted \u2019 s views today politically are almost identical to when I met him , \u201d Panton said . \u201c There \u2019 s nothing he says today that I didn \u2019 t hear in college. \u201d That assessment , spoken about anybody , should be convincing enough evidence for shallowness of mind . Can there be such thing as a learned person who has discovered nothing new since freshman year ?\nIn fact , the stories about Cruz 's younger days show the marks of someone profoundly insecure about his intelligence . Quizzing others as to their SAT scores , wanting to limit his law-school study group to graduates of the `` H-Y-P '' schools ( a charge Cruz has denied ) , an unrelenting and discomforting argumentative aggression : He \u2019 s missing only a Mensa application to complete the full package of desperate IQ-dork self-affirmations .\nOf course , a chorus of people from Cruz \u2019 s student years has vouched for his brilliance . No less a heavyweight than Alan Dershowitz has commented on Cruz 's precocity at Harvard . Now , one could somewhat unkindly argue that Dershowitz , too , has in his career relied on people \u2019 s confusion of credentials and bluster for depth of intellect . More to the point , though , is that the evidence put forth doesn \u2019 t support the claim . Nobody doubts that Cruz has the gift of gab , and can be formidable in an argument . But sophistry is not philosophy , and being the loudest , most driven , and most shameless guy in the room does not necessarily make one the brightest .\nAny definition of intelligence is destined to be highly contestable . Yet it is hard to imagine a plausible one that does not include large measures of critical thinking and self-scrutiny . As Bertrand Russell put it , it \u2019 s always a central problem that `` the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt .

If Newt Gingrich is \u201c a stupid person \u2019 s idea of what a smart person looks like , \u201d Ted Cruz is a lawyer \u2019 s idea of what a smart person looks like .

Law schools pose as Socratic institutions , where preconceptions are left in tatters on the lecture-room floor , but in practice they reward sparring ability far more than reflection and careful scholarliness ( the haphazard , un-peer-reviewed world of law journals can attest to the legal academy \u2019 s prioritization of argumentative formalism over a sober-minded quest for enlightenment ) . A person with one or two core principles , and a ruthless willingness to bend any truth that gets in the way , can do very well for himself at law school . Certainly , this requires skill .
