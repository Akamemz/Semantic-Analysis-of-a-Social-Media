Scott Walker signed a slate of bills \u2014 passed by Wisconsin \u2019 s GOP-controlled legislature \u2014 that will curb incoming Democrat governor-elect Tony Evers \u2019 s power in office , and potentially make it harder for Democrats to get elected in the future .\nThe laws will limit Evers \u2019 s power to change policies around welfare , health care , and economic development ; put limits on the incoming Democratic attorney general ; and cut down early voting .\nA similar tale is playing out in Michigan , where Democrats Gretchen Whitmer , Dana Nessel , and Jocelyn Benson handily won the governor , attorney general , and secretary of state races , respectively . Michigan Republicans are trying to guarantee the GOP-controlled legislature the right to intervene in any legal battles involving state laws that the attorney general may be reluctant to defend , as well as remove campaign finance oversight from the Secretary of State \u2019 s office .\nThere are not many ways to spin it ; it \u2019 s a power grab that would seriously undermine the platform on which these Democrats campaigned on , and won . Even Wisconsin \u2019 s Republican state House Speaker Robin Vos admitted that Republicans were seeking the changes because \u201c we are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in . \u201d\nTwo years ago , North Carolina set the precedent for this kind of move , when the Republican-controlled legislature stripped then-incoming Democrat Roy Cooper \u2019 s power over Cabinet appointments , made the state \u2019 s judicial system more partisan , and ensured that the state \u2019 s board of elections would be controlled by Republicans in election years .
