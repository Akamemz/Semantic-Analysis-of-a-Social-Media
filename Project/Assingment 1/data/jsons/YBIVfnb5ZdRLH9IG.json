After the ambassador had finished condemning Hamas for the violence on the Gaza-Israel border this week and Palestinian Ambassador Riyad H. Mansour instead began condemning Israeli forces , she got up and left .\nNikki Haley walking out as Palestine 's envoy to the UN begins to speak pretty much summarizes the US stance towards the Palestinians . pic.twitter.com/3GJJM48ewK \u2014 ian bremmer ( @ ianbremmer ) May 15 , 2018\nHalf of Twitter loved her symbolic exit . The other half decried it as shameful and undiplomatic .\nViolence erupted in Gaza this week as the new U.S. embassy in Israel opened in Jerusalem . Several top U.S. officials were there for the ceremony , including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner . President Trump recorded a video address for the occasion , reiterating the U.S. 's hope for peace in the region . In his own remarks , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump for his courage and his friendship .\nThousands of Palestinians , however , responded by rioting near the Gaza border , some armed with firebombs and other explosive devices . Israeli Defense Forces , who had warned the Palestinians not to approach the border , killed over 50 of those individuals and wounded over 2,000 others . A group of U.S. Democratic lawmakers and nations like France responded by demanding Israel show more restraint . In his UN remarks , the Palestinian ambassador said `` Israel occupation forces '' were to blame for the `` massacre '' at the border . Haley disagreed with all of them , noting that Israel showed just the right amount of restraint .\n`` No country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has , '' Haley said at the Security Council meeting . `` In fact , the record of several countries here today suggest that they would be less restrained . ''\nWho can blame Israel for simply wanting to defend itself ?\nRT @ USUN : \u201c I ask my colleagues here in the Security Council , who among us would accept this type of activity on your border ? No one would. \u201d pic.twitter.com/gh0ukdqCCp \u2014 Nikki Haley ( @ nikkihaley ) May 15 , 2018\nReports indicate that the terror group Hamas had orchestrated the riots near the border . She placed the blame squarely on their shoulders .\n`` Let 's remember that the Hamas terrorist organization has been inciting violence for years , long before the United States decided to move our embassy , \u201d she said . \u201c This is what is endangering the people of Gaza . Make no mistake , Hamas is pleased with the results from yesterday . \u201d\nIsrael is so moved by the Trump administration 's kept embassy promise that they gifted Haley a rare artifact this week - an ancient coin from the Great Revolt of 68 CE , as reported by The Jerusalem Post .
