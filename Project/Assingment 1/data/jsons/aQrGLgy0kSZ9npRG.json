This plane was making the trip between Barcelona and Duesseldorf . There were 148 persons on board . The conditions of the accident , which have not yet been clarified , lead us to think there are no survivors . I want to first express to the families that are affected by this tragic event that happened in France , our complete solidarity , as we do not yet know the identity of the victims . I immediately contacted the Prime Minister , the Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is going immediately to the scene . A crisis committee has just been assembled and we will make available all the information we have in a few minutes . Before then , we will do everything so that there will be no consequences of the accident and I will have meetings , with Chancellor Merkel because there is also probably a good number of German victims and of course with the King of Spain who is visiting us today . It \u2019 s a tragedy , a new aerial tragedy , we will also know all the details and the causes of what has happened and we will evidently give them to the authorities concerned , including Spanish and German , and to the families of the victims . This is a mourning period that we need to overcome because it \u2019 s a tragedy that has occurred on our land . And finally , I have the will to know if there were not any other consequences of the accident . It happened in a region that is fairly difficult to access , I don \u2019 t know if there are any homes involved , we will know it in the coming hours .

As yet we have little information about the scant details of the flight and any speculation about the crash must be ruled out . All of it will be thoroughly investigated . First of all , now , I want to focus on the amount of suffering that this disaster has brought to so many people . My thoughts and my sympathies - and also those of the entire government - are with those people who so suddenly lost their lives , among them many compatriots . The suffering for their families is immeasurable . We will do everything to make sure they get the help and assistance that can be made available in hours like these . In the past hours , I have spoken on the telephone to the French President , Francois Hollande , and also with the Spanish Prime Minister , Mariano Rajoy . We agreed that our nations will help each other in any way possible , to discover the cause of this catastrophe and to support the forces at the crash site and also at the airports .

I will travel there tomorrow , to get a first-hand impression , and to talk to the local authorities , and the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia , Hannelore Kraft , will accompany me .
