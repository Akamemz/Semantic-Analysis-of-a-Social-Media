    "content": "The Supreme Court \u2019 s much-awaited decision on affirmative action in the Fisher v. University of Texas case could be handed down as soon as this Tuesday , May 28 . The court \u2013 and the public \u2013 have heard a host of arguments both for and against the practice . One opposing argument in particular has been more specious than many of the others .\nFor nearly a decade , UCLA Law professor Richard Sander has demanded an overhaul of affirmative action practices at colleges and universities , citing his own research on the \u201c mismatch \u201d theory . According to Mr. Sander \u2019 s theory , affirmative action harms blacks and Latinos because it pushes them into situations ( elite universities ) where their peers outmatch them in standardized test scores . This \u201c mismatch , \u201d Sander claims , leads to underperformance , which then leads to the students \u2019 failure to achieve their ultimate goals .\nScholars have been quick to point out holes in the mismatch argument . For example , scholars have highlighted how Sander \u2019 s research fails to capture the complexities of admissions decisionmaking , which is not simply based on test scores , but instead involves holistic reviews of the many well-qualified students who are vying for limited seats at competitive institutions .\nScholars also have noted how Sander \u2019 s analysis does not adequately take into account the impact of hostile racial environments ( at elite institutions ) on student performance . They have further noted how the mismatch theory improperly rests on one narrow view of merit , failing to acknowledge the many ways in which different students may be mismatched against one another . Other research shows that students who enter elite institutions under affirmative action policies excel \u2013 even more than their white peers .\nIndeed , as anyone who has attended college will tell you , there are a plethora of factors that determine a student \u2019 s success or struggle in college . And my own experiences as a parent have taught me that , when children are \u201c outmatched , \u201d they often grow the most both in confidence and ability .\nRecently , my 10-year-old daughter reminded me of this very point when she engaged in actions that demonstrated exactly why Sander \u2019 s mismatch theory fails in many instances . Unlike most girls , my daughter has maintained an interest in math , robotics , and numerous other things that her physics professor father is geekily proud of and , more important , that boys seem to dominate even at the tender age of 10 .\nThis year , my daughter joined the chess club . Having never played chess before and having parents who were not chess players , she was initially \u201c outmatched \u201d by her peers , most of whom had been playing for years . However , over time and with training and the constant challenge of being \u201c outmatched , \u201d she has become one of the stronger players in her group .\nLike thousands of college students who have benefited from affirmative action programs over the past three decades , my daughter possessed the native intelligence and skill for the program she was joining . Having the additional challenge of being outmatched brought out the best in her and pushed her to excel . As my former colleague Alan Brownstein from the University of California , Davis School of Law once said to me , \u201c Mismatch is what we want for our kids . \u201d\nIndeed , those of us who are parents tell our children to seek mismatches all the time . When our children want to improve their basketball skills , we do not tell them , \u201c Play basketball with kids who play just at your level or lower. \u201d Instead , we say , \u201c Find the best players because playing with them will improve your skills . It will make you better , stronger , wiser . \u201d\nOf course , as parents , we know that there are limits to what our children can achieve . Some kids may not be able to make the varsity team or the honor society . Still , they also can not know their own limits until they confront challenges that test their capabilities and their determination . If they have the fortitude and the raw talent to take on these challenges , we should not slam the door in their faces and tell them that we are so sure they will fail that we refuse to even give them the opportunity to prove us wrong .\nIn their book \u201c The Shape of the River : Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions , \u201d William Bowen and Derek Bok , former presidents of Princeton University and Harvard University , respectively , confirmed that our parental instinct to encourage mismatches is on the mark . The book \u2019 s data revealed that racial minority students who benefited from affirmative action at elite schools graduated at higher rates than those at less selective institutions . And they earned advanced degrees at rates similar to their white peers .\nThe data that Mr. Bowen and Mr. Bok highlight also show that such students contributed to civic and community activities after college more than their white counterparts and made significant achievements in business and government upon graduation .\nThese findings are further affirmed by the work featured in the book \u201c Crossing the Finish Line : Completing College at America 's Public Universities \u201d by Bowen ; Matthew Chingos , a Brookings Institution fellow ; and Michael S. McPherson , a former president of Macalester College .\n\u201c Crossing the Finish Line \u201d revealed that students who are \u201c undermatched \u201d \u2013 meaning students who attended a college that was less selective than their credentials would have allowed them to attend ( and thus should have been easier for them ) \u2013 graduated at a lower rate than those students who \u201c matched \u201d \u2013 meaning students who attended a college that was as selective as their credentials would have allowed them to attend .\nAs this research shows , success in college , and later in life , is about more than just numbers ; it is about resources , support of intellectual development , environment , networks , and numerous other factors .\nIn fact , as many of our parenting experiences have taught us , mismatches are not just good for the \u201c outmatched , \u201d but also for the \u201c overmatched \u201d \u2013 meaning those students at elite institutions with ample qualifications and privileged backgrounds .
