It \u2019 s the same things that are important to other Americans , \u201d he adds . \u201c That \u2019 s to not be [ criminalized ] ; to have our families recognized ; and to have jobs and not to be discriminated against . \u201d\nWhile questions of religious liberty remain to be addressed , the ruling is a momentous one .

For individual rights , \u201c It has more ramifications for most Americans than the Constitution . \u201d\n\u201c Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result , \u201d wrote Justice Gorsuch . \u201c But the limits of the drafters \u2019 imagination supply no reason to ignore the law \u2019 s demands . \u201d\nTitle VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on \u201c race , color , religion , sex and national origin. \u201d The majority held that \u201c sex \u201d covers \u201c gay or transgender \u201d people .\nThe 172 pages of opinions tell a more complicated story \u2013 one of debate between the court \u2019 s conservative justices over how best to interpret laws based on the \u201c ordinary meaning \u201d of the text .\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the 6-3 majority opinion enshrining civil rights for LGBTQ Americans . In his view , Monday \u2019 s historic ruling was a straightforward one .\nIn a landmark , and unexpected , decision yesterday , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that firing an employee because of their sexual orientation or gender identity violates federal law .\nIn what could be a month of blockbuster decisions from the high court , the ruling immediately ranks among the most consequential civil rights rulings in the court \u2019 s history , experts say . The fact it came from a court with a small but deeply conservative majority \u2013 and that so many people tried to access the opinion online it crashed the court \u2019 s website \u2013 only heightened the drama .\nTo hear Justice Neil Gorsuch \u2013 who wrote the 6-3 majority opinion \u2013 tell it , the landmark ruling was a straightforward one . The 172 pages of opinions tell a more complicated story \u2013 one of three-pronged debate between the court \u2019 s conservative justices over the best practices of textualism , a judicial method of interpreting laws based on the \u201c ordinary meaning \u201d of the text .\nTitle VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on \u201c race , color , religion , sex and national origin. \u201d In that statute , the majority held that \u201c sex \u201d covers people who are \u201c gay or transgender . \u201d\n\u201c Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result , \u201d wrote Justice Gorsuch . \u201c But the limits of the drafters \u2019 imagination supply no reason to ignore the law \u2019 s demands . \u201d\n\u201c When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another , it \u2019 s no contest , \u201d he added . \u201c Only the written word is the law , and all persons are entitled to its benefit . \u201d\nThe ground-level effects of the ruling are significant . In 25 states there are no explicit prohibitions against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity . It also came days after the Trump administration \u2013 which had opposed the LGBTQ employees in the case \u2013 eliminated regulations prohibiting discrimination against transgender patients in health care .\n\u201c This is as important a ruling as Obergefell [ v. Hodges ] , \u201d the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage , says Michael Boucai , a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law , \u201c simply because employment is such a basic human need . \u201d\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters/File U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is shown during an official portrait June 1 , 2017 .\nAnd when one of the high court \u2019 s staunchest defenders of LGBTQ rights , Justice Anthony Kennedy , retired in 2018 , most court watchers expected those rights only to get rolled back .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a matter of great good luck that the arguments that could be made in this case are obviously going to appeal to someone like Gorsuch , \u201d says Mary Anne Case , a professor at the University of Chicago Law School .\n\u201c It would have been hard for Gorsuch to cast a different vote without looking unprincipled , \u201d she adds .\nAll nine justices would consider themselves textualists , to the extent they give the actual text of a statute significant weight when they interpret it . But Justice Gorsuch may be the strictest .\n\u201c The role of a judge is to say what the law is , \u201d he said during his 2017 confirmation hearings . \u201c Before I put a person in prison , before I deny someone of their liberty or property , I want to be very sure that I can look them square in the eye and say , \u2018 You should have known . \u2019 \u201d\nYet he is also a conservative justice with a strong belief that the Supreme Court should not be driving social change . This case brought those two core principles to a head , and strict textualism won .\nIn a detailed , 32-page scrutiny of the \u201c because of ... sex \u201d phrase in Title VII , he makes the pivotal holding that while the law doesn \u2019 t explicitly reference LGBTQ employees , and while Congress in 1964 may not have intended it to cover them , it protects those employees nonetheless .\n\u201c When an employer fires an employee for being homosexual or transgender , it necessarily and intentionally discriminates against that individual in part because of sex , \u201d he wrote .\nTitle VII \u201c is a major piece of federal civil rights legislation . It is written in starkly broad terms . It has repeatedly produced unexpected applications , \u201d he added . \u201c The same judicial humility that requires us to refrain from adding to statutes requires us to refrain from diminishing them . \u201d\nMonday \u2019 s ruling also suggests that , if Congress were to pass clearly articulated legislation expanding protections for LGBTQ Americans , this court would uphold it . LGBTQ Americans are \u201c still unprotected from discrimination in housing , and discrimination in public accommodations , \u201d says Kimberly West-Faulcon , a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles .\nMonday \u2019 s rationale for enshrining new civil rights for LGBTQ Americans differs markedly from Obergefell , the high court \u2019 s last major opinion in the area .\nFirst , that case concerned a constitutional question instead of a statutory one . The Supreme Court is typically more reluctant to reinterpret the Constitution than a statute , but former Justice Kennedy was also plain in his opinion that while the 14th Amendment \u2019 s due process clause didn \u2019 t guarantee a right to same-sex marriage , it should .\n\u201c The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times , \u201d he wrote . \u201c When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution \u2019 s central protections and a received legal stricture , a claim to liberty must be addressed . \u201d\nJustice Kennedy was joined in that opinion by the court \u2019 s four liberal justices , and that judicial philosophy \u2013 that laws and the Constitution can and should evolve with the times \u2013 is traditionally popular on the left .\nTextualism is traditionally popular on the right , but yesterday \u2019 s ruling showed that it can also contain multitudes .\nAs Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a dissent ( joined by his conservative colleague Justice Clarence Thomas ) , the majority opinion is not textbook textualism , but a \u201c pirate ship . \u201d\n\u201c It sails under a textualist flag , \u201d he wrote . But \u201c there is only one word for what the Court has done today : legislation . \u201d\n\u201c When textualism is properly understood , it calls for an examination of the social context in which a statute was enacted , \u201d he added .\nThe social context 50 years ago , he argued ( with 52 pages of appendices ) , included that sodomy was a crime in every state but Illinois , and that discrimination because of \u201c sex \u201d was understood \u201c to refer to men and women . \u201d\nIn his own dissent , Justice Brett Kavanaugh leveled a different textualist argument : that the majority doesn \u2019 t apply the \u201c ordinary meaning \u201d of the text of the law , and that it departs from how \u201c sex \u201d discrimination has been interpreted in federal law for 25 years .\nThe robust debate over how to interpret statutes by itself makes the case something of a landmark , says William Eskridge , a professor at Yale Law School and author of the forthcoming book \u201c Marriage Equality : From Outlaws to In-Laws. \u201d Both dissenters cited his research on statutory interpretation and the history of LGBTQ rights , but in his opinion , Justice Gorsuch won the debate .\n\u201c He accounts and relies on more text than the dissenters do . He explains more text , he is more thorough on the textual front , \u201d adds Professor Eskridge , who also wrote an amicus brief supporting the LGBTQ employees in the case .\nThis kind of schism between the court \u2019 s five conservatives has not been unusual since President Donald Trump consolidated their majority with the appointments of Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh .\n\u201c This is a 5-4 majority , so if even one vote defects that majority isn \u2019 t there , and the conservative justices do have many disagreements among themselves , \u201d says Ilya Somin , a professor at George Mason University \u2019 s Antonin Scalia Law School .\n\u201c It varies by the issue , \u201d he adds . \u201c Gorsuch has been more willing to subvert expectations than other conservatives . \u201d\nWhile this is a landmark ruling for LGBTQ civil rights , the majority acknowledged that some important questions remain unanswered . Notably , the degree to which this ruling might burden an employer \u2019 s free exercise of religion , and whether transgender people can use sex-segregated bathrooms or locker rooms in line with their gender identity .\n\u201c What the court has given here it can potentially take away with a vengeance \u201d when it comes to religious employers , says Professor Case . \u201c And if they do that it [ could ] not just be LGBT employees left with little to no protection , it [ could ] be every employee on every ground , with perhaps the exception of race . \u201d\nThis move could begin as early as this month , with the justices deliberating over a case argued last month over the \u201c ministerial exception \u201d doctrine , which bars certain employees of churches or other religious institutions from suing their employers for employment discrimination .\nBut the ruling is still a momentous one . Title VII , as Professor Eskridge describes it , is a \u201c super statute . \u201d\n\u201c It has more ramifications for most Americans than the Constitution does , in terms of individual rights , \u201d he says . \u201c Discrimination based on sex \u2013 that \u2019 s a whopper . It \u2019 s a broad statute , and it applies to us . \u201d\n\u201c What is important to us ? It \u2019 s the same things that are important to other Americans , \u201d he adds . \u201c That \u2019 s to not be [ criminalized ] ; to have our families recognized ; and to have jobs and not to be discriminated against . \u201d",
