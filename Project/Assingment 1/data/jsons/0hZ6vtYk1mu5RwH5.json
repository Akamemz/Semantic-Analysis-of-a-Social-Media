Do students live with aged grandparents ? Do teachers have high-risk health conditions that would make online teaching safest ? Do infected children easily spread COVID-19 to each other and to adults ?\nRegarding the latter , some evidence suggests they don \u2019 t , but a big government study aims to find better proof . Results won \u2019 t be available before the fall , and some schools are slated to reopen in just a few weeks .\n\u201c These are complicated issues . You can \u2019 t just charge straight ahead , \u201d Dr. Tom Frieden , former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Wednesday during an online briefing .\nChildren infected with coronavirus are more likely than adults to have mild illnesses , but their risk for severe disease and death isn \u2019 t zero . While a virus-linked inflammatory condition is uncommon , most children who develop it require intensive care , and a few have died . Doctors don \u2019 t know which children are at risk .\n\u201c The single most important thing we can do to keep our schools safe has nothing to do with what happens in school . It \u2019 s how well we control COVID-19 in the community , \u201d Frieden said . \u201c Right now there are places around the country where the virus is spreading explosively and it would be difficult if not impossible to operate schools safely until the virus is under better control . \u201d\nZahrah Wattier teaches high school in Galveston , Texas , where cases and deaths have been spiking . Until the state recently said schools must reopen to in-person classes , her district had been weighing options many others are considering , including full-time online teaching or a hybrid mix .\nWattier \u2019 s school has mostly Hispanic and Black students , many from low-income families ; almost 70 % qualify for free or reduced-cost lunches and many have parents who work in \u201c essential \u201d jobs that increase potential exposure to the virus . Online education was hard for many with limited internet access , and Wattier knows in-person classes can help even the playing field .\n\u201c My school has over 2,000 students . That \u2019 s over 2,000 exposures in a day , \u201d said Wattier , whose parents live with the family and are both high-risk . \u201c It \u2019 s a lot to think about . It \u2019 s my job . It \u2019 s something I choose to do , it \u2019 s something I love . Now it comes at a really high risk . \u201d\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics , whose guidance the Trump administration has cited to support its demands , says the goal is for all students to be physically present in school . But , it adds , districts must be flexible , consult with health authorities and be ready to pivot as virus activity waxes and wanes .\n\u201c It is not that the American Academy of Pediatrics thinks this is a done deal because we have put out guidance , \u201d said Dr. Nathaniel Beers , a member of the academy \u2019 s school health council . \u201c But what we do know is that we need to have a more realistic dialogue about the implications of virtual learning on the future of children . We have left whole swaths of society behind , whether it \u2019 s because they have limited access to a computer , or broadband internet , \u201d or because of other challenges that online education can \u2019 t address .\nDeVos said local school officials are smart enough to know when conditions are not right .\n\u201c There \u2019 s going to be the exception to the rule , but the rule should be that kids go back to school this fall , \u201d she told CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\n\u201c And where there are little flare-ups or hot spots , that can be dealt with on a school by school or a case by case basis . \u201d\nFollowing CDC and academy guidelines would mean big changes for most schools .
