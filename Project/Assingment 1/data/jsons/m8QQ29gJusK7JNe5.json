Cunningham has served as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York under Rudolph Giuliani , general counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee under then-chair Joseph R. Biden , and general counsel of the White House Office of Administration under Bill Clinton .\nNelson W. Cunningham has served as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York under Rudy Giuliani , general counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee under then-Chair Joe Biden , and general counsel of the White House Office of Administration under Bill Clinton .\nThese months before the midterm elections are tough ones for all of us Mueller-watchers . As we expected , he has gone quiet in deference to longstanding Justice Department policy that prosecutors should not take actions that might affect pending elections . Whatever he is doing , he is doing quietly and even further from the public eye than usual .\nBut thanks to some careful reporting by Politico , which I have analyzed from my perspective as a former prosecutor , we might have stumbled upon How Robert Mueller Is Spending His Midterms : secretly litigating against President Donald Trump for the right to throw him in the grand jury .\nAs a former prosecutor and Senate and White House aide , I predicted here last May that Mueller would promptly subpoena Trump and , like independent counsel Kenneth Starr back in 1998 , bring a sitting president before his grand jury to round out and conclude his investigation . What Trump knew and when he knew it , and what exactly motivated his statements and actions , are central to Mueller \u2019 s inquiry on both Russian interference and obstruction of justice .\nAs the summer proceeded , we certainly heard a great deal from Rudy Giuliani , the president \u2019 s lawyer , about purported negotiations with Mueller \u2019 s office regarding the propriety and scope of Trump \u2019 s potential testimony . On August 15 , Giuliani said Trump would move to quash a subpoena and went so far as to say , \u201c [ W ] e \u2019 re pretty much finished with our memorandum opposing a subpoena . \u201d\nAnd then\u2014nothing . Labor Day came and went without a visible move by Mueller to subpoena the president , and we entered the quiet period before the midterms . Even the voluble Giuliani went quiet , more or less . Mindful of the time it would take to fight out the legal issues surrounding a presidential subpoena , and mindful of the ticking clock on Mueller \u2019 s now 18-month-old investigation , many of us began to wonder whether Mueller had decided to forgo the compelling and possibly conclusive nature of presidential testimony in favor of findings built on inference and circumstantial evidence . A move that would leave a huge hole in his final report and findings .\nBut now , thanks to Politico \u2019 s reporting ( backed up by the simple gumshoe move of sitting in the clerk \u2019 s office waiting to see who walks in and requests what file ) , we might know what Mueller has been up to : Since mid-August , he may have been locked in proceedings with Trump and his lawyers over a grand jury subpoena\u2014in secret litigation that could tell us by December whether the president will testify before Mueller \u2019 s grand jury .\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine \u2019 s email of the week \u2019 s best , delivered to your inbox every Friday morning .

Thanks to Politico \u2019 s Josh Gerstein and Darren Samuelsohn , we know that on August 16 ( the day after Giuliani said he was almost finished with his memorandum , remember ) , a sealed grand jury case was initiated in the D.C. federal district court before Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell . We know that on September 19 , Howell issued a ruling and five days later one of the parties appealed to the D.C . Circuit . And , thanks to Politico \u2019 s reporting , we know that the special counsel \u2019 s office is involved ( because the reporter overheard a conversation in the clerk \u2019 s office ) . We can further deduce that the special counsel prevailed in the district court and that the presumptive grand jury witness has frantically appealed that order and sought special treatment from the judges of the D.C. Circuit\u2014often referred to as the \u201c second-most important court in the land . \u201d\nNothing about the docket sheets , however , discloses the identity of the witness . Politico asked many of the known attorneys for Mueller witnesses\u2014including Jay Sekulow , another Trump lawyer\u2014and each one denied knowledge of the identity of the witness . ( What , of course , would we expect a lawyer to say when asked about a proceeding the court has ordered sealed ? )\nBut for those of us who have been appellate lawyers , the brief docket entries tell a story . Here \u2019 s what we can glean :\nThe parties and the judges have moved with unusual alacrity . Parties normally have 30 days to appeal a lower court action . The witness here appealed just five days after losing in the district court\u2014and three days later filed a motion before the appellate court to stay the district court \u2019 s order . That \u2019 s fast .\nThe appeals court itself responded with remarkable speed , too . One day after getting the witness \u2019 motion , the court gave the special counsel just three days to respond\u2014blindingly short as appellate proceedings go . The special counsel \u2019 s papers were filed October 1 .\nAt this point an unspecified procedural flaw seems to have emerged , and on October 3 , the appeals court dismissed the appeal . Just two days later , the lower court judge cured the flaw , the witness re-appealed , and by October 10 the witness was once again before appellate court . Thanks to very quick action of all the judges , less than one week was lost due to a flaw that , in other cases , could have taken weeks or months to resolve .\nBack before the D.C . Circuit , this case \u2019 s very special handling continued . On October 10 , the day the case returned to the court , the parties filed a motion for expedited handling , and within two days , the judges had granted their motion and set an accelerated briefing schedule . The witness was given just 11 days to file briefs ; the special counsel ( presumably ) just two weeks to respond ; and reply papers one week later , on November 14 ( for those paying attention , that \u2019 s eight days after the midterm elections ) . Oral arguments are set for December 14 .\nAt every level , this matter has commanded the immediate and close attention of the judges involved\u2014suggesting that no ordinary witness and no ordinary issue is involved . But is it the president ? The docket sheets give one final\u2014but compelling\u2014clue . When the witness lost the first time in the circuit court ( before the quick round trip to the district court ) , he petitioned , unusually , for rehearing en banc\u2014meaning the witness thought the case was so important that it merited the very unusual action of convening all 10 of the D.C . Circuit judges to review the order . That is itself telling ( this witness believes the case demands very special handling ) , but the order disposing of the petition is even more telling : Trump \u2019 s sole appointee to that court , Gregory Katsas , recused himself .\nWhy did he recuse himself ? We don \u2019 t know ; by custom , judges typically don \u2019 t disclose their reasons for sitting out a matter . But Katsas previously served in the Trump White House , as one of four deputy White House counsels . He testified in his confirmation hearings that in that position he handled executive branch legal issues , but made clear that apart from some discrete legal issues , he had not been involved in the special counsel \u2019 s investigation . If the witness here were unrelated to the White House , unless the matter raised one of the discrete legal issues on which Katsas had previously given advice , there would be no reason for the judge to recuse himself .\nBut if the witness were the president himself\u2014if the matter involved an appeal from a secret order requiring the president to testify before the grand jury\u2014then Katsas would certainly feel obliged to recuse himself from any official role . Not only was the president his former client ( he was deputy counsel to the president , remember ) but he owes his judicial position to the president \u2019 s nomination . History provides a useful parallel : In 1974 , in the unanimous Supreme Court decision United States v. Nixon , which required another witness-president to comply with a subpoena , Justice William Rehnquist recused himself for essentially the same reasons .\nWe can not know , from the brief docket entries that are available to us in this sealed case , that the matter involves Trump .
