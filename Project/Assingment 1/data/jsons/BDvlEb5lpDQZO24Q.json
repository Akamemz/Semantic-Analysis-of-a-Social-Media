It will simply be because more people voted for him than his opponents . ( Or at least in states that compose a majority of the Electoral College . )\nIf the election goes the other way , the same will not be said by a majority of Trump \u2019 s supporters . In poll after poll , most people pulling the level for Trump can only attribute one rationale to a prospective Trump loss : fraud .
