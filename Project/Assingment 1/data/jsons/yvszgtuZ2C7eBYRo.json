Hillary Clinton 's plans wo n't affect his decision , he says\nVice President Joe Biden is n't buying the growing consensus heading into Election Day that Republicans are poised to take control of the Senate .\n`` I do n't agree with the oddsmakers , '' Biden said in an exclusive interview with CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger . `` I predict we 're gon na ... keep the Senate . ''\nBut even if Republicans do win the chamber for the first time in nearly a decade , Biden did n't seem to think the victory would have much impact on the administration 's priorities .\n`` I do n't think it would change anything , in terms of what we 're about , '' he told Borger . `` We know what we have to get done the last two years . And -- quite frankly -- going into 2016 , the Republicans have to make a decision whether they 're in control or not in control . Are they gon na begin to allow things to happen ? Or are they gon na continue to be obstructionists ? And I think they 're gon na choose to get things done . ''\nJUST WATCHED GOP looking to take the Senate Replay More Videos ...

New polls over the weekend showed key races moving in the GOP 's favor , especially in Iowa , where Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst 's lead over the Democratic candidate is growing .\nThe vice president has played a crucial role for the administration during this election season , appearing with Democratic candidates across the country at a time when President Barack Obama 's popularity is waning . Biden was in Florida this weekend campaigning with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist as part of a trip that also took him to California and Nevada .\nBiden 's rigorous campaign schedule has raised questions about whether he might run for president in 2016 , particularly if Hillary Clinton decides to enter the race .\nThough Biden would n't say whether he would run for president , he made clear that he would n't base the decision on Clinton 's plans .\n`` That 's not the reason not to run or to run , '' he told Borger . `` The question is ... am I convinced I am best positioned of anyone else to lead the country the next four years ? ''\nIn the more immediate future , Biden said he did n't see the White House changing how it does business if the GOP wins the Senate majority .\n`` We have to be more direct and clear about exactly what it is we 're looking to do , '' he said . `` And look , we 're -- we 're ready to compromise .
