    "content": "We are embroiled in the fight for our lives . The secret to America \u2019 s greatness has been and is our culture . More than fighting ISIS in Syria or investigating the now-discredited Steele Dossier for two years , our nation \u2019 s future will rest on whether we can protect the Judeo-Christian culture that built this country and that continued making it the greatest nation humans ever created .\nWe are a great nation . We rebuild countries whose evil forces us first to fight and destroy them . We are generous \u2014 too generous \u2014 to our enemies when they encounter natural disasters . We are magnanimous in victory . For example , after World War I , we differed from our West European allies because we did not grab land from the vanquished . Our values for two centuries have guided us to be fair and understanding to those with whom we disagree . We allow fearless dissent and freedom to think , to assemble , to publish . For two centuries , we have respected and protected private property as much as any government possibly can , recognizing the inevitability of eminent domain when progress demands it . Even then , the Fifth Amendment includes Constitutional protections . A key \u2014 really , the key \u2014 to the economic prosperity that has made us , our dollar , and our financial markets the world \u2019 s financial standards by which all others measure themselves and their currencies is that we encourage personal responsibility , private investment , and we reward risk .\nWe are a good people . We also are a normal people . Our norms stem from values that trace to Holy Scripture , to ten Divine pronouncements that the Bible records at Mount Sinai , to the expanded values that derive from those recorded declarations . Thus , we have foundational principles of right and wrong . We know that truth is not subjective . We know that there are distinct differences between men and women , between humans and animals . For those of us who have studied other cultures and civilizations , other nations and histories , we have nothing to apologize for . Quite the contrary : We stand proud .\nBecause conservatives \u2014 social conservatives , theological conservatives , political conservatives \u2014 slept for the past half-century , we ceded too much of value to the Left . That which makes America great continues to be the values associated with conservatism . People from all over the world who try to enter our country , whether legally or otherwise , are not marching in caravans because they seek the life of Ferguson , Missouri or Detroit , Michigan . They want the America of wealth , of safety and low crime , of economic prosperity and limited governmental interference .\nThis past week marked the two-year anniversary \u2014 the half-way mark of the first term \u2014 since President Trump \u2019 s inauguration . It was a week that offered a snapshot into how endangered our American culture has become and how close to the abyss we had sunk before electing a once-in-a-generation President prepared to fight for this civilization before all is lost . By our indifference , we already have ceded academia for at least a generation , the \u201c news \u201d media , Broadway and Hollywood , and all major national team sports except baseball . Thanks both to the Democrat left and to the RINOs who controlled the reins of the Republican alternative for most of the past eight decades ( except for the brief Reagan respite ) , the culture that bred one \u201c greatest generation \u201d after another now is in jeopardy . Consider the lessons to draw in three themes of the past week : Sex , Lies , and Videotape .\nThe President invited the NCAA collegiate-champion Clemson Tigers football team to the White House as a treat celebrating their decisive victory over the Crimson Tide of Alabama . Because of the government shutdown \u2014 and may it absolutely continue unabated for the next two years into the November 2020 elections if the Pelosi San Francisco Democrats continue refusing to fund the Wall \u2014 the President served the football players fast-food burgers and fries instead of fancy White House Chef cuisine . He also joked to the players that he could have had his and Mike Pence \u2019 s wives instead make the boys some salads , but he figured that college football guys would prefer the Big Macs . There ensued the usual predictable uproar among the Democrat-CNN-MSNBC-WaPo\u2013NYT Left : the President is sexist , misogynist . Since when do we associate women with making salads ?\nSo let us identify normal . In the normal American world , women make the salads . Yes , there are great male chefs who make great salads . When some guy named Caesar Cardini made a salad , it was so unusual that they named the thing for him . Yes , single guys and loving husbands occasionally make a salad . But as the norm \u2014 that is , what is normal\u2014 wives make the salads . And guys kill the ants , roaches , and spiders . OK ? Now maybe there are single women who are adept at exterminating , but every exterminator ever sent to my home in forty years was a guy . In between visits , when needed , I buy the sprays , and I buy the powders . Snail Death . Raid . Deer Repellent ( works on rabbits , too ) . I have known thousands of men . Few of them make salads . If the word \u201c normal \u201d refers to the norm , then it is normal that women make the salads , and men kill the bugs .\nWhen the high-back executive office chair in our upstairs home office had to be brought downstairs and replaced , I did the heavy lifting . There never was a thought in my mind : \u201c Hey , why do I have to lift and carry this chair ? Why can \u2019 t she do it ? Why do I have to spray the ants ? \u201d Our home is a normal home \u2014 liberal-free . We share tons of chores . She cleans ; I clean . She throws out garbages ; I throw out garbages . But she \u2014 and only she \u2014 makes the salads . And I \u2014 and only I \u2014 carry the furniture down the stairs and kill the critters . That is normal .\nWhich of course brings the discussion to that idiotic Gillette ad . American men really need to respond by not buying Gillette-brand anything until that company changes its new advertising theme . If Coca-Cola could be forced by consumer outrage to bring back Classic Coke , this should be a cinch . It is not just about a product line , but about fighting back against a concerted effort to destroy our nation \u2019 s culture . Here is reality : Boys need to be boys . Men need to be men . There is nothing to apologize for . It is normal for a boy to be a boy . It is not normal for a boy to be a girl . It is not normal for a man to be a woman . These are not things of the norm . Yes , respect everyone . Do not lecture those who tilt differently . Treat all people fairly . Hire without prejudice . Don \u2019 t insult people or snicker or mock them for being different . But it still is the norm for a man to be a man , and for a woman to be a woman .\nAsk a hundred couples how they became couples , and the norm will be that the man at some point asked the woman . The man goes on his knees and proposes to the woman . A woman who goes on her knees and asks a man to marry her is pathetic . That is the norm . That is normal .\nAmerican men always have behaved properly . India has a rape issue . Saudi Arabia has a rape issue . South America has that issue . Not we . We do not apologize for outliers , and we must not be made crazy by man-haters , \u201c White Male Privilege \u201d enviers , Christianity-haters , Jew-haters , or any others among those burdened with their own issues . Men horse around in their way , and women do in their way . Despite the lies of the media , we do not live in a rape culture in this country , not even on the campuses . Men simply have more testosterone , and women have more estrogen . When the hordes invade \u2014 ISIS , Hamas , Hitler , Hezbollah , Mussolini , Genghis Khan \u2014 it will be the men of America whose masculinity will determine whether we remain free . Yes , we have wonderful brave women in the armed forces , too . Absolutely . But check out a Ken Burns series on the Civil War or on World War II . The courage , bravery , strength , and heroism that saw American men land in Normandy , survive Bataan and then return to liberate the Philippines , capture Saipan and Okinawa and the other Pacific Islands , win the Battle of the Bulge \u2014 those were men . The Bands of Brothers . Men who were men , reared in a culture of masculinity . They did not go around West Europe and the Pacific raping and massacring because those vile expressions are not inherent in masculinity but in depraved culture . However , the Judeo-Christian culture of the American male celebrates his testosterone masculinity while also regulating his behavior to remember that he is created in the image of G-d .\nThe Gillette ad is despicable because it is part of the CNN-MSNBC-Democrat-Left effort to neuter the American male . More than criticizing that ad , Americans must stop buying that company \u2019 s product until the company gets the message that the consumer is not buying . Let them sell their razors to women to slice the radicchio , chicory , and endives .\nMichael Cohen is a serial liar . Nothing he says can be believed as the truth . When he swears under oath , he is even less believable . The ultimate conundrum will come the day that he swears under oath that he is lying .\nBuzzFeed is a \u201c news \u201d outlet only to the degree that CNN is Cable Network \u201c News. \u201d In an era where lies are called \u201c news , \u201d we have reached a nadir akin to Communist Stalinism where they named one of their two \u201c news \u201d publications \u201c Pravda \u201d ( \u201c truth \u201d ) and the other one \u201c Izvestia \u201d ( \u201c news \u201d ) . There never was any pravda in Izvestia , nor any izvestia in Pravda . And now we have CNN and BuzzFeed each calling themselves \u201c news \u201d sources . BuzzFeed made itself famous by publishing the now-discredited Steele Dossier . Indeed , the only time anyone sees the term \u201c Steele Dossier \u201d it is preceded by the words \u201c now-discredited. \u201d This past week , BuzzFeed \u201c reported \u201d that President Trump had told Michael Cohen to lie to Congress .\nFirst of all , no one has to tell Michael Cohen to lie . That is like telling a one-month-old baby to cry if it gets hungry or dirty . It is like telling a person in a supermarket to take items from the shelves and place them in a cart if the shopper wants to buy it . Michael Cohen does not need to be told to lie . That would be like telling him to remember to breathe .\nSecond , it never happened . Just as the BuzzFeed fiction on the now-discredited ( see ? ) Steele Dossier was pure lies , so is the story that President Trump suborned perjury . With that lie , CNN went to town , as did MSNBC and all the other liars who keep saying they are not the \u201c enemy of the people. \u201d One by one , each one ran with stories like : \u201c IF the BuzzFeed story is true , then the President is exposed to impeachment. \u201d Well , IF it is true that Chuck Schumer raped Nancy Pelosi , then Schumer should be questioned . IF it is true that Obama colluded with Iran and was paid by the Iran Mullahs to sign the disastrous Iran Deal and to pay them $ 1.7 billion in cold cash and to dump cold water on the nascent Green Movement , then Obama should be investigated . IF it is true that the new Congressional Representative Rashida Tlaib is not an American citizen , then she should not be in Congress . IF it is true that the other one , Ilhan Omar , is a member of Hamas , then she should be investigated .\nThe way that the Left media have been at war with President Trump from the day he was elected , never giving him a honeymoon nor even a breather , never treating him with an even playing field , conniving day and night to destroy American reality to create a web of lies to destroy America \u2019 s faith in its duly and legitimately elected leaders , is despicable . Michael Cohen and BuzzFeed fit their narrative for them perfectly . A den of thieves , a pack of liars . Enemies of the American People \u2014 the whole murder of crows that they comprise .\nIn the age of social media \u2014 really , anti-social media \u2014 every tape potentially goes viral , often without context . With a 24/7 \u201c news \u201d cycle , there barely is time for the truth to see the light of day before the CNN-MSNBC-Democrat-Left media have published a false narrative and convinced a chunk of the public that the half-story of the tape is the whole truth . On issues of the day , which video do they show ?\nThey can show the pathetic \u201c Women \u2019 s March \u201d that now is proven to be decimated \u2014 literally , one-tenth of what it was only a year ago , as Louis Farrakhan acolytes Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory , vile Jew-haters both , took over the organization and its assets , driving \u201c Women \u2019 s March \u201d into cacophonic insignificance . Even the Democrat National Committee pulled out its co-sponsorship . Even the Democrats \u2019 radical women Presidential candidates stayed away : Elizabeth Warren , Kamala Harris . A year ago Kirsten Gillibrand was basking in Linda Sarsour ; this year she went to Iowa instead . One state \u2019 s \u201c Women \u2019 s March \u201d contingent pulled out , another state saw its marches canceled , celebrities pulled out . What building was Madonna blowing up this year ? In whose custody was Ashley Judd being strait-jacketed this year ?\nOr they can show the March for Life . One march on a Friday , the other on a Saturday . Same locale . One comprised of cheerful people , large numbers of them young , lovingly celebrating life , pointing to the science of the past forty years that now demonstrates conclusively and unequivocally that fetuses are living beings , begging that these lives not be killed .\nIn similar vein , an incident unfolds at the gorgeous March for Life , where some well-behaved fabulous Catholic teens from Covington , Kentucky , get confronted vilely by vicious insults from counter-protesters . The Catholic kids stand their ground quietly , respectfully , but defiantly refusing to back down . The anti-social media circulate videotape that is incomplete , without context , making it seem that the Catholic kids disrespected a Native American who was in their faces . In short order , the Catholic school blames its own fine kids . And it is left for this Orthodox rabbi to come to the defense of those teens in Catholic school and to say \u201c You kids handled yourselves beautifully . You have nothing to apologize for . \u201d\nWe are in a fight , a war , for our culture . The present government shutdown is about much more than merely whether a wall will be built . And that Wall itself is about much more than border control . It is about keeping opioids out , stopping human trafficking in defenseless women and children , and barring criminals , gang thugs , and terrorists from entering our land . But more than even that , it is about whether the combination of CNN-MSNBC-ABC-CBS-ABC along with the New York Times and the Washington Post actually can control and direct hearts and minds , destroying the pillars of American culture , and can force even the strongest Republican president we ever will have to cave in under pressure .\nThese people are liars , day and night , and the President has to hold his ground because \u2014 having seen the GOP \u2019 s mush of Nixons , Fords , Bushes , Doles , McCains , Romneys , and Ryans \u2014 we never will have another President strong enough to stand up to all of them if this President can not . He has to know we have his back . We are OK with the Government being shut down for the next two years if the Democrats will not fund the Wall that they always backed and endorsed and voted to fund before he was elected . If federal workers lose their jobs , we remember that the Democrats and their Left media never saw a problem in driving coal-mine workers out of their jobs and oil-producing and hydraulic-fracturing employees out of their jobs . When circumstances in economies change , people do not just get furloughed but laid off . It happens to all of us . They file for unemployment and then find new jobs . Too many of those jobs are wasteful anyway , and the extended furloughs offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity to terminate hundreds of thousands of federal jobs that need to be cut anyway . While his wife makes salads , the President must continue to be a man .",

When circumstances in economies change, people do not just get furloughed but laid off. It happens to all of us. They file for unemployment and then find new jobs. Too many of those jobs are wasteful anyway, and the extended furloughs offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity to terminate hundreds of thousands of federal jobs that need to be cut anyway.
