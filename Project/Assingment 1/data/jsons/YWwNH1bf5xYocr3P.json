    "content": "Jim Comey deserves a special place in the annals of sanctimonious frauds in Washington , D.C . He leaked , lied , bent rules , treated FBI material as his own personal property , violated confidential conversations , and generally acted like a government unto himself . But now he has the gall to write it all up in the sonorous nonsense language of \u201c constitutional crisis. \u201d His forthcoming memoir amounts to nothing more than the sour grapes of a self-serving operator over a wholly justified sacking .\nThe media is already burbling over its fatuous contents . Ever the leaker , Comey tossed a pre-publication morsel of gossip from the book to the liberals at the Daily Beast \u2014 Comey \u2019 s claim that General Kelly commiserated with him over his \u201c dishonorable \u201d firing . The White House has denied the claim . So Comey is already cashing in on betrayed confidences , all while lecturing others about \u201c loyalty \u201d and probity .\nWhat Comey calls \u201c higher loyalty \u201d is just adherence to the interests of an unaccountable ruling class and the needs of his own ego . Comey slithered out of the swamp and now plays the great conscience of Washington . He sighs , looks heavenward , quotes Reinhold Niebuhr , tries hard to look very thoughtful \u2014 only to relay low hearsay and peddle anti-Trump dreck . Who cares ? Comey \u2019 s wounded ego is not a constitutional crisis . The scandal is not that he lost his exalted job but that such a pompous creep once held it .\nTo understand the depth of Comey \u2019 s leaking and lying , all you have to do is go back and look at his scummy maneuvering in response to Trump \u2019 s \u201c wiretap \u201d tweets . Those tweets turned out to be entirely accurate : The Obama administration was intercepting communications at Trump Tower , both during the campaign and the transition . Comey knew perfectly well that Trump was right \u2014 FBI agents had been sifting through the Trump Tower records of Carter Page and Paul Manafort \u2014 but he sent his team out to lie about Trump \u2019 s tweets anyways .\nHe had a story placed in the New York Times shortly after Trump \u2019 s tweets : \u201c Comey Asks Justice Department to Reject Trump \u2019 s Wiretapping Claim. \u201d It quoted Comey \u2019 s leakers , \u201c senior American officials , \u201d as saying that Trump \u2019 s assertion was \u201c false \u201d and that the FBI director had asked the Justice Department to refute it .\nAs Comey \u2019 s stenographer , the Times wrote up his lie in its inimitably smearing style :\nMr. Comey \u2019 s request is a remarkable rebuke of a sitting president , putting the nation \u2019 s top law enforcement official in the position of questioning Mr. Trump \u2019 s truthfulness . The confrontation between the two is the most serious consequence of Mr. Trump \u2019 s weekend Twitter outburst , and it underscores the dangers of what the president and his aides have unleashed by accusing the former president of a conspiracy to undermine Mr. Trump \u2019 s young administration .\nSo here was an FBI director using the front page of a newspaper to libel a sitting president , all while a FISA warrant based on Hillary \u2019 s campaign research , which gave Comey the power to reach into Trump Tower , sat on his desk .
