The Chicago Mayor was blunt about his position , saying , `` Her remarks are not anti-Israel ; they are anti-Semitic . ''\nNo one is questioning the right of members of Congress and others to criticize Israeli policies . But Omar is crossing a line that should not be crossed in political discourse .
