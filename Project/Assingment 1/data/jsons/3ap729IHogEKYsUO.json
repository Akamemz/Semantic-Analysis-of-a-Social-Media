    "content": "It seems like every few weeks we get a new explanation for why Jeb Bush should continue running president . As the summer dragged and Donald Trump shot to the top of the national polls while Jeb \u2019 s support began to soften , Jeb \u2019 s plan was to use the debates to offer himself as a serious alternative to Trump , someone who could fix problems and get things done . He did that , and his numbers kept dropping . But not to worry , Jeb said as we transitioned to autumn , things will turn around once the mailers are sent out and the TV ads start airing in the early primary states . The mail went out and the ads were aired , and his numbers kept dropping . Here we are in late October , and JebWorld has a new rationale to offer : forget about the polls and forget about the early states , it \u2019 s all about money and delegates , and we \u2019 ll outlast everyone else .\nMike Murphy , the head of Jeb \u2019 s super PAC , Right to Rise , gave a big interview to Bloomberg \u2019 s Sasha Issenberg this week in which he laid out pretty much every facet of his strategic thinking regarding Jeb \u2019 s candidacy . His group has been blasting Iowa and New Hampshire with millions of dollars in pro-Jeb propaganda for the last several weeks , only to see his candidate \u2019 s numbers keep dropping . So it was revealing when he described how he sees the race shaking out once the voting starts and insisted that the early states won \u2019 t matter :\nBLOOMBERG : During that period , you expect several candidates to be clumped together as far as delegates are concerned . MURPHY : Yeah , for a while , for a while . I mean February 's not really about delegates , it 's about media momentum . BLOOMBERG : When do you expect that to change ? MURPHY : March 15 is the big day . On the 16th , I do n't think anybody will have a mathematical lock , but there definitely will be a very strong leading candidate .\nAs Dave Weigel notes , this is the same thinking that animated Ron Paul \u2019 s 2012 campaign , which is weird given that Paul was an outsider running on an ideologically heterodox platform , while Bush is the concentrated essence of establishment Republican politics . The argument here is that Jeb , unlike other candidates , will have the financial resources to stay in the race basically forever , and once the other candidates flame out , their voters will come home to Team Bush . What they \u2019 re basing that assumption on is anyone \u2019 s guess , given that Republican voters seem to show nothing but growing contempt for Jeb as time goes by . The latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 44 percent of Republican primary voters could not see themselves supporting Bush .\nTeam Jeb has a different view of things , obviously . In Murphy \u2019 s vision of the 2016 primary , there are two \u201c lanes \u201d for candidates . \u201c I 'm more interested in what percent of the electorate is considering Jeb versus others , \u201d he explained . \u201c I 'm interested in lanes , kind of the Grievance Lane versus the Optimistic Lane. \u201d Jeb , obviously , falls into the Optimistic Lane . Candidates like Donald Trump , Ben Carson , Ted Cruz , and Mike Huckabee are the Grievance Lane inhabitants . But what about the other candidates ? Specifically , what about Marco Rubio ? He \u2019 s the big threat to steal away Jeb \u2019 s establishment support , so what does Murphy think of him ?\nWell , while Jeb is in the Optimistic Lane , Rubio is in the \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Cynical Lane :\nMURPHY : What \u2019 s interesting about Marco \u2019 s campaign \u2013 and in the end I think all the essential truth of the stuff bubbles up to the voters and they sort it out pretty well \u2013 is there 's a cynicism to it . It \u2019 s cynical to run as the creature of new , fresh , while it \u2019 s all secret dark money . Maybe from one person , we don \u2019 t know . It \u2019 s cynical to say , \u201c I \u2019 m going to take the lead on defeating this horrible Iran deal that we all hate , \u201d and broadcast your ads to defeat that deal only on the Fox Network , where everybody is already against the deal , instead of running those ads on MSNBC to pressure Democratic senators that were the outcome to beating that deal . Cynically use it just to raise your name ID among Republican primary voters who already agree with you on the deal . There is a cynicism behind the young , fresh brand that I think is going to catch up with him .\nJeb himself previewed his anti-Rubio strategy earlier this month , questioning Rubio \u2019 s leadership capabilities and suggesting the young first-term senator wasn \u2019 t up for the rigors of the presidency . What Jeb and Murphy are doing here is a version of what Hillary Clinton tried to do to Barack Obama in 2008 .\nIf you \u2019 ll recall , Obama spent basically the entire month of February 2008 dunking on Hillary , winning primary after primary and running up the delegate count .
