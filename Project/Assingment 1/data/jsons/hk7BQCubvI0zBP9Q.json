    "content": "Working for the federal government used to mean a trade-off -- lower salaries , in exchange for higher job security . Today , that trade-off is gone as federal workers often make good money with little risk of being fired .\nThough numbers are hard to come by in the mammoth 2.4 million-employee federal workforce , an analysis by USA Today found the federal government fired only one half of one percent of its workers in fiscal year 2011 . That 's about five times smaller than in the private sector .\nIf Congress and the Executive Branch are loath to confront the bloat in government , there may be good reason . Firing federal workers is hard .\n`` When President Carter first came to office , he decided that he was going to revamp the civil service process , '' said Tom Schatz , president of the nonprofit Citizens Against Government Waste . `` Nobody really talked to him much after that in the federal agencies .

''\nThat , of course , was a reference to Jeff Neely , the organizer of the infamous $ 800,000 General Services Administration conference in Las Vegas .\nAnd still , Neely was not technically fired -- civil service regulations allowed him to retire with benefits .\nJust this month , another GSA executive , Paul Prouty , who was fired after the Vegas conference scandal , was re-instated with 11 months back-pay after an administrative judge ruled against the GSA .\nAnother example of the cumbersome process of employee discipline in the federal government is the Baltimore-based Social Security Administration worker who was reprimanded for `` excessive flatulence '' last year . Five pages of meticulous notes documenting his 61 infractions were catalogued over several months .

Tom Coburn , R-Okla. , said . `` The vast majority of them do superb work . ''\nBut he added , `` You ca n't get highly effective people to come work in the federal government because they have no capability to manage the people under them -- because of the office of Office of Personnel Management rules and union contracts . ''\nStill , the existing system has no shortage of defenders . `` They are the best-educated workforce in the United States . They tend to be highly specialized .
