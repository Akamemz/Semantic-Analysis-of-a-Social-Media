If he runs , he will use that half-billion-dollar stake \u2014 roughly $ 175 million more than the Trump campaign spent over the course of the entire 2016 election cycle \u2014 to fuel his campaign through the 2020 primary season , with the expectation that the sum represents a floor , not a ceiling , on his potential spending .\nIf Bloomberg declines to seek the presidency , his intention is to run an unprecedented data-heavy campaign designed to operate as a shadow political party for the eventual Democratic nominee .\n\u201c That \u2019 ll get us through the first few months , \u201d Kevin Sheekey , a top adviser to the former New York mayor , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 when asked about the $ 500 million plan , which is just 1 percent of Bloomberg \u2019 s estimated net worth .\n\u201c Mike spent $ 100 million in his last New York City election . And you can do the math as you think more broadly but New York City is 3 percent of the national population , \u201d Sheekey said . \u201c I \u2019 m not suggesting it \u2019 s straight math . But I \u2019 m suggesting that when Mike Bloomberg is committed to making a difference and seeing something though , generally speaking he \u2019 s pretty unabashed in doing so . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

According to Plan B , Bloomberg uses all the data \u2014 ranging from meticulously researched profiles of voters to polling data on the top issues that move the electorate \u2014 and field staff to help the otherwise-outgunned Democratic Party nominee to end Trump \u2019 s presidency .\nBloomberg said Friday at an event in Orlando , Fla. , that he \u2019 ll make a decision in \u201c three more weeks . \u201d\nHe also made clear that he \u2019 s not waiting on former Vice President Joe Biden , who \u2019 s also mulling a bid for president and who , Bloomberg advisers acknowledge , could draw from the same pool of moderate primary voters .\n`` My decision does n't depend on what other people are going to do , '' Bloomberg told The Associated Press . `` My decision depends on whether or not I think I can make a difference . ''\nStill , the subject of Biden has come up in discussions with those who have discussed Bloomberg \u2019 s options with his team .\nIn those conversations , Democratic operatives say , Bloomberg \u2019 s team members have indicated that they \u2019 re polling and conducting focus groups , and are familiar with the primary election calendar and the complicated politics of wringing delegates from various states . They \u2019 re also under no illusions about the difficulties of a Democratic Party newcomer running as a centrist in a progressive primary .\nBut Bloomberg \u2019 s aides are operating under the assumption that while the billionaire can \u2019 t buy the nomination , hundreds of millions of dollars can put him in contention .\n\u201c Five hundred million is just an obscene amount of money . It \u2019 s crazy , enough to buy up all the TV ad inventory in the seven or eight states that really matter in a primary , \u201d said a Democratic consultant familiar with the plans who privately shared information from a conversation with a top Bloomberg adviser .\nThe consultant said it was unclear what Bloomberg would ultimately decide . But the mission would be similar either way .\n\u201c They \u2019 re going to do the infrastructure and logistical work to fill in the gaps for the state and national parties so that whoever the nominee is would inherit a state-of-the-art , fully functioning infrastructure , \u201d the consultant said . \u201c It \u2019 s being done with a clear and specific purpose : stopping Donald Trump . \u201d\nBloomberg \u2019 s team knows the former mayor would need every penny to make his case to a Democratic electorate that \u2019 s shifting ever-leftward and that \u2019 s increasingly suspicious of billionaires and older white males .\nProgressives also doubt his Democratic bona fides for having backed Republican candidates in the past , supporting the stop-and-frisk New York City policing policies that disproportionately targeted African-Americans and supporting gas and oil pipelines that leave some Democrats doubting his commitment to fight climate change \u2014 despite his commitment of $ 218 million to help cities reduce their carbon footprint while also financing the Sierra Club \u2019 s unprecedented Beyond Coal campaign that has shuttered 282 coal-fired electricity plants .\nThough raised a Democrat , Bloomberg , 76 , was elected to the first of his three New York mayoral terms as a Republican , became an independent in 2007 before he left office in 2013 and registered last year as a Democrat .\nBut if Bloomberg runs , his polling would likely show there \u2019 s a path for a centrist in a field of progressives , who presumably would cannibalize the progressive base . Surveys from Bloomberg \u2019 s longtime pollster , Doug Schoen , shows that 80 percent of Democratic primary voters respond positively to Bloomberg \u2019 s biography .\n\u201c When people learn about his involvement in climate change activism and gun safety , and when they learn that he \u2019 s not just a billionaire \u2014 but he came from a middle-class background and his dad never earned more than $ 6,000 a year , and you talk about the work he \u2019 s done on the ground and his philanthropy \u2014 Dem primary voters view him favorably , \u201d said one Democrat familiar with the polling .\nWith a net worth of $ 50 billion , Bloomberg contributed so much last year to charity \u2014 $ 767 million \u2014 that he was the nation \u2019 s second-biggest philanthropist behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos . Bloomberg \u2019 s charitable causes also overlap top issues for the Democratic electorate , such as climate change and gun control .\nHis giving provides a ripe area for contrast : the Bloomberg Philanthropies \u2019 compared with the Donald J.

Trump \u2019 s foundation agreed last year to dissolve amid an investigation from New York \u2019 s attorney general , who said it was \u201c functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump \u2019 s business and political interests [ and engaged in ] a shocking pattern of illegality . \u201d\nIn a primary , Bloomberg \u2019 s deep pockets would enable an extended run with adequate resources , said Sheekey , a longtime political adviser .\n\u201c The pressure for most people is two things : the need to raise money and the need to find the best and most-competitive staff , \u201d he said . \u201c Obviously , the first is not a problem for Mike and since we started this process , we \u2019 ve put together a core staff that we \u2019 re very happy with that is committed to staying with Mike as long as he wants , partly because Mike has talked about , if he doesn \u2019 t run , going down a separate path and having the kind of impact on a larger scale than he did in the last midterm . \u201d\nSheekey , who makes the case for Bloomberg for president better than Bloomberg himself , runs the weekly data-and-strategy meetings with Howard Wolfson , who oversaw Bloomberg \u2019 s political operation last year \u2014 when the former mayor contributed $ 110 million to 24 Democratic congressional candidates , 21 of whom won .\nHis top adviser at City Hall and the executive director of Bloomberg Philanthropies , Patti Harris , rounds out the inner circle \u2019 s troika .\nA data-driven effort like the one the Bloomberg operation envisions , as first reported by the Atlantic , hearkens back to the roots of the billionaire \u2019 s wealth .
