It 's very early on , but here 's some things we can already tell .\n1 . According to Cohen 's own lawyer , the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York ( widely regarded within itself as being the most important and prestigious U.S. Attorney 's Office in the country ) secured the search warrants for the FBI , based on a referral from Robert Mueller 's office .

Moreover , it 's not just that the office thought that there was enough for a search warrant . They thought there was enough for a search warrant of an attorney 's office for that attorney 's client communications . That 's a very fraught and extraordinary move that requires multiple levels of authorization within the Department of Justice . The U.S. Attorney 's Manual ( USAM ) \u2014at Section 9-13.320\u2014contains the relevant policies and procedures . The highlights :\nThe feds are only supposed to raid a law firm if less intrusive measures wo n't work . As the USAM puts it :\nIn order to avoid impinging on valid attorney-client relationships , prosecutors are expected to take the least intrusive approach consistent with vigorous and effective law enforcement when evidence is sought from an attorney actively engaged in the practice of law . Consideration should be given to obtaining information from other sources or through the use of a subpoena , unless such efforts could compromise the criminal investigation or prosecution , or could result in the obstruction or destruction of evidence , or would otherwise be ineffective .\nSuch a search requires high-level approval . The USAM requires such a search warrant to be approved by the U.S. attorney\u2014the head of the office , a presidential appointee\u2014and requires `` consultation '' with the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice . This is not a couple of rogue AUSAs sneaking in a warrant .\nSuch a search requires an elaborate review process . The basic rule is that the government may not deliberately seize , or review , attorney-client communications . The USAM\u2014and relevant caselaw\u2014therefore require the feds to set up a review process . That process might involve a judge reviewing the materials to separate out what is privileged ( or what might fall within an exception to the privilege ) , or else set up a `` dirty team '' that does the review but is insulated from the `` clean team '' running the investigation . Another option is a `` special master , '' an experienced and qualified third-party attorney to do the review . Sometimes the reviewing team will only be identifying and protecting privileged material . Sometimes the reviewing team will be preparing to seek , or to implement , a court ruling that the documents are not privileged . ( Robert Mueller is aggressive on this sort of thing ; he already sought and obtained a court ruling that some of Paul Manafort 's communications with his lawyers were not privileged because they were undertaken for the purpose of fraud\u2014the so-called `` crime-fraud exception '' to the attorney-client privilege . )\n3 . A magistrate judge signed off on this . Federal magistrate judges ( appointed by local district judges , not by the president ) review search warrant applications .
