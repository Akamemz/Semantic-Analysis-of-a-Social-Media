The anti-apartheid movement of the 1970s and '80s \u2013 where Barack Obama got his political start ; I covered the University of Wisconsin 's successful divestment movement with the Daily Cardinal in 1978 -- was demonized as the far left at the time . Moderates proposed alternatives like the Sullivan Principles , named after Rev .

Reagan vetoed an amazingly ( if belatedly ) bipartisan bill to impose tough sanctions on the apartheid regime . Of course then-congressman Dick Cheney had voted against the sanctions in 1986 , and he defended his position while running for vice president in 2000 , telling ABC : `` The ANC was then viewed as a terrorist organization ...

''\nThe Heritage Foundation was a clubhouse for apartheid backers ; as late as 1990 , when Mandela had been freed from prison and traveled to the U.S. , Heritage suggested he was a terrorist , `` not a freedom fighter .

For a time he believed ending apartheid would require armed resistance , and although he eventually renounced violence , he refused to do so as a condition of being released from prison . He was a revolutionary who believed in a radical redistribution of wealth , and a global warrior against poverty , to the end . Yes , it \u2019 s important to remember his legacy of reconciliation , and love , toward white South Africans who had brutalized him .
