Because the strikes are classified operations , the U.S. typically does not acknowledge when they occur , or reveal how many combatants and civilians are killed or injured .\nAn official for the Air Force \u2014 the service primarily tasked with carrying out drone strikes \u2014 said \u201c tactical directives have changed a number of times over the years to tackle collateral damage concerns not only from aircraft and helicopters but from mortars and other weapons that deliver effects beyond line of sight . \u201d\nThe official , who requested anonymity to discuss security matters , declined to say how the directives have changed or what the collateral damage concerns are , citing \u201c operational security . \u201d\nMilitary officials , however , said the Joint Chiefs document is one of several that instruct commanders on conducting drone strikes , as well as theater-specific rules of engagement and the overarching Law of Armed Conflict .\nThe October 2012 document was published on a Pentagon website several months ago but has since been removed , said Public Intelligence founder and editor Michael Haynes , who obtained and analyzed the documents .\nA military official confirmed that the document is being used , among others , to provide guidance for drones .\nHuman rights groups say such secrecy prevents scrutiny and accountability for civilian casualties . Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have released reports focused on Pakistan and Yemen that say the strikes could be illegal and that the U.S. has killed more than 4,700 people , including more than 1,000 civilians .\nAdministration officials say the strikes are legal because the U.S. is at war with al Qaeda and its associates .
