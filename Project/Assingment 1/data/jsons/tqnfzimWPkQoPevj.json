But there \u2019 s also a divide between steps taken in America \u2019 s large cities , where the disease hit first , and its rural counties , where people might not be able to even see their nearest neighbor .\nPeople in rural areas have social distancing \u201c already built into their lifestyle , \u201d Representative Larson says , but when the statewide order went into effect , \u201c people took that seriously . \u201d\nAs more cases were reported , Lyle Larson , a Republican state representative from San Antonio , was calling for weeks for a statewide order . He understands the various interests the governor had to balance , however , including broader health care realities , such as 26 rural hospitals that have closed across the state since 2010 .\nSome 9 in 10 Texans live in or near a city , but the state boasts vast stretches of ranchland , scrub , and desert . Until early April , Republican Gov . Greg Abbott preferred to let cities and counties decide for themselves the wisest course of action .\nRep. Vikki Goodwin \u2019 s district in Texas took swift action to protect residents from the novel coronavirus in early March . Austin canceled the popular SXSW festival for the first time in more than three decades , losing an estimated $ 350 million in revenue .\nBut last week , 30 miles out in her district , which stretches into the sparsely populated Hill Country , the town of Lago Vista 's golf course was still open \u2013 a week after Republican Gov . Greg Abbott issued a statewide stay-at-home order .\nIn more suburban and rural stretches of Texas , there seems to be a sense that the virus is a distant , perhaps overblown , crisis .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a concern to me , \u201d says state Representative Goodwin , a Democrat . \u201c In rural areas the feeling is it hasn \u2019 t gotten there yet and it won \u2019 t spread . There \u2019 s maybe a false sense of security . \u201d\nThe U.S. , as has been widely reported , has adopted a state-by-state approach to battling the novel coronavirus . But there \u2019 s also a divide between steps taken in America \u2019 s large cities , where the disease hit first , and its rural counties , where people might not be able to even see their nearest neighbor and social distancing has long been a way of life . The idea that \u201c it can \u2019 t happen here \u201d also plays on cultural suspicions that date back to Aesop \u2019 s Fables , where the country mouse tells the city mouse she prefers her plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it .\nNow , as COVID-19 sweeps into small-town America \u2013 with two-thirds of rural counties reporting at least one confirmed case as of last week \u2013 a new pandemic geography is emerging . In a recent poll , 74 % of Democrats support restrictive policies to protect people , including some infringements on civil liberties , as did 71 % of Republicans .\n\u201c The initial take among a lot of elected officials and Southerners in general , especially in rural areas , was ... \u2018 This is their problem . We don \u2019 t see it , \u2019 \u201d says Cal Jillson , a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas . \u201c When you put the importance of church with the small government ethic and where people don \u2019 t want to be told what to do , it \u2019 s true , you can do the wrong thing for a good and understandable reason and still pay a very heavy price . \u201d\nIn rural America , that \u2019 s playing out from pews to boat ramps .\nIn St. Augustine , Florida , some 10,000 people have signed Eric Hires \u2019 petition to reopen the beaches of St. Johns County , despite the state \u2019 s 20,000 confirmed cases .\n\u201c People have called me selfish , but this has become much bigger than me , \u201d says Mr . Hires , a surfer in his 30s , in a phone interview . He points out the golf course was allowed to stay open , and says he just wants early and late-morning hours with no congregating . \u201c I \u2019 m more libertarian . I don \u2019 t like the government infringing on rights or freedoms . But there is also an element of personal freedom . If you live near the beach and the ocean is your sanctuary , you should be able to go there . \u201d\nSome 9 in 10 Texans live in or near a big city , but the state boasts vast stretches of ranchland , scrub , and desert . Until early April , Governor Abbott preferred to let cities and counties decide for themselves the wisest course of action .\nAs more cases were reported , Lyle Larson , a Republican state representative from San Antonio , had been calling for weeks for a statewide order . He understands the various interests the governor had to balance , however , including politics and broader health care realities , including that 26 rural hospitals have closed across the state since 2010 .\nRicardo B. Brazziell/Austin American-Statesman/AP Texas Gov . Greg Abbott expressed optimism during a coronavirus news conference , April 10 , 2020 , in Austin , Texas . Governor Abbott also said the state 's death toll was lower than many other states .\n\u201c Some people don \u2019 t like the government making blanket declarations on what they can and can \u2019 t do , and there are others who want a total shutdown , \u201d says Representative Larson . People in rural areas have social distancing \u201c already built into their lifestyle , \u201d he adds , but when the statewide order went into effect , \u201c people took that seriously . \u201d\nA handful of states with large rural populations have yet to order statewide lockdowns , trying to balance local interests against what former FEMA director Craig Fugate calls a \u201c slow-rolling disaster . \u201d\n\u201c What is happening is that there is much less coordinated federal control in this emergency than in past ones , so you do see an absolute flowering of federalism driven by ... geography , demography , and ideological makeup , \u201d says Mr. Jillson . \u201c That means if you are in the South or Mountain West and you have a diverse state geographically \u2013 a few major cities and large open stretches between them \u2013 you have been conflicted as to how to proceed . \u201d\nNoting a regional difference , \u201c we \u2019 ve been pretty aggressive as a geography and I think that \u2019 s important , \u201d Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer , a Democrat , said on CNN . Governor Whitmer issued a stay-at-home order in March , one of the first governors to do so , but Michigan remains one of the hardest-hit states , with about 25,000 cases .\nIn contrast , South Dakota Gov . Kristi Noem , a Republican , told a press conference in early April that \u201c the people themselves are primarily responsible for their safety. \u201d And , she added , \u201c South Dakota is not New York City. \u201d Over the weekend , one of the largest pork processors in the U.S. , Smithfield , announced it was shutting down its Sioux Falls plant indefinitely after 293 workers tested positive .\nPeople talk about infringements on constitutional rights , but \u201c what I think people forget about is their constitutional responsibilities : You live in this country and you have a duty that includes not endangering others , \u201d says Polly Price , a professor of law and global health at Emory University in Atlanta . \u201c This kind of effort relies on citizen participation . \u201d\nOn Tybee Island , the stakes have risen dramatically . On March 20 , after spring break crowds flocked along Tybrisa Street , the city barricaded the beach .\nBut in early April , as part of a statewide lockdown order , Republican Gov . Brian Kemp reopened the beaches to allow Georgians to access their common outdoor property . His chief of staff even urged , \u201c Go to the beach ! \u201d\nPatrik Jonsson/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Two Georgia state troopers try to keep a minimum six foot distance on April 5 , 2020 , as they prepare to patrol the beach at Tybee Island . Gov . Brian Kemp reopened Georgia 's three beaches , including Tybee , superseding local closure orders . That means law enforcement is walking a thin line \u2018 between a rock and a hard place , ' says one trooper after his shift .\nAs a precaution , Governor Kemp sent dozens of state troopers and game wardens to patrol to make sure social distancing protocols were observed .\nKen and Jessica Branch drove down from North Carolina , where beach communities have closed off access to outsiders .\n\u201c As long as we abide by the rules , I think we \u2019 ll be OK. We needed a break . We needed this , \u201d says Ms . Branch .\nTybee local Dan Lockwood , on the other hand , watched beachgoers violate six-foot distancing orders as they passed each other on narrow dune overwalks . \u201c Governor Kemp is basically saying , \u2018 Stay at home , but don \u2019 t take it seriously , \u2019 \u201d says Mr. Lockwood .\nLike many Republicans along the conservative Georgia coast , state Rep. Jeff Jones , a carwash operator , has struggled to come to terms with the governor \u2019 s decision .\nOn one hand , he says , \u201c I think media reporting of the CV-19 outbreak is overblown . \u201d\nYet Representative Jones disagrees with Mr. Kemp \u2019 s decision to reopen the beaches , including those in his district at St. Simons Island .\n\u201c I am scratching my head , \u201d he writes in an email . \u201c Locally , we logically knew that if people travel away from their homes , the chances of spreading the highly contagious CV-19 increased exponentially . This has , no surprise , turned out to be correct . \u201d\nTo Mr. Fugate , who served as Florida \u2019 s emergency director under former Republican Gov . Jeb Bush and as FEMA director under Democratic President Barack Obama , the case-by-case approach underscores larger failures of communication as the pandemic moves into arguably more vulnerable populations , given health and welfare disparities in the South .\n\u201c Until we have enough ability to do rapid testing and until everybody self-isolates , we are still on the front end of the pandemic , \u201d says Mr. Fugate , who hails from a Southern tobacco farming family and vacations on Georgia \u2019 s Jekyll Island . \u201c We \u2019 re seeing places like New York explode , we \u2019 re watching New Orleans explode , and then now Albany , Georgia , and these micro-areas that don \u2019 t have a lot of depth [ in their health care systems ] . We know what to do , yet we are reluctant or slow to embrace the only tools that we have . It \u2019 s a brutal math : Do people die or do businesses die ? \u201d\nThe fears of outsiders played out in Huntsville , Alabama , as the crisis began in late February .\nA federal plan to house stricken cruise ship passengers on a decommissioned Army base fell apart amid a conspiracy theory-fueled pushback from residents and politicians . Seeing what he considers a lack of resolve in the federal response , Michael Barton , Calhoun County emergency management director , initiated the state \u2019 s first infectious disease task force .\nUntil two weeks ago , Alabama had not recorded a single death and Republican Gov . Kay Ivey had resisted a lockdown . \u201c Y \u2019 all , we are not California , \u201d she said . \u201c We are not New York . We are not even Louisiana . \u201d\nBut by last week , as the state recorded 1,400 cases \u2013 including 200 nurses \u2013 Governor Ivey switched course , ending a press conference with a prayer for Alabamans \u2019 safety .\n\u201c Those numbers are increasing and that gets people \u2019 s attention , \u201d says Mr. Barton , a former special deputy United States marshal . \u201c Sure , we have some people saying it \u2019 s overblown . But the mantra we are following here is we are going to prepare for the worst and work for the best . \u201d\nOn Tybee Island , the crowds never really arrived . While the beaches are technically open , the city fought to keep the majority of narrow dune crossovers closed to enforce distancing . And after the town of 3,000 people \u2013 which has at least six first responders in quarantine and two hospitalized city employees \u2013 became inundated with requests for short-term rentals , the governor reinstated the ban on rentals in an amended order Wednesday .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
