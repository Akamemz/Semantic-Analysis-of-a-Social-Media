    "content": "( CNN ) Sen. Kamala Harris ended her 2020 presidential campaign on Tuesday , an abrupt departure for a candidate who was once seen as a leading contender for the Democratic nomination .\nThe California Democrat told her senior staff of the decision Tuesday morning , and later sent an email to supporters and released a video on Twitter .\n`` To you my supporters , my dear supporters , it is with deep regret -- but also with deep gratitude -- that I am suspending our campaign today , '' Harris said in the video .\n`` But I want to be clear with you : I am still very much in this fight , '' Harris continued . `` And I will keep fighting every day for what this campaign has been about . Justice for the people . All the people . ''\nHarris ' exit from the race is a precipitous fall for a candidate who launched her campaign to high expectations . The senator has struggled for months to move her low poll numbers and said Tuesday that financial pressures led her to end her bid . The lack of support and money led to internal squabbling in the closing months of the campaign , campaign sources told CNN , all of which contributed to her inability to stay in the race .\nIt has been the honor of my life to be your candidate .

''\n`` I 'm not a billionaire . I ca n't fund my own campaign . And as the campaign has gone on , it 's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete , '' Harris said .\nHarris will travel to the early-voting states this week to personally and privately thank staff and supporters there for their hard work and dedication .\nThe move drew a snarky tweet from President Donald Trump , who said , `` Too bad . We will miss you Kamala ! ''\nHarris launched her campaign on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January , a nod to how her candidacy and possible nomination would be a historic moment for the country and party . Harris now exiting the race means Democrats are losing the only black woman -- a key voting bloc to the party -- running in the 2020 primary .\nHarris had struggled to gain traction in the race for months . The campaign , in a bid to resuscitate her presidential hopes , turned all of its attention to Iowa in the fall , pledging to keep Harris in the state as much as possible and telling reporters that anything less than a third-place finish in the state would be a loss .\nAn early sign that Harris ' bid was facing challenges came in November when her campaign -- in an effort to further go all in on Iowa -- all but shuttered her organization in New Hampshire and redeployed staff in Nevada and California to Iowa .\nThe move was an about face for the senator , who had launched her campaign by touting her ability not only to compete in places like Iowa and New Hampshire , but also seize on her local and neighboring status in Nevada and California .\nBut Harris ' departure this early before the Iowa caucuses was unexpected , especially considering she had already qualified for the December debate stage , something a number of candidates still in the race had yet to do .\nOne reason that could have led to Harris ' sudden ending of her bid : The financial situation inside the campaign was more dire than widely known . For example , the campaign had only reserved less than $ 10,000 for a digital ad that it had touted with much fanfare earlier this week .
