Hawaii , will decide the ultimate fate of President Donald Trump \u2019 s third travel ban , which prohibits travel from six Muslim-majority countries and North Korea . The nine justices will hear 30 minutes of argument from each side : the government , represented by Solicitor General Noel Francisco , and the assembled plaintiffs , represented by President Barack Obama \u2019 s one-time acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal .\nThe ban \u2019 s opponents , including the state of Hawaii and the George Soros-funded International Refugee Assistance Project , have tried to characterize it as a \u201c Muslim Ban \u201d and are challenging it on both First Amendment Establishment Clause and statutory grounds , using language of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( INA ) . The U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Ninth and Fourth circuits have both already agreed with these opponents , striking down the bans repeatedly on statutory and constitutional grounds respectively . The Fourth Circuit was ruling on a similar case whose ultimate outcome will likely be determined by the outcome of this one .\nThroughout the litigation in the lower courts , the bans \u2019 opponents have sought to include President Trump \u2019 s words during and after the 2016 presidential campaign as evidence the ban is motivated by anti-Muslim animus and that this renders them illegal .\nThe travel ban case is the only one scheduled for arguments Wednesday .
