Get over it: Upwards of 15 prominent Republicans are privately contemplating 2016 campaigns for the presidency \u2014 and the most serious and ambitious of the bunch are already plunging in, some quite publicly.\n\nDon\u2019t expect them to officially announce or even officially decide for many months. But Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) are doing nothing to disguise their presidential ambitions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nJindal, the Rhodes scholar and new chairman of the Republican Governors Association, is making a very public case for a more intellectual approach to conservatism, accusing the GOP of being, in his words, \u201cthe stupid party.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Jindal: End \u2018dumbed-down conservatism\u2019)\n\nHe offered a similar premeditated critique to reporters at the RGA, on Fox and in an opinion piece.\n\nRubio and Ryan, both arguably better positioned than Jindal, are also competing for the mantle of the high-energy, forward-thinking conservative. POLITICO has learned both will unveil new policy plans at an awards dinner of the Jack Kemp Foundation in early December: Ryan will begin a new push on a more modern approach to alleviating poverty, focused on education; Rubio will lift the curtain on an economic empowerment message, heavy on college affordability and workforce training.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Rubio already in Iowa)\n\nThat upcoming duet is one of the clearest signs that this presidential race is beginning as early as any in history.\n\nNot to be outdone, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), son of Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) and heir to his father\u2019s libertarian following, is now on the record exploring a run that will focus heavily on returning power to the states. In a post-election interview with POLITICO, Paul said he wants to find common ground with liberal Democrats on softer marijuana laws and help create an eventual pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Welcome to the Rand Paul revolution)\n\nThese 40-something rising stars are hardly alone. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, despite party grumbling about his embrace of President Barack Obama during the recent hurricane, has made plain that he plans to make the case that he has cracked the code on winning on Democratic turf. Christie has the perfect chance to take the temperature of big donors as he raises money for his 2013 reelection race for governor.
