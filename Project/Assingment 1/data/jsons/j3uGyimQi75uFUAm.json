Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they \u2019 re published .\nA food relief program championed by President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka is relying on some contractors who lack food distribution experience and aren \u2019 t licensed to deal in fresh fruits and vegetables .\nThe contractors on Friday began delivering boxes containing fresh produce to food banks and other nonprofits . Forty-nine out of the 159 contractors picked by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to deliver boxes containing produce don \u2019 t have a requisite license from the same agency , according to a search of the USDA \u2019 s database using the information released about the contractors .\nSome of the contractors are established companies , and many food banks told \u2588\u2588\u2588 they \u2019 re successfully and gratefully receiving shipments . But other contractors have eclectic backgrounds with little track record in food distribution , such as a wedding planner , a caterer and a \u201c brand builder . \u201d\nAs a result , some food banks are left scrambling for shipments or even callbacks .\n\u201c We thought this would work very well , and we really needed the food due to rising unemployment and business closings , \u201d said Pamela Irvine , CEO of Feeding America Southwest Virginia , which serves the poorest and most rural counties in that state . The USDA , she said , \u201c had money and wanted to respond quickly , which they should have because you saw all this produce grounded and milk being dumped . However , they didn \u2019 t think about how that product should end up on a table somewhere and didn \u2019 t communicate and didn \u2019 t have a process in place for bidders to understand . \u201d\nThe awards to firms for which no licenses could be found amount to $ 105.3 million , about 15 % of the total for produce boxes . The USDA also hired contractors for boxes containing meat and dairy , at a total cost of $ 1.2 billion for six weeks , with the possibility of extending .\nThe licenses under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act , or PACA , are required for wholesalers , processors , truckers , food-service firms and anyone else who buys or sells more than 2,000 pounds of fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables a day , according to the USDA \u2019 s website .\n\u201c Much like you need a driver \u2019 s license to operate a vehicle , the law requires that you have a PACA license to operate a produce business , \u201d the agency \u2019 s website says . \u201c A PACA license is proof to your customers and suppliers that you are a serious business person who can be trusted to honor the terms of your contracts . \u201d\nThe licenses give vendors a way to resolve payment disputes , and many producers won \u2019 t sell to someone who isn \u2019 t licensed .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t do business with people without a PACA license , \u201d said Noah Murguia , the CEO of Murguia Fruit , an orange wholesaler in California . Murguia said he is selling oranges to licensed contractors in the program but doesn \u2019 t understand why anyone without a license would be allowed to participate . \u201c To me , it \u2019 s a big joke , \u201d he said .\nThe USDA \u2019 s official solicitation and application form don \u2019 t mention PACA licenses . An agency spokesman said contractors that don \u2019 t already have one will need to get one .\n\u201c All proposals were carefully reviewed by a team of contracting and technical experts and contracts made accordingly , \u201d the USDA said in a statement . Companies will have to submit documentation showing deliveries that meet the contract requirements in order to be paid , the agency said .\nTrump heralded the program in a tweet on May 9 , saying it was implemented at his personal direction .\nStarting early next week , at my order , the USA will be purchasing , from our Farmers , Ranchers & Specialty Crop Growers , 3 Billion Dollars worth of Dairy , Meat & Produce for Food Lines & Kitchens . \u201c FARMERS TO FAMILY FOOD BOX \u201d Great news for all ! @ SecretarySonny @ ZippyDuvall \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 9 , 2020\nIvanka Trump also claimed credit for the initiative , telling USA Today , \u201c I \u2019 m not shy about asking people to step up to the plate . The whole country needs to be galvanized in the effort , both to combat this deadly virus , but also to rebuild ... to rebuild our economy as we emerge . \u201d\nSpeaking at a kick-off event in Maryland last week , Ivanka Trump addressed the awards to small operators , saying , \u201c We want to encourage and support a robust ecosystem of distributors across the nation . \u201d\nThe USDA has a long-established program that buys and distributes food to schools , food banks and households , totaling 3.3 billion pounds and $ 3.5 billion in 2019 .

But none of those distributors received contracts .\nIrvine \u2019 s organization , in southwest Virginia , committed to taking 3.3 million pounds of produce , 2 million pounds of meat and 2.5 million pounds of dairy over six months . So far , her team has only secured 480,000 pounds of produce , 25,000 pounds of meat and no dairy after five days of cold-calling distributors who won contracts . Out of nine distributors contacted , three never responded and two didn \u2019 t know what the program was , Irvine said .\n\u201c This is just going to blow your mind , it makes no sense , \u201d Irvine said : The only distributor who would ship them produce is sending it cross-country from Washington state .\n\u201c We actually think he called us by mistake , \u201d Bob Frampton , Feeding America Southwest Virginia \u2019 s chief operations officer , said . \u201c But he \u2019 s been great to work with , and we took what we could get because we \u2019 re not crazy . \u201d\nRead More How Panic Buying Has Put an Incredible Strain on Food Banks Even As the Need for Them Explodes Here \u2019 s the dismal equation for food banks : Panic shopping and hoarding have led to supply shortages .

The USDA spokesman said the agency looked for contractors who would \u201c support local and regional farmers . \u201d\nThe contracts also moved much faster than normal . Companies had only a week to submit bids , and the USDA announced winners just a week later .\nRejected applicants received a form letter saying \u201c some of the most common factors \u201d for losing were missing signatures , according to a copy of the letter obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nOn a conference call a few days after the contracts were awarded , the USDA told winning bidders that they would need to apply for a PACA license if they didn \u2019 t already have one , according to Stephen Martin of Blueprint Foods ( identified on the USDA \u2019 s announcement as SMH2 Manufacturing , receiving $ 1 million ) . \u201c We never knew about a PACA license until they brought it up on a conference call , \u201d Martin , whose company typically delivers prepared foods to grocery stores , said in an interview . \u201c What they \u2019 re asking us to do is a fairly simple thing , like what we do anyway , except usually we cook things , so it \u2019 s actually easier . \u201d\nStill , there are challenges for companies like Martin \u2019 s that are working on their first government contract . \u201c We still have to go over how to invoice , \u201d Martin said . \u201c The notion that they built the plane in the air is accurate . \u201d\nSome \u201c upstanding companies \u201d that have experience with government contracts were denied \u201c on mistaken grounds , \u201d while winning bidders who don \u2019 t have their own warehouses , staff and distributions channels are now looking for subcontractors , according to Tom Stenzel , CEO of the United Fresh Produce Association . \u201c This is not \u2018 sour grapes \u2019 from those that may not have been awarded ; this is a genuine effort to ensure integrity and confidence in the program and that fresh produce actually gets to those in need in an efficient and cost-effective way , \u201d Stenzel said in a letter to USDA leaders .\nThree companies that received a total of $ 6 million in contracts are licensed but are involved in business disputes that were reported to the USDA , according to the agency \u2019 s public data . Doug Peterson , the CEO of Aggrigator , which received a contract for $ 2.6 million , said the company is trying to resolve its five disputes and the complaints never came up in the bidding process . Peterson said the company is producing 4,000 boxes a day and started deliveries on Saturday .\nA California avocado grower named Ben Holtz received a contract for $ 40 million , more than any other company without a PACA license .

If your Farm or Shed or Packing Operation wants orders , PM me . \u201d\nOne commenter asked Holtz if his company is in the Produce Blue Book , an industry-standard business directory that rates the creditworthiness of produce suppliers . Without that assurance , the commenter wanted to know if Holtz would be paying cash upfront .\nHoltz has since made a website and said he has more than 10,000 orders . In a phone interview , he said he \u2019 s already delivered more than 2,200 boxes and has thousands more on the way .\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t foreign to me , \u201d Holtz said in a phone interview . \u201c I have lots of experience running jobs , this is just a job . I \u2019 m a fourth-generation avocado grower , I can talk produce . I know how things get to where they need to be . I know how to run jobs with manpower and people with limits and constraints and financing .

We \u2019 re off to the races . \u201d\nHoltz was surprised to win a contract at the top of the range he applied for , for up to 1 million boxes . \u201c Getting up to seven digits was just kind of cool-looking , \u201d he said . \u201c I put it down and they said all right . \u201d\nHoltz doesn \u2019 t have a PACA license but said he has applied for one and asked the USDA to expedite it .
