    "content_original": "First Step Toward Replacing Obamacare\n\nHouse Republicans are taking the first step toward fulfilling one of President Trump's biggest campaign promises: Repealing and replacing Obamacare.\n\nBut as you've probably guessed, the plan faces big roadblocks on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\nIn his address to Congress last week, the president pushed lawmakers to take action to replace Obamacare.\n\nNow the House has unveiled a plan called the American Health Care Act.\n\nTwo of the House Republicans behind the plan, including Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, are touting the plan in The Wall Street Journal today.\n\nThey say it will \"rescue those hurt by Obamacare's failures and lay the groundwork for a patient-centered healthcare system.\"\n\n\"Our fiscally responsible plan will lower costs for patients and begin returning control from Washington back to the states... The bill will improve access to care and restore the free market, increasing innovation, competition and choice,\" Brady and Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, wrote.\n\nWhat Does the New Plan Eliminate?\n\nThe plan gets rid of some of the most unpopular parts of Obamacare, like trying to force people to buy healthcare insurance, even if they don't want to.\n\nThe measure also eliminates Obamacare's taxes.\n\nAnd it blocks taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood for a year.\n\nThe bill gets rid of Obamacare's government subsidies for health insurance, but it replaces them with federal tax credits, to help people buy insurance.\n\nWhat Does the New Plan Include?\n\nThe plan also expands contributions to health savings accounts. And it forbids tax credits for any plan that covers abortion.\n\nThe bill keeps a couple popular parts of Obamacare, such as letting young adults stay on their parents' plans until they're 26 and protecting people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nHow Will It All Shake Out?\n\nBut there are still some big questions about the plan, including:\n\nHow many people could lose insurance from Obamacare?\n\nAnd how much it will cost?\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office hasn't estimated the costs yet.\n\nMany Republicans have questions about parts of the plan.\n\nAnd Democrats will oppose it because they don't want to get rid of Obamacare, even though the law has been unpopular in the polls for several years, and even though former President Bill Clinton blasted it on the campaign trail last year.\n\nJust a Starting Point\n\nStill, the plan is likely to be a starting point for discussion on replacing Obamacare.\n\nAnd it may take a while. It took the Democrats over a year to pass President Obama's health care plan in 2009 and 2010.\n\nBut Republicans are clearly determined to push ahead so they can then move on to their next big goal for this year \u2014 reforming the tax code and cutting taxes for businesses and individuals.",
