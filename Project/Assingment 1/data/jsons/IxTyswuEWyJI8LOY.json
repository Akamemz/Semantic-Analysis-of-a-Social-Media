    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) It is hard to deny that Scott Walker has some serious momentum going for him as the 2016 Republican presidential primary fight starts to heat up -- with one year to go until the first in the nation Iowa caucuses .\nThe Wisconsin governor has surged to the head of the GOP pack in the Hawkeye State , according to a fresh Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll released over the weekend . Walker gets the support of 15 percent of likely Republican caucusgoers , edging out Rand Paul at 14 percent , Mitt Romney at 13 percent , Mike Huckabee at 10 percent , Ben Carson at nine percent and Jeb Bush at 8 percent , though all within the polls 4.9 percentage point margin of error .\nRomney announced Friday that he would not pursue a third bid for the presidency . With the 2012 GOP nominee out of the equation Walker still leads with 16 percent , followed by Paul at 15 percent and Huckabee at 13 percent .\nThe survey also showed Walker ranking third when Iowa Republicans were asked if a candidate is too conservative , too moderate or about right in terms of ideology . Fifty-six percent of respondents said Walker 's ideology was `` about right , '' with seven percent saying he was `` too conservative '' and just three percent calling him `` too moderate . ''\nWalker recently said he sees `` gaps '' in the GOP field and the Register 's findings suggest he could be primed to fill them .\nOn one side you have the establishment candidates favored by the business class of Republicans -- Bush and Christie . But social conservatives and tea party supporters remain wary of them . Among Iowa Republicans 46 percent say Christie is `` too moderate '' while 37 percent say the same about Bush .\nMore conservative Republicans would instead prefer a candidate more along the lines of Huckabee , Rick Santorum or Ted Cruz . But mainstream Republicans have doubts about their electability in a general election campaign . In the Register poll Huckabee and Santorum are seen as `` too conservative '' by 23 percent of Iowa Republicans , with 20 percent rating Cruz that way .\nWalker is betting he can shoot the gap by appealing to both wings of the GOP . It 's a formula that has worked for him in Wisconsin , says Charles Franklin , the director of the Marquette Law School poll .\n`` Walker is someone who has strong support in Wisconsin among Christian conservatives and social-issue conservatives , '' Franklin notes . `` And yet he also has strong support among the business community . ''\nThat view of Walker 's possible reach is shared by others . `` He has a strong reputation with the grassroots activists while still holding the credentials of somebody who has great potential as a national candidate , '' says Kevin Madden , who served as a senior adviser to Romney 's 2012 campaign .\nAs the two-term governor of a state that has n't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1984 , Walker has a marketable story to tell . He 's the son of a former Baptist preacher and an Eagle Scout who came into office in 2011 and pushed to eliminate collective bargaining rights for public employee workers .\nThat decision angered progressives , especially labor unions , spawning large protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison . But the move endeared Walker to Republicans in Wisconsin and across the country , who helped him become the first governor in U.S. history to survive a recall in 2012 .
