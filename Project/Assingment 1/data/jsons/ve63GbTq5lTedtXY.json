    "content": "The latest news from Chicago has a very angry Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attacking the Cook County State \u2019 s Attorney \u2019 s Office for abruptly dropping the 16-count indictment of actor Jussie Smollett . Recall that , in the words of the New York Times :\nMr. Smollett , who is black , gay and outspoken on social issues , had told the police that two men jumped him , while taunting him with homophobic and racial slurs and yelling \u201c This is MAGA country , \u201d a reference to President Trump \u2019 s \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d slogan . The assailants , according to Mr. Smollett , tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him . He was briefly treated at a hospital .\nThen , of a sudden , the Chicago police , after investigating , came to the conclusion Smollett \u2019 s tale was not only a lie but that it was a stunt . A stunt which Smollett had carefully planned himself and carried out with two Nigerian brothers who were captured on video purchasing the supplies used in the \u201c attack. \u201d The idea was to gain national attention for Smollett , who was said to be dissatisfied with his salary on his Empire TV series \u2014 and at the same time take a smack at President Trump , whom Smollett despises . Abruptly , Smollett went from heroic victim to perpetrator and found himself formally charged .\nNow , the judicial proceedings formally underway with indictments in hand , of a sudden the charges were all dropped . Astounding Mayor Emanuel and Police Superintendent Johnson .\nSaid the Mayor : \u201c This looks like he \u2019 s an actor , a person of influence , he got treated differently than everyone else . \u201d\nIn fact , the New York Times reported this in the same story linked above :\nUntil Tuesday , the prosecutor \u2019 s office had appeared to be taking a hard line with Mr. Smollett . A couple of weeks after his arrest , the office announced that a grand jury had indicted him on 16 separate counts of disorderly conduct related to the filing of a false police report . The move appeared to increase the pressure on Mr. Smollett , whose lawyers described it as \u201c prosecutorial overkill. \u201d But the state \u2019 s attorney \u2019 s office had already drawn scrutiny for its handling of the case . The Chicago Tribune reported that after police department sources began leaking their doubts about Mr. Smollett to local reporters , Tina Tchen , a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama , had emailed Kimberly Foxx , the top prosecutor , saying the actor \u2019 s family had \u201c concerns about the investigation. \u201d Ms. Foxx told Ms. Tchen , and separately a member of Mr. Smollett \u2019 s family , that she had asked the police superintendent to request that the F.B.I . take over the investigation . \u201c Omg this would be a huge victory , \u201d the relative replied in a text message , according to The Tribune . Once it became clear that Mr. Smollett was himself a suspect , Ms. Foxx recused herself from the case , but her actions had already embittered the police department , and the head of the police union accused her of interference .\nJussie Smollett logged a total of 18 hours of community service over 2 days \u2014 with Jesse Jackson \u2018 s organization , the Rainbow PUSH Coalition \u2014 and that was enough to satisfy prosecutors in Chicago .\nIn other words ? Insiders in Chicago \u2014 from Tina Tchen , the ex-chief of staff to former First Lady Michelle Obama , to Jesse Jackson \u2014 put the pressure on to have the charges dropped . And the all-too-responsive Cook County State \u2019 s Attorney , Kimberly Foxx \u2014 she of widely reported political ambitions who had previously recused herself from the case \u2014 suddenly jumped back into the case and had the charges dropped . It doesn \u2019 t get more \u201c insider corruption \u201d than that .\nMeanwhile , in Washington , the Trump-Russia collusion case imploded with the Mueller report . But not before revealing a cast of insiders who spent volumes of time trying to , first , prevent the election of Donald Trump to the White House . Then , second , when the attempt at preventing his election failed , a veritable parade of the same insiders began going about the business of plotting a silent coup to remove the new president . These insiders all have names and held major jobs . They include both an ex-Director of the FBI and CIA , plus over twenty officials in either the FBI and the Department of Justice . Most have now either been fired or resigned .\nWhat both the Smollett case and the \u201c get Trump \u201d silent coup attempt have surfaced is a bold case of the corruption of insiders in Chicago and Washington . Revealing an elitist mentality that has those with power and influence deliberately and willfully ignoring the law in an obsessive drive to satisfy their own personal political whims \u2014 freeing Jussie Smollett in Chicago or blocking Donald Trump from the White House and then plotting to remove him once duly elected . And in both cases the elite media aided and abetted in the pushing of the false Smollett narrative and , in Washington , the phony Trump-Russia collusion fairy tale .\nIt should not go unnoticed that in both cases there were ties to former President Obama . In Chicago , at the center of the corruption in the Smollett case was Michelle Obama \u2019 s insider ex-chief of staff . In Washington the plotters began their anti-Trump activities as players of various influence in the Obama administration . From Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch to the Obama appointed FBI Director Comey and CIA Director Brennan and on down through the ranks , each and every one were tied to the Obama administration .\nWhatever else this says it is crystal clear that in both the Smollett and Trump-Russia collusion cases insiders were seeking to achieve their objectives outside the law \u2014 the law they took an oath to uphold .
