Rubio and Paul and Jindal et al. won\u2019t have to squirm over whether to endorse SSM, back a federalist approach to the issue, or oppose it on the merits. They can just shrug and say \u201cThe Court was wrong but whaddaya gonna do?\u201d and move on to other business. Take it from Huckabee: That won\u2019t happen. Abortion\u2019s technically been \u201coff the table\u201d for 40 years and yet it\u2019s still an absolute litmus test for any potential GOP nominee (and any potential Democratic nominee too). To keep social conservatives onboard, candidates will be asked to promise (a) that they\u2019ll appoint Supreme Court justices who are committed to overturning any gay-marriage rulings and (b) that they\u2019ll endorse some sort of constitutional amendment that would either ban SSM outright or, at a minimum, return the issue to the states. (The amendment will go nowhere but that\u2019s beside the point here.) Think a prospective nominee won\u2019t do some squirming over whether they should sign on to those propositions, especially given the GOP\u2019s panic over losing young voters? Come 2016, this won\u2019t be just about gay marriage anymore; it\u2019ll be a test of whether social conservatives retain the same influence over the party platform that they\u2019ve had for the last few decades. That\u2019s why Huck\u2019s framing this in apocalyptic \u201cstick with us or we walk\u201d terms. It\u2019s their party, at least on social issues.\n\nWith respect to what\u2019s best for other GOP pols, the simple explanation is the correct one: They\u2019re better off if the Court surprises everyone and upholds Prop 8. Then the 2016 field can take the position that they\u2019re personally opposed to SSM in order to placate social cons while insisting that, as good federalists, they want local voters to decide this issue for themselves. That sort of squishy middle-way stance won\u2019t dazzle anyone on either side but it might hold the Republican coalition together by reassuring Huck and his supporters that red states will still get to chart their own course. It might also be acceptable to young voters in the sense that the potential GOP nominee won\u2019t be standing in the way of gay marriage in states when the votes are there. But note: The squishy position won\u2019t work if the Court does end up legalizing gay marriage this summer. In that case, taking the federalist position via a constitutional amendment will be seen as an attempt to roll back marriage rights that gays have already won. Young voters likely will find that alienating, and social cons may reason that an amendment to return power to the states on the subject simply doesn\u2019t go far enough as a rebuke to a judiciary that\u2019s out of control. What politicians cherish is room to maneuver, and a pro-SSM ruling leaves the GOP with less of that than an anti-SSM ruling would.\n\nAnyway. Across the aisle, Mark Begich magically decided last night that he too is now pro-gay marriage, which makes three Democratic senators who have \u201cevolved\u201d in just the past 24 hours. I\u2019m starting a pool as of right now: At what time today will the next Democratic holdout formally declare his support for SSM? I\u2019ll take 2 p.m. ET.\n\nUpdate: Interesting choice of words from Reince Priebus:",
