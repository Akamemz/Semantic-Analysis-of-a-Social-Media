Candidate Obama banned the phrase to signal to progressives his visceral condemnation of the tactics George W. Bush had used in the \u201cwar\u201d paradigm to justify. He rejected the use of enhanced interrogation, labeled \u201ctorture\u201d the indefinite detention of \u201cenemy combatants,\u201d and proscribed trial by military tribunals.
