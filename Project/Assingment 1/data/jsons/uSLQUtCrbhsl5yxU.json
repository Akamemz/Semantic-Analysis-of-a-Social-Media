Like Senator Kyrsten Sinema , Reps. Peter Welch , Elise Stefanik , and Will Hurd , Gardner has a different kind of personality than what is typically rewarded in the modern political environment .\nHis uniqueness allowed him to successfully unseat a purple state Democratic incumbent to become Colorado \u2019 s junior senator in 2014 . It also makes him the real target of impeachment .\nThe impeachment of President Donald Trump is not about Trump 's removal from office . Of the more than one dozen Republican senators whose conviction votes would be necessary to remove the president from office , no one can identify more than 3 Republican senators who might even conceivably vote to do so . And there are Democratic senators , like Doug Jones from Alabama and Joe Manchin from West Virginia , who are just as likely to vote for an acquittal , as any Republican senators are to vote to convict .\nEven the practicality of the math could not sway the likes of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , who lectured us that impeachment was his `` responsibility . '' Public hearings did not change public opinion . Changing prosecutorial theories did not change public opinion . A gale-force media tailwind pushing impeachment has not changed public opinion . But Schiff knows what is best for you -- even if you do not -- so he must press on .\nSo why would otherwise savvy politicians like Speaker Nancy Pelosi continue to push a case for which there is zero likelihood of a conviction ?\nThis impeachment exercise is most assuredly about removing someone from office . It 's just not about removing Trump from office .\nWhy would these same politicians rush to advance impeachment articles , pass those articles with no Republican votes , declare President Trump an existential threat to the Republic , and then place those articles in legislative purgatory and refuse to transmit those articles for trial ?\nThe impeachment inquiry , investigation , votes , and ultimate refusal to transmit articles are not about removing Trump from office . Rather , it is a tacit acknowledgment he will be re-elected in November of 2020 . The plan now is to use impeachment to neuter that second term with a Democrat-controlled Senate .\nThis impeachment exercise is most assuredly about removing someone from office . It 's just not about removing Trump from office . It 's about removing Cory Gardner , Martha McSally , Thom Tillis , Susan Collins and Joni Ernst from their senate offices .\nA Democratic Senate would make the assemblage of a Cabinet next to impossible , end the filling of judicial vacancies , paralyze the country should there be a U.S. Supreme Court opening and ensure that both the House and Senate spend their time investigating the executive branch .\nIf you think the country made little to no legislative progress with a Democrat-controlled House and a Republican president , just wait until there is a Democrat-controlled House and Senate and a Republican president .\nThere are currently 53 Republican Senators with 45 Democrats and 2 independents .
