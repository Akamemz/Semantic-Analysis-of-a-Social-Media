    "content": "Tham Luang caves , Thailand ( CNN ) The second day of rescue operations at the cave site in northern Thailand ended after four more boys were brought out of the flooded cave system on Monday .\nEight boys have now been freed , while four remain inside the flooded Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex with their coach . On Monday , they endured their 17th night trapped on a ledge 4 kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) inside the cave system .\nTheir rescued teammates are being treated in quarantine at Chiang Rai Prachanukroh Hospital . Former Chiang Rai governor and rescue mission commander Narongsak Osotthanakorn said doctors were monitoring the rescued boys for any illnesses they may have picked up in the cave and supervising efforts to build up their strength after they spent more than two weeks with little food and no natural light .\nThai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha visited the hospital Monday evening after speaking with the families , who are all still gathered near the cave entrance .\nOsotthanakorn said those rescued Monday were in better condition than those freed the previous day , adding that all the boys rescued are well . Osotthanakorn 's statement could indicate the rescuers opted to send the weaker ones out first , a reversal of the previously announced strategy .\nThe rescue workers are using compressed air tanks and oxygen tanks . They are now resting and need at least 20 hours to prepare for the third operation , Osotthanakorn said , but timings could change depending on weather and water levels . Monday 's rescue was carried out four to five hours ahead of schedule due to favorable conditions , he said .\nOfficials said late Sunday that the operation had been paused to allow oxygen tanks depleted during the first phase to be refilled . It is unclear whether that was also a determining factor in suspending operations Monday .\nA stretcher carrying what is believed to be the fifth boy rescued from the cave is taken to an ambulance parked near the Tham Luang Nang Non cave .\nThe 12 boys , aged between 11 and 16 and all members of the youth soccer team known as the Wild Boars , entered the caves with their coach on June 23 and became trapped inside after heavy rains flooded the entrance .\nThey were found by two British divers last Monday , sparking a week of fevered activity around the cave system as teams of local and international experts devised a series of rescue plans .\nShortly after the eighth boy arrived at the hospital on Monday , the Thai Navy SEALs , who are leading the rescue operation , posted a celebratory message on their Facebook page , listing the `` boars '' that had been freed and ending with the morale-boosting `` hooyah . ''\nThe post echoed the buoyant mood among the volunteers at the support center near the cave system Monday , with people sensing that the rescue mission was nearing the finish line . Jokes were shared and smiles covered the faces of many of those who have made the site their home over the last two weeks .\nOnlookers cheer as a helicopter flies toward an airstrip near the cave to transport the fifth boy rescued to hospital .\nThat marked a huge shift since Friday , when a diver died while navigating the dangerous , water-filled passageways inside the caves , raising fears that the rescue could still end in tragedy for the trapped boys and their coach .\nBut the successful rescue of eight of the boys has brought hope to this community .\nOn Monday night , members of the under-17s Wild Boars soccer team met and played football for the first time since their younger teammates disappeared . Consumed by worry for the boys and their coach , the club had previously suspended all matches and training sessions , the coaches said .\nBut now the club 's head coach , Nopparat Kanthawong , said he felt it was important to bring the team together in a show of unity with the rescuers .\nThe mood there was optimistic , with the players and coaching staff confident that the junior team would soon be home .\nNopparat Kanthawong , head coach of the Wild Boars , left , and Pannawit Jongkham , coach for the senior team , are feeling optimistic about the rescue .\nThe rescue mission has been a huge operation , led by the Royal Thai Navy 's SEAL unit , and supported by a cast of hundreds .\nAmong those are US military partners , British cave diving experts -- including the two men who first located the boys a week ago -- and rescue workers from Australia , China and other countries .\nThe first boy to emerge Monday was seen on a stretcher just before 4:30 p.m. local time ( 5:30 a.m .
