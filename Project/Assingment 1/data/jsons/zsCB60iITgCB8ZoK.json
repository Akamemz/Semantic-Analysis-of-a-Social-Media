    "content": "On Feb. 17 , 2009 , President Obama promised the sun and the moon and the stars . That was the day , five years ago , when he signed the $ 800 billion `` American Recovery and Reinvestment Act . '' President Modesty called it `` the most sweeping economic recovery package in our history . '' He promised `` unprecedented transparency and accountability . '' He claimed the spending would lift `` two million Americans from poverty . '' Ready for the reality smackdown ?\nThe actual cost of the $ 800 billion pork-laden stimulus has ballooned to nearly $ 2 trillion . At the time of the law 's signing , the unemployment rate hovered near 8 percent . Obama 's egghead economists projected that the jobless rate would never rise above 8 percent and would plunge to 5 percent by December 2013 . The actual jobless rate in January was 6.6 percent , with an abysmal labor force participation rate of 63 percent ( a teeny uptick from December , but still at a four-decade low ) .\nFive years after the Recovery Act , 10.2 million people are out of work . The number of able-bodied Americans who have simply given up looking for work or are `` not in the labor force ( but ) who currently want a job '' has exploded . By some estimates , a record 90 million-plus people are hopelessly sitting on the sidelines .\nThe unemployment rate for black Americans is 12.1 percent : nearly double the national rate . The Obama campaign excoriated President George W. Bush when it exceeded 10 percent under his watch . The black teen jobless rate is now a whopping record 38 percent . Some 50 million Americans remain below the poverty level . And 47 million are now on food stamps , a third more than when Obama first took office in the halcyon days of Hope and Change .\nAfter $ 150 billion in stimulus and other spending on green energy boondoggles , what does the White House have to show for it ? According to The Green Corruption Files blog , 32 Obama-backed environmental firms have gone bankrupt as of February 2014 . These include crony-clogged Solyndra at a cost to taxpayers of $ 535 million ; Beacon Power , $ 240 million ; Abound Solar , $ 400 million-plus ; Fisker Auto , $ 529 million ; A123 , $ 250 million ; ECOtality , $ 100 million ; and Ener1 , $ 118.5 million . In addition , 22 other Obama green energy projects are now in dire financial trouble .\nUnprecedented transparency ? Section 1513 of the Recovery Act required the White House to submit a progress report every three months .

Somehow , stimulus `` Sheriff '' Biden overlooked the hundreds of millions in stimulus money steered to General Services Administrations junkets in Las Vegas and Hawaii , ghost congressional districts , dead people , and those ubiquitous stimulus propaganda road signs stamped with the shovel-ready logo .\nIn 2012 , Ohio State University economics professor Bill Dupor reported that more than three-quarters of the jobs created or saved by the stimulus were government jobs . Dupor and another colleague also concluded that the massive wealth redistribution scheme `` destroyed/forestalled roughly one million private sector jobs '' by siphoning tax dollars `` to offset state revenue shortfalls and Medicaid increases rather than boost private sector employment .
