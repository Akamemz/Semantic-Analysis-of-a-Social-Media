Today , they do it with luxury beliefs .\nPeople care a lot about social status . In fact , research indicates that respect and admiration from our peers are even more important than money for our sense of well-being .\nWe feel pressure to display our status in new ways . This is why fashionable clothing always changes . But as trendy clothes and other products become more accessible and affordable , there is increasingly less status attached to luxury goods .\nThe upper classes have found a clever solution to this problem : luxury beliefs . These are ideas and opinions that confer status on the rich at very little cost , while taking a toll on the lower class .\nOne example of luxury belief is that all family structures are equal . This is not true . Evidence is clear that families with two married parents are the most beneficial for young children . And yet , affluent , educated people raised by two married parents are more likely than others to believe monogamy is outdated , marriage is a sham or that all families are the same .\n\u2018 Upper-class people don a luxury belief to separate themselves from the lower class \u2019\nRelaxed attitudes about marriage trickle down to the working class and the poor .

But during this time , affluent Americans loosened social norms , expressing skepticism about marriage and monogamy .\nThis luxury belief contributed to the erosion of the family . Today , the marriage rates of affluent Americans are nearly the same as they were in the 1960s . But working-class people are far less likely to get married . Furthermore , out-of-wedlock birthrates are more than 10 times higher than they were in 1960 , mostly among the poor and working class .
