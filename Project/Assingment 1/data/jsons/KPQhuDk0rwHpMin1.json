    "content": "For the past month , the centrist Democrats running against Sen. Bernie Sanders have begged Democratic voters not to nominate him . Former Vice President Joe Biden , former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and Sen. Amy Klobuchar have argued that putting a socialist atop the ticket would help President Donald Trump and hurt Democratic candidates down the ballot . These warnings are well-founded , but they haven \u2019 t worked . Sanders has won the popular vote in Iowa , New Hampshire , and Nevada .\nWhy , despite the warnings , is Sanders still winning ? One reason is that a lot of people like him and what he stands for . Another reason is that other candidates are splitting the votes of moderate Democrats , leaving him with a plurality on the left . But there \u2019 s a third reason : Socialism doesn \u2019 t freak out Democratic voters the way it freaks out other Americans . On this subject , Democrats are very different not just from Republicans , but also from independents , who represent about 40 percent of Americans and about 30 percent of the electorate . Socialism is a loser among independents , and this makes it a liability in a general election . But Democrats don \u2019 t feel an aversion to socialism . So perhaps they don \u2019 t see the extent of the political danger .\nThe detachment starts with Sanders voters . In a September poll taken by Data for Progress , 37 percent of them identified themselves not as progressives or liberals , but as socialists , democratic socialists , or communists . Nearly all of them endorsed democratic socialism . In a January NBC/Wall Street Journal poll , most Sanders voters endorsed socialism even without the word \u201c democratic \u201d in front of it . Only 4 percent of them opposed it . These people aren \u2019 t likely to buy the argument that nominating a socialist is an unnecessary risk . For them , electing a socialist is the ballgame .\nBut the problem goes beyond Sanders supporters . Rank-and-file Democrats , as a whole , are significantly more pro-socialist than independents are . And while Republicans , conversely , are more anti-socialist than independents are , the gap between Democrats and independents , on average , is about 10 points bigger than the gap between Republicans and independents .\nOver the past year , numerous national polls have asked Americans whether they view socialism positively or negatively . In every poll , Democrats lean in favor of socialism , and independents don \u2019 t . In every poll , the opinions of voters or of Americans in the aggregate\u2014Democrats , independents , and Republicans combined\u2014add up to a net rejection of socialism .\nWhen pollsters raise specific objections to socialism , independents tend to agree with those objections . Democrats don \u2019 t . In a Monmouth poll taken last spring , most Democrats said socialism wouldn \u2019 t take away too many individual rights . But most independents ( and therefore most voters , when the answers of Democrats , independents , and Republicans were combined ) said it would . A plurality of Democrats , 50 percent to 32 percent , said socialism was compatible with American values . But most independents and voters as a whole said it wasn \u2019 t .\nIt won \u2019 t surprise you to hear that Democrats are far more willing than independents to support a socialist candidate . But you might be surprised by how much bigger the partisan gap is for a socialist than for other kinds of candidates . In a Gallup poll taken last month , Democrats didn \u2019 t differ much from independents in their stated willingness to vote for a black , female , gay , or atheist presidential nominee . For a Muslim nominee , the gap was more then 30 net percentage points . For a socialist , it was more than 60 points . Three-quarters of Democrats were willing to vote for a socialist . Most independents\u2014and , consequently , most of the Gallup respondents\u2014weren \u2019 t .\nWhy are Americans more likely to refuse ( or , at least , to tell pollsters that they refuse ) to vote for a socialist than for a woman or a Muslim ? Probably because socialism isn \u2019 t an innate characteristic or a matter of personal faith . It \u2019 s a doctrine about how government should intervene in the lives of other people . That makes it a legitimate reason to vote against a candidate and therefore\u2014unlike race , sex , or religion\u2014a legitimate factor when you \u2019 re considering whether to nominate a candidate other voters won \u2019 t support .\nThis chasm endangers Sanders in a general election against Trump . In an ABC/Washington Post poll taken last summer , Biden led Trump in a hypothetical matchup by 10 points . Other potential Democratic nominees tied Trump or barely led him . Sanders held a one-point lead among independents and among voters as a whole . But when respondents were asked to choose between Trump and \u201c a Democratic candidate who you regard as a socialist , \u201d the numbers shifted . Democrats , by a margin of 82 percent to 8 percent , said they \u2019 d support the socialist . Independents , given the same choice , went for Trump , 50 percent to 42 percent . With their support , Trump beat the hypothetical socialist , 49 percent to 43 percent .\nYou could argue , based on this survey , that people who say they \u2019 d never vote for a socialist would , in fact , vote for Sanders anyway . He polls fairly well against Trump , and he claims that if Trump attacks him as a socialist , voters will ignore the attacks , because Trump \u201c lies all the time. \u201d But Sanders isn \u2019 t an accused socialist . He \u2019 s a self-identified socialist . A follow-up survey , taken a week ago by ABC and the Post , shows that this label would hurt him . The pollsters told half their sample that \u201c Sanders identifies himself as a socialist , \u201d and they asked whether \u201c his being a socialist \u201d made respondents more or less likely to support him against Trump . For Democrats , that information was a wash or a net plus . But for independents , it was a loser . Six percent of independents said it made them more likely to support Sanders . Thirty-seven percent said it made them less likely . *\nSanders stipulates that he \u2019 s a \u201c democratic \u201d socialist . That distinction helps him , but mostly among Democrats . In a Yahoo News/YouGov poll taken two weeks ago , Democrats agreed that democratic socialism was different from socialism . But a plurality of independents saw no difference . ( Voters as a whole were evenly divided . ) Only 45 percent of Democrats conceded that Sanders was a socialist ; 30 percent said he wasn \u2019 t . But more than 60 percent of independents and voters as a whole said Sanders was a socialist . Fewer than 20 percent said he wasn \u2019 t .\nRunning as a democratic socialist isn \u2019 t as lethal as running as a socialist . But it \u2019 s still pretty bad . In an Emerson poll taken last summer , a plurality of independents ( 42 percent to 26 percent ) said they wouldn \u2019 t vote for a self-described democratic socialist . In a November HarrisX poll , 64 percent of independents said they \u2019 d never vote for a democratic socialist . In this month \u2019 s Yahoo News poll , a 47 percent plurality of independents said they wouldn \u2019 t consider voting for a presidential candidate who called himself a democratic socialist . And in the new Post/ABC poll , 33 percent of independents said they were less likely to support Sanders after hearing that he \u201c identifies himself as a democratic socialist. \u201d *\nSome advocates of a Sanders nomination believe that independents aren \u2019 t really in play . They argue that independents lean toward one party or the other and will vote that way , so it \u2019 s more important to turn out the Democratic base than to fuss over voters in the middle . That belief is mistaken . In 2016 , independents voted for Trump against Hillary Clinton , 46 percent to 42 percent . In 2018 , independents voted for Democratic House candidates against Republican House candidates , 54 percent to 42 percent . In both cases , independents made the difference .\nMost Americans don \u2019 t like the idea of moving toward socialism , regardless of how you qualify it . In a Suffolk poll taken last spring , a slight plurality of Democrats said they \u2019 d be \u201c satisfied with a presidential candidate who thinks the United States should be more socialist. \u201d But steep majorities of independents ( 72 percent to 18 percent ) and voters in the aggregate ( 67 percent to 22 percent ) said they wouldn \u2019 t . Most Republicans wouldn \u2019 t vote for the Democratic nominee regardless . But these grim numbers go much further .\nDemocrats , perhaps because they differ from the rest of the electorate in their feelings about socialism , are bad at estimating how socialism would play in a general election . Two weeks ago , in the Yahoo News poll , a 49 percent plurality of Democrats said most , nearly all , or about half of Americans would consider voting for a presidential candidate who called himself a democratic socialist . The guess was incorrect . According to the same poll , only 35 percent of voters said they \u2019 d consider voting for such a candidate . Democrats got it wrong .\nYes , Sanders could try to duck the word socialism and just talk about health care and education . But even if he focuses on specific proposals\u2014leaving labels aside\u2014he \u2019 ll still face a big divide between Democrats and independents . In the Yahoo News poll , only 39 percent of Democrats opposed \u201c eliminating private health insurance. \u201d Fifty-seven percent of independents opposed that idea .
