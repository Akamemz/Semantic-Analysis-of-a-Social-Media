    "content": "( CNN ) Hours after being repeatedly insulted by President Donald Trump , Attorney General Jeff Sessions just did something he rarely , if ever , does : He punched back -- hard .\n`` I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in , which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President 's agenda -- one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people , reduces violent crime , enforces our immigration laws , promotes economic growth , and advances religious liberty .\nWhile I am Attorney General , the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations . I demand the highest standards , and where they are not met , I take action . However , no nation has a more talented , more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States .\nI am proud to serve with them and proud of the work we have done in successfully advancing the rule of law . ''\nThe first line come as a direct rebuttal to Trump putting Sessions on blast with this line in his interview with `` Fox and Friends '' host Ainsley Earhardt : `` I put in an attorney general that never took control of the Justice Department . Jeff Sessions never took control of the Justice Department and it 's a sort of an incredible thing . ''\nThat was far from the only time Trump ran down Sessions in the Fox interview . He told Earhardt that `` even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you would n't have put him in . '' Trump added that the only reason he gave Sessions a job in his administration was because he was loyal . And , in perhaps the most cutting and personal attack , Trump said this of Sessions : `` He took the job and then he said , ' I 'm going to recuse myself . ' I said , 'What kind of a man is this ? ' ''\n`` What kind of man is this '' -- a shot at both Sessions ' masculinity and his ethics .\nWhat 's remarkable here is not that Trump attacked Sessions publicly . After all , Trump has called Sessions `` weak '' and `` beleaguered '' and told multiple news outlets that he would have never hired Sessions if he had known the attorney general was going to recuse himself in the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election .\nNo , the truly unique thing here is that Sessions decided to actually speak up in his own defense . The only other time -- that I can find -- that Sessions directly responded to a Trump attack was back at the end of February , when the President tweeted this\n`` Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse . Will take forever , has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc . Is n't the I.G . an Obama guy ? Why not use Justice Department lawyers ? DISGRACEFUL ! ''\nSessions shot back that he had `` initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against this department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary , '' adding : `` As long as I am the attorney general , I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor , and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution .

If Sessions had n't recused himself , in Trump 's mind , none of that happens .
