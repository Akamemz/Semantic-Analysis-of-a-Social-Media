    "content": "Over the past week , differences between Israel and the United States have boiled over into a scalding diplomatic confrontation between these closest of allies . The dispute reflects not any change in American policy , but a dangerous evolution in Israeli policy , under the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , away from an acceptance of a negotiated two-state resolution to Israel \u2019 s conflict with the Palestinians . The dispute also arises from Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s lamentable practice of making his government a more nakedly partisan player in American politics than any foreign government in memory , save Russia .\nIt is hard to see how either move by this Israeli government serves Israel \u2019 s long-term interest .\nThe spark for this confrontation was a United Nations Security Council resolution , adopted on Friday , that condemned Israeli settlement-building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem . The Obama administration chose to abstain from the vote rather than exercise its veto to block it . The United Nations is shamefully biased against Israel , and President Obama has used the American veto and its diplomatic muscle more assiduously than any previous American president to shield Israel from unwarranted criticism . But nowhere is it written that an American president is obliged to shelter Israel from international criticism that is consistent with decades-old American policy and with American interests .\nThe American abstention has triggered more than the usual amount of outrage , name-calling and threats from Mr. Netanyahu and his allies . Personalizing the dispute to an astonishing degree , they have accused Mr. Obama of betraying Israel .\nThey \u2019 re wrong . Many of Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s accusations and those of his supporters misrepresent the history of Israeli-American relations , malign Mr. Obama and his secretary of state , John Kerry , and confuse what should be a serious debate over the future of a negotiated peace between Israelis and Palestinians , which seems further away every day . With less than three weeks before Mr. Obama leaves office , Mr. Kerry on Wednesday finally gave the speech he wanted to give two years ago \u2014 a passionate , blunt and detailed warning about why the two-state solution is in jeopardy and how it might yet be salvaged before incalculable damage is done to Israel and the region .",
