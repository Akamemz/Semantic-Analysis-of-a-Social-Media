Tracking them is notoriously difficult :\nWhile a patchwork of data means we do n't have a complete picture of the problem , the SPLC and the ADL say available numbers show disturbing trends . In its most recent hate crimes report , the FBI tracked a total of 5,818 hate crimes in 2015 , a rise of about 6.5 % from the previous year , and showed that attacks against Muslims surged . The SPLC documented an uptick of hate and bias incidents after the presidential election , tracking 1,094 in the first month alone . The organization also says the number of hate groups in the U.S. increased for a second year in a row in 2016 .
