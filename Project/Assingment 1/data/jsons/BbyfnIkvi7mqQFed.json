    "content": "Military reformers in the nation \u2019 s capital may have found a soul mate in a billionaire real estate magnate who takes a keen interest in what things cost , including big weapons systems .\nThe reformers \u2014 an alliance of watchdog activists , technocrats and former government auditors \u2014 have long bemoaned the delays and cost overruns that plague the Pentagon \u2019 s procurement of ships , guns and planes .\nNow , President-elect Donald Trump seems to have joined them . He has taken to Twitter to blast the titans of defense contracting for what he sees as overpriced weapons , suggesting a procurement overhaul may be a top priority to Defense Secretary-nominee James N. Mattis .\n\u201c To say the least , we are a bit stunned , albeit pleasantly so , \u201d said Thomas P. Christie , the Pentagon \u2019 s former top weapons tester who has long advocated lower-cost alternatives .\nMr. Trump met Dec. 21 at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach , Florida , with senior officers who will oversee the procurement side of a $ 619 billion defense budget this year .\nBefore the Florida summit , Mr. Trump tweeted a cancellation warning to Boeing Co. about the long-term costs of two new Air Force One planes . Then he took on the costliest weapon system in U.S. history : the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II . The procurement history of the joint strike fighter jet is so pocked with trouble that Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain , Arizona Republican , has called it a \u201c scandal and tragedy . \u201d\nLockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing rank No . 1 and No . 2 , respectively , as the Defense Department \u2019 s largest contractors based on revenue , according to Defense News .\nIf there is a networking headquarters for the military reform movement , it would be the Project On Government Oversight in Washington . For years , POGO has exposed defense industry malpractice while promoting what it sees as less-costly weapons options .\nDan Grazier , a former Marine captain who joined POGO in 2015 as a budget and weapons analyst , said he is \u201c cautiously optimistic \u201d about Mr. Trump \u2019 s tilt toward Pentagon reforms .\n\u201c It \u2019 s refreshing to hear someone taking on the military-industrial-congressional complex this way , because this is something we haven \u2019 t seen for many , many , many years , \u201d Mr. Grazier said . \u201c The fact that he \u2019 s able to at least get Boeing and Lockheed working to reduce cost , it \u2019 s a good shot across the bow . But there \u2019 s a big difference between words and action . He \u2019 s talking a really good game now . Now let \u2019 s see if he can actually translate it into action . \u201d\nWinslow Wheeler , a longtime reformer government auditor and Senate aide , said it \u2019 s impossible to predict what actions Mr. Trump will take but that the right path is a \u201c drain the swamp \u201d option of canceling the F-35 and building separate replacements for the A-10 close-air support jet used effectively against the Islamic State group , as well as follow-ons for the Navy F-18 Hornet and the Air Force F-16 .\nA big complaint from reformers is that the F-35 was doomed to cost explosions from the start because Les Aspin , defense secretary at the time , decided to make it a \u201c joint \u201d fighter \u2014 a single aircraft to serve the various and specific needs of the Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps .\nReformers say Lockheed \u2019 s F-16 Falcon is perhaps the most successful fighter program in history because the Pentagon forced the Air Force to design and build it only to its specifications . To a certain extent , the same holds true for the Navy and its carrier-based F-18 .\nThe defense industry and its many supporters on Capitol Hill generally got what they wanted during a decade and a half in the war on Islamic terrorism . With weapons systems wearing out , even programs such as the $ 379 billion F-35 , with its myriad problems , won the budget battle every year .\nBut their serenity was shattered by a White House-congressional budget deal known as \u201c sequestration , \u201d or mandatory spending cuts .\n\u201c The F-35 program and cost is out of control , \u201d he tweeted on Dec. 12 . \u201c Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military ( and other ) purchases after January 20th . \u201d\nTen days later , the president-elect met with Boeing \u2019 s CEO and announced via Twitter that he asked the company to price its F-18 Super Hornet as a possible competitor to the F-35 .\nOn paper , the F-35 \u2019 s stealth , a 360-degree-vision helmet , and advanced software make the single-engine jet more capable than the twin-engine Hornet . But some Navy leaders said their service branch was left out of the expensive F-35 development in favor of continuing buys of the F-18 Super Hornet . The motive : The savings could be used to build more ships .\nBoeing has not escaped Mr. Trump \u2019 s wrath . He flatly threatened to cancel plans to build two Air Force One craft slated for completion in 2022 . \u201c Costs are out of control , more than $ 4 billion . Cancel order ! \u201d he tweeted .\nThe Government Accountability Office estimates the development and procurement costs at $ 3 billion for what are essentially flying White Houses . The 747s will come with grand living quarters , advanced communications , defensive systems and avionics technology .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s $ 4 billion figure may include what are called \u201c life cycle costs \u201d from the program \u2019 s beginning through its service life , with repairs , new parts and maintenance .\nThe GAO and Pentagon testers have documented the F-35 \u2019 s cost overruns , production delays and performance shortfalls for nearly a decade .\nPlanners for the Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps were wildly off base when predicting its price and schedule . The $ 379 billion total acquisition cost is double their initial estimates . The military was supposed to be flying more than 1,000 F-35s by now but has received fewer than 200 .\nIn April , GAO examiners concluded that the F-35 may not be affordable because budget restraints limit yearly production , driving up per-plane costs . Soon , the Pentagon will need to spend more than $ 12 billion a year on procurement until 2038 to purchase 2,457 planes .\n\u201c It is unlikely the program will be able to sustain such a high level of annual funding and if required funding levels are not reached , the program \u2019 s procurement plan may not be affordable , \u201d the GAO said .\nMr. McCain subsequently summoned the F-35 brain trust to a Senate hearing .\n\u201c Aircraft deliveries amount to no more than a mere trickle relative to the original promises of the program , \u201d said Mr. McCain , who served as a Navy fighter pilot in Vietnam . \u201c Because the Air Force , Marines and Navy were all counting on the F-35s that never appeared , combat aircraft and strike fighter capacity shortfalls in all three services have reached critical levels , severely impacting readiness . \u201d\nThe few F-35s that have reached the services were operationally flawed . Mr. McCain had a list : \u201c They have problems with maintenance diagnostic software , radar instabilities , sensor fusion shortfalls , fuel system problems , structural cracks from service life testing , engine reliability deficits , limitations on the crew escape system that cause pilot weight restrictions , and potential cyber vulnerabilities . This list is as troubling as it is long . \u201d\nMr. Grazier said the F-35 is an example of \u201c political engineering , \u201d creating such broad grass-roots support that lawmakers do not dare vote against it .\n\u201c Contracts for the F-35 have been spread across the 45 states , \u201d he said . \u201c We estimate around 350 different congressional districts all over the country . So that is a lot of political support on Capitol Hill . Overcoming that is going to be a very difficult endeavor . \u201d\nMr. Grazier would like the Trump administration to stop buying F-35s at least until initial tests and evaluations are completed to rule out even more defects . Lockheed built the F-35 concurrently , meaning the plane \u2019 s development overlapped its production .\nThe reality is the F-35 program , begun 20 years ago , is so big and the fighter jets are so needed in the field that outright cancellation is unlikely . Eight NATO countries are partners with Lockheed . The Air Force and Marine Corps have declared initial operational capability for their deliveries .\nBut contracts with Lockheed Martin are negotiated at certain production stages , meaning Mr. Trump \u2019 s \u201c Art of the Deal \u201d approach may come into play to lower the price .\n\u201c It \u2019 s great that Donald Trump is having all the other execs in the defense industry sort of hopping to his tune , but the reality is Congress gets a vote on this , \u201d Mr. Grazier said .\nHow true . For all the complaints , Congress increased the buy from 63 F-35s requested by President Obama to 74 in this year \u2019 s budget .\nReformers wonder who among Mr. Trump \u2019 s advisers is steering his focus to costly weapons . One Trump supporter said people should remember that Mr. Trump has spent his business career negotiating prices , including for his own airplanes .\n\u201c Who is whispering in his ear ? \u201d said Mr. Christie , who was in charge of weapons testing in President George W. Bush \u2019 s first term . \u201c Surely , he hasn \u2019 t come down this hard strictly on his own . However he has come to issuing these tweets , he has certainly picked deserving fiascoes , especially the F-35 . It will be interesting to see if his administration goes after these \u2018 out of control \u2019 programs after Jan. 20 . We are hopeful Mattis will be more than happy to follow through to crack down and , hopefully , roll back both the F-35 and Air Force One , as well as turn his attention to other debacles . \u201d\nMr. Christie mentioned the Navy \u2019 s littoral combat ship and aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford as other major programs that need the Trump treatment .\nOne of the top brass who visited Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago was Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan , who runs the F-35 program office . Whether he changed Mr. Trump \u2019 s mind is unclear .\nDays later , Gen. Bogdan met with reporters to assert that the plane \u2019 s major problems had been eliminated .\n\u201c This program is not out of control , \u201d Gen. Bogdan said , according to Bloomberg News . \u201c Since 2011 , we have basically been on schedule . Since 2011 , we have basically been on budget . \u201d\nThe history is , he said : \u201c We put unrealistic schedules and budgets together . And then when we ran into problems we did not manage them very well . \u201d\nThe program office says the total acquisition cost has decreased since 2014 from $ 400 billion to $ 379 billion .",
