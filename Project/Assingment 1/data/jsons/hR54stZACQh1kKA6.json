    "content": "President Obama , who extolled the value of middle-class construction jobs during nearly five years of recession and recovery , has changed his tune to borderline contempt for the blue-collar jobs needed to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline .\nIn a speech in Chattanooga , Tenn. , on Tuesday , Mr. Obama chuckled derisively when he mentioned that Republican lawmakers are promoting the pipeline project for the thousands of jobs it would create over two years .\n\u201c They keep on talking about this \u2014 an oil pipeline coming down from Canada that \u2019 s estimated to create about 50 permanent jobs , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c That \u2019 s not a jobs plan . \u201d\nIn an interview last week , the president gave a lowball estimate of \u201c maybe 2,000 \u201d construction jobs that would be created by the pipeline project . He called those jobs \u201c a blip \u201d of what the nation needs .\nThe comments contrast starkly with Mr. Obama \u2019 s attitude during his first term , when he expressed enthusiasm for construction jobs of all kinds . As part of his \u201c We Can \u2019 t Wait \u201d campaign in November 2011 , Mr. Obama held an event at the Key Bridge in Georgetown to call on Congress to approve more temporary stimulus spending on infrastructure projects to help unemployed construction workers .\n\u201c Of all the industries hammered by the economic downturn , construction has been among the hardest hit , \u201d Mr. Obama said at the time . \u201c I \u2019 m joining many of these workers to say that it makes absolutely no sense when there \u2019 s so much work to be done that they \u2019 re not doing the work . \u201d\nHe chided House Republicans at the time for considering legislation to reaffirm \u201c In God We Trust \u201d as the national motto rather than devoting time and effort to helping construction workers .\n\u201c That \u2019 s not putting people back to work , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c I trust in God , but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work . \u201d\nIn February 2009 , as he urged Congress to approve an $ 800 billion-plus economic stimulus package , Mr. Obama cited the need for construction jobs .\nThe stimulus legislation , he said at the time , \u201c has the right priorities to create 3 [ million ] to 4 million jobs and to do it in a way that lays the groundwork for long-term growth by fixing our schools ; modernizing health care to lower costs ; repairing our roads , bridges , levees and other vital infrastructure ; and moving us toward energy independence . It is what America needs right now . \u201d\nEven before he took the oath of office in January 2009 , Mr. Obama was promoting government-funded infrastructure projects that he said were \u201c shovel-ready all across the country. \u201d Many of them also would have been temporary jobs , given the act \u2019 s proposed life of two or three years .\nTwo years later , amid criticism that the stimulus law hadn \u2019 t produced the promised number of construction jobs , Mr. Obama wisecracked , \u201c Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected . \u201d\nThe president \u2019 s top aides said Mr. Obama wasn \u2019 t disparaging the value of construction jobs in his most recent comments , but was trying to make a point that House Republicans lack a comprehensive strategy for creating jobs .\nDan Pfeiffer , senior adviser to Mr. Obama , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday that the president \u2019 s latest comments are \u201c not inconsistent \u201d with previous statements about construction jobs .\n\u201c One infrastructure project is not a jobs strategy , \u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said at a breakfast meeting with reporters hosted by The Christian Science Monitor . \u201c That would be like saying our jobs strategy is to repair the Key Bridge . We \u2019 re talking about one thing , and it would have some temporary jobs which would be significant . But in the overall scale of the employment situation in this country , as the president said , it \u2019 s a blip . And when that \u2019 s done , contrary to \u2026 the rhetoric you hear , it \u2019 s 50 to 100 permanent jobs . \u201d\nMr. Pfeiffer suggested that the president \u2019 s comments about Keystone are aimed at September confrontations with Republicans over spending and borrowing .\n\u201c He \u2019 s put his jobs ideas on the table , he \u2019 s calling on Republicans to do the same , \u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said . \u201c To date , the core of the Republican jobs package \u2026 is vote to repeal Obamacare for the 40th time and build the Keystone pipeline . There \u2019 s a legitimate debate over whether you should build that pipeline or not . The president \u2019 s point is that \u2019 s not a jobs strategy . \u201d\nRepublican lawmakers also suspect that the president is signaling his disapproval of the project , which environmentalists vehemently oppose . Last month , Mr. Obama said his administration would approve the pipeline only if it would not contribute to carbon pollution .\nCanadian government and private officials have said repeatedly that they will mine the oil and sell it in the U.S. or somewhere else to burn and put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , regardless of whether the pipeline is built .\nRepublicans said that whether Mr. Obama is trying to kill the pipeline or is posturing for September , he is way off base in the jobs numbers for the project .\n\u201c The president famously pledged to \u2018 do whatever it takes \u2019 to create jobs \u2014 but this is a new low , \u201d said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton , Michigan Republican . \u201c Attacking new job opportunities is not a jobs plan .
