Arkansas , with its early primary election , has emerged as a battleground in the race for the Democratic nomination .

Many said they are still waiting to decide for whom to vote .\n`` This is really about the first time in 30 years in which there 's not been a favorite daughter or favorite son in one of the contests , or someone like Al Gore , who is very clearly identified with a major figure from Arkansas , '' said Andrew Dowdle , a political science professor at the University of Arkansas , Fayetteville , whose work focuses on the presidential nomination process .\nHillary Clinton carried Arkansas in a rout during competitive Democratic primaries in 2016 and earlier in 2008 , following up on the easy victory by her husband , then-Gov . Bill Clinton , in 1992 en route to the presidency .\nRetired U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark of Little Rock had dropped out of his primary run by the time Arkansas voted in 2004 , though nearly a quarter of the state 's Democrats that year cast their ballots for `` uncommitted '' delegates . Arkansas was one of the last states to vote in 2000 , by which point then-Vice President Gore faced only nominal opposition while carrying the state .\nBefore the 2016 election cycle , the Arkansas Legislature voted to move the state 's primary up in the calender , from May to March , to coincide with the so-called SEC primary of mostly Southern states .\nThat change generated a flurry of campaign stops to the state by Republicans running in that year 's crowded GOP primary , which was ultimately won by Donald Trump . Clinton , a home-state favorite , made a single appearance in Pine Bluff ahead of the primary . Sanders , her opponent , made none . Trump ended up beating Clinton 61 % to 34 % in the 2016 general election in Arkansas .\n`` A lot of times , by the time it got to Arkansas , there was one candidate that came out of Arkansas with viability . Last time there were two , '' said Arkansas Democratic Party Chairman Michael John Gray . `` There 's a real possibility to see , potentially , four come out with delegates , which would be a real change for us . ''\nAfter having the state 's airwaves mostly to himself earlier in the campaign , Bloomberg has since been joined by five candidates competing on the delegate chart -- as well as billionaire investor Tom Steyer -- in running television ads in Arkansas .\nSteyer was planning to drop out of the race Saturday night after his showing in the South Carolina primary .\nDowdle noted that the party 's demographics in Arkansas are different from the states that have already voted or will have voted by the end of Tuesday . About 15 % of the state 's population is black , according to the U.S. census , a smaller portion than in other Southern voting states like South Carolina . The state also lacks a major metropolitan area dense with more progressive voters , he said .\n`` The few Democrats in Northwest Arkansas are likely to be very different from Democrats in the Delta , who may be different from the few remaining Democrats in kind of the rural white areas , '' Dowdle said .\nTo gauge support among the party 's leadership , the Democrat-Gazette attempted to survey all 33 Democrats currently serving in the Legislature . Of the 27 who responded or who have publicly announced endorsements , more than half said they remained undecided in the final week before the election , or declined to say for whom they were voting .\nBiden 's campaign led the others with the support of four members of the Legislature , as well as the endorsements of both David and Mark Pryor , who each served in the U.S. Senate .\nOne of Biden 's supporters , freshman Rep. Jamie Scott , D-North Little Rock , announced her endorsement in February along with the Pryors and House Minority Leader Fred Love , D-Little Rock .\nIn a recent interview , Rep. Scott expressed respect for the other campaigns that had drawn her colleagues ' support , but faulted those candidates for not doing enough to connect with minority-group voters .\n`` Their messaging right now does n't represent me as a black woman , does n't represent me as someone who represents a majority-black district , '' Scott said .\nClose behind Biden was Warren , who has received the backing of three lawmakers in Northwest Arkansas , and Klobuchar , who had the support of two lawmakers and an endorsement from former U.S. Rep. Vic Snyder of Little Rock .\nButtigieg and Bloomberg each had the pledged support of one lawmaker . Bloomberg also has received endorsements from Mayor Scott and his predecessor , Mark Stodola .\n`` I think she 's the most prepared , I think she 's got the clearest plans ; she 's just tough , '' said Sen. Greg Leding , D-Fayetteville , of Warren , his preferred candidate .\nBoth Warren and Klobuchar 's supporters in the Legislature said that at least part of their support was rooted in the desire to see a woman president .\nRep. Tippi McCollough , D-Little Rock , who joined Klobuchar at a rally in North Little Rock last week , said she believed the Minnesota senator 's health care plan fit best with Arkansas ' `` private-option '' Medicaid expansion program . But , McCollough added , `` She 's also a qualified woman candidate and that 's important to me . ''\nOf the lawmakers who said they remained undecided , some said they had whittled their choices down to just a few candidates . Rep. Chris Richey , D-Helena-West Helena , said he was stuck between Biden and Klobuchar and waiting to see how each performed in South Carolina . Others , like Rep.
