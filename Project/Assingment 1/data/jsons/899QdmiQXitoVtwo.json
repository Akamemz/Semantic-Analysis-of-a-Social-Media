    "content": "Derek Chauvin , the former Minneapolis police officer who was arrested on Friday in connection with the death of George Floyd , faces two charges as a result of that incident : third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter . Floyd 's family argues that Chauvin should have been charged with first-degree murder . The distinction hinges on Chauvin 's state of mind as he pinned Floyd to the ground with a knee on his neck , which he continued to do even as Floyd complained that he could not breathe , even after Floyd stopped speaking or moving , and even after another officer reported that he could not detect a pulse .\nThe May 25 incident , which sparked protests across the country , began when someone called 911 to report that a man had used a counterfeit $ 20 bill for a purchase at Cup Foods , a restaurant on Chicago Avenue . Shortly after 8 p.m. , Officers Thomas Lane and J.A . Kueng arrived at the restaurant , where employees reported that the customer who had made the purchase was sitting in a car parked nearby on 38th Street . Lane and Kueng found Floyd sitting in the driver 's seat and ordered him , then pulled him , out of the car . According to the criminal complaint against Chauvin , which is based largely on body camera video of the incident , Floyd `` actively resisted being handcuffed '' but `` once handcuffed\u2026became compliant and walked with Officer Lane to the sidewalk and sat on the ground at Officer Lane 's direction . ''\nThe complaint says Lane asked for Floyd 's name and identification , asked if he was `` on anything , '' and informed him that he was under arrest for passing a counterfeit bill , a misdemeanor when the offense involves merchandise worth no more than $ 1,000 . When Lane and Kueng stood Floyd up and tried to walk him toward their squad car , the complaint says , he `` stiffened up , fell to the ground , and told the officers he was claustrophobic . '' At this point Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived at the scene in a separate squad car .\nAccording to the complaint , the officers repeatedly tried to get Floyd into Lane and Kueng 's car . The complaint says Floyd `` did not voluntarily get in the car and struggled with the officers by intentionally falling down , saying he was not going in the car , and refusing to stand still . '' While standing outside the car , Floyd `` began saying and repeating that he could not breathe . '' About five minutes after Lane and Kueng intially tried to put Floyd in their car , Chauvin pulled Floyd `` out of the passenger side of the squad car . '' Floyd `` went to the ground face down and still handcuffed . '' As Kueng held Floyd 's back and Lane held his legs , Chauvin `` placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd 's head and neck . ''\nChauvin kept his knee on Floyd 's neck for nearly nine minutes . `` I ca n't breathe , '' Floyd repeatedly said . `` Please , '' he pleaded more than once . `` Mama , '' he cried out . CNN legal analyst Elie Honig , a former state and federal prosecutor , notes that Floyd also can be heard saying `` do n't kill me '' and `` I 'm about to die '' in video of the incident , although the complaint omits those statements . It also does not mention that bystanders , worried about Floyd , urged the officers to get off of him .\nChauvin and the other two officers nevertheless `` stayed in their positions , '' although Lane twice suggested that they roll Floyd off his stomach and onto his side . `` I am worried about excited delirium or whatever , '' Lane said at one point . Chauvin rejected Lane 's suggestions .\nAbout five minutes after the officers pinned Floyd to the ground , he stopped moving . A minute later , `` the video appears to show Mr. Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak . '' Kueng checked Floyd 's right wrist for a pulse and said , `` I could n't find one . '' Still , `` none of the officers moved from their positions . '' About two minutes later , Chauvin finally removed his knee from Floyd 's neck . An ambulance arrived and took Floyd to the Hennepin County Medical Center , where he was pronounced dead .\nThe third-degree murder charge against Chauvin , which is punishable by up to 25 years in prison , alleges that he caused Floyd 's death by `` perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind , without regard for human life , '' but `` without intent to effect the death of any person . '' The lesser charge of second-degree manslaughter , which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison , alleges that Chauvin killed Floyd through `` culpable negligence '' that created `` an unreasonable risk '' of `` death or great bodily harm . ''\nBoth of those charges seem well-supported by the facts revealed in the video . What about first-degree murder , the charge that Benjamin Crump , the attorney representing Floyd 's family , thinks should have been brought ? That charge , which carries a mandatory life sentence , requires that Chauvin acted `` with premeditation '' and `` with intent '' to kill Floyd . `` We now have the audio from the police body cam , and we hear where one officer says , 'He does n't have a pulse , maybe we should turn him on his side , ' '' Crump said today on Face the Nation . `` But yet , Officer Chauvin says , 'No , we 're going to keep him in this position . ' That 's intent . ''\nThat claim seems plausible given the repeated pleas from Floyd , the repeated exhortations by witnesses , and Lane 's repeated suggestions that Floyd should not be left on his stomach\u2014any of which , if heeded , could have prevented Floyd 's death . But do Chauvin 's actions suggest `` premeditation '' ? That element does not require a carefully laid plan to kill someone , but it does mean that the defendant `` consider [ ed ] , plan [ ned ] or prepare [ d ] for , or determine [ d ] to commit , the act\u2026prior to its commission . ''\nSecond-degree murder , which is punishable by up to 40 years in prison , seems like a better fit . That charge requires that the defendant `` cause [ d ] the death of a human being with intent to effect the death of that person or another , but without premeditation . '' Yet even that charge requires an intent that Chauvin surely will deny .\nProsecutors may yet revise the charges against Chauvin . They may also file charges against Kueng and/or Lane , who were complicit in keeping Floyd pinned to the ground on his stomach despite all the warning signs . All four Minneapolis officers who were involved in the incident were fired the day after Floyd 's death .\n`` The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd 's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total , '' the criminal complaint notes . `` Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive . Police are trained that this type of restraint with a\nSome of the details in the complaint could be useful to the officers ' lawyers . The complaint claims that Floyd was uncooperative and that he began complaining about difficulty breathing even before he was pinned to the ground , which might have led the officers to discount his subsequent complaints . `` You are talking fine , '' one of them said while Floyd was still moving .\nThe report also notes\u2014gratuitously , in Honig 's view\u2014that Floyd was `` over six feet tall and weigh [ ed ] more than 200 pounds . '' While that information might be relevant in understanding why the officers had trouble getting Floyd into the patrol car , it has no real bearing on what they did once they had him pinned . In particular , it does not explain Chauvin 's decision to keep kneeling on Floyd 's neck .\nHonig also faults the prosecutors ' description of what caused Floyd 's death , which is based on preliminary autopsy results . `` The autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation , '' the complaint says . `` Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease . The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police , his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death . ''\nHonig notes that `` the lack of 'physical findings ' by no means rules out the possibility that the victim died of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation . '' And he questions the reference to intoxication as a factor that may have contributed to Floyd 's death . `` In my 14 years as a prosecutor ( or my 45 years of life ) , I 've never heard of a 'potential intoxicant , ' '' he writes . `` Did Floyd have intoxicants in his system or not ? A basic toxicology test should answer that question conclusively , and there is no excuse for prosecutors to not know the answer , or to state it ambiguously , four days after Floyd 's death . ''\nContrary to Honig 's assertion , toxicology results often are not available for weeks after an autopsy . At this point , the speculation that Floyd was under the influence of a drug seems to be based on little more than the officers ' suspicions . In any event , as Honig points out , that question is irrelevant to Chauvin 's culpability . Regardless of Floyd 's preexisting medical conditions or any drug he may or may not have taken , the relevant question in the causal analysis is whether he would still be alive but for Chauvin 's actions , and the answer to that seems clear .\nAddendum : Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe and Minnesota attorney Albert Turner Goins , writing in The Boston Globe , argue that the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin is inappropriate because case law limits that charge to `` reckless or wanton acts\u2026without special regard to their effect on any particular person , '' such as `` shooting aimlessly into a crowd . '' They say a second-degree murder charge , under a provision dealing with a defendant who causes someone 's death `` while committing or attempting to commit a felony offense '' ( in this case , the assault on Floyd ) makes more sense . That provision does not require proof of an intent to kill .",
