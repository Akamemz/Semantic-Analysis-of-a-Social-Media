    "content": "The Texas Theatre , a one-screen movie house in Dallas , has already left its mark on U.S. history . It was inside the theater , on Nov. 22 , 1963 , that presumed killer Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy .\nOn Thursday , the theater in north Texas joined about 300 other small cinemas to make history of a different kind , and one also linked to an assassination , though of the imaginary kind : Showing the movie \u201c The Interview . \u201d\nThe comedy about the assassination of North Korea \u2019 s ruler , Kim Jong Un , was yanked by Sony Pictures last week after big theater chains refused to play it . The decision followed a cyberattack at the Sony Corp. unit , which the U.S. blamed on North Korea , and a terrorist threat against theaters that played the film .\nPossibly as a result of the controversy , crowds flocked theaters to catch showings of the movie . The film made just over $ 1 million in ticket sales on its first day from 331 locations for an impressive $ 3,142 per theater average , according to distributor Sony Pictures .\nA loud round of applause marked the end of the Texas Theatre \u2019 s first showing of the film . \u201c It was hysterical , \u201d said Chip Northrup , a 64-year-old investor . \u201c I can \u2019 t believe the chain theaters didn \u2019 t pick this up . I hope these independent theaters make a fortune . \u201d\nLines started forming for \u2018 The Interview \u2019 more than an hour before the first show at The Texas Theatre in Dallas on Christmas Day . Dan Molinski/The Wall Street Journal\nOne of the film \u2019 s stars , Seth Rogen , greeted patrons in Los Angeles at an early Christmas morning screening . In New York , audiences flocked to see \u201c The Interview , \u201d after weeks of drama surrounding its fate .\n\u201c I wanted to see the first showing , \u201d said Ken Jacowitz , a 54-year-old librarian , as he held his movie ticket aloft for TV cameras and photographers outside Cinema Village , an independent theater in New York City .\nMr. Jacowitz said he was there to bolster freedom of speech rather than display patriotism . \u201c I don \u2019 t see it as being pro-American but pro the spirit of America , \u201d he said .\nEarly box office figures weren \u2019 t available , but since it played in so few theaters , \u201c The Interview \u201d was likely dwarfed by much bigger Christmas Day releases such as \u201c Into the Woods \u201d and \u201c Unbroken . \u201d\nThe limited release wasn \u2019 t the public \u2019 s first chance to see the $ 44 million farce . On Wednesday , Sony persuaded Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to offer the movie for rental or purchase from their online video stores .\nIt costs $ 5.99 to rent the movie from Google and Microsoft and $ 14.99 to buy it . Sony also set up a special website , seetheinterview.com , to offer the movie directly .\nSony , Google and Microsoft all declined to give viewership figures for \u201c The Interview \u201d on Thursday .\nThe movie \u2019 s online release might take some of the fun out of opening day , though Barak Epstein , the 35-year-old manager of the Texas Theatre , said he doesn \u2019 t mind . After all , he said , the main reason he joined fellow small-theater operators in deciding to run the film was to show North Korea that Americans don \u2019 t back down .\n\u201c So what are the hackers going to do , get into my email ?

I \u2019 m not really worried . \u201d \u2014Barak Epstein , manager of The Texas Theatre\n\u201c It \u2019 s now available to everyone , and that \u2019 s great , so the online release doesn \u2019 t bother me , \u201d Mr. Epstein said . \u201c Other governments can \u2019 t censor what movies we watch here . We need to always be sure we \u2019 re protecting the First Amendment . \u201d\nStaff at Cinema Village in New York said several showings were sold out .
