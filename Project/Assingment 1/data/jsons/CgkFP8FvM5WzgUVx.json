    "content": "President Donald Trump on Friday declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency in order to free up more money and resources . But he denied any responsibility for delays in making testing available for the new virus , whose spread has roiled markets and disrupted the lives of everyday Americans .\nSpeaking from the Rose Garden , Trump said , \u201c I am officially declaring a national emergency , '' unleashing as much as $ 50 billion for state and local governments to respond to the outbreak .\nTrump also announced a range of executive actions , including a new public-private partnership to expand coronavirus testing capabilities with drive-through locations , as his administration has come under fire for being too slow in making the test available . Trump said , \u201c I do n't take responsibility at all '' for the slow rollout of testing .\nLate Friday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a deal with the Trump administration for an aid package from Congress that would provide free tests , sick pay for workers and bolster food programs .\n\u201c We are proud to have reached an agreement with the Administration to resolve outstanding challenges , and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act , \u201d Pelosi announced in a letter to colleagues . The House was poised to vote .\nHowever , as of 8:30 p.m . ET the vote had not yet occurred . According to a Reuters news alert , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said there were unresolved issues between the administration and lawmakers on the response bill , though Pelosi had thought there was a deal at hand .\nA few minutes later , though , another alert from Reuters said Trump had indicated he was fully supportive of H.R . 6201 , the Families First Coronavirus Response Act , `` which will be voted on in the House this evening . ''\nNo further details were available at the time of publication .\nAccess to testing has been a persistent source of concern . Still , Trump said officials do n't want people taking the test unless they have certain symptoms . `` We do n't want people without symptoms to go and do that test , '' Trump said , adding , \u201c It 's totally unnecessary . ''\nTrump took a number of other actions to bolster energy markets , ease the financial burden for Americans with student loans and give medical professionals additional \u201c flexibility \u201d in treating patients during the public health crisis .\nHe waived interest on federally held student loans and moved to prop up energy markets , by directing the Department of Energy to buy oil to fill the strategic petroleum reserve \u201c 'right up to the top. \u201d He said he was giving Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar emergency authorities to waive federal regulations and laws as needed , for instance , to allow doctors to practice tele-medicine across state lines .\n\u201c Through a very collective action and shared sacrifice , national determination , we will overcome the threat of the virus , \u201d Trump said .\nEarlier , Trump said the White House and Congress have yet to agree on a broader economic aid package , claiming that he does n't believe House Democrats are `` giving enough . '' Lawmakers are preparing to vote on their own measure Friday .\nSpeaker Pelosi said Friday the House would approve its coronavirus aid package , imploring the Trump administration and congressional Republicans to \u201c put families first \u201d by backing the effort to provide Americans with relief .\nThe House Democratic leader spoke from the speaker 's balcony at the Capitol ahead of Trump 's news conference at the White House , as the power centers of Washington were shuttered to visitors .\n\u201c Our nation , our great nation has faced crisis before , '' Pelosi said . \u201c And every time , thanks to the courage and optimism of the American people , we have prevailed . Now , working together , we will once again prevail . \u201d\nCentral to the package is free testing for the virus and guaranteed sick pay for workers who are taking time away from jobs , along with an infusion of dollars to handle unemployment benefits and boost food programs for children , families and seniors .\nPelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , whom Trump tapped to negotiate for the administration , have engaged in around-the-clock negotiations that continued even as Trump was speaking .\nBut Republican leaders in Congress slowed the deal , wanting assurances that Trump would publicly support the agreement before signing off on it ahead of any vote , according to a top congressional aide unauthorized to discuss the private talks and speaking on condition of anonymity .\nGOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California , the House minority leader , huddled with Mnuchin and Trump at the White House earlier Friday .\n\u201c We can only defeat this outbreak if we have an accurate determination of its scale and scope , so that we can pursue the precise science-based response that is necessary to put families first , \u201d Pelosi said .\nIt 's not clear if any of the GOP leadership 's issues were holding up passage .\nThe White House is under enormous pressure , dealing with the crisis on multiple fronts as it encroached ever closer on the president .\nThe virus has swept in alarming ways across American life , sending the financial markets into a dangerous slide and shuttering schools and sporting events and limiting everyday interactions in communities across the country .\nAnd a personal health scare intensified as White House officials worked to determine the level of exposure by the president and senior aides to several foreign officials who have since tested positive for the virus .\nTrump said he was gratified that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tested negative for the virus , after the pair sat next to each other for an extended period of time last weekend . A senior aide to Bolsonaro tested positive . \u201c We have no symptoms whatsoever , \u201d said Trump , who has not gotten tested but said Friday he would \u201c most likely \u201d be tested \u201c fairly soon . \u201d\nAustralian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton , now in isolation at a hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus , had returned to Sydney from Washington , where he met Attorney General WIlliam Barr and Ivanka Trump last week .\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said Ivanka Trump , who worked from home on Friday , was evaluated by the White House Medical Unit and it was determined that because she was exhibiting no symptoms she does not need to self-quarantine .\nBarr , meanwhile , was staying home Friday , though he \u201c felt great and was n't showing any symptoms , \u201d according to his spokeswoman Kerri Kupec . She said the CDC did not recommend testing at this point .\nIn addition , just days after meeting Trump and Sen. Rick Scott , R-Fla. , at the president 's Mar-a-Lago resort , the communications chief for Brazil 's president , F\u00e1bio Wajngarten , tested positive for coronavirus . Scott said he was isolating himself .\nGOP Sen. Lindsey Graham , who was also at Trump \u2019 s club on the weekend , joined a growing list of lawmakers who have chosen to isolate themselves as a precaution . He announced Friday that he also met with the Australian official who has now tested positive . And GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , who had previously isolated himself after a potential exposure at a conservative conference in Washington , said Friday he met with a Spanish official and is now self-quarantining .\nPelosi and Mnuchin continued their constant cross-town phone calls throughout a tense day of negotiations to firm up and salvage the emerging deal that has widespread support from Democrats and some in the business community seeking certainty .\nProviding sick pay for workers is a crucial element of federal efforts to stop the rapid spread of the infection . Officials warn that the nation 's healthcare system could quickly become overwhelmed with gravely sick patients , as suddenly happened in Italy , one of the countries hardest hit by the virus .\nThe ability to ensure paychecks will keep flowing \u2014 for people who stay home as a preventative measure or because they 're feeling ill or caring for others \u2014 can help assure Americans they will not fall into financial hardship .\nTrump 's 73-minute remarks capped a tumultuous week in which Washington strained for a comprehensive response to an outbreak that is testing the nation 's political , financial and health care systems .\nHospitals welcomed Trump \u2019 s emergency declaration , which they and lawmakers in Congress had been requesting . It allows the Health and Human Services Department to temporarily waive certain federal rules that can make it harder for hospitals and other health care facilities to respond to an emergency .\nSuch rules include a Medicare requirement that a patient spend three days in the hospital before the program will pay for care in a nursing facility . Waiving the rule would make more inpatient beds available . Another rule requires doctors and other clinicians to be licensed in the state in which they are providing services . It can be waived if the physician is licensed in another state .\nThe American Medical Association said the emergency declaration would help ensure America 's health care system has sufficient resources to properly respond to the ongoing outbreak .\nTrump 's actions were also viewed favorably on Wall Street . The Dow Jones Industrial Average 's gains doubled in the last half-hour of trading Friday to nearly 2,000 points , its biggest point gain ever , as Trump outlined steps to expand testing , buy more oil to boost U.S. reserves , ease the economic impact on students and free up billions for states and cities to fight the virus outbreak .\nFor most people , the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough . For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia .\nThe vast majority of people recover . According to the World Health Organization , people with mild illness recover in about two weeks , while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to be over it .\nTrump has struggled to show he 's on top of the crisis , after giving conflicting descriptions of what the U.S. is doing to combat the virus . On Wednesday he announced he would ban travel to the U.S. from Europe , but aides later clarified that it would have carve-outs for American citizens , permanent residents and some others \u2014 and only affect 26 European nations .\nTrump on Friday said `` we may have to include '' the U.K. because of a recent rise in cases . \u201c Their numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours , so we may be adding that , and we may be adding a couple of others and we may frankly start thinking about taking some off . \u201d\nThe House aid package builds on an emergency $ 8.3 billion measure approved last week .\nPelosi promised a third coronavirus package will follow soon , though the House is leaving Washington on Friday for a previously scheduled recess .
