Nadler made \u201c false allegations \u201d and \u201c should be embarrassed\u2026for the way [ he ] addressed this body . \u201d\n\u201c This is the U.S. Senate . You \u2019 re not in charge here. \u201d https : //t.co/YliqkRpTBy pic.twitter.com/PNLUAtYWEp \u2014 ABC News Politics ( @ ABCPolitics ) January 22 , 2020\nHe went on to call Nadler a liar , saying , \u201c Mr . Nadler came up here and made false allegations against our team . He made false allegations against all of you . \u201d\nCipollone then accused the lawmaker of being a hypocrite as well , reading a quote from a statement Nadler made during President Bill Clinton \u2019 s impeachment proceedings in which he argued \u201c a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment substantially supported by one of our major political parties and largely opposed by the other \u201d would be illegitimate , and would \u201c call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions . \u201d\nHe concluded by saying , \u201c You owe an apology to the president of the United States and his family . You owe an apology to the Senate . But most of all , you owe an apology to the American people . \u201d\nHis fellow counsel , Jay Sekulow , followed this up with one of his own , directly addressing Nadler , with a fiery argument in which he , too , accused Nadler of hypocrisy and claimed that it was Nadler who was treacherous .\nThat \u2019 s when Nadler returned to the floor to call Cipollone and Sekulow liars .\n\u201c The president \u2019 s counsel has no standing to talk about lying , \u201d Nadler said , pointing out that the counsel lied about Trump not being invited to take part in the impeachment inquiry . He told the Senate he personally had invited Trump \u2014 which is true \u2014 and that \u201c a few days later , we received a letter from Mr. Cipollone on the White House stationary that said , \u2018 No , there \u2019 s no interest in appearing. \u2019 So on the one hand , they \u2019 re lying \u2014 \u201d\nNadler cut himself off there , and returned to his effort to rebut the White House \u2019 s claims with facts . But he returned to his point when concluding his remarks , saying the president \u201c defies everything . Defies the law to withhold aid from Ukraine . Defies the law in a dozen different directions , all the time . And lies about it , all the time . And sends Mr. Cipollone here to lie about it . \u201d\nAfter a day that was relatively staid \u2014 particularly in comparison to the impeachment proceedings in the House \u2014 these exchanges stood out . Chief Justice John Roberts , who until this point had only spoken to preside over procedural issues , felt he had to comment , saying :\nI think it is appropriate at this point for me to admonish both the House managers and the president \u2019 s counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world \u2019 s greatest deliberative body . One reason it has earned that title is because its members avoid speaking in a manner and using language that is not conducive to civil discourse . In the 1905 Swain trial , a senator objected when one of the managers used the word pettifogging , and the presiding officer said the word ought not to have been used . I don \u2019 t think that we need to aspire to that high a standard , but I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are .\nHouse Democrats have argued before that there \u2019 s a time and place for decorum\nIn the past , tensions in the Senate have broken out into violence , particularly when one senator has accused another of being a liar , which is why Sen. Ben Tillman punched Sen. John McLaurin in 1902 . It was that incident that led to the creation of the rules governing how senators are to speak about each other , namely : \u201c No Senator in debate shall , directly or indirectly , by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator . \u201d\nImpeachment trials have their own special rules that do not include a similar clause ; however , Roberts clearly hoped to tamp down passions in order to keep up the Senate \u2019 s normal , subdued sense of decorum .\nBut Democrats \u2014 particularly those in the House \u2014 have argued there are times when decorum deserves to be broken ; for instance , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was censured for calling a nativist Trump attack on lawmakers \u201c racist \u201d in July , breaking the House rule that states \u201c personal abuse , innuendo , or ridicule of the President is not permitted . \u201d\nPelosi accepted her punishment \u2014 not being allowed to speak on the House floor for a day \u2014 and was praised by many members of her caucus , like Rep. Jamie Raskin , who said , \u201c The speaker engaged in a small-but-necessary act of legislative civil disobedience . ... She needed to tell the truth about the president \u2019 s remarks . \u201d\nTuesday , the House impeachment managers tried to do the same . Nadler was correct in asserting the White House counsel was lying to the Senate . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Aaron Rupar noted , the defense team \u2019 s opening remarks alone contained at least four easily refuted lies . And as the proceedings went on , those lies \u2014 particularly the claim that Trump had been barred from participating in the impeachment inquiry \u2014 were repeated .\nNadler \u2019 s statements were an attempt to push back against these false claims \u2014 and given the fact that they were delivered after more than 10 hours of deliberation , they may have been couched in some frustration .\nGiven that frustration , and the length of the day , working to avoiding fistfights on the Senate floor is admirable . And it is important that the drama of the trial be contained to discussions of presidential wrongdoing , rather than fights .\nBut if there is no way for either side to openly challenge when the other side is not presenting arguments based on the facts , there is little point in having the trial at all .
