    "content": "In North Carolina , a husband left his house to start a car , only to be handcuffed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent . In Los Angeles , a man was arrested at the Walmart where he worked . In Garden City , Kansas , whole apartments of people were fingerprinted and taken into custody .\nThey \u2019 re three of the more than 680 people that ICE agents around the country \u2014 from the Midwest to the Southeast , California to New York \u2014 have arrested in the past week . Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly , in a statement Monday , calls it \u201c a series of targeted enforcement operations , \u201d and maintains it \u2019 s no different from what ICE has done \u201c for many years. \u201d Critics call it a series of nationwide raids \u2014 and claim it \u2019 s the first step toward President Donald Trump fulfilling his promise to deport millions of unauthorized immigrants .\nThe reality is somewhere in the middle . Nothing that ICE did last week was unprecedented . But it feels different with President Trump in the White House \u2014 and that \u2019 s something that ICE agents and immigrants alike know all too well .\nFor the most part , last week \u2019 s raids wouldn \u2019 t have been out of place in the early years of the Obama administration . ICE agents didn \u2019 t ( despite rumors to the contrary ) set up street-level checkpoints to demand proof of citizenship of anyone in passing cars . They didn \u2019 t sweep through whole apartment buildings and arrest whole blocks \u2019 worth of immigrants . They didn \u2019 t deliberately target immigrants simply for being in the country without papers .\nWhat distinguished last week \u2019 s raids from the Obama era were three things : First , ICE agents broke with years of Obama-administration policy by making \u201c collateral arrests \u201d \u2014 arresting unauthorized immigrants who happened to be in the place they were raiding , even if they didn \u2019 t have a warrant for them . Second , the agency deliberately coordinated a series of nationwide raids , scooping up more people in less time than ICE raids typically do .\nFinally , of course , President Obama \u2014 who spent much of his presidency attempting to reassure unauthorized immigrants that if they hadn \u2019 t committed crimes in the US , they were safe from deportation \u2014 isn \u2019 t in office anymore . In his place is a president who got elected promising a new , tougher era in immigration enforcement , one in which immigrants were more broadly targeted and ICE agents less restrained .\nLast week \u2019 s raids don \u2019 t necessarily represent that new era yet . But it \u2019 s not surprising that they \u2019 re being seen that way .\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security , more than 680 immigrants were arrested in the past week \u2014 in regions spanning the country .\nThe New York Times reported Monday that 160 were arrested in the Los Angeles area , with another 40 or so arrested in the New York area . \u201c An additional 200 were arrested last week in Georgia , North Carolina and South Carolina , \u201d the Times reports , and \u201c about 200 were arrested across Illinois , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Missouri and Wisconsin \u201d ( including Gardenville , Kansas ) .\nOther enforcement sweeps were reported in the Baltimore and DC metro areas ; in Austin , Dallas , and Pflugerville , Texas ; in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma ; in Plant City , Florida ; and elsewhere .\nFor the most part , the raids appear to have been targeted efforts to catch individual immigrants that ICE had gotten warrants to arrest . DHS \u2019 s statement claimed that \u201c approximately 75 % \u201d of the immigrants arrested were \u201c criminal aliens , \u201d implying they had criminal convictions \u2014 though many of those convictions were almost certainly for minor crimes ( or simply for reentering the country illegally ) .\nConfusingly , another DHS official told the Washington Post that anyone who \u2019 d entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa counted as a \u201c criminal alien \u201d \u2014 but that definition would fit all 680 of the people arrested last week , not just 75 percent of them , so it doesn \u2019 t appear to be the definition used in the DHS statement .\nImmigrants who had previously gotten orders of deportation also appeared to be targets in Los Angeles and Maryland .\nBut it \u2019 s also clear that when ICE agents encountered other unauthorized immigrants along with the person they were seeking \u2014 or when they didn \u2019 t find that person , but found other unauthorized immigrants instead \u2014 others were arrested too .\n\u201c They show you some sort of warrant and they go in and fingerprint everybody , \u201d says Ambar Pinto , who manages a hotline for immigrants to report ICE activity to the advocacy network United We Dream . Anyone whose fingerprints reveal them to be unauthorized is arrested ; \u201c if there \u2019 s children in the house , \u201d Pinto says , \u201c they will leave the mother behind with an order to report to ICE for a check-in . \u201d\nIn other cases , ICE agents have reportedly used aggressive tactics . Maria Fernanda Durand of the advocacy group CASA de Maryland reports that , instead of attempting to enter houses to serve warrants , ICE agents waited outside houses and arrested people when they left the house to go to work . In Maryland and elsewhere , ICE agents made arrests out of uniforms \u2014 or while wearing a vest that said ICE on the back , but , as Pinto says , \u201c if they \u2019 re knocking on your door you can \u2019 t see that . \u201d\nThe truth of the raids , however , has sometimes been overshadowed by rumors that sound much worse than anything that \u2019 s been documented \u2014 but that have ultimately been debunked .\nThere is no evidence of street-level \u201c checkpoints \u201d where ICE agents stop drivers to ask for proof of citizenship , though rumors of such checkpoints are ubiquitous . ( The National Immigration Law Center , in a two-page document sent to its network warning them what to look for , didn \u2019 t include checkpoints in its list of \u201c practices \u201d in which ICE was engaging ; advocates in Austin , where the checkpoints were most widely rumored , say they don \u2019 t exist . ) Other , more specific rumors \u2014 like a widely-circulated Facebook post claiming that ICE agents in Kansas City planned to arrest immigrants on their way out of church \u2014 turned out to be baseless as well .\nThe current ICE raids may be more in line with the prior immigration policy than they seem\nAs a candidate and as president , Donald Trump has claimed that his predecessors didn \u2019 t do anything to enforce immigration law . He \u2019 s wrong . He \u2019 s actually continuing an era of aggressive enforcement that started under George W. Bush and continued under Barack Obama .\nOne of the key tactics used by both the Bush and Obama administrations was the immigration raid . Often , under Obama in particular , targeted \u201c surges \u201d were used to track down individuals who met enforcement priorities : immigrants who \u2019 d been convicted of crimes , immigration \u201c fugitives \u201d who had already been given orders of deportation , or people who \u2019 d been deported and re-entered the United States . In Obama \u2019 s last year in office , ICE conducted 18 \u201c surges \u201d ( according to press releases on the agency \u2019 s site ) . In the biggest , a month-long sweep of several Midwestern states , it arrested 331 people . A Los Angeles raid netted 112 immigrants in a week .\nObama used increased enforcement as a credibility-building tool with the public as he attempted to push Congress to enact an immigration overhaul that would have given millions of undocumented Americans a path to citizenship .\nTrump , by contrast , appears to be using raids , and enforcement , as an end in themselves .\nAn executive order Trump signed in his first week in office redefined enforcement priorities to include , in practice , pretty much every unauthorized immigrant in the US .\nBut ICE is claiming that last week \u2019 s raids were in line with the old priorities issued by Obama \u2014 and that the raids were just a continuation of what the agency has been doing .\nOn a press call , ICE officials in Los Angeles claimed that , of the 161 arrests they made , \u201c all but 5 would \u2019 ve been people we would \u2019 ve prioritized for enforcement previously. \u201d Another ICE official told the Times , \u201c The president has been clear in saying that D.H.S . should be focused on removing individuals who pose a threat to public safety , who have been charged with criminal offenses , who have committed multiple immigration violations or who have been deported and re-entered the country illegally. \u201d This sounds like the \u201c priorities \u201d issued by President Obama circa 2011 \u2014 not the ones issued by President Trump in 2017 .\nICE \u2019 s claims don \u2019 t exactly line up with the reports from advocacy groups on the ground \u2014 but they \u2019 re not that far off , either . Advocates claim that ICE is going after people that it could have deported in the past , but explicitly decided not to \u2014 like Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos , who was deported from Arizona last week \u2014 or people who have years-old final orders of deportation .\nObama , in a November 2014 memo , told ICE agents to focus on people who \u2019 d been ordered deported since the beginning of 2014 . Now , Pinto says , \u201c they are going after anyone who has ever had a removal order. \u201d That \u2019 s a shift from the most recent Obama administration policy \u2014 but it \u2019 s identical to the policy that the Obama administration carried out over its first term , in which any \u201c fugitive , \u201d no matter how long ago they were ordered deported , was a priority .\nICE agents are now free to make \u201c collateral arrests \u201d \u2014 something they \u2019 ve been demanding for years\nWhen Kelly maintained in Monday \u2019 s statement that \u201c The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine , targeted arrests carried out by ICE \u2019 s Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis , \u201d he wasn \u2019 t necessarily wrong .\nBut he was only telling half the story . His department has changed its policy toward the immigrants it \u2019 s not explicitly \u201c focusing \u201d on \u2014 which make up the overwhelming majority of unauthorized immigrants in the United States . To millions of immigrants and their communities , last week \u2019 s raids represented a potential threat of the type they hadn \u2019 t seen in years : the threat of becoming a \u201c collateral \u201d victim of an ICE raid simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time .\nThe immigrants caught up in \u201c collateral arrests \u201d last week aren \u2019 t authorized to be in the US , but have never had a criminal record or been deported or ordered deported . In some cases , they happened to be in the same apartment as someone ICE was looking for . In others , ICE had the wrong address but fingerprinted and arrested anyone who was there anyway .\nCollateral arrests were known to happen under the Obama administration . But generally , ICE agents were under instructions to arrest people identified in advance , and only those people .\nIn 2011 , the president of the ICE union , Chris Crane , testified to Congress that agents \u201c were not permitted to arrest or even speak to confirmed or suspected illegal aliens encountered in the field during operations , and were prohibited from running standard criminal record checks for wants and warrants . \u201d\nCrane testified before Congress that the policies were prohibiting ICE from \u201c enforcing many laws enacted by Congress ; laws they took an oath to enforce. \u201d He cited them as evidence that the agency \u2019 s policy was being controlled by \u201c powerful special interest groups that advocate on behalf of illegal aliens. \u201d When his union backed Donald Trump for president in the 2016 election , it was in large part based on Trump \u2019 s promise to take the \u201c handcuffs \u201d off ICE agents and allow them to do their jobs the way they saw fit .\nThe raids were designed to send a message \u2014 and the rumors that followed were inevitable\nThe United We Dream hotline for immigrants to report ICE activity \u2014which has been up and running for over a year \u2014 has never seen anything like last week .\n\u201c For the past six months , \u201d Pinto says , \u201c our average of calls \u201d to the enforcement hotline \u201c is 30 to 50 calls a month. \u201d In the first 11 days of February , \u201c we have had more than 214 calls , \u201d Pinto told \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2014 and \u201c most \u201d of those came during a 9-day period from February 3rd to February 11 .\nBut February 2017 doesn \u2019 t yet hold the record for monthly call volume . That record belongs to January 2016 \u2014 when unauthorized immigrants around the country were panicked by reports of household raids directed by the Obama administration .\nThose raids were designed to target only Central Americans ( mostly families ) who \u2019 d been ordered deported in the past 2 years and hadn \u2019 t left . Most unauthorized immigrants didn \u2019 t fit that description , but the traumatic nature of raids \u2014 and the knowledge that , if ICE agents did make collateral arrests , there would be no legal recourse \u2014 sent the entire community of unauthorized immigrants and their neighbors into a panic spiral for several weeks .\nThe Trump administration has shown no interest in quelling the fears of otherwise law-abiding unauthorized immigrants . To the contrary , the purpose of Trump \u2019 s executive order broadening immigration priorities was to make it easier to deport unauthorized immigrants \u2014 to turn Trump \u2019 s campaign declaration \u201c Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation \u201d into government policy .\nLast week \u2019 s raids were , indeed , designed to reinforce that message . They wouldn \u2019 t have been so big , or so coordinated , if they weren \u2019 t . One ICE spokesperson told reporters that \u201c the fact that they coincided is not entirely a coincidence ; \u201d a different official told the New York Times that the coordinated action was in the works for several weeks , and \u201c New York was late to the game . \u201d\nUnder Obama , ICE conducted one \u201c surge \u201d larger than the one conducted by Trump last week \u2014 it arrested 2,000 people over only a few days . But most enforcement \u201c surges \u201d were more likely to net 200 people over the course of a month . And the combination of nationwide , coordinated raids and collateral arrests is something immigrants didn \u2019 t see in the Obama era .\nHigh-profile raids are designed to affect not only the people who are physically being arrested , but anyone else who could be in a similar position . They \u2019 re supposed to serve as a deterrent to anyone who might be considering coming to the US without papers , and to increase the pressure on anyone who is currently here and could be persuaded to leave .\nBut raids are an extremely blunt instrument for this purpose . Inevitably , they inspire fear in many , many more people than those who are likely to be targets . And where there is fear , rumors about raids can easily spread , putting vulnerable people on high alert .\nThis is especially true if people already used to living in fear of deportation . For immigrant communities , what they are experiencing today is simply a return to what they felt under George W. Bush in 2005 , or when Obama was setting deportation records in 2010 while claiming he wasn \u2019 t deporting law-abiding unauthorized immigrants .\nNow , as then , there \u2019 s nothing concrete that local leaders and advocates can offer immigrants to ensure they won \u2019 t be deported . Indeed , they have little ability to dismiss the worst rumors \u2014 because under Trump , no one knows what is possible .\nWhile ICE agents did not , in fact , arrest people going to or from church in Kansas City , they could have . There \u2019 s a 2011 memo that tells ICE agents not to conduct enforcement activities at \u201c sensitive locations \u201d like churches and schools , but it \u2019 s not clear whether ICE is following that memo under Trump . In most cases , ICE agents weren \u2019 t sweeping through whole neighborhoods or stopping drivers at random \u2014 but there wasn \u2019 t anything stopping them from doing so , and no indication they won \u2019 t start in future .\nCORRECTION : This article originally referred to the nonexistent city of Gardenville , KS instead of the real city of Garden City , KS .

To the contrary, the purpose of Trump\u2019s executive order broadening immigration priorities was to make it easier to deport unauthorized immigrants \u2014 to turn Trump\u2019s campaign declaration \u201cAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation\u201d into government policy.\n\nLast week\u2019s raids were, indeed, designed to reinforce that message. They wouldn\u2019t have been so big, or so coordinated, if they weren\u2019t. One ICE spokesperson told reporters that \u201cthe fact that they coincided is not entirely a coincidence;\u201d a different official told the New York Times that the coordinated action was in the works for several weeks, and \u201cNew York was late to the game.\u201d\n\nUnder Obama, ICE conducted one \u201csurge\u201d larger than the one conducted by Trump last week \u2014 it arrested 2,000 people over only a few days. But most enforcement \u201csurges\u201d were more likely to net 200 people over the course of a month. And the combination of nationwide, coordinated raids and collateral arrests is something immigrants didn\u2019t see in the Obama era.\n\nHigh-profile raids are designed to affect not only the people who are physically being arrested, but anyone else who could be in a similar position. They\u2019re supposed to serve as a deterrent to anyone who might be considering coming to the US without papers, and to increase the pressure on anyone who is currently here and could be persuaded to leave.\n\nBut raids are an extremely blunt instrument for this purpose. Inevitably, they inspire fear in many, many more people than those who are likely to be targets. And where there is fear, rumors about raids can easily spread, putting vulnerable people on high alert.\n\nThis is especially true if people already used to living in fear of deportation. For immigrant communities, what they are experiencing today is simply a return to what they felt under George W. Bush in 2005, or when Obama was setting deportation records in 2010 while claiming he wasn\u2019t deporting law-abiding unauthorized immigrants.\n\nNow, as then, there\u2019s nothing concrete that local leaders and advocates can offer immigrants to ensure they won\u2019t be deported. Indeed, they have little ability to dismiss the worst rumors \u2014 because under Trump, no one knows what is possible.\n\nWhile ICE agents did not, in fact, arrest people going to or from church in Kansas City, they could have. There\u2019s a 2011 memo that tells ICE agents not to conduct enforcement activities at \u201csensitive locations\u201d like churches and schools, but it\u2019s not clear whether ICE is following that memo under Trump. In most cases, ICE agents weren\u2019t sweeping through whole neighborhoods or stopping drivers at random \u2014 but there wasn\u2019t anything stopping them from doing so, and no indication they won\u2019t start in future.\n\nCORRECTION: This article originally referred to the nonexistent city of Gardenville, KS instead of the real city of Garden City, KS.
