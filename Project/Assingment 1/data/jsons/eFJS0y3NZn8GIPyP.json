    "content": "Republicans are on the verge of achieving one of biggest policy goals of the past decade : unraveling the Affordable Care Act .\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , as being considered in the US Senate , repeals Obamacare \u2019 s individual mandate . That change , according to the Congressional Budget Office , would cut $ 338 billion over 10 years from Medicaid and insurance subsidies and lead to 13 million fewer people having health coverage . That will , according to the best evidence we have , lead to an increase in preventable deaths on the order of 15,600 people per year .\nIt will do more than that , though . It will completely destabilize the market for individual health insurance . The individual mandate serves a critically important function for people buying health insurance outside of an employer . It makes sure that young and healthy people with low health expenses buy insurance , which lowers premiums for everyone else . That ensures that people with chronic health conditions who don \u2019 t get insurance from work can buy coverage at an even barely reasonable price .\nWithout the mandate , the individual market could easily collapse into what \u2019 s known as a \u201c death spiral , \u201d in which healthy people flee the individual health insurance market en masse , leaving the remaining customers to just be less healthy or older people , who \u2019 d then face huge premiums . They \u2019 d get some help from Obamacare \u2019 s insurance subsidies , which would remain and cap premiums as a share of income for low- and middle-income people . But even that might not be enough to make the plans affordable . And if enough people quit , then insurers could stop offering plans in some areas altogether .\nSome of the healthy and younger people , in turn , would then grow older and sicker . Some would get potentially fatal illnesses , and without insurance they wouldn \u2019 t be able to recover . That \u2019 s where that 15,600 deaths figure becomes relevant .\nThis is Obamacare repeal lite , and it \u2019 s a serious threat to the safety net\nRepublicans like to argue that repealing the mandate doesn \u2019 t take health coverage away from anyone . It just lets people choose ! Medicaid expansion and insurance subsidies would remain for anyone who wants them . Then-Sen. Barack Obama unwittingly laid the groundwork for this argument in 2007 and 2008 , when he opposed the mandate in debates with Hillary Clinton and insisted that universal coverage was possible without it .\nAnd , indeed , some health care analysts have argued you can create other incentives to ensure healthy people still sign up . Paul Starr , a medical sociologist at Princeton , has proposed barring people who decline health coverage from government health subsidies for five years ; people would have a choice , but the choice would have huge negative consequences . Republicans in Congress have proposed replacing the mandate with a surcharge you \u2019 d pay upon returning to health insurance .\nHere \u2019 s the thing , though : If you replaced the mandate with something that actually worked , that actually succeeded at getting as many or more people to sign up for coverage , the CBO would score that as not saving money , perhaps even as costing money . Repealing the mandate saves money by reducing health coverage . Less health coverage means less Medicaid and insurance subsidy spending by the federal government . If you replace the mandate with something effective , coverage levels stay the same , no money is saved , and the mandate can \u2019 t be repealed to pay for tax cuts .\nPut another way : Either the Senate tax bill kicks millions of people off insurance or it costs $ 338 billion more than its supporters say it does .\nReasonable people can argue about whether the 13 million figure is too high ( or too low ) .
