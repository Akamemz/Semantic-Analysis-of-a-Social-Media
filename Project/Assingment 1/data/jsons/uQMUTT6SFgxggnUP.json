'' Lately , that subtitle seems prophetic and ubiquitous . As we watch Big Tech crush diversity of thought and promote one-sided radical disinformation , it seems that more and more people are recognizing that they live in an information bubble strictly controlled by a few billionaires and a handful of media outlets .\nGoogle and its brethren have become the de facto Ministry of Truth , which ( as fans of George Orwell \u2019 s \u201c Nineteen Eighty-Four \u201d already know ) is in fact the Ministry of Lies and Propaganda . Due to congressional malfeasance , Google is the leviathan unleashed without any oversight on a world of unsuspecting information consumers , many of whom assume that what they read is reliable . In fact , it is filtered through a complex network of algorithms and policies that eliminate nuance and subtlety and substitute far-left talking points and distortions .\nAs Orwell \u2019 s dystopian novel explains , \u201c Who controls the past controls the future : who controls the present controls the past. \u201d Of course , in \u201c Nineteen Eighty-Four \u201d it is the monolithic Party that exercises unilateral control over thought , history and behavior . But in our modern world of \u201c Twenty Twenty , \u201d the government has been supplanted from the role of Big Brother by Google , the gatekeeper of all knowledge and the arbiter of all opinion .\nGoogle \u2019 s power , aided and abetted by the federal government , is not just derived from its virtual monopoly on search results , but also by its control of almost all Internet advertising through its AdSense program . Websites , therefore , have become dependent on Google for their continued existence , and if Google removes their revenue stream , they have no choice but to buckle under to the Mother Ship \u2019 s demands or to go under altogether . What \u2019 s worse is that Google is answerable to no one . It makes its own rules and there is no effective right of appeal .\nLast week , after being goaded by a branch of NBC , Google demonetized ZeroHedge and threatened to do the same to The Federalist because of the way they characterized Black Lives Matter , or maybe because they allowed unrestricted comment on their websites . ( We don \u2019 t know for sure because when you are as powerful as Google , you don \u2019 t have to explain yourself . ) The Federalist , one of the most important conservative opinion and news sites on the internet , removed its comment section altogether in order to appease the beast that is Google . ZeroHedge , another conservative outlet , has not been so lucky . It has been sent to digital Siberia , where one assumes the rations are limited to bread and water .\nOn Wednesday , Sen. Josh Hawley introduced legislation to restrict the ability of Internet platforms to censor such conservative voices , or for that matter any voices , with impunity . Hawley 's bill , called the Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act , would require companies to undertake a \u201c duty of good faith \u201d in order to receive the liability protections of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act . If they don \u2019 t maintain a neutral platform or if they exercise \u201c selective enforcement of policies , \u201d they wouldn \u2019 t qualify for protection from lawsuits .\n\u201c For too long , Big Tech companies like Twitter , Google and Facebook have used their power to silence political speech from conservatives without any recourse for users , \u201d Hawley said . \u201c Congress should act to ensure bad actors are not given a free pass to censor and silence their opponents . \u201d\nHawley is one of a handful of conservatives who understand what is at stake . Another is Tucker Carlson , who continues to risk his career on Fox News by speaking out against the powers that be . On Tuesday , Carlson was one of the first to call out Google for its latest assault on freedom of speech . Carlson , who in 2017 called Google \u201c the most powerful company in the history of the world , \u201d doubled down on the threat that Google posed to not just free speech but free thought :\n\u201c Suddenly your opinions qualify as crimes . Dare to say what you think at work , and you will be fired in the middle of a recession . Write what you think online , and you will be silenced by the Big Tech companies . So , you keep your views to yourself . You have no choice . A lot of Americans are doing that right now . They 're staying quiet . And of course , that 's the point of censorship \u2014 to keep people isolated and alone to prevent a consensus from forming that challenges those in charge . If you 're forced to shut up , they can do what they want to you and your country . That 's why they do it . \u201d\nAs Carlson said in 2017 , \u201c To an unprecedented extent , Google controls reality . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s true , but Google is not alone . Facebook last week banned an ad placed by the Trump campaign because it included a red triangle as a reference to antifa , the leftist hate group that has fomented violence in many of our major cities .
