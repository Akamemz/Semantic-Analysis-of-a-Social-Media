The courier \u2019 s heavy investment has turned Memphis International Airport , just minutes from Elvis \u2019 s Graceland estate , into the world \u2019 s busiest air cargo hub after dark . Each night , as the final commercial passengers stream through the airport \u2019 s terminals , FedEx jets start roaring onto the tarmac . From about 10:30 p.m. to daybreak , about 160 planes land and take off , shuttling 1.8 million packages in and out of the hub through 42 miles of conveyor belts .\nBoth a friend and foe for UPS and FedEx is Amazon , which is progressively upending how consumers shop during the holiday season . Amazon has been investing heavily in its warehouses , and it unveiled an army of squat robots called Kiva this summer to prepare goods for delivery .\nThe online retailer , the world \u2019 s largest , is building its own sorting centers to speed deliveries , and it also introduced a one-hour delivery service in New York , steps that could eventually make Amazon a competitor to FedEx and UPS .
