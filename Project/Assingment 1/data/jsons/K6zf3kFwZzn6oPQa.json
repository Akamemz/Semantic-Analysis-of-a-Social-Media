Ted Cruz says lawmakers should be wary of handing the commander in chief a \u201c blanket authorization \u201d to wage war .\nSen. Marco Rubio is open to sending ground troops into the region if that \u2019 s what it takes to win . But Sen. Rand Paul says he \u2019 s \u201c not eager \u201d to send troops back to the Middle East , and he \u2019 s demanding that Congress set a one-year timeline for a war authorization to expire .\nAs Congress prepares to dive into its most politically charged debate in years over war and peace , the four Republican senators considering 2016 presidential bids are staking out diverging positions on how much power to give Obama \u2014 a fight that is bound to drive the argument on which candidate would best defend the U.S. from threats abroad . The GOP presidential field consists of roughly two dozen potential candidates , but these are the only four who can help shape the proposed Authorization for Use of Military Force and will have to vote on it .\nIf they vote yes and the war campaign goes poorly , they could own the consequences , as Hillary Clinton did after backing the Iraq War authorization in 2002 . If they oppose it , they could be castigated as weak on defense at a time when military and political leaders are calling for partisan posturing to be put aside \u2014 much like the congressional Democrats who saw their presidential hopes dented after voting against the 1991 Gulf War .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s going to show divisions , \u201d Graham said , \u201c between those who understand what it takes to contain the threat and defeat the threat versus those who are just stumbling around trying to find a political sweet spot . \u201d\nForeign policy has already become a political flash point for 2016 . Rubio argues that his Senate experience sets him apart from governors who have little background on foreign affairs . Graham , who serves in the Air Force Reserve , would heavily promote his hawkish national security views and his calls for an assertive U.S. presence in the world . Cruz , a likely candidate , is positioning himself between the neoconservative and isolationist wings of the party , while Paul has long sought a less aggressive American role overseas .\nIn interviews with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , all four senators laid out their views on the AUMF , showcasing the divide that is about to become more pronounced on the campaign trail .\nPaul is clearly aiming for younger and war-weary primary voters eager to see the next president exercise restraint before sending troops into harm \u2019 s way .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not for declaring a worldwide war where I can send troops anywhere anytime , \u201d said Paul , the libertarian former congressman \u2019 s son , who won his first foray into public office in 2010 . \u201c I \u2019 m not for sending 100,000 troops back to the Middle East . \u201d\nLast fall , Paul offered an AUMF proposal that would have declared war against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant , with some caveats . It would rescind existing war authorities for Afghanistan and Iraq approved after the Sept. 11 attacks ; it would limit the use of ground forces to intelligence-gathering , attacks on high-value targets and situations where U.S. citizens face an imminent threat ; and it would expire one year after enactment .\n\u201c I \u2019 m willing to give my opinion about what I believe ; the question is whether or not it resonates , \u201d Paul , a Kentucky Republican , said when asked how his views would play with GOP primary voters . \u201c But I think , frankly , that there are many in the Republican Party who are not eager to send ground forces back into the Middle East . \u201d\n\u201c The idea that you would declare war for one year and not use any ground troops probably is not going to be taught at West Point , \u201d said Graham , who was elected to his seat in 2002 .\nWhile Paul calls the 2003 invasion of Iraq \u201c a mistake \u201d that spawned chaos in the region , Graham , a staunch supporter of the war effort , said the Kentuckian \u201c just doesn \u2019 t get radical Islam . \u201d\n\u201c The isolationist , libertarian wing of the party really believes we brought this upon ourselves , \u201d said Graham , who has been back to Afghanistan four times over the past two years for Air Force Reserve duty . \u201c The fact of the matter is : This is a religious war . \u201d\nOn the AUMF , Graham said he \u2019 s opposed to setting conditions because he \u2019 s not \u201c into restricting our ability to defeat ISIL . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to restrict the commander in chief \u2019 s options , \u201d said Graham , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee . \u201c You can \u2019 t have 535 commanders in chief . \u201d\nRubio , a Florida Republican elected in 2010 , has foreign policy views that more closely align with Graham \u2019 s . And he \u2019 ll have the first chance to square off with Paul , since both men serve on the Foreign Relations Committee , which will get the initial crack in shaping the use-of-force resolution .\nWhile Paul \u2019 s proposal last year limited the scope of the fight to ISIL , Rubio said the language should be broader because the U.S. faces a \u201c rapidly evolving conflict \u201d in which the militant organization could \u201c quickly morph into something different over a period of time , as we \u2019 ve already seen happen . \u201d\n\u201c We shouldn \u2019 t be dictating in legislation : You can do this but you can \u2019 t do that , you can go here but you can \u2019 t go there , \u201d Rubio said of an AUMF . \u201c I think it should be broad enough to allow him latitude on choosing the tactics , the method , the timing , etc . \u2014 that \u2019 s not just President Obama , it \u2019 s future commanders in chief . \u201d\nAsked about sending ground troops into the region , Rubio said , \u201c I \u2019 m open to doing whatever it takes to defeat them. \u201d He added that the president must make a \u201c a cost-benefit analysis \u201d to determine whether U.S. troops would fight alongside Iraqi forces or if they would face threats from militias backed by Iran .\n\u201c Ultimately , I think we need to do what we can within the realm of the responsible to defeat them , \u201d he said .\nWith their perches on the Foreign Relations Committee , both Paul and Rubio have had a series of high-profile and bitter splits , including over Cuba policy , foreign aid to Egypt and arming moderate Syrian rebels .
