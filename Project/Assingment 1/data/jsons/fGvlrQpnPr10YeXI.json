    "content": "It \u2019 s quite an evolution for the former governor . During his presidential candidacy last year , Perry went further than nearly anyone in condemning Trump , calling the television personality \u201c a barking carnival act \u201d who represents a \u201c cancer on conservatism , \u201d and who would send the Republican Party to the \u201c graveyard. \u201d Less than a year later , however , the Texan started hinting that he was looking for a job on Trump \u2019 s team.But what \u2019 s especially noteworthy about this story isn \u2019 t just Perry \u2019 s likely role in Trump \u2019 s cabinet , but the specific post to which he \u2019 ll be nominated.I suspect much of the country remembers Perry \u2019 s \u201c oops \u201d moment . During his first presidential campaign , the Texas Republican participated in a debate in November 2011 in which he tried to list the cabinet agencies he \u2019 d eliminate if elected . He mentioned the Departments of Commerce and Education , but couldn \u2019 t remember that he also wanted to scrap the Department of Energy.Perry , in other words , will now lead a federal agency he doesn \u2019 t think should exist . And as we discussed the other day , during Trump \u2019 s transition process , this keeps happening.Jeff Sessions is Trump \u2019 s choice for Attorney General despite his record of hostility towards civil rights.Betsy DeVos is Trump \u2019 s choice for Education Secretary despite her opposition towards public schools.Ben Carson is Trump \u2019 s choice for Housing and Urban Development Secretary despite his hostility towards the Fair Housing Act.Tom Price is Trump \u2019 s choice for Health and Human Services Secretary despite his opposition to programs that provide health security to millions of Americans.Andrew Puzder is Trump \u2019 s choice for Labor Secretary despite his contempt for labor laws.Scott Pruitt is Trump \u2019 s choice to lead the EPA despite Pruitt vow to fight the agency \u2019 s policy agenda.This is not an encouraging pattern . * Postscript : I \u2019 ve seen some suggestions that because Perry was governor of a state with a lot of oil drilling , the Energy Department is a logical choice .
