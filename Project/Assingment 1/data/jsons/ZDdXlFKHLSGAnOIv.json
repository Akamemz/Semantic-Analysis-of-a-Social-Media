To qualify for the third debate , a candidate must reach 2 percent in at least four national or early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations and must have at least 130,000 unique donors , including at least 400 donors in at least 20 states . Information released by campaigns is used to determine whether a candidate has hit the donor threshold . If a campaign announced it had reached 130,000 donors but did not say whether it had at least 400 donors in 20 states , we assumed that it had met the latter requirement as well .

Since our last update , former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro became the 10th candidate to qualify for the stage when he got his fourth poll on Aug. 20 .

Steyer announced earlier this month that he had accrued 130,000 individual donors , and he has already spent millions on digital and television ads , primarily in early-voting states like Iowa and South Carolina . So it \u2019 s perhaps unsurprising that all three of Steyer \u2019 s qualifying polls are from those two early states while he has yet to register more than 1 percent in a national qualifying poll .\nAs for the candidates that could fall short of making the debate , some , like Gabbard , are displeased with the qualification rules .

Among her campaign \u2019 s complaints are that the DNC \u2019 s rules about which polls will be counted aren \u2019 t very consistent : Some highly-rated polling organizations were left off the DNC \u2019 s list , and some surveys were excluded despite being sponsored by notable media organizations . For example , state-level polls conducted by online pollster YouGov on behalf of CBS News have been counted \u2014 which is approved by the DNC \u2014 while national YouGov polls sponsored by The Economist have not .\nWilliamson announced last week that she had surpassed the donor threshold for the third debate , and today \u2019 s Monmouth poll gave her one qualifying poll .
