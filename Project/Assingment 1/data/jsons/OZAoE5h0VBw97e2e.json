Neal , Massachusetts Democrat , sent his demand to the IRS for the president \u2019 s tax returns from 2013 through 2018 . He also asked for returns from eight Trump entities , including his revocable trust and his golf course in Bedminster , New Jersey .\nMr. Neal said his committee is thinking about passing legislation on government audits of presidents and therefore has the right under its oversight powers to demand to see the information .\nHe set an April 10 deadline for the IRS to comply .\nMr. Trump , saying he is under audit , has repeatedly rebuffed calls to make his tax returns public . He signaled Wednesday that he is likely to battle Mr. Neal \u2019 s demand .\nSEE ALSO : Dems approve subpoena for Mueller report , investigative files\n\u201c Until such time as I \u2019 m not under audit , I would not be inclined to do it , \u201d he told reporters at the White House .\nMeanwhile , the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to give Chairman Jerrold Nadler , New York Democrat , the power to issue a subpoena to demand that the Justice Department turn over the special counsel \u2019 s report into Mr. Trump and Russian interference in the 2016 election , as well as all investigative files that Mr. Mueller developed .\nThat expansive subpoena was joined by other subpoenas for five former Trump White House officials , including onetime chief of staff Reince Priebus , former top attorney Donald McGahn and former chief strategist Steve Bannon .\nThe 24-17 committee vote did not issue the subpoenas , but it gave permission to send them at any time to Mr. Nadler , who would oversee any impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump .\nThe subpoena would demand access to classified documents and to information that stemmed from the grand jury that Mr. Mueller relied upon during his investigation .\nUnder the law , grand jury proceedings are supposed to be sealed , though a court can unseal them .\n\u201c We need these materials to fulfill our constitutional obligation , \u201d said Mr. Nadler , adding that Congress received classified data and grand jury information during impeachment-style investigations into President Nixon in the 1970s and President Clinton in the 1990s .\nAttorney General William P. Barr said he is planning to release as much of Mr. Mueller \u2019 s final report as possible this month .\nThe materials he isn \u2019 t releasing are supposed to be kept secret under the law , they said , and if Mr. Nadler wants to see those , he will have to go through a long legal battle in the courts asking them to unseal grand jury information .\nRep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin , one of the Republican impeachment managers against Mr. Clinton in the 1990s , said he would join Mr. Nadler in making that request to the courts but added that approving the subpoena now would make no sense .\n\u201c Go to court and let the judge make the decision , \u201d he said .\nMr. Nadler , though , said he wanted to have the subpoena in hand first and then go to court if necessary .\nMr. Nadler was on the other side of the debate in the 1990s , arguing that the Clinton investigation information should not be provided to Congress .
