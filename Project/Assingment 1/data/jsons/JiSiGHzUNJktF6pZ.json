    "content": "Anthony S. Fauci , the nation \u2019 s top infectious-diseases expert , predicted Americans would experience \u201c suffering and death that could be avoided , \u201d as well as additional economic damage , if states ignore federal guidelines , including delaying reopening of most businesses until they see dramatic declines in cases . He also said the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus is probably higher than the 80,000 reported to date .\nFauci \u2019 s comments came during a contentious Senate hearing as lawmakers of both parties pressed him and other federal health officials on whether the country is ready to reopen . The panel \u2019 s chairman and all four witnesses appeared remotely because they all recently came into contact with people with confirmed infections \u2014 a testament to how the virus has transformed life even within the corridors of power .\nSen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , which held the hearing , is self-isolating at home after a staff member tested positive for the virus . Fauci ; Stephen Hahn , head of the Food and Drug Administration ; Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ; and Brett Giroir , an assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services , all testified remotely after coming into contact with a White House aide who tested positive last week .\nIn his first congressional testimony since President Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency on March 13 , Fauci bluntly laid out the dangers of ignoring federal reopening guidelines .\n\u201c If some areas , cities , states or what-have-you , jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently , my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks , \u201d said Fauci , director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . \u201c I have been very clear in my message \u2014 to try , to the best extent possible , to go by the guidelines , which have been very well thought-out and very well-delineated . \u201d\nGiroir , who oversees the U.S. testing strategy , told senators the U.S. could be performing up to 50 million tests a month by September \u2014 but that would still amount to fewer than the 2 million to 3 million tests a day that experts have said is needed to ensure that people returning to work are infection-free .\nThe health officials also warned that a surge of cases in the fall could be especially challenging , when a coronavirus outbreak could coincide with flu season \u2014 in contrast to the president \u2019 s statements that the fall would not be worse . Redfield said the U.S. would need a five-to-10-fold increase in its capability to conduct contact tracing by the fall to identify all the known contacts of someone who tested positive for the virus in order to prevent an outbreak . He warned that individuals needed to remain vigilant in practicing social distancing measures for the next several months .\nFauci at one point contradicted statements made last week by Trump , when the president proclaimed the virus would disappear in coming months even without a vaccine .\n\u201c This is going to go away without a vaccine , \u201d Trump said Friday , adding there could be \u201c flare-ups , \u201d including in the fall , but that covid-19 would go away regardless .\n\u201c That is just not going to happen , \u201d Fauci said of the notion the virus would disappear on its own . \u201c It \u2019 s a highly transmissible virus . It is likely there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will likely get back to us . \u201d\nThe hearing often became combative , with Democrats criticizing Trump \u2019 s response to the pandemic and even Sen. Mitt Romney ( R-Utah ) scolding Giroir at one point for politicizing testing numbers . Romney said Giroir \u201c celebrated \u201d the fact that the U.S. is conducting more tests per capita than South Korea in a Rose Garden news conference on Monday , but ignored that South Korea had far greater testing capacity than the U.S. at the beginning of its outbreak and has only had 300 deaths .\n\u201c I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever , \u201d Romney said .\nSen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) , who recovered after becoming infected with covid-19 earlier this year , questioned aspects of the scientific consensus during his questioning time , and in a combative exchange , told Fauci he was not the \u201c end-all \u201d for coronavirus decisions . Paul asserted that schools could reopen widely in the fall because the virus appears to be less dangerous in children .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not to say this isn \u2019 t deadly , but really , outside of New England , we \u2019 ve had a relatively benign course for this virus nationwide , \u201d Paul said . \u201c And I think the one-size-fits-all , that we \u2019 re going to have a national strategy and nobody is going to go to school , is kind of ridiculous . We really ought to be doing it school district by school district , and the power needs to be dispersed because people make wrong predictions . \u201d\nAfter asking to respond , Fauci told Paul , \u201c I \u2019 ve never made myself out to be the end-all. \u201d He warned that while the numbers indicate the pathogen is less dangerous to children than adults and the elderly , \u201c we don \u2019 t know everything about this virus. \u201d He noted a spate of new cases of coronavirus-infected children presenting with a \u201c very strange inflammatory syndrome . \u201d\n\u201c I am very careful and hopefully humble in knowing that I don \u2019 t know everything about this disease , and that \u2019 s why I \u2019 m very reserved in making broad predictions , \u201d Fauci said .\nIn response to repeated questions about when better therapeutics and a vaccine would be available , Fauci dismissed the notion they might be in use by the time schools reopen in the fall .\n\u201c The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far , \u201d he said . \u201c The drug that has shown some degree of efficacy was modest and in hospitalized patients \u201d only , he added , referring to remdesivir , the Gilead antiviral drug that has shown to reduce recovery time for people with covid-19 . But Fauci said that remdesivir alone was not sufficient as a therapeutic .\nAsked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) whether the virus is contained in the U.S. , Fauci chose his words carefully . \u201c I think we are going in the right direction , \u201d he said . \u201c But the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak . \u201d\nFauci says he doesn \u2019 t have a confrontational relationship with Trump Sen. Kelly Loeffler ( R-Ga. ) , the last senator in line to ask questions , sought assurances from all four witnesses that they don \u2019 t have a confrontational relationship with Trump \u2014 a notion that she said has been advanced by the news media and some of her colleagues . \u201c There is certainly not a confrontational relationship between me and the president , \u201d Fauci said . \u201c I give advice , opinion based on evidence-based scientific information . He hears that . He respects it . He gets opinions from a variety of other people , but in no way , in my experience over the last several months , has there been any confrontational relationship between us. \u201d Redfield , Hahn and Giroir all gave similar answers . \u201c We have a very productive working relationship with each other , \u201d Giroir said . Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , the committee \u2019 s chairman , adjourned the hearing shortly before 1:30 p.m. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic .

Mitt Romney ( R-Utah ) criticized the Trump administration \u2019 s news conference Monday heralding its increased testing capacity . \u201c I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever , \u201d Romney told the health officials assembled at the hearing . Trump and other administration officials Monday regularly pointed to the fact that the United States was conducting more testing per capita than South Korea , which has been widely praised for its early and aggressive testing efforts that helped stem its outbreak . Romney said U.S. officials were ignoring the fact that South Korea had far higher testing capacity than the United States early in its outbreak , while the United States was \u201c treading water in February. \u201d South Korea has had fewer than 300 covid-19 deaths . Romney also asked why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2019 s data-collection system was so outdated and the agency \u2019 s director what Congress needed to do to help modernize the system . He also asked coronavirus task force member Anthony S. Fauci whether it was a \u201c long shot \u201d to hope for a vaccine that would be ready within a year or two . \u201c It \u2019 s definitely not a long shot , \u201d Fauci replied . \u201c It \u2019 s clearly much more likely than not that somewhere in that time frame , we will get a vaccine for the virus. \u201d By Yasmeen Abutaleb AD AD\nFDA commissioner pledges remdesivir distribution will be based on need Trump administration officials pledged to be guided in their distribution of the coronavirus treatment drug remdesivir by evidence of outbreaks and patient need , responding at the Senate hearing Tuesday to an uproar over the uneven distribution of the treatment . Doctors last week complained of a haphazard and opaque process for distributing the limited supplies of the experimental Gilead Sciences drug in the week after the Food and Drug Administration permitted its distribution under an emergency use authorization . Over the weekend , the Department of Health and Human Services disclosed that seven states had received the drug in a first wave , and it added five more states to the list . Maine was not on either list , which drew concern at the Senate hearing Tuesday from Sen. Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) . \u201c I \u2019 m concerned that hospitalized patients in Maine will have little or no ability to be treated with this promising therapeutic for the foreseeable future , \u201d Collins said . \u201c As this and more therapeutics and ultimately a vaccine come onto the marketplace , how can these allocations and distribution issues be resolved so that patient care is not delayed and so it doesn \u2019 t depend on which state you live in , whether you are going to get access to these treatments , and ultimately a vaccine ? '' she asked Trump officials . Hahn appeared to acknowledge problems in the early distribution of remdesivir and said HHS officials had established a system of sending the drug to areas with the most hospitalized patients who are eligible to receive the drug . \u201c I think we can all agree upon the fact that we have learned a lot of lessons on the remdesivir situation , \u201d Hahn said . Moving forward , the drug will be sent to areas based the size of outbreaks and numbers of hospitalized patients , he said . HHS said in a weekend news release that an initial allocation was sent to Indiana , Massachusetts , New Jersey , New York , Rhode Island , Tennessee and Virginia . It said it added Connecticut , Illinois , Iowa , Maryland and Michigan beginning May 7 . It said Gilead has pledged to provide enough donated drug to treat 78,000 patients in the United States over the next six weeks . By Christopher Rowland AD AD\n\u2018 The time for magical thinking is over , \u2019 Sen. Warren says Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) , like most Democrats , used her questioning time Tuesday to attack the Trump administration without directly criticizing the nonpolitical officials appearing before the committee . She began her round by asking Anthony S. Fauci a simple question : \u201c Do we have the coronavirus contained ? \u201d He gave a nuanced answer : In some places , like New York and New Orleans , rates of infection and hospitalization have started to diminish , he said , but in other places they have spiked \u2014 contributing to an overall flattening of the national infection curve . \u201c I think we \u2019 re going in the right direction , but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak , \u201d Fauci said . Warren went on to question Fauci about the risks of a possible fall resurgence of the virus and whether the federal government would be prepared to handle it . Fauci said his previous warnings continue to hold but that current administration projections are that there will be sufficient testing and health system capacity to handle it . \u201c If we do not respond in an adequate way when the fall comes \u2026 then we run the risk of having a resurgence , \u201d he said . \u201c I would hope by that point in time in the fall that we have more than enough to respond adequate . But if we don \u2019 t , there will be problems. \u201d \u201c I appreciate your hope , \u201d Warren said . \u201c The president needs to stop pretending that if he just ignores bad news , it will go away , \u201d she continued . \u201c It won \u2019 t . The time for magical thinking is over , here . President Trump must acknowledge that the federal response has been insufficient and that more people are dying as a result. \u201d She did not ask Fauci to respond . By Mike DeBonis AD AD\nMurphy presses health officials for more detailed guidance on reopening Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn. ) pressed health officials over whether the Trump administration would release more detailed guidance to aid states beginning to reopen , adding that the guidance so far provided is \u201c criminally vague. \u201d Redfield declined to commit to a specific timetable on when the CDC might issue more detailed guidance . Several media outlets reported last week that the White House rejected CDC guidance because it was overly prescriptive . \u201c You work for a president who is frankly undermining our efforts to comply with the guidance you gave us , \u201d Murphy told the health officials . \u201c The guidance you gave us is criminally vague . The plan to reopen America was to be followed by more nuanced , detailed guidance. \u201d Murphy also asked the health officials whether they were continuing to draw a salary while they self-isolated at home due to exposure to a confirmed coronavirus case . Fauci said he was at the White House on Monday and could return to his NIH office on Tuesday , despite his recent exposure to Vice President Pence \u2019 s press secretary , who tested positive for the virus last week . By Yasmeen Abutaleb AD AD\nSen. Paul spars with Fauci over immunity , school openings Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) , who recovered after becoming infected with the novel coronavirus earlier this year , questioned aspects of the scientific consensus surrounding the pandemic during his questioning time \u2014 asserting for instance that there is compelling evidence that recovered covid-19 patients are at least temporarily immune from reinfection and that schools could reopen widely in the fall . Paul said U.S. policymakers should consider following the example of Sweden . Schools did not widely close there as they did in the United States , yet Sweden \u2019 s mortality rates remained below other European countries where schools did close . \u201c I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s anybody arguing that what happened in Sweden is an unacceptable result , \u201d he said , adding that \u201c we never really reached any sort of pandemic levels \u201d in Kentucky and other rural states . \u201c It \u2019 s not to say this isn \u2019 t deadly , but really , outside of New England , we \u2019 ve had a relatively benign course for this virus nationwide , \u201d Paul said . \u201c And I think the one-size-fits-all , that we \u2019 re going to have a national strategy and nobody is going to go to school , is kind of ridiculous . We really ought to be doing it school district by school district , and the power needs to be dispersed because people make wrong predictions. \u201d Fauci asked to respond , and then warned that while the numbers indicate that the virus is less dangerous to children than adults and the elderly , \u201c we don \u2019 t know everything about this virus. \u201d He noted that there are now cases of coronavirus-infected children presenting with a \u201c very strange inflammatory syndrome. \u201d \u201c I am very careful and hopefully humble in knowing that I don \u2019 t know everything about this disease , and that \u2019 s why I \u2019 m very reserved in making broad predictions , \u201d Fauci said . Regarding immunity , Fauci told Paul that he agreed that it was \u201c very likely \u201d that there is a degree of protection for those who have recovered from covid-19 . But the level of antibodies necessary for protection and the duration of that protection remain unknown , he said . \u201c You can make a reasonable assumption that it would be protective , but natural history studies over a period of months to years will then tell you definitively if that \u2019 s the case , \u201d he said . By Mike DeBonis AD AD\nFauci says U.S. death toll is probably higher than the 80,000 reported Fauci said the U.S. death toll is probably higher than the 80,000 deaths officially reported , and added that the virus will not disappear in the fall or winter , contradicting President Trump \u2019 s claims last week that the virus would go away even without a vaccine . \u201c I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests : This is going to go away without a vaccine , \u201d Trump said Friday , adding that there could be \u201c flare-ups , \u201d including in the fall , but that covid-19 would go away regardless . \u201c That is just not going to happen , \u201d Fauci said of the idea that the virus would disappear on its own . \u201c It \u2019 s a highly transmissible virus . It is likely there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will likely get back to us. \u201d Fauci also agreed with Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , who said many experts have said that the death toll is higher than what \u2019 s been reported . Fauci pointed to New York City , where he said the health-care system faced an extraordinary challenge during the peak of the outbreak , and people could have died at home of coronavirus without being officially counted . Several administration officials , including Trump , have questioned whether the death toll is inflated . Sanders also pressed officials on whether a vaccine would be available to everyone regardless of income if and when it becomes available . \u201c I will certainly advocate that anyone be able to access the vaccine , \u201d Giroir said in response to Sanders \u2019 s question .

By Yasmeen Abutaleb AD AD\nPremature openings could be dangerous , Fauci says Pressed by Sen. Patty Murray ( D-Wash. ) , Fauci warned that states that fail to obey federal reopening guidelines and move too quickly to restart their economies would put themselves at risk of new outbreaks that could be hard to control . \u201c If some areas , cities , states or what-have-you jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently , my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks , \u201d said Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . \u201c I have been very clear in my message \u2014 to try to the best extent possible to go by the guidelines , which have been very well thought out and very well delineated. \u201d Any loosening of restrictions , Fauci added , would lead to new cases , but those new cases could be manageable so long as states have the proper infrastructure in place . \u201c It \u2019 s the ability and the capability of responding to those cases with good identification , isolation and contact tracing [ that ] will determine whether you can continue to go forward as you try to reopen America , \u201d he said . Murray also pressed Brett Giroir , the federal official overseeing coronavirus testing efforts , on a strategic testing plan required to be submitted later this month to Congress under the terms of recent legislation . Giroir said that the administration had numerical targets in place for testing in each state but cautioned that they stand to be revised based on the course of the virus \u2019 s spread . \u201c Yes , there will be targets , \u201d he said . \u201c The targets will need to change based on the evidence that we see . \u2026 So we really just need to be very humble about this . We need to look at the data. \u201d By Mike DeBonis AD AD\nHahn : Evolving clinical picture of virus affects FDA \u2019 s search for treatments Hahn said new information about the virus and how it manifests itself in the body affects the \u201c endpoints \u201d the FDA is looking for in new drugs to treat covid-19 . For example , the agency is looking at evolving symptoms , such as blood clots \u2014 which weren \u2019 t immediately obvious at the beginning of the pandemic . He also said the agency is working with other agencies to ensure that there will be enough supplies , including syringes and needles to distribute vaccines , once they are available . By Laurie McGinley\nFDA head Hahn : Agency is working to \u2018 bridge the gap \u2019 to a vaccine through treatments Hahn , head of the Food and Drug Administration , said the agency is working to \u201c bridge the gap \u201d between now and when a vaccine might be available through therapeutics . The focus , he said , is speeding development and review of antiviral and antibody drugs as well as convalescent plasma products . Hahn said the agency has created an emergency program to conduct such reviews and is using \u201c every available authority and flexibility that \u2019 s appropriate. \u201d On testing , he said that the agency has worked with more than 500 developers who have submitted or said they would submit applications for FDA authorization for covid-19 tests \u2014 including some involving technologies never used before . The agency also is cracking down on fraudulent tests and trying to provide more clarity to the public on which tests have been authorized by the FDA and which ones haven \u2019 t , he said . By Laurie McGinley\nFauci : \u2018 A bridge too far \u2019 to expect treatments , vaccine in time for fall school semester Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , the panel \u2019 s chairman , began the questioning by asking Fauci whether college and school administrators could feel safe welcoming students back to campus in the fall , and the likelihood of a treatment or vaccine becoming available by then . \u201c The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far , \u201d Fauci said . \u201c The drug that has shown some degree of efficacy was modest and was in hospitalized patients. \u201d Fauci said whether students will feel safe returning to school will also largely depend on testing capabilities . Giroir said he expects the country to have the capacity to conduct 25 million to 30 million tests a month by the fall , which could allow schools to have a surveillance strategy in place to quickly identify and isolate confirmed covid-19 cases .

By Yasmeen Abutaleb\nGiroir : 40 million to 50 million tests per month by September Giroir , the federal official overseeing coronavirus testing efforts , said the nation will be able to conduct more tests for the novel coronavirus in the coming months , a critical step to reopening the country . \u201c By September \u2026 we project that our nation will be capable of performing 40 to 50 million tests per month , \u201d Giroir told the committee . The Trump administration has faced criticism that it is not testing enough Americans , with health experts arguing that far more testing is necessary . Trump has been dismissive about the need for testing , calling it \u201c somewhat overrated \u201d last week . On Monday , the president claimed that his administration is besting the world in testing and that it will help states expand such efforts , which are a key element of lifting the safety restrictions that have shuttered much of the economy since March . Trump \u2019 s claims about U.S. testing benchmarks do not account for what health experts have criticized as the slow pace of testing capability in the United States this spring , a delay that some say contributed to the rapid spread of the virus , the mounting death toll and uncertainty about the way forward . By Donna Cassata\nCDC director : \u2018 We \u2019 re not out of the woods yet \u2019 CDC Director Robert Redfield told the Senate committee that social distancing remains \u201c imperative \u201d for Americans as public health authorities continue battling the pandemic . \u201c It \u2019 s important to emphasize that we \u2019 re not out of the woods yet , \u201d Redfield said in his opening statement , adding that the battle could continue for months . \u201c We need to stay vigilant with social distancing . It remains an imperative. \u201d Redfield deemed the pandemic \u201c the most serious public health crisis in more than a century \u201d and detailed the CDC \u2019 s efforts to combat it , including expert assistance to state health authorities , disease surveillance and testing and contact tracing strategy . But he also sounded an alarm that the nation \u2019 s public health resources have been insufficient to meet the challenge that covid-19 has posed . \u201c We need to rebuild our nation \u2019 s public health infrastructure : data and data analytics , public health laboratory resilience and our nation \u2019 s public health workforce , \u201d he said . \u201c Now is the time to put it in place for the generations to come , not only for the public health system that our nation needs , but for the public health system our nation deserves. \u201d By Mike DeBonis\nFauci gives overview of covid-19 vaccine , therapeutic progress in opening statements In his much-anticipated opening remarks , Fauci gave senators an update on potential drugs and vaccines that could treat covid-19 . While several senators will look to Fauci for an honest assessment of the administration \u2019 s response to the crisis and whether the country is ready to reopen , Fauci kept his opening remarks focused on the search for medical treatments for coronavirus patients . He said remdesivir , the drug that showed some efficacy in treating covid-19 and has been distributed to several states , had only a \u201c modest result \u201d and that researchers hope to find a more effective treatment , either through a combination of drugs or through another medication altogether . Fauci also told senators that there were eight covid vaccines in clinical development , and that the NIH has been collaborating with numerous pharmaceutical companies in various stages of development . He said the agency hoped to know how successful a vaccine candidate may be in late fall . Fauci again stressed that a vaccine was at least a year away , at best , and that certain vaccines could have negative consequences . By Yasmeen Abutaleb\nRemote appearances , social distancing as committee questions top federal health officials Senators wore masks and sat six feet apart Tuesday morning in a cavernous Capitol Hill hearing room as they questioned top federal health officials about the coronavirus pandemic . Some senators , most notably Chairman Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) and top Democrat Patty Murray ( Wash. ) participated remotely from home . Murray , whose state had some of the first cases of the disease , criticized the Trump administration \u2019 s response . \u201c One thing that \u2019 s abundantly clear , we need dramatically more testing . It \u2019 s unacceptable that we still don \u2019 t have a national strategic plan to make sure testing is free , fast and everywhere , \u201d she said . More than a half-dozen senators participated in the hearing in person . By Donna Cassata\nSen. Alexander : \u2018 Almost all of us ... underestimated this virus \u2019 In his opening statement , committee Chairman Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) struck two notes : first , that coronavirus testing needs to be greatly expanded over the coming months to reopen the American economy , and second , warning against political gamesmanship as Democratic criticism of the Trump administration mounts . \u201c Before we spend too much time finger pointing , I would like to suggest that almost all of us \u2026 underestimated this virus , \u201d he said , according to prepared remarks . \u201c Underestimated how contagious it would be . How it can travel silently without causing symptoms . How it can be especially deadly among certain segments of the population. \u201d Alexander noted that the federal government prepared over the past 20 years for a pandemic and other public health threats . But he said Washington had \u201c become preoccupied with other important things . '' \u201c Our collective memory is short , \u201d he said . \u201c Just three months ago the country was consumed with impeaching a president . Now that seems like ancient Roman history. \u201d Now , Alexander said , Congress should start thinking about preparing for the next pandemic \u2014 even amid the scourge of covid-19 : \u201c If there is to be finger pointing , I hope fingers will point in that direction. \u201d Addressing the theme of the hearing \u2014 \u201c Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School \u201d \u2014 Alexander declared that indefinite stay-at-home orders would be unworkable . \u201c There is not enough money available to help all those hurt by a closed economy , \u201d he said . \u201c All roads back to work and back to school lead through testing , tracking , isolation , treatment and vaccines. \u201d Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic .

By Mike DeBonis\nKey senators , witnesses are appearing remotely The Senate hearing will be far different from most on Capitol Hill , with many senators and the four witnesses appearing remotely . Neither the panel \u2019 s chairman , Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , nor its top Democrat , Sen. Patty Murray ( Wash. ) , plan to be in the hearing room , according to aides . Alexander \u2019 s office disclosed that he will self-quarantine in Tennessee for two weeks after an aide tested positive for the novel coronavirus . The four health officials are appearing via video conference after Katie Miller , Vice President Pence \u2019 s press secretary who participated regularly in the administration \u2019 s task force briefings , tested positive for the coronavirus . Even some senators who are in Washington will appear from their offices rather than the hearing room , aides said . Those who arrived early , including Sens . Tim Kaine ( D-Va. ) and Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) , were wearing masks . By Seung Min Kim and John Wagner\nSchumer encourages Fauci to be a \u2018 truth-teller \u2019 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) expressed hope Tuesday that senators would hear from a Fauci who was not \u201c muzzled \u201d by the president during the hearing . \u201c Dr . Fauci is a truth-teller , '' Schumer said during an appearance on CNN . `` That \u2019 s his reputation . It seems he has sort of muted the truth some in the presence of the president . \u2026 He has to tell the whole truth here . The president does not like the truth . He likes a story that helps his own ego on the day he tells it .

    "content_original": "Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-diseases expert, predicted Americans would experience \u201csuffering and death that could be avoided,\u201d as well as additional economic damage, if states ignore federal guidelines, including delaying reopening of most businesses until they see dramatic declines in cases. He also said the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus is probably higher than the 80,000 reported to date.\n\nFauci\u2019s comments came during a contentious Senate hearing as lawmakers of both parties pressed him and other federal health officials on whether the country is ready to reopen. The panel\u2019s chairman and all four witnesses appeared remotely because they all recently came into contact with people with confirmed infections \u2014 a testament to how the virus has transformed life even within the corridors of power.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which held the hearing, is self-isolating at home after a staff member tested positive for the virus. Fauci; Stephen Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration; Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services, all testified remotely after coming into contact with a White House aide who tested positive last week.\n\nIn his first congressional testimony since President Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency on March 13, Fauci bluntly laid out the dangers of ignoring federal reopening guidelines.\n\n\u201cIf some areas, cities, states or what-have-you, jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks,\u201d said Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cI have been very clear in my message \u2014 to try, to the best extent possible, to go by the guidelines, which have been very well thought-out and very well-delineated.\u201d\n\nGiroir, who oversees the U.S. testing strategy, told senators the U.S. could be performing up to 50 million tests a month by September \u2014 but that would still amount to fewer than the 2 million to 3 million tests a day that experts have said is needed to ensure that people returning to work are infection-free.\n\nThe health officials also warned that a surge of cases in the fall could be especially challenging, when a coronavirus outbreak could coincide with flu season \u2014 in contrast to the president\u2019s statements that the fall would not be worse. Redfield said the U.S. would need a five-to-10-fold increase in its capability to conduct contact tracing by the fall to identify all the known contacts of someone who tested positive for the virus in order to prevent an outbreak. He warned that individuals needed to remain vigilant in practicing social distancing measures for the next several months.\n\nFauci at one point contradicted statements made last week by Trump, when the president proclaimed the virus would disappear in coming months even without a vaccine.\n\n\u201cThis is going to go away without a vaccine,\u201d Trump said Friday, adding there could be \u201cflare-ups,\u201d including in the fall, but that covid-19 would go away regardless.\n\n\u201cThat is just not going to happen,\u201d Fauci said of the notion the virus would disappear on its own. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly transmissible virus. It is likely there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will likely get back to us.\u201d\n\nThe hearing often became combative, with Democrats criticizing Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic and even Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) scolding Giroir at one point for politicizing testing numbers. Romney said Giroir \u201ccelebrated\u201d the fact that the U.S. is conducting more tests per capita than South Korea in a Rose Garden news conference on Monday, but ignored that South Korea had far greater testing capacity than the U.S. at the beginning of its outbreak and has only had 300 deaths.\n\n\u201cI find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever,\u201d Romney said.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who recovered after becoming infected with covid-19 earlier this year, questioned aspects of the scientific consensus during his questioning time, and in a combative exchange, told Fauci he was not the \u201cend-all\u201d for coronavirus decisions. Paul asserted that schools could reopen widely in the fall because the virus appears to be less dangerous in children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not to say this isn\u2019t deadly, but really, outside of New England, we\u2019ve had a relatively benign course for this virus nationwide,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I think the one-size-fits-all, that we\u2019re going to have a national strategy and nobody is going to go to school, is kind of ridiculous. We really ought to be doing it school district by school district, and the power needs to be dispersed because people make wrong predictions.\u201d\n\nAfter asking to respond, Fauci told Paul, \u201cI\u2019ve never made myself out to be the end-all.\u201d He warned that while the numbers indicate the pathogen is less dangerous to children than adults and the elderly, \u201cwe don\u2019t know everything about this virus.\u201d He noted a spate of new cases of coronavirus-infected children presenting with a \u201cvery strange inflammatory syndrome.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very careful and hopefully humble in knowing that I don\u2019t know everything about this disease, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m very reserved in making broad predictions,\u201d Fauci said.\n\nIn response to repeated questions about when better therapeutics and a vaccine would be available, Fauci dismissed the notion they might be in use by the time schools reopen in the fall.\n\n\u201cThe idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far,\u201d he said. \u201cThe drug that has shown some degree of efficacy was modest and in hospitalized patients\u201d only, he added, referring to remdesivir, the Gilead antiviral drug that has shown to reduce recovery time for people with covid-19. But Fauci said that remdesivir alone was not sufficient as a therapeutic.\n\nAsked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) whether the virus is contained in the U.S., Fauci chose his words carefully. \u201cI think we are going in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak.\u201d\n\nFind live updates about Fauci\u2019s testimony below.\n\nFauci says he doesn\u2019t have a confrontational relationship with Trump Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), the last senator in line to ask questions, sought assurances from all four witnesses that they don\u2019t have a confrontational relationship with Trump \u2014 a notion that she said has been advanced by the news media and some of her colleagues. \u201cThere is certainly not a confrontational relationship between me and the president,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI give advice, opinion based on evidence-based scientific information. He hears that. He respects it. He gets opinions from a variety of other people, but in no way, in my experience over the last several months, has there been any confrontational relationship between us.\u201d Redfield, Hahn and Giroir all gave similar answers. \u201cWe have a very productive working relationship with each other,\u201d Giroir said.

Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the committee\u2019s chairman, adjourned the hearing shortly before 1:30 p.m. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) criticized the Trump administration\u2019s news conference Monday heralding its increased testing capacity. \u201cI find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever,\u201d Romney told the health officials assembled at the hearing. Trump and other administration officials Monday regularly pointed to the fact that the United States was conducting more testing per capita than South Korea, which has been widely praised for its early and aggressive testing efforts that helped stem its outbreak. Romney said U.S. officials were ignoring the fact that South Korea had far higher testing capacity than the United States early in its outbreak, while the United States was \u201ctreading water in February.\u201d South Korea has had fewer than 300 covid-19 deaths. Romney also asked why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s data-collection system was so outdated and the agency\u2019s director what Congress needed to do to help modernize the system. He also asked coronavirus task force member Anthony S. Fauci whether it was a \u201clong shot\u201d to hope for a vaccine that would be ready within a year or two. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a long shot,\u201d Fauci replied. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly much more likely than not that somewhere in that time frame, we will get a vaccine for the virus.\u201d By Yasmeen Abutaleb AD AD\n\nFDA commissioner pledges remdesivir distribution will be based on need Trump administration officials pledged to be guided in their distribution of the coronavirus treatment drug remdesivir by evidence of outbreaks and patient need, responding at the Senate hearing Tuesday to an uproar over the uneven distribution of the treatment. Doctors last week complained of a haphazard and opaque process for distributing the limited supplies of the experimental Gilead Sciences drug in the week after the Food and Drug Administration permitted its distribution under an emergency use authorization. Over the weekend, the Department of Health and Human Services disclosed that seven states had received the drug in a first wave, and it added five more states to the list. Maine was not on either list, which drew concern at the Senate hearing Tuesday from Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). \u201cI\u2019m concerned that hospitalized patients in Maine will have little or no ability to be treated with this promising therapeutic for the foreseeable future,\u201d Collins said. \u201cAs this and more therapeutics and ultimately a vaccine come onto the marketplace, how can these allocations and distribution issues be resolved so that patient care is not delayed and so it doesn\u2019t depend on which state you live in, whether you are going to get access to these treatments, and ultimately a vaccine?'' she asked Trump officials. Hahn appeared to acknowledge problems in the early distribution of remdesivir and said HHS officials had established a system of sending the drug to areas with the most hospitalized patients who are eligible to receive the drug. \u201cI think we can all agree upon the fact that we have learned a lot of lessons on the remdesivir situation,\u201d Hahn said. Moving forward, the drug will be sent to areas based the size of outbreaks and numbers of hospitalized patients, he said. HHS said in a weekend news release that an initial allocation was sent to Indiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia. It said it added Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland and Michigan beginning May 7. It said Gilead has pledged to provide enough donated drug to treat 78,000 patients in the United States over the next six weeks. By Christopher Rowland AD AD\n\n\u2018The time for magical thinking is over,\u2019 Sen. Warren says Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), like most Democrats, used her questioning time Tuesday to attack the Trump administration without directly criticizing the nonpolitical officials appearing before the committee. She began her round by asking Anthony S. Fauci a simple question: \u201cDo we have the coronavirus contained?\u201d He gave a nuanced answer: In some places, like New York and New Orleans, rates of infection and hospitalization have started to diminish, he said, but in other places they have spiked \u2014 contributing to an overall flattening of the national infection curve. \u201cI think we\u2019re going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak,\u201d Fauci said. Warren went on to question Fauci about the risks of a possible fall resurgence of the virus and whether the federal government would be prepared to handle it. Fauci said his previous warnings continue to hold but that current administration projections are that there will be sufficient testing and health system capacity to handle it. \u201cIf we do not respond in an adequate way when the fall comes \u2026 then we run the risk of having a resurgence,\u201d he said. \u201cI would hope by that point in time in the fall that we have more than enough to respond adequate. But if we don\u2019t, there will be problems.\u201d \u201cI appreciate your hope,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThe president needs to stop pretending that if he just ignores bad news, it will go away,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt won\u2019t. The time for magical thinking is over, here. President Trump must acknowledge that the federal response has been insufficient and that more people are dying as a result.\u201d She did not ask Fauci to respond. By Mike DeBonis AD AD\n\nMurphy presses health officials for more detailed guidance on reopening Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) pressed health officials over whether the Trump administration would release more detailed guidance to aid states beginning to reopen, adding that the guidance so far provided is \u201ccriminally vague.\u201d Redfield declined to commit to a specific timetable on when the CDC might issue more detailed guidance. Several media outlets reported last week that the White House rejected CDC guidance because it was overly prescriptive. \u201cYou work for a president who is frankly undermining our efforts to comply with the guidance you gave us,\u201d Murphy told the health officials. \u201cThe guidance you gave us is criminally vague. The plan to reopen America was to be followed by more nuanced, detailed guidance.\u201d Murphy also asked the health officials whether they were continuing to draw a salary while they self-isolated at home due to exposure to a confirmed coronavirus case. Fauci said he was at the White House on Monday and could return to his NIH office on Tuesday, despite his recent exposure to Vice President Pence\u2019s press secretary, who tested positive for the virus last week. By Yasmeen Abutaleb AD AD\n\nSen. Paul spars with Fauci over immunity, school openings Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who recovered after becoming infected with the novel coronavirus earlier this year, questioned aspects of the scientific consensus surrounding the pandemic during his questioning time \u2014 asserting for instance that there is compelling evidence that recovered covid-19 patients are at least temporarily immune from reinfection and that schools could reopen widely in the fall. Paul said U.S. policymakers should consider following the example of Sweden. Schools did not widely close there as they did in the United States, yet Sweden\u2019s mortality rates remained below other European countries where schools did close. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody arguing that what happened in Sweden is an unacceptable result,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe never really reached any sort of pandemic levels\u201d in Kentucky and other rural states. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say this isn\u2019t deadly, but really, outside of New England, we\u2019ve had a relatively benign course for this virus nationwide,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I think the one-size-fits-all, that we\u2019re going to have a national strategy and nobody is going to go to school, is kind of ridiculous. We really ought to be doing it school district by school district, and the power needs to be dispersed because people make wrong predictions.\u201d Fauci asked to respond, and then warned that while the numbers indicate that the virus is less dangerous to children than adults and the elderly, \u201cwe don\u2019t know everything about this virus.\u201d He noted that there are now cases of coronavirus-infected children presenting with a \u201cvery strange inflammatory syndrome.\u201d \u201cI am very careful and hopefully humble in knowing that I don\u2019t know everything about this disease, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m very reserved in making broad predictions,\u201d Fauci said. Regarding immunity, Fauci told Paul that he agreed that it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that there is a degree of protection for those who have recovered from covid-19. But the level of antibodies necessary for protection and the duration of that protection remain unknown, he said. \u201cYou can make a reasonable assumption that it would be protective, but natural history studies over a period of months to years will then tell you definitively if that\u2019s the case,\u201d he said. By Mike DeBonis AD AD\n\nFauci says U.S. death toll is probably higher than the 80,000 reported Fauci said the U.S. death toll is probably higher than the 80,000 deaths officially reported, and added that the virus will not disappear in the fall or winter, contradicting President Trump\u2019s claims last week that the virus would go away even without a vaccine. \u201cI feel about vaccines like I feel about tests: This is going to go away without a vaccine,\u201d Trump said Friday, adding that there could be \u201cflare-ups,\u201d including in the fall, but that covid-19 would go away regardless. \u201cThat is just not going to happen,\u201d Fauci said of the idea that the virus would disappear on its own. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly transmissible virus. It is likely there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will likely get back to us.\u201d Fauci also agreed with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who said many experts have said that the death toll is higher than what\u2019s been reported. Fauci pointed to New York City, where he said the health-care system faced an extraordinary challenge during the peak of the outbreak, and people could have died at home of coronavirus without being officially counted. Several administration officials, including Trump, have questioned whether the death toll is inflated. Sanders also pressed officials on whether a vaccine would be available to everyone regardless of income if and when it becomes available. \u201cI will certainly advocate that anyone be able to access the vaccine,\u201d Giroir said in response to Sanders\u2019s question.

By Yasmeen Abutaleb AD AD\n\nPremature openings could be dangerous, Fauci says Pressed by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Fauci warned that states that fail to obey federal reopening guidelines and move too quickly to restart their economies would put themselves at risk of new outbreaks that could be hard to control. \u201cIf some areas, cities, states or what-have-you jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks,\u201d said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cI have been very clear in my message \u2014 to try to the best extent possible to go by the guidelines, which have been very well thought out and very well delineated.\u201d Any loosening of restrictions, Fauci added, would lead to new cases, but those new cases could be manageable so long as states have the proper infrastructure in place. \u201cIt\u2019s the ability and the capability of responding to those cases with good identification, isolation and contact tracing [that] will determine whether you can continue to go forward as you try to reopen America,\u201d he said. Murray also pressed Brett Giroir, the federal official overseeing coronavirus testing efforts, on a strategic testing plan required to be submitted later this month to Congress under the terms of recent legislation. Giroir said that the administration had numerical targets in place for testing in each state but cautioned that they stand to be revised based on the course of the virus\u2019s spread. \u201cYes, there will be targets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe targets will need to change based on the evidence that we see. \u2026 So we really just need to be very humble about this. We need to look at the data.\u201d By Mike DeBonis AD AD\n\nHahn: Evolving clinical picture of virus affects FDA\u2019s search for treatments Hahn said new information about the virus and how it manifests itself in the body affects the \u201cendpoints\u201d the FDA is looking for in new drugs to treat covid-19. For example, the agency is looking at evolving symptoms, such as blood clots \u2014 which weren\u2019t immediately obvious at the beginning of the pandemic. He also said the agency is working with other agencies to ensure that there will be enough supplies, including syringes and needles to distribute vaccines, once they are available. By Laurie McGinley\n\nFDA head Hahn: Agency is working to \u2018bridge the gap\u2019 to a vaccine through treatments Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency is working to \u201cbridge the gap\u201d between now and when a vaccine might be available through therapeutics. The focus, he said, is speeding development and review of antiviral and antibody drugs as well as convalescent plasma products. Hahn said the agency has created an emergency program to conduct such reviews and is using \u201cevery available authority and flexibility that\u2019s appropriate.\u201d On testing, he said that the agency has worked with more than 500 developers who have submitted or said they would submit applications for FDA authorization for covid-19 tests \u2014 including some involving technologies never used before. The agency also is cracking down on fraudulent tests and trying to provide more clarity to the public on which tests have been authorized by the FDA and which ones haven\u2019t, he said. By Laurie McGinley\n\nFauci: \u2018A bridge too far\u2019 to expect treatments, vaccine in time for fall school semester Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the panel\u2019s chairman, began the questioning by asking Fauci whether college and school administrators could feel safe welcoming students back to campus in the fall, and the likelihood of a treatment or vaccine becoming available by then. \u201cThe idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThe drug that has shown some degree of efficacy was modest and was in hospitalized patients.\u201d Fauci said whether students will feel safe returning to school will also largely depend on testing capabilities. Giroir said he expects the country to have the capacity to conduct 25 million to 30 million tests a month by the fall, which could allow schools to have a surveillance strategy in place to quickly identify and isolate confirmed covid-19 cases.

By Yasmeen Abutaleb\n\nGiroir: 40 million to 50 million tests per month by September Giroir, the federal official overseeing coronavirus testing efforts, said the nation will be able to conduct more tests for the novel coronavirus in the coming months, a critical step to reopening the country. \u201cBy September \u2026 we project that our nation will be capable of performing 40 to 50 million tests per month,\u201d Giroir told the committee. The Trump administration has faced criticism that it is not testing enough Americans, with health experts arguing that far more testing is necessary. Trump has been dismissive about the need for testing, calling it \u201csomewhat overrated\u201d last week. On Monday, the president claimed that his administration is besting the world in testing and that it will help states expand such efforts, which are a key element of lifting the safety restrictions that have shuttered much of the economy since March. Trump\u2019s claims about U.S. testing benchmarks do not account for what health experts have criticized as the slow pace of testing capability in the United States this spring, a delay that some say contributed to the rapid spread of the virus, the mounting death toll and uncertainty about the way forward. By Donna Cassata\n\nCDC director: \u2018We\u2019re not out of the woods yet\u2019 CDC Director Robert Redfield told the Senate committee that social distancing remains \u201cimperative\u201d for Americans as public health authorities continue battling the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s important to emphasize that we\u2019re not out of the woods yet,\u201d Redfield said in his opening statement, adding that the battle could continue for months. \u201cWe need to stay vigilant with social distancing. It remains an imperative.\u201d Redfield deemed the pandemic \u201cthe most serious public health crisis in more than a century\u201d and detailed the CDC\u2019s efforts to combat it, including expert assistance to state health authorities, disease surveillance and testing and contact tracing strategy. But he also sounded an alarm that the nation\u2019s public health resources have been insufficient to meet the challenge that covid-19 has posed. \u201cWe need to rebuild our nation\u2019s public health infrastructure: data and data analytics, public health laboratory resilience and our nation\u2019s public health workforce,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to put it in place for the generations to come, not only for the public health system that our nation needs, but for the public health system our nation deserves.\u201d By Mike DeBonis\n\nFauci gives overview of covid-19 vaccine, therapeutic progress in opening statements In his much-anticipated opening remarks, Fauci gave senators an update on potential drugs and vaccines that could treat covid-19. While several senators will look to Fauci for an honest assessment of the administration\u2019s response to the crisis and whether the country is ready to reopen, Fauci kept his opening remarks focused on the search for medical treatments for coronavirus patients. He said remdesivir, the drug that showed some efficacy in treating covid-19 and has been distributed to several states, had only a \u201cmodest result\u201d and that researchers hope to find a more effective treatment, either through a combination of drugs or through another medication altogether. Fauci also told senators that there were eight covid vaccines in clinical development, and that the NIH has been collaborating with numerous pharmaceutical companies in various stages of development. He said the agency hoped to know how successful a vaccine candidate may be in late fall. Fauci again stressed that a vaccine was at least a year away, at best, and that certain vaccines could have negative consequences. By Yasmeen Abutaleb\n\nRemote appearances, social distancing as committee questions top federal health officials Senators wore masks and sat six feet apart Tuesday morning in a cavernous Capitol Hill hearing room as they questioned top federal health officials about the coronavirus pandemic. Some senators, most notably Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and top Democrat Patty Murray (Wash.) participated remotely from home. Murray, whose state had some of the first cases of the disease, criticized the Trump administration\u2019s response. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s abundantly clear, we need dramatically more testing. It\u2019s unacceptable that we still don\u2019t have a national strategic plan to make sure testing is free, fast and everywhere,\u201d she said. More than a half-dozen senators participated in the hearing in person. By Donna Cassata\n\nSen. Alexander: \u2018Almost all of us ... underestimated this virus\u2019 In his opening statement, committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) struck two notes: first, that coronavirus testing needs to be greatly expanded over the coming months to reopen the American economy, and second, warning against political gamesmanship as Democratic criticism of the Trump administration mounts. \u201cBefore we spend too much time finger pointing, I would like to suggest that almost all of us \u2026 underestimated this virus,\u201d he said, according to prepared remarks. \u201cUnderestimated how contagious it would be. How it can travel silently without causing symptoms. How it can be especially deadly among certain segments of the population.\u201d Alexander noted that the federal government prepared over the past 20 years for a pandemic and other public health threats. But he said Washington had \u201cbecome preoccupied with other important things.\" \u201cOur collective memory is short,\u201d he said. \u201cJust three months ago the country was consumed with impeaching a president. Now that seems like ancient Roman history.\u201d Now, Alexander said, Congress should start thinking about preparing for the next pandemic \u2014 even amid the scourge of covid-19: \u201cIf there is to be finger pointing, I hope fingers will point in that direction.\u201d Addressing the theme of the hearing \u2014 \u201cSafely Getting Back to Work and Back to School\u201d \u2014 Alexander declared that indefinite stay-at-home orders would be unworkable. \u201cThere is not enough money available to help all those hurt by a closed economy,\u201d he said. \u201cAll roads back to work and back to school lead through testing, tracking, isolation, treatment and vaccines.\u201d Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

By Mike DeBonis\n\nKey senators, witnesses are appearing remotely The Senate hearing will be far different from most on Capitol Hill, with many senators and the four witnesses appearing remotely. Neither the panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), nor its top Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), plan to be in the hearing room, according to aides. Alexander\u2019s office disclosed that he will self-quarantine in Tennessee for two weeks after an aide tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The four health officials are appearing via video conference after Katie Miller, Vice President Pence\u2019s press secretary who participated regularly in the administration\u2019s task force briefings, tested positive for the coronavirus. Even some senators who are in Washington will appear from their offices rather than the hearing room, aides said. Those who arrived early, including Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), were wearing masks. By Seung Min Kim and John Wagner\n\nSchumer encourages Fauci to be a \u2018truth-teller\u2019 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope Tuesday that senators would hear from a Fauci who was not \u201cmuzzled\u201d by the president during the hearing. \u201cDr. Fauci is a truth-teller,\" Schumer said during an appearance on CNN. \"That\u2019s his reputation. It seems he has sort of muted the truth some in the presence of the president. \u2026 He has to tell the whole truth here. The president does not like the truth. He likes a story that helps his own ego on the day he tells it. And that has had severe consequences for this country.\u201d During remarks Monday on the Senate floor, Schumer encouraged Fauci to \u201clet it rip\u201d during the Senate hearing. \u201cThis will be one of the first opportunities for Dr. Fauci to tell the American people the unvarnished truth without the president looking over his shoulder,\u201d Schumer said. By John Wagner\n\nDemocrats prepared to grill the witnesses Democratic senators on the committee are preparing to grill top federal health officials, with much of the questioning centered on whether the nation is ready to reopen parts of the country that had been shuttered to contain the pandemic. Among the topics that senators plan to raise at Tuesday\u2019s hearing are problems in the supply chain for tests, how the federal government makes decisions about testing machines and testing capacity, and workplace safety standards for businesses that choose to reopen. Democrats also want to question the health officials on what the administration\u2019s metrics and goals are for testing, and why it did not take certain key steps earlier, according to interviews Monday with senators and aides. \u201cI\u2019m interested in more of a prospective interrogation,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a commission and a very painful, under-the-hood look at what went horribly wrong. Right now, my state\u2019s in crisis and we need answers as to whether we\u2019re going to safely reopen.\u201d Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, plans to focus on reports that the White House interfered with guidance from public health experts and how the federal government will properly distribute a vaccine once it is eventually developed. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, President Trump has been more focused on fighting against the truth, than fighting this virus \u2014 and Americans have sadly paid the price,\u201d Murray will say in her opening remarks. \u201cStill, President Trump is trying to ignore the facts, and ignore the experts who have been clear we are nowhere close to where we need to be to reopen safely.\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), another member of the Senate health committee, said in an interview that he wants to compare the U.S. government response to the coronavirus pandemic to that of South Korea, which has been lauded for aggressive testing and tracing measures to contain the outbreak. \u201cI just think it didn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d Kaine said.
