But \u201c as you start to scratch a little bit deeper ... you can actually see considerable willingness on the part of folks to want an expansion of certain functions in government . \u201d\nYet moving beyond the label reveals a surprising amount of common ground . For example , many supporters of President Trump and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders agree that unrestrained global capitalism , dominated by large corporations , has hurt American workers .\nAmericans have actually been warming more to the concept , with 4 out of 10 now embracing some form of socialism , according a Gallup poll in May . Not surprisingly , the shift has been deeply partisan .\nBoth President Donald Trump and the Republican Party have turned warnings about socialism into a persistent refrain this summer . By calling Democrats \u201c communists , \u201d they \u2019 re counting on being able to tap into the deep suspicion of socialism harbored by many Americans .\nThe term \u201c socialism \u201d can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people \u2013 from a social safety net or universal access to health care to the chaos in present-day Venezuela .\nSitting over breakfast at the Nazareth Diner , a 24-hour haunt just down the street from the old white silos of the landmark Nazareth concrete plant , Charles Yellak and his old friend Dave Arbey are talking about socialism \u2013 and the Democrats who support it .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a bad idea , \u201d says Mr. Yellak , a Vietnam veteran and retired utility worker who spent decades with PPL Electric , the local power company . \u201c It \u2019 s not right for America . \u201d\n\u201c To a person in their 20s , I \u2019 m sure it sounds great , \u201d adds Mr. Arbey , a former electrical supervisor at a Bell & Howell plant producing mailing and labeling machines . \u201c But you go out and work for a living , and you \u2019 ll find out socialism \u2019 s not so great , giving all your money away to somebody that \u2019 s going to stay home . \u201d\nJust 15 minutes away , at the Terra Cafe , which features the edgy work of local artists in downtown Easton , Elizabeth Pecota calls herself \u201c a firm believer . \u201d\n\u201c You \u2019 re looking at a pretty full-blown socialist , \u201d the retired middle school history teacher says . \u201c There just needs to be a more equal distribution among the people . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s the top 1 or 2 % of big businesses that \u2019 s getting all the wealth , \u201d agrees her friend Gypsy Lysgaard , sipping a caf\u00e9 latte . \u201c The middle class isn \u2019 t really middle class anymore . \u201d\nMs. Pecota acknowledges that , as recently as 10 years ago , socialism \u201c was absolutely a dirty word , and never really taken seriously as an option. \u201d Yet today the term , and how each party defines it , is becoming a central question of the 2020 election . And as the two conversations show , it can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people \u2013 from a social safety net or universal access to health care to the chaos in present-day Venezuela .\nBoth President Donald Trump and the Republican Party have turned warnings about socialism into a persistent refrain this summer . By calling progressives like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez communists , political observers say , they \u2019 re counting on being able to tap into the deep suspicion of socialism harbored by many Americans like those in the diner .\nAs a whole , though , Americans have been warming more to the concept , with 4 out of 10 now embracing some form of socialism , according a Gallup poll in May .\nNot surprisingly , the shift has been deeply partisan . Since 2010 , a majority of Democrats have begun to view socialism in a positive light , including 57 % in a 2018 Gallup poll , and 65 % in a Pew Research survey in June , which included Democratic-leaning independents . At the same time , fewer Democrats now say they have a positive view of capitalism , according to Gallup , a minority of 47 % , down from 56 % of those polled in 2016 .\nBrian Snyder/Reuters A supporter of President Donald Trump waves to passing drivers during a roadside sign-waving rally in Clearwater , Florida , May 15 , 2019 .\nBy contrast , an overwhelming majority of Republicans , some 84 % , express negative views about socialism , according to Pew and other surveys , while nearly 8 in 10 express positive views about capitalism .\nIt \u2019 s a divide that matters a lot here in Northampton County , known locally as \u201c NorCo , \u201d and encompassing much of the Lehigh Valley , once one of the mightiest industrial regions in the world . Nestled halfway between the metropolitan regions of Philadelphia and New York City , NorCo is a kind of microcosm of the nation , with artsy urban areas , boom suburbs , and conservative rural swaths . The town of Easton , the county seat , nearly mirrors the country \u2019 s demographics as a whole .\nIt was one of three \u201c pivot counties \u201d in Pennsylvania that voted twice for Barack Obama and then switched in 2016 to Mr. Trump , who won Pennsylvania by less than 1 % . Many political observers consider it one of the most important bellwether regions in the country \u2013 and a place where impressions of the Democratic Party \u2019 s growing ranks of democratic socialists might play a key role in 2020 .\n\u201c Trying to cast a lot of progressive policies as socialist or even communist , I think , is still a significant strategic approach on the part of Republicans right now , because in places like this , there \u2019 s still reticence and concern about government overreach and the government becoming too intrusive , \u201d says Christopher Borick , a professor of political science at Muhlenberg College in Allentown and director of its Institute of Public Opinion . \u201c Those older concerns about socialism that have long held sway still hold today in a place like this . \u201d\nAndrew Harnik/AP Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks at George Washington University in Washington , June 12 , 2019 , on democratic socialism , the economic philosophy that has guided his political career .\nYet as a resident of Nazareth himself and a longtime observer of Pennsylvania politics , Professor Borick says that despite the deep divides on the surface , views of socialism here are in fact \u201c a little bit more nuanced , depending on how you broadly define the policies you \u2019 re talking about . \u201d\n\u201c As you start to scratch a little bit deeper ... you can actually see considerable willingness on the part of folks to want an expansion of certain functions in government , \u201d he continues .\nMr. Arbey brings up the Democratic debates back in June , and many of the men at the diner express incredulity at the \u201c way out there \u201d socialist idea of Democratic candidate Andrew Yang , the businessman and entrepreneur who \u2019 s proposed a \u201c universal basic income \u201d of $ 1,000 a month for every American age 18 or older . Of course , it \u2019 s an idea that has also been proposed by conservative libertarians such as sociologist Charles Murray and even one of the foundational economic thinkers on the right , Friedrich Hayek .\nYet a lot of the men admit that there \u2019 s something \u201c socialistic \u201d about programs such as Medicare , which they support . \u201c I \u2019 m not against people buying in , \u201d says Mr. Yellak . \u201c I mean , you need insurance , and people that don \u2019 t have insurance , that \u2019 s going to sound really good to them . \u201d\n\u201c Even your Social Security is a socialist kind of plan , \u201d he adds . \u201c Yeah , I don \u2019 t think you \u2019 re ever going to have a total government without some kind of social program \u2013 and I \u2019 m not against helping people that need it . \u201d\nMs. Lysgaard , on the other hand , stresses that there is an important place for competition in the economy . \u201c Seeing what has been happening , global capitalism disturbs me , \u201d says Ms. Lysgaard , a Unitarian Universalist who practices Buddhism . \u201c But competition is good ; competition between people in the workplace , between businesses and products to an extent \u2013 and having a good work ethic , it \u2019 s so important . \u201d\nHer friend Ms. Pecota agrees : \u201c But there needs to be [ less ] focus on big business and corporations and more on smaller companies and local businesses . \u201d\nIndeed , this is one area where the views of many supporters of Mr. Trump and those of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders often overlap . Unrestrained global capitalism , dominated by large corporations , has hurt American workers , both sides agree . And the government needs to intervene to promote local economies and businesses , and protect the American worker .\nPollsters note that while many Americans express skepticism toward the general idea of socialism , their opinions about related policies are more complex .\n\u201c We may be in a period of flux with how these economic systems are viewed , \u201d said Patrick Murray , director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch , New Jersey , in a statement about its survey in May . \u201c Socialism still carries a stigma , but many Americans feel they are being left behind by the current capitalist system . Policies that have traditionally been seen as socialist may be getting more popular even if the term itself is not . \u201d\nSince 2016 , Democrats have been thrashing the GOP in local and statewide races here . Democratic Gov . Tom Wolf and Sen. Bob Casey both carried Northampton County by double-digit margins last year , and Susan Wild , a Democrat , won an open House seat covering the county , easily beating a moderate Republican .\nBut most of the men at Nazareth Diner say they \u2019 ll likely vote for Mr. Trump next November . And despite Democratic successes in the 2018 midterms , both parties are eyeing suburban moderates and independents who are wary about the Democrats \u2019 drift toward socialism . Nearly 75 % of these voters said they would be very uncomfortable with a candidate embracing the label socialist , according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll this year .\nDennis Ciszeski , a left-leaning independent from Westampton , New Jersey , just across the Philadelphia border , says he thinks perspectives of socialism are changing , even among members of his generation .\n\u201c We grew up in the \u2019 80s , \u201d says Mr. Ciszeski , a writer for an advertising firm . \u201c When \u2018 socialism \u2019 was being bandied about as un-American , along with the Red Scare and all that kind of stuff \u2013 those old perceptions from the \u2019 50s . \u201d\nHe \u2019 s passing through Easton on the way home from vacation with his wife , Kristin Ciszeski , a project manager for a medical education company , and their 3-year-old son , Riley . \u201c But it \u2019 s already in the American system , \u201d Ms. Ciszeski says . \u201c People don \u2019 t think about how many things , how many programs we already have that really are based around the concept of socialism . \u201d\nBut they also talk about the great convenience of businesses like Amazon and the wide-ranging virtues of competition and market-driven capitalism .\n\u201c When we had our son , we were able to have a subscription service for when we needed diapers , \u201d Mr. Ciszeski says . \u201c They could be ordered and delivered to us \u2013 and there are jobs involved with that system . \u201d\nBoth see a different definition of socialism emerging . Gallup findings bear this out : Nearly 1 in 4 Americans now associates the concept with social equality , with only 17 % associating it with the classic definition of government control over the means of production .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\u201c They \u2019 re rebranding right now , and a lot of people are saying that they \u2019 re \u2018 democratic socialists , \u2019 \u201d says Mr. Ciszeski . \u201c They don \u2019 t mean that they \u2019 re for a system that is totally controlled by the government , which then controls production , and then disperses everything to everybody else . \u201d\nHe sees a way where both economic models \u201c can coexist with each other , \u201d he says . \u201c You can have both \u2013 and then have a discourse on the ideas and the particular policies , and what to expand and what to hold the line without hating each other . \u201d",
