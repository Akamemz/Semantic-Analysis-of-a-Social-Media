    "content": "Donald Trump \u2019 s new chief campaign strategist , Paul Manafort , is bringing on some close associates for key spots on Trump 's presidential campaign , including several whose lobbying histories seem to epitomize the special-interest influence against which the candidate rails .\nAmong the influence industry veterans who have been helping the campaign in recent weeks , according to sources close to the Trump campaign , are Laurance Gay , who worked with Manafort on an effort to obtain a federal grant that one congressman called a \u201c very smelly , sleazy business , \u201d and Doug Davenport , whose firm \u2019 s lobbying for an oppressive Southeast Asian regime became a liability for John McCain \u2019 s 2008 presidential campaign .\nThe pair join another former Manafort lobbying partner named Rick Gates , who was identified as an agent of a Ukrainian oligarch in a 2011 racketeering lawsuit that also named Manafort . And Manafort this week met with Marc Palazzo , a former lobbyist for a Koch Industries subsidiary who used to work as a communications staffer for GTECH Corp. , the controversial lottery operator , to which Gay , Davenport , Gates and Manafort all have ties .\nIt 's not clear whether the people who recently started advising the campaign are working as staff , consultants or volunteers . But what unites almost all of them is a professional connection to Manafort , 67 , a veteran GOP operative who was hired by Trump late last month to professionalize his campaign .\nFor the first 10 months of his candidacy , the billionaire real estate showman relied on a relatively inexperienced skeleton staff that helped elevate him from quirky political sideshow to a candidate on the verge of the GOP presidential nomination . But that core team , led by campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , was seen as unable to take Trump all the way , so the candidate handed the keys to Manafort , who has moved quickly to consolidate power on the campaign .\nManafort has made a decades-long career drifting between GOP presidential politics and lucrative lobbying and consulting work . The firm he helped found developed a niche representing a roster of controversial international clients that has been described as \u201c the torturers \u2019 lobby. \u201d Clients included Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos , Zaire \u2019 s Mobutu Sese Seko , Angolan guerrilla Jonas Savimbi , a group accused of being a front for Pakistani intelligence , and \u2014 most recently \u2014 ousted Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych . In fact , the last time Manafort was intricately involved in a presidential campaign was Bob Dole \u2019 s unsuccessful 1996 bid , and he has been largely absent from GOP politics and Washington for years .\nManafort \u2019 s recent additions to the Trump campaign have prompted incredulous reactions among Lewandowski \u2019 s loyalists on the campaign , who have privately questioned whether Manafort understands modern presidential politics , said one operative who works with the Trump campaign .\n\u201c They said that they were going to bring in a new campaign team , but Manafort has been out of the game for so long , \u201d said the operative . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t have any current connections , so he \u2019 s just bringing in all his old lobbyist friends . \u201d\nIt 's an odd fit for a campaign based in large part on Trump 's broadsides against Washington special interests and their lobbying corps , which Trump alleges have skewed the political process against the interests of regular people . Those lobbyists , he argues , are backing his opponents out of self-interest .\nTwo months after launching his campaign last year , Trump boasted on CBS \u2019 `` Face the Nation '' : `` I do n't want lobbyists . I do n't want special interests , \u201d adding that he `` turned down $ 5 million last week from a very important lobbyist , because there are total strings attached to a thing like that . He 's going to come to me in a year or two years and he 's going to want something for a country that he represents or for a company that he represents . \u201d\nManafort did not respond to questions about whether his own lobbying background or those of his new advisers would undermine Trump \u2019 s message , or whether his new team had the experience to run a presidential campaign in 2016 .\nPalazzo , who worked with Manafort on one of Ed DiPrete \u2019 s successful Rhode Island gubernatorial campaigns in the 1980s , rejected the idea that bringing on lobbyists without recent presidential campaign experience would hurt more than help .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve known Paul Manafort for many , many years . I have great respect for him , and am confident in his ability to help Mr. Trump win the nomination , \u201d said Palazzo , 56 . He met with Manafort at the campaign \u2019 s Manhattan headquarters this week to talk about the campaign but said he is \u201c not going to assume an official role with the campaign . \u201d\nGay , 63 , Davenport , 44 , and Gates , 43 , did not respond to messages seeking comment about their roles with the campaign or their lobbying work .\nIt \u2019 s not immediately evident whether Gay , who is based in Connecticut , has worked on a presidential campaign in recent decades . But he has been on the ground in California and has met with Trump \u2019 s state director Tim Clark , according to the operative who works with the Trump campaign . The operative said that Gay has had discussions about the campaign \u2019 s plans to spend heavily in the run-up to California 's primary on June 7 \u2014 the last day of voting \u2014 which in all likelihood will determine whether Trump reaches the 1,237-delegate threshold necessary to secure the GOP nomination before the convention .\nGates , who boasts in an online bio that he \u201c has worked on several US presidential campaigns and has participated in many international political campaigns in Europe and Africa , \u201d took over some of the duties of Lewandowski 's deputy Michael Glassner , according to multiple campaign sources .\n\u201c He was coordinating nuts and bolts kind of stuff with the staff on the ground , trying to make sure we had the right people in place , and interviewing potential hires , \u201d said a campaign insider . The insider said that some of those operational duties were inherited by Rick Wiley , who Manafort hired to be national political director . Wiley appears to be the only Manafort hire so far with recent high-level presidential campaign experience , though Wiley \u2019 s stewardship of Scott Walker \u2019 s underperforming presidential campaign was widely panned . The Wisconsin governor entered the race as an establishment favorite and was the beneficiary of $ 32 million in campaign and super PAC cash , but his campaign was seen as poorly managed , and he dropped out after plummeting in the polls .\nMultiple campaign sources said that Davenport , who first worked with Manafort many years ago , is helping lead the campaign \u2019 s strategy for courting individual delegates , assembling what \u2019 s known as the delegate \u201c book. \u201d That will be a critical job , since those individual delegates could decide the GOP nomination at the party \u2019 s July convention if Trump fails to reach 1,237 delegates on or by June 7 .\nWhile Davenport has been involved in past conventions , his role was at least partly that of a lobbyist planning corporate events . His last high-level presidential campaign experience appears to have come in 2008 , when he was a regional campaign manager for McCain . He stepped aside after it was revealed that the lobbying and public relations firm for which he worked , DCI Group , had previously been on retainer for the repressive military regime in Myanmar , then known as Burma .\nDavenport is currently lobbying for DCI on behalf of hedge funds that hold Puerto Rico \u2019 s debt and don \u2019 t want Congress to approve a restructuring plan , according to lobbying disclosure records . The investors \u2019 aggressive tactics \u2014 running attack ads in lawmakers \u2019 home districts \u2014 have rankled some Congress members and other bondholders . He also lobbied for forcing Argentina to pay back U.S. investors in its own recent debt dispute . At least one of the hedge funds hounding Argentina is also involved in Puerto Rico .\nAnd Davenport has lobbied since at least 2001 for GTECH , which dominated the state lottery equipment business but also came under legal scrutiny for its business practices . Its founder , Guy Snowden , resigned in 1998 after a London jury convicted him of attempted bribery , and GTECH last year was absorbed by slot machine maker IGT .\nGates and Gay also lobbied and worked for GTECH , which was represented by Manafort \u2019 s lobbying firm in the late 1990s \u2014 around the time Palazzo served as GTECH \u2019 s director of communications . He called Davenport and Gay \u201c good friends and talented professionals . \u201d\nGay led the company \u2019 s government relations and sales between 1994 and 1998 . After leaving the company with a reported $ 4.5 million golden parachute , Gay registered to lobby in Connecticut for the casino-owning Mashantucket Pequot Indians and mall developer Westfield .\nGay and Gates also worked together at Gay \u2019 s Hartford , Connecticut-based firm Business Strategies and Insight LLC . In the early '00s , they registered to lobby Congress on behalf of Xavier Chemical Co. , a Georgia firm that was locked in a dispute with the U.S. Army about a federal contract to operate a former ammunition plant .\nMore recently , Gates represented the American Stock Exchange and VILF Consultants , a Virgin Islands company lobbying on the territory \u2019 s infrastructure . Gates was named in a racketeering lawsuit brought in U.S. federal court by former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko against Manafort and his associates for their work for pro-Russian strongman Yanukovych . The complaint , first reported by the Washington Free Beacon , describes Gates as an agent of Ukrainian gas oligarch Dmytro Firtash , who Tymoshenko accuses of improperly shielding profits .
