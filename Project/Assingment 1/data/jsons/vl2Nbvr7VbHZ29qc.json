The Film Suggests the Iraq War Was In Response To 9/11 : One way to get audiences to unambiguously support Kyle 's actions in the film is to believe he 's there to avenge the 9/11 terrorist attacks .

The Film Invents a Terrorist Sniper Who Works For Multiple Opposing Factions : Kyle 's primary antagonist in the film is a sniper named Mustafa . Mustafa is mentioned in a single paragraph in Kyle 's book , but the movie blows him up into an ever-present figure and Syrian Olympic medal winner who fights for both Sunni insurgents in Fallujah and the Shia Madhi army .\n3 .
