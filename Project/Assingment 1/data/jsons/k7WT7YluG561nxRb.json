She searched for \u201c Trump \u201d in Google \u2019 s News tab , and then used a highly questionable media chart that separated outlets into \u201c left \u201d and \u201c right \u201d to tabulate the results . She reported that 96 of 100 results returned were from so-called \u201c left-leaning \u201d news outlets , with 21 of those from CNN alone .

In the absence of evidence , hyper-partisan news outlets like PJ Media , Breitbart , the Daily Caller , and the Washington Examiner foreground stories of Silicon Valley being \u201c hostile \u201d towards conservatives \u2013 the firing of James Damore and Sergey Brin \u2019 s anti-Trump comments are favorite examples \u2013 and from this , infer a concerted suppression of conservative views through the companies \u2019 technical infrastructure .\nThe Creepy Line , a documentary released this year by the director MA Taylor and the former Breitbart editor Peter Schweizer , offers an extended exploration of this argument .\nThe movie hinges on the research of the psychologist Robert Epstein , who since 2013 has published a number of studies demonstrating how search engines could be used to manipulate political opinion through ordering and filtering search results . Epstein calls this the \u201c search engine manipulation effect \u201d .\nWhile Epstein proposes that this effect could theoretically be used for any political agenda , an insidious subtext throughout the movie insinuates that this type of manipulation is explicitly being used in favor of Democrats and liberal causes .\nNews headlines about anti-conservative bias at big tech companies flash across the screen . The film \u2019 s narrator , Peter Schweizer , makes provocative statements about how \u201c these companies have a far deeper agenda than they want to let on \u201d or how they are \u201c governments trying to steer us towards some utopia \u201d . Images of Barack Obama with Mark Zuckerberg and Eric Schmidt suddenly appear as Epstein describes how Google and Facebook could rig an election in favor of one candidate .\nJordan Peterson , the controversial Canadian psychology professor , is given ample screen time to tell the story of how Google supposedly censored him for objecting to gender-neutral terminology . \u201c When you \u2019 re powerful enough to change the political landscape , it isn \u2019 t a question of whether you want to if you can , \u201d Peterson says . \u201c It \u2019 s a question of : convince me that you \u2019 re not doing it . \u201d\nThis collage of impressions builds throughout the documentary to paint a picture of Google and Facebook as liberal silos that are antagonistic to conservative thought . Linking this to Epstein \u2019 s research implies that this ideology has a direct impact on how information is filtered and moderated .\n\u201c The political leaning of the company usually wouldn \u2019 t matter to me , \u201d Taylor , the movie \u2019 s director , told me . \u201c No one cares how many Democrats work at Honda . But when you control the ebb and flow of information and have a political leaning that informs whether certain information should be out there or not , that \u2019 s when bias starts entering the conversation . \u201d\nWhile the narrative of anti-conservative bias emerges from these right-leaning media sources , it is beginning to hit home with more mainstream audiences . In the past year , several Republican politicians have publicly questioned whether social media platforms skew their algorithms to discriminate against conservatives .\nGoogle , Facebook and Twitter have all emphatically denied any technological anti-conservative bias . While trust in these companies is justifiably low after recent scandals , Ari Ezra Waldman , director of the Innovation Center for Law and Technology at the New York Law School , says that there is \u201c zero evidence \u201d to suggest that they \u2019 re lying . \u201c The fact that individual conservatives get less play or banned [ from platforms ] is not evidence of a pattern of bias , \u201d he says . \u201c Those are anecdotes , and anecdotes do not make a case . \u201d\nFor Francesca Tripodi , professor of sociology at James Madison University , anecdotal evidence of anti-conservative bias spreads as fact through the media in part because of a deep misunderstanding of how bias in search engines and content moderation practices work . \u201c These algorithms are very complex and not at all intuitive , \u201d she says . \u201c They weigh things like how many people are linking to an article , what key words appear in the headline , and what specific phrases people are using in their search .\nIf you search for Donald Trump and receive mostly negative results , Tripodi explains , it isn \u2019 t because Google executives are censoring pro-Trump voices , but because most Google users are seeking or linking to this particular type of news item . \u201c In other words , Google is biased but its bias skews towards the type of results people want to see . Search results are kind of like a public opinion poll about what news matters . The company depends on being good at measuring precisely this . If they weren \u2019 t , we wouldn \u2019 t keep using their services . \u201d\nTripodi , who published a report on media manipulation for the New York-based research institute Data & Society , also explains that so-called anti-conservative \u201c censorship \u201d on social media can often be explained by random glitches in moderation practices taking place at scale .\nThis year , the conservative media company PragerU accused YouTube and Facebook of \u201c deliberate censorship of conservative ideas \u201d after a number of their videos were taken down . Tripodi reviewed several of the videos and found that there were plausible , non-ideologically motivated explanations for why they were removed .\n\u201c One of the videos began with a woman saying the word \u2018 rape \u2019 . This might \u2019 ve been picked up by some automated system and then sent for review to a third-party moderator in the Philippines . When you only have three seconds to make a decision about content , you \u2019 re not questioning whether the video is promoting conservative views , \u201d she says . \u201c You \u2019 re mostly worried about the word \u2018 rape \u2019 . \u201d\nGoogle , Facebook and other big tech companies have offered similar explanations when accused of anti-conservative bias and censorship , admitting that figuring out how to moderate and filter such enormous amounts of content is , as Jack Dorsey put it , \u201c a work in progress \u201d .\n\u201c What we \u2019 re coming to realize is that these systems are not neutral and often amplify biases , \u201d Tripodi says . \u201c But this impacts all of us. \u201d Indeed , faulty content moderation practices have affected many progressive causes . Activists associated with Black Lives Matter have been banned from platforms for calling out racism and LGBT activists have had videos referencing same-sex marriage filtered off YouTube .\n\u201c A big part of this problem is that these processes are not transparent , \u201d Tripodi says . \u201c Maybe if we knew more about why content is promoted , removed , flagged , or demonetized , there would be less room for all of this counterproductive conjecture . \u201d\nIn the absence of transparency , the idea of anti-conservative bias thrives .\nIn September , Alex Jones gatecrashed a congressional hearing where Republicans were questioning tech executives Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg about political bias on their platforms . Jones was protesting against his recent ban from YouTube and Facebook for spreading hate speech , including the conspiracy theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary shooting had never happened .\n\u201c The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google , \u201d Jones said . \u201c They are outright banning people and they are blocking conservatives involved in their own first amendment political speech . \u201d\nAs danah boyd explained in a speech given at the Online News Association conference a week after this outburst , Jones \u2019 s hate speech does not constitute conservative values . But he cynically manipulates the narrative of anti-conservative bias to give his online presence legitimacy under \u201c the false flag of conservatism \u201d .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about using nominal conservatism as a cloak to promote toxic masculinity and white supremacy . It \u2019 s about extremists using conservatives , \u201d she said . \u201c Fundamentally , it \u2019 s a technique to grab power by gaslighting the public and making reality seem fuzzy . \u201d\nThe same tactic has been used by other far-right trolls including Mike Cernovich , Milo Yiannopoulos , and Laura Loomer ( who also interrupted proceedings by beseeching Donald Trump to \u201c save \u201d conservatives from social media censorship ) .\nThe strategy appears to be working . Social media companies have become more hesitant to ban users even if they flagrantly violate their terms of service out of fear of being painted as censors . And there has been an emergence of professed \u201c alternative \u201d social media platforms , like Gab , which promote themselves as bastions of free speech and havens for conservatives , while actually serving as a breeding ground for hate speech .\nTrump 's Twitter tantrum : Google may be controlling , but it 's not partisan Read more\nNot all claims of anti-conservative bias are as straightforwardly malicious as Jones and co . When I spoke to Bolyard and Taylor , they both claimed that they were most concerned with how algorithmic bias could destabilize the democratic process . \u201c No matter who you are , or how you lean politically , or what gender you are , the idea that one day the company can just point at you and say , you \u2019 re out , you \u2019 re gone \u2013 that \u2019 s not good for society , \u201d Taylor told me .\nYet , according to Safiya U Noble , a professor at the University of Southern California \u2019 s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism , those spreading the narrative of anti-conservative bias without sufficient evidence have a responsibility to understand that their assertions do not exist in a political vacuum . \u201c I think this is a nuanced issue , \u201d she told me in an email . \u201c But the claims about conservative bias don \u2019 t hold up given the rise of conservative and rightwing political power in modern democracies . \u201d\nNoble \u2019 s broader point , which is laid out in her book Algorithms of Oppression , is that while all algorithmic systems are embedded with pre-existing social biases , these biases reinforce power and thus work against those who are systemically disenfranchised . She shows , for instance , how Google searches for \u201c black girls \u201d return a disproportionately high number of pornographic results .\nAs Noble explains , unsubstantiated cries of anti-conservative bias distracts from these more pressing forms of algorithmic oppression . \u201c We have to understand the values at play in these notions of conservative bias , \u201d Noble says , \u201c and understand this is nothing more than a red herring . \u201d",
