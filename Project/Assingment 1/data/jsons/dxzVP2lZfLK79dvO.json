Undoubtedly . But the fact is it \u2019 s working \u2014 better than anything Republicans have tried so far . Last week , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $ 4.8 million , thanks to a series of \u201c red alert \u201d emails feeding off talk of impeachment and Boehner \u2019 s lawsuit against Obama over executive actions . It was the committee \u2019 s best week for online fundraising .\nAll the handicappers say Democrats have no chance of retaking the House in November and that the party may well lose seats .

The results , they say , speak for themselves : The committee is on pace to easily top its 2012 record of $ 49 million raised through emails \u2014 and all those millions translate into more field workers and TV ads this fall , and potentially a better election night .\nThe man behind the missives is Brandon English , a 30-year-old Brown grad who came to the committee in 2006 with minimal experience in digital technology . Sporting jeans and beat-up sneakers on a recent day at party headquarters , English recounted how he landed that entry-level gig : He did a Google search for \u201c Democratic Party jobs \u201d and stumbled upon an online department opening at the DCCC in Washington .\n\u201c Which , if I \u2019 m being honest , I \u2019 d not heard of up to this point , \u201d he cracked .\nEnglish shot through the DCCC \u2019 s digital ranks over multiple election cycles , proving so effective at pushing donors \u2019 buttons that DCCC Chairman Steve Israel ( N.Y. ) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made personal pleas to him after the 2012 election to stick around for two more years .\n\u201c Obviously , it \u2019 s not normal to be the guy that \u2019 s on Year Eight at a party committee , \u201d English said . \u201c It \u2019 s usually you do your two years and you go . \u201d\nHe is plainly having fun .

( One suggested subject line : \u201c There Is Literally No Reason Left To Live . \u201d )\nFaiz Shakir , a former Pelosi digital director who now has the same job for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , said English has \u201c been able to evolve and adapt their email strategy to capitalize on the zeitgeist of the moment . \u201d\nStriking an urgent tone in emails hasn \u2019 t been difficult . The GOP has given English plenty of material , from countless Obamacare repeal bills to the government shutdown and demands to see Obama \u2019 s birth certificate .\n\u201c If the Republicans weren \u2019 t constantly awful , \u201d English deadpanned , \u201c we wouldn \u2019 t be sending emails about how the Republicans are constantly awful . \u201d\nThe Democrats \u2019 digital operation is actually a mix of low tech and high tech .\nEnglish \u2019 s 11-person team is squirreled back in a corner of the DCCC \u2019 s headquarters , with several desks overlooking the Amtrak tracks . No resemblance here to a Silicon Valley startup with ping-pong tables or a Zen meditation room ; it \u2019 s a cubicle farm straight out of the 1990s . A large red digital clock hangs on one wall , not far from a rack of old-school print newspapers and magazines .\nFor ideas , English and his staff lean on cable TV , online news and their own email inboxes to see what Democratic-aligned supporters are most riled up about . After a 9 a.m. senior DCCC staff meeting , English and his deputy , Charles Starnes , huddle with the writing team to map out the day \u2019 s email strategy . Three writers usually pen three versions of a message before sharing them for peer editing . English then weighs in before handing the drafts over to Starnes for a final scrub .\nRecognizing about a third of their audience will read emails on a mobile phone , English said he insists that messages are no longer than 70 words before the first donation link .\n\u201c We know we have to get to the point and we have to get to the point quick , \u201d English said . \u201c I \u2019 m very incredibly nit-picky about every single word in our emails . Any extra words , extra sentences , unnecessary anything can just kill an email . \u201d\nThe DCCC gets a little more technical when it comes to testing their emails to see what works best to get donations .\nSome messages do well no matter what . Anything from Obama is typically a winner , English said .\nBut a more in-depth analysis is vital for testing messages from the likes of Vice President Joe Biden or Pelosi , as well as generic emails from the DCCC . They usually send out six versions of an email to smaller subsets of their larger email list . Within a half-hour , English \u2019 s team will have enough responses to know what \u2019 s working or not .\nSubject lines make a big difference . Donors responded with 50 percent greater frequency when they received an April email headed \u201c Boehner INFURIATED , \u201d compared with just \u201c INFURIATED. \u201d The subject line \u201c CRUSHING blow \u201d also did much better than an email that simply addressed the recipient by name to offer a \u201c status update . \u201d\nBoehner subject lines tend to elicit a big response , English said , because liberals despise his reluctance to challenge tea party conservatives . But there are others who are strong draws , too , including the former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor . \u201c We will miss Michele Bachmann , \u201d English said .\nDemocrats also have had some of their most successful fundraising days at the end of a month , when their messages have a more urgent tone . Not coincidentally , that \u2019 s the same time as a Federal Election Commission reporting deadline .\n\u201c The fact we know \u2588\u2588\u2588 is going to write a story about our July fundraising numbers , good or bad , we have to be ready for that , \u201d English said .\nDemocrats declined to say how many addresses are on their list , except to acknowledge their list is smaller than the 16 million Obama had at the end of the 2012 campaign .\nRepublicans have been building up their own direct email appeals too , but they are far behind the Democrats . House GOP officials say their email operation didn \u2019 t really kick off until 2012 , giving Democrats an eight-year head start in collecting email addresses and spending millions of dollars for critical infrastructure investments .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no black magic , \u201d a senior House GOP campaign official said of the Democratic efforts .\nBut GOP officials also readily admit they \u2019 ve been trying to copy the Democrats . As much as he \u2019 s loathed by Democratic activists , Boehner is the GOP \u2019 s top draw for a fundraising email signature . They also have had success using Paul Ryan , Ben Carson , Sarah Palin and Condoleezza Rice .\nOhio Rep. Steve Stivers , the finance vice chair for the National Republican Congressional Committee , praised the Democrats \u2019 success and said Republicans are working hard to catch up . \u201c We \u2019 re on a high growth curve , but we started on a much lower level than they did , \u201d he said .\nBut Republicans have also gotten in trouble for using a Democratic tactic of singling out people in emails who haven \u2019 t recently sent in donations .\nGeorgia-based conservative blogger Nathan Smith questioned the Republican National Committee in a recent post for sending him an email asking in the subject line if he \u2019 d abandoned the party .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t take kindly to threats , and I know my Republican friends don \u2019 t , either , \u201d he wrote . \u201c This email doesn \u2019 t exactly make me reach for my wallet and doesn \u2019 t do much to endear me to them . \u201d\n\u201c The reason the DCCC does things that are annoying is cause it works , \u201d the Republican said . \u201c And we want to try to push things a little bit but not be as annoying as they are if we can . \u201d\nThe GOP declined to release details about how much money they \u2019 ve raised online compared with other methods .
