In that incident , a suicide bomber reached the outer gate of the U.S. installation while the vice president was visiting .\nMr. Ismael described the attack as an \u201c assassination attempt \u201d against Mr. Cheney , a theory that was debated in U.S. military circles . He said that when al-Libi was killed several months later in Pakistan by a CIA Predator drone , it was Libyan intelligence that helped U.S. forces find him .\n\u201c Libya was the first country in the world to issue an international arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden in March 1988 , \u201d Mr. Ismael told The Times in a series of email exchanges .\n\u201c Intelligence sharing and information provided to U.S. intelligence agencies led the U.S. to their first arrest of [ al-Libi ] , and Libyan intelligence services provided their U.S. counterpart with valuable information on Libyan terrorists in Iraq and hard-core fighters from Derna , Libya , in Iraq , \u201d he said .\nMr. Ismael broke his silence to the press last month for the first time since the fall of the Gadhafi regime when he spoke to The Times about Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s role in pushing the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya that ousted Gadhafi from power .\nThe Times reported that the Pentagon opposed military intervention so much that it sent an emissary to negotiate with Libya , bypassing Mrs. Clinton , in conversations that were captured on tape . U.S. intelligence couldn \u2019 t corroborate Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s primary argument for war , that Libya was in imminent danger of a humanitarian crisis , the paper reported .\nIn September 2011 , The New York Times reported that documents found in an abandoned Libyan spymaster \u2019 s office \u201c provide new details of the close relations the Central Intelligence Agency shared with the [ Gadhafi ] Libyan intelligence services . \u201d\nIt said the U.S. apparently sent terrorism suspects at least eight times for questioning to Libya .\nMr. Ismael told The Times that his former bosses helped lead the CIA to Ibrahim Suleiman Adnan Adam Harun \u2014 commonly known as \u201c Spin Ghul \u201d \u2014 a battle-hardened al Qaeda veteran who was extradited to New York from Italy in 2013 and held on six federal charges including conspiracy to kill American military personnel and conspiracy to bomb diplomatic buildings .\nOne of those buildings , Mr. Ismael said , was the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria targeted in 2005 . While Gadhafi tried to help the U.S. thwart terrorist attacks , he said , the rebels unleashed by the removal of the Libyan leader led to an attack that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stephens and three other Americans at Benghazi in September 2012 .\n\u201c So you have the [ Gadhafi ] regime , which helped stop an attack on the U.S. Embassy , and you have the Libyan supported rebels that planned an attack on the U.S. Embassy . It \u2019 s ironic , \u201d he wrote to The Times .\nMr. Ismael also expressed frustration that after years of helping U.S. intelligence halt al Qaeda operations against its overseas military installations and embassies , the U.S. agency armed al-Qaeda-linked rebels in his own country , leading to the death of Gadhafi and the collapse of his regime .\n\u201c You can see that al Qaeda was specifically linked to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , which [ NATO ] backed in the war against the regime , \u201d Mr. Ismael noted by email .\nThe Times this month revealed a classified weapons list compiled by Gadhafi intelligence agents that detailed armaments supplied to rebel forces by NATO member states .\nThe Libyan Islamic Fighting Group was one of the most powerful anti-Gadhafi rebel forces that allied itself with NATO in 2011 . Shortly before the intervention started in March , the Islamic organization adopted a secular , pro-democracy sounding name , calling itself the \u201c Libyan Fighting Group for Change . \u201d\nMr. Ismael said the former Libyan regime also helped shield Western nationals from terrorist dangers .\n\u201c Libyan intelligence services played a major role with U.S. assistance in the arrest of Abd Razzaq al-Bara , a top al Qaeda leader in the Sahel region who was responsible for the abduction of more than 30 Western tourists in the Sahara desert , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c He was arrested with assistance of Libyans by a Chadian rebel group . The Libyans then stepped in and convinced the group to hand him over to Libya , which in turn turned him over to Algeria , \u201d Mr. Ismael said .\n\u201c Al-Bara had plans to target U.S. interests in the region , \u201d he said .\nSenior U.S. intelligence officials corroborated most of Mr. Ismael \u2019 s claims , confirming that Libya was a key cooperator from 2004 through 2011 with the CIA and that intelligence-gathering in the country became more difficult in the chaos that ensued with Gadhafi \u2019 s ouster .\n\u201c My understanding and belief is that they were helpful after they dismantled their WMD program , \u201d said another U.S. intelligence source . \u201c They became pretty helpful to us because there were so many Libyans in al Qaeda and they had a unique window into that . \u201d",
