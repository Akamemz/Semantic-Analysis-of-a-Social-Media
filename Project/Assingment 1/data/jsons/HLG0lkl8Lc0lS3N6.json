    "content": "Labor Day marks the traditional kickoff to election season , and all Democrats can say for themselves about the coming midterms is : Things look bad , but they could be worse . Republicans will almost certainly gain Senate seats , and could very well take it over , though their chances diminish every time we hear new audio of Mitch McConnell and his GOP cronies sucking up to the Koch brothers at their last retreat . But traditional low midterm Democratic turnout could make McConnell the Senate majority leader in January nonetheless .\nThis political season opens against a backdrop of profound pessimism , captured in an August Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll that found that 71 percent of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track . The president 's approval rating is at an all-time low , but so is that of congressional Republicans . Even worse , the two big stories dominating the end-of-summer headlines \u2013 the unrest in Ferguson , Missouri . and the rise of ISIL \u2013 only deepen the political gloom , because they reflect two enormous American problems that are coming to seem almost unsolvable : profound and persistent racial injustice , and the shape-shifting chaos that is Iraq .\nThese problems are particularly vexing for people who subscribe to the Magical President theory of politics -- which includes too many of us , including me sometimes \u2013 because those are two issues Americans thought we 'd `` solved , \u201d or at least responsibly addressed , by electing our first black president , who 'd famously opposed the `` dumb '' Iraq war and promised to end it . Now race relations are arguably worse than when Obama took office , and so is Iraq , and this is a rare case where you can fairly say people on \u201c both sides \u201d blame the president -- mostly wrongly .\nCornel West is now slipping deep into Maureen Dowd territory : a formerly incisive , moderately influential social critic ( a genuinely important one , in West \u2019 s case ) driven to cruelty and irrelevance by Obama hatred . The National Journal \u2019 s Ron Fournier is a consistent proponent of what some deride as the \u201c Green Lantern \u201d approach to the presidency : If only Obama would just lead , our problems would solve themselves , though Fournier doesn \u2019 t stoop to channeling Abraham Lincoln or Aaron Sorkin when he criticizes Obama . But even fair and sober observers are frustrated with some of Obama \u2019 s moves .\nYou can certainly criticize the president on the margins \u2013 I have , and I \u2019 m sure I will again . Personally , if I worked for him , I \u2019 d probably have suggested not golfing after his moving statement on journalist James Foley \u2019 s execution , and not equivocating as much in his Ferguson remarks , which Michael Eric Dyson fairly laments . But those are issues more of stage management than statecraft .\nStill , even for people who respect Obama , it \u2019 s hard to see us mired in what feels like ancient , intractable conflict in both Ferguson and Iraq . It hurts . Yet I would argue ( after having been demoralized about both issues ) that the unrest in Ferguson is in fact a kind of social progress : Within hours of Mike Brown \u2019 s awful shooting a network of new and seasoned activists came together to demand justice , pushing both Gov . Jay Nixon and the president to take action to rein in abusive local cops and drive the investigation into what happened .\nEven the ugly situation in Iraq represents political progress , because as painful and outrageous as Foley \u2019 s execution was , and as disturbing as it is to see ISIL gain power in Iraq and Syria , the vital debate over what the U.S. can and should do there has actually been strengthened by the existence of intervention skeptics on the left and the right . Obama has repudiated the neocon approach , but he \u2019 s still wrestling with Colin Powell \u2019 s Pottery Barn doctrine : If you break it , have you really bought it ? Certainly , we \u2019 ve already paid for it , many times over .\nLet \u2019 s be clear : There is neither a Democratic nor a progressive consensus on what is to be done there . All we have is a profound skepticism , and I \u2019 ll take that over a cynical Cheneyesque certainty , built on lies to the American people . Disagreement , even deadlock , is preferable .\nThe belief that somehow Obama can lead us out of our summer of misery reflects Magical President thinking . Which leads me back to the rapidly approaching and dispiriting midterms . When I reviewed Rick Perlstein \u2019 s \u201c Invisible Bridge , \u201d I noted that the major political difference between the right and left seems to be that when defeated and disillusioned , the right gets back to the nuts and bolts work of electoral politics . The left , or some of it , disintegrates , a flank here promoting direct action over electoral politics ( a debate that \u2019 s understandably renewed by events in Ferguson ) ; a flank there preaching about a third party ; and one over there fantasizing about the perfect left-wing challenge to the mainstream Democratic candidate , like that dreamy African-American senator who opposed the war in Iraq who looked so magical eight years ago . Meanwhile , Republicans count on division on the left , and low turnout by the Democratic base of younger , poorer non-white voters , to help them take back the Senate .\nAnd when they do , Mitch McConnell has promised only more obstruction and gridlock .
