They 've been waiting for the big one , '' an airport security source told the newspaper . `` We have many scares but this one nearly got hand baggage pulled from all airlines . The threat is still alive and real . `` One source told the New York Post , `` There is a credible threat that they 're concerned about \u2026 They 've known about it for a while . `` Mobile phones and electronic devices may still be banned because they can be used to trigger bombs . `` High level negotiations are continuing at the governmental level but at the moment there has been little done to respond . There is paralysis because of the difficulty of banning hand luggage , which is one of the strongest weapons we have against the new threats , '' the source said , according to the Express . `` All electronics may be banned from hand luggage and placed in the hold , that has been considered , and there has been behavior analysis training at airports but while it 's effective , it 's difficult to roll out quickly and is not a sufficient safety net . `` `` The threat is aimed at Europe .
