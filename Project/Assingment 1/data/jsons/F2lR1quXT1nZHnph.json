For instance , it 's been de rigueur for Democrats to claim unequivocally that Republicans have been moving farther and farther to the right , thus polarizing our politics and creating gridlock in Washington , while Democrats have become rational , reasonable , and centrist .\nIn the immortal words of Independence Day 's Defense secretary , Albert Nimziki : `` That 's not entirely accurate . ''\nAt least since the 2010 midterms , it \u2019 s been a liberal talking point that Republican extremism is to blame for political polarization and gridlock .

Before the last GOP debate , for example , the Center for American Progress launched a \u201c Right of Reagan \u201d campaign to supposedly show \u201c how the extremism of today \u2019 s Republican presidential candidates sets them apart from their conservative idol. \u201d But as the debates over issues like the $ 15 minimum wage , healthcare , and universal preschool have already shown , the Democrats have moved to the left at least as quickly as the Republicans have moved to the right . After all , Hillary Clinton has to renounce a good chunk of her husband \u2019 s positions to be competitive in the 2016 primary . Now , a paper on polarization and inequality released in August by political scientists from Princeton , Georgetown , and the University of Oregon ( and highlighted this week in a Washington Postarticle ) provides some empirical evidence that Democratic Party \u2019 s leftward drift is more pronounced than the GOP \u2019 s rightward drift , at least at the state level . The study \u2019 s overall argument is that income inequality has increased political polarization at the state level since the 1990s . But the authors find that that this happens more by moving state Democratic parties to the left than by moving state Republican parties to the right .

The authors find that the ideological median of Republican legislators has shifted much less . One study does not a thesis prove , but the paper is certainly interesting , and it coheres with the trends we \u2019 ve been seeing .
