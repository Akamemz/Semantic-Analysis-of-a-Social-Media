    "content": "A few years back someone walked up to then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords outside a Safeway in Tucson , Arizona , and shot her in the head . The shooter , Jared Loughner , killed six and injured a dozen or so others . In 2012 , another nut shot up a movie theater in Aurora , Colorado . Later that year , a shooter walked into a Newtown , Connecticut , elementary school and murdered 20 children . These are only a few high-profile examples of the dozens of mass shootings that have taken place in the last several years .\nAfter Newtown , President Obama and many members of Congress finally felt compelled to make the first serious push for gun control legislation in decades . Their demands were eventually whittled down to some modest measures , such as expanding background checks for gun buyers . But even that effort , pushed hard by then-former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and backed by vast majorities of the American people , failed to overcome a Republican Senate filibuster .\nOddly enough , it strains certain imaginations that the above sequence of events is something that people could get really , really angry about it . That masses of people , including members of Congress , movie-theater patrons , and children could get shot , and that members of Congress -- mostly Republicans , with a handful of conservative Democrats -- would n't even accede a minimal piece of legislation shoring up the country 's porous background check laws . It 's horrifying and enraging , and those public figures who work to maintain or even loosen what we might generously called the `` loopholed '' status quo of American gun law should expect to be treated as accomplices to this farce .\nAs Giffords herself recovered , retired from Congress and became an ardent advocate for stricter background checks , she first tried to play nice .

As we know , that did n't work very well .\nSo this cycle , Giffords ' super PAC , Americans for Responsible Solutions , is getting `` mean .
