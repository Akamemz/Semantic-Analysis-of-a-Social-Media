    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders joined the burgeoning field of candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination , vowing Tuesday to take on \u201c the powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life . \u201d\nMr. Sanders , who battled Hillary Clinton for the nomination three years ago and helped reshape the party , will return to the presidential stage with a loyal group of supporters and arguably the strongest online fundraising machine in Democratic politics . But unlike 2016 , he will need to compete for the party \u2019 s most liberal voters in a large and unpredictable field vying to challenge President Trump .\nThe independent senator announced his campaign in an email and a video posted on his Twitter account , telling his supporters , \u201c Real change never takes place from the top on down , but always from the bottom on up. \u201d He called Mr. Trump \u201c the most dangerous president in modern American history . \u201d\nIn a sign of the senator \u2019 s online fundraising clout , the campaign said he raised $ 3.3 million from 120,000 individual donors in the first 10 hours after his announcement . That was more than double California Sen. Kamala Harris , who raised $ 1.5 million in the first 24 hours after she started her campaign .\nMr. Sanders is the sixth senator to seek the party \u2019 s nomination and is the 12th candidate to announce plans for a White House run . The field could grow even larger with the arrival of potential candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden and former Texas Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke .\nThe self-described democratic socialist will also serve as a bigger target for detractors . During his State of the Union address , Mr. Trump railed against the \u201c new calls to adopt socialism in our country , \u201d taking a shot at advocates for expansive government policies that include Mr. Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D. , N.Y. ) , a prominent new member of Congress .\nPresident Trump \u2019 s campaign responded to Mr. Sanders \u2019 s candidacy , saying in a statement that the senator \u201c has already won the debate in the Democrat primary because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism \u201d and that Mr. Trump is the only candidate who will keep the country \u201c free , prosperous and safe . \u201d\nAlthough Mr. Sanders isn \u2019 t registered with any political party , he caucuses with Senate Democrats , allowing him to be appointed to committees , and is running for president as a Democrat .\nWhen he first ran for president , Mr. Sanders was largely unknown nationally , and few Democrats expected him to pose a serious threat to Mrs. Clinton during the 2016 primaries .\nSurprising skeptics , he raised more than $ 230 million from 2.5 million donors and carried 22 states during the primaries .\nPresidential hopefuls are stepping out of the shadows , but their 2020 announcements are far from spontaneous . WSJ \u2019 s Shelby Holliday explains .\nNow 77 years old , Mr. Sanders was the popular choice for Democratic primary voters under age 30 and served as the driving force behind a leftward push within the party on a number of policy issues that have become part of the party \u2019 s mainstream , including a Medicare-for-all health-care system , efforts to provide free college tuition for students , and dramatic steps to curb the effects of climate change , some of which has been embodied in the so-called Green New Deal .\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren opened her campaign in late December and will be angling for many of the same voters who supported Mr. Sanders . Primary voters will also have more fresh-faced options to choose from such as Sens . Harris , Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York . And Mr. O \u2019 Rourke , should he run , would compete for many of the same millennial voters who helped power Mr. Sanders \u2019 s campaign .\nSome of Mr. Sanders \u2019 s 2016 allies , meanwhile , have moved on . Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , a top campaign surrogate for Mr. Sanders , is also seeking the Democratic nomination while Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley , the first Senate Democrat to endorse him , is also weighing a potential bid .\nIn his campaign launch , Mr. Sanders signaled he would continue to target the influence of the wealthiest Americans on the nation \u2019 s political and economic systems . In an interview with \u201c CBS This Morning , \u201d he warned of the potential independent candidacy of former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz .\n\u201c There are a lot of people I know personally , who work hard for a living and make forty , fifty-thousand dollars a year who know a lot more about politics than , in all due respect , does Mr. Schultz , \u201d Mr. Sanders said . \u201c But because we have a corrupt political system , anybody who is a billionaire , who can throw a lot of TV ads on television , suddenly becomes very , very credible . \u201d\nMr. Sanders remains a prominent voice on economic issues and income inequality and has pressured corporations like Amazon.com Inc. to raise their wages . The senator praised Amazon last fall when the company announced it would raise the minimum wage it pays to all U.S. employees to $ 15 an hour and urged corporate leaders to follow the online retailer \u2019 s lead .\nHe has also helped influence the internal workings of the Democratic Party . The Democratic National Committee voted last year to strip from so-called superdelegates\u2014which includes DNC members , federal lawmakers , governors and other party leaders\u2014the right to vote on the first presidential ballot at the party \u2019 s national convention .\nThe changes came after Mr. Sanders and his supporters argued that the party \u2019 s superdelegates helped give Mrs. Clinton an insurmountable delegate lead before the 2016 national convention and reforms were needed to give primary voters a more central role .\nHis campaign will seek to create a larger and more diverse operation this time . The senator picked Faiz Shakir , a former aide to Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , to manage the campaign . Mr. Shakir most recently served as national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union . Mr. Sanders \u2019 s campaign is also expected to include several advisers from his 2016 run .\nMr. Sanders has also dealt with internal problems from his last campaign . In January , he apologized after learning of allegations that some members of his 2016 staff had been sexually harassed by fellow staffers . He convened a private meeting last month to develop recommendations to improve workplace policies and told CBS in Tuesday \u2019 s interview that his campaign would have the \u201c strongest protocols \u201d to protect employees from harassment .\nMr. Sanders was elected to the Senate in 2006 after more than a decade representing Vermont in the U.S. House . The New York native ran multiple losing statewide campaigns in Vermont during the 1970s before winning a race\u2014by 10 votes\u2014to become Burlington \u2019 s mayor in 1981 and led the city for nearly a decade .",
