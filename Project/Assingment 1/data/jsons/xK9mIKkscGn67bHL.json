My head is se\u00adcured in place . I have a pan\u00adic but\u00adton . I won \u2019 t press it , but I do grip it tightly . Above me , faces flash on a screen .\nSome are hu\u00adman , oth\u00aders are dolls , and some are di\u00adgit\u00adally blen\u00added to be something in between . It \u2019 s my job to fig\u00adure out which are which . And as I do , re\u00adsearch\u00aders at New York Uni\u00adversity \u2019 s brain-ima\u00adging cen\u00adter are track\u00ading what goes on in my head .\nI \u2019 m not sick , and we \u2019 re not here to test my calm in the face of claus\u00adtro\u00adpho\u00adbia . In\u00adstead , I \u2019 m a sub\u00adject for re\u00adsearch on a big\u00adger ques\u00adtion : Is the hu\u00adman polit\u00adic\u00adal brain broken ?\nThe NYU team is try\u00ading to show that our brains are hard\u00adwired for par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship and how that skews our per\u00adcep\u00adtions in pub\u00adlic life . Re\u00adsearch at NYU and else\u00adwhere is un\u00adder\u00adscor\u00ading just how blind the \u201c us-versus-them \u201d mind-set can make people when they try to pro\u00adcess new polit\u00adic\u00adal in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion . Once this par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship men\u00adtal\u00adity kicks in , the brain al\u00admost auto\u00admat\u00adic\u00adally pre-fil\u00adters facts \u2014 even non\u00adcon\u00adtro\u00adver\u00adsial ones \u2014 that of\u00adfend our polit\u00adic\u00adal sens\u00adib\u00adil\u00adit\u00adies .\n\u201c Once you trip this wire , this trig\u00adger , this cue , that you are a part of \u2018 us-versus-them , \u2019 it \u2019 s al\u00admost like the whole brain be\u00adcomes re-co\u00adordin\u00adated in how it views people , \u201d says Jay Van Bavel , the lead\u00ader of NYU \u2019 s So\u00adcial Per\u00adcep\u00adtion and Eval\u00adu\u00adation Lab .\nOur tend\u00adency to\u00adward par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship is likely the res\u00adult of evol\u00adu\u00adtion \u2014 form\u00ading groups is how pre\u00adhis\u00adtor\u00adic hu\u00admans sur\u00advived . That \u2019 s help\u00adful when try\u00ading to mas\u00adter an un\u00adfor\u00adgiv\u00ading en\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment with Stone Age tech\u00adno\u00adlogy . It \u2019 s less so when try\u00ading to foster a func\u00adtion\u00adal demo\u00adcracy .\nUn\u00adder\u00adstand\u00ading the oth\u00ader side \u2019 s point of view , even if one dis\u00adagrees with it , is cent\u00adral to com\u00adprom\u00adise , poli\u00adcy\u00admak\u00ading , and any hope for ci\u00advil\u00adity in civic life . So if our brains are blind\u00ading us to in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion that chal\u00adlenges our par\u00adtis\u00adan pre\u00addis\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion , how can we hope ever to find com\u00admon ground ? It \u2019 s a chal\u00adlenge that is stump\u00ading both the elect\u00ador\u00adate and the elec\u00adted of\u00adfi\u00adcials who rep\u00adres\u00adent them . Con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal hear\u00adings are hear\u00adings in name only \u2014 op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adit\u00adies for politi\u00adcians to grand\u00adstand rather than talk with each oth\u00ader . And the polit\u00adic\u00adal dis\u00adcus\u00adsion , even among those well versed in the is\u00adsues , largely ex\u00adists in par\u00adal\u00adlel red and blue uni\u00adverses , men\u00adtal spheres with few or no com\u00admon facts to serve as start\u00ading points .\nBut rather than des\u00adpair , many polit\u00adic\u00adal-psy\u00adcho\u00adlogy re\u00adsearch\u00aders see their res\u00adults as reas\u00adon for hope , and they raise a tan\u00adtal\u00adiz\u00ading pro\u00adspect : With enough un\u00adder\u00adstand\u00ading of what ex\u00adactly makes us so vul\u00adner\u00adable to par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship , can we re\u00adshape our polit\u00adic\u00adal en\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment to ac\u00adcess the bet\u00adter an\u00adgels of our neur\u00ado\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal nature ?\nWHAT DOES ANY OF this have to do with pho\u00adtos of dolls ? The re\u00adsearch\u00aders are test\u00ading one of par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship \u2019 s more fright\u00aden\u00ading fea\u00adtures : It al\u00adlows us , even pushes us , to de\u00adhu\u00adman\u00adize those we cat\u00adegor\u00adize as \u201c them . \u201d\nI \u2019 m tasked with dis\u00adtin\u00adguish\u00ading hu\u00admans from non\u00adhu\u00admans , and it \u2019 s not as easy as it sounds . While some of the faces ap\u00adpear to be nor\u00admal pho\u00adto\u00adgraphs of men and wo\u00admen , oth\u00aders are warped in\u00adto something that would have scared me as a child \u2014 faces that look like masks . They have no creases in their pla\u00adsticky skin , and their big , anime-style eyes shine death stares . They are dis\u00adtinctly non\u00adhu\u00adman . It \u2019 s the ones in between that pose the prob\u00adlem , however . A face that \u2019 s 90 per\u00adcent hu\u00adman and 10 per\u00adcent doll is plainly seen as hu\u00adman . But when the face is 50 per\u00adcent doll and 50 per\u00adcent hu\u00adman , that \u2019 s where par\u00adtis\u00adan per\u00adspect\u00adive takes over .\nRe\u00adsearch\u00aders test par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship by ask\u00ading par\u00adti\u00adcipants to dis\u00adtin\u00adguish hu\u00adman from non\u00adhu\u00adman faces . ( Journ\u00adal of Ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment\u00adal So\u00adcial Psy\u00adcho\u00adlogy 52 ( 2014 ) 15 \u201d \u201c 23/Hack\u00adel et al. , JESP , 2014 ) For the first tri\u00adal I am just shown a set of faces , but for the next run , Van Bavel in\u00adtro\u00adduces a twist : The faces are di\u00advided in\u00adto two groups . Be\u00adfore I see the first group , the Amer\u00adic\u00adan flag flashes , and I \u2019 m told I \u2019 m look\u00ading at my coun\u00adtry\u00admen . Be\u00adfore the second , a Rus\u00adsi\u00adan flag ap\u00adpears . These are faces of Rus\u00adsi\u00adans .\nAs I try to as\u00adsess which faces have a soul be\u00adhind them , a dark fa\u00adcet of par\u00adtis\u00adan psy\u00adcho\u00adlogy sur\u00adfaces . If the face be\u00adlongs to a team mem\u00adber \u2014 in my case , an Amer\u00adic\u00adan \u2014 I \u2019 m more likely to as\u00adsign them hu\u00adman\u00adity . I \u2019 m less in\u00adclined to do the same for Rus\u00adsi\u00adans .\nIt \u2019 s not en\u00adtirely my fault \u2014 or , at least , not the fault of any con\u00adscious de\u00adcisions . In\u00adstead , it \u2019 s just my brain pro\u00adcess fol\u00adlow\u00ading a well-worn pat\u00adtern . When Van Bavel looks at the brain scans of people in his doll\u00adhouse ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment , he finds that the brain re\u00adgions used to em\u00adpath\u00adize with oth\u00aders aren \u2019 t as act\u00adive when a per\u00adson is eval\u00adu\u00adat\u00ading faces he or she has been told be\u00adlong to the oth\u00ader team .\nHU\u00adMANS \u2019 WILL\u00adING\u00adNESS TO de\u00adhu\u00adman\u00adize is of\u00adten men\u00adtioned along\u00adside some of the darkest chapters of his\u00adtory \u2014 the Holo\u00adcaust , gen\u00ado\u00adcide in Rwanda , the Kh\u00admer Rouge \u2014 when re\u00adgimes went to great lengths to build an\u00adger against \u201c the oth\u00ader. \u201d In my case , the ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment re\u00adlies on a na\u00adtion\u00adal iden\u00adtity re\u00adin\u00adforced since birth .\nBut to cre\u00adate the base \u201c us and them \u201d struc\u00adture , none of that is needed . The brain is so hard\u00adwired to build such groups that Van Bavel says he can turn any\u00adone on the street in\u00adto a par\u00adtis\u00adan . \u201c I can do it in five minutes with a ran\u00addom stranger , \u201d he says . All it takes is a coin flip .\n\u201c Some\u00adbody comes in\u00adto your lab and you tell them , \u2018 You \u2019 re part of the blue team , \u2019 \u201d he ex\u00adplains . \u201c The next per\u00adson who comes in , you flip a coin , let \u2019 s say it comes up the oth\u00ader way . And you say , \u2018 You \u2019 re on the red team. \u2019 \u201c\nThat \u2019 s it . The team\u00admates nev\u00ader have to meet . Or in\u00adter\u00adact . There doesn \u2019 t need to be any\u00adthing at stake . But with\u00adin minutes , these in\u00adsta-par\u00adtis\u00adans like their team\u00admates bet\u00adter than they like the oth\u00ader guys . And it shows when Van Bavel puts his sub\u00adjects through his MRI doll\u00adhouse .\nRed-team mem\u00adbers are more likely to see hu\u00admans when they \u2019 re told they \u2019 re look\u00ading at fel\u00adlow red-team faces . Blue-team mem\u00adbers re\u00adspond the same way . Oth\u00ader tests re\u00adveal that red-team mem\u00adbers re\u00admem\u00adber red-team faces more ac\u00adcur\u00adately , and if Van Bavel asks sub\u00adjects to al\u00adloc\u00adate money , red-team mem\u00adbers will pay out more to their own . Team mem\u00adbers also have less sym\u00adpathy for those on the oth\u00ader side , and even ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adence pleas\u00adure while read\u00ading about their pain .\nI \u2019 m not just in\u00adside the MRI to be stumped by Rus\u00adsi\u00adan dolls . The re\u00adsearch\u00aders are also check\u00ading to see if my brain has a con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive or lib\u00ader\u00adal shape .\nThe au\u00adthor be\u00ading loaded in\u00adto an MRI ma\u00adchine . ( Reena Flores ) In 2011 , a team of Brit\u00adish sci\u00adent\u00adists pub\u00adlished a pa\u00adper that found that brain struc\u00adtures cor\u00adrel\u00adated with polit\u00adic\u00adal ori\u00adent\u00ada\u00adtion . Spe\u00adcific\u00adally , con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives ten\u00added to have lar\u00adger amy\u00adg\u00addala areas \u2014 brain mat\u00adter that plays a role in fear con\u00addi\u00adtion\u00ading \u2014 than lib\u00ader\u00adals . The res\u00adults ad\u00added to a body of re\u00adsearch that finds con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives and lib\u00ader\u00adals have dif\u00adfer\u00adent physiolo\u00adgic\u00adal re\u00adsponses to the en\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment , and even per\u00adceive the world dif\u00adfer\u00adently .\nAt NYU , they \u2019 re test\u00ading that con\u00adclu\u00adsion , and the mag\u00adnets around me are meas\u00adur\u00ading the volume of my amy\u00adg\u00addala . Be\u00adfore my MRI , I took a test aimed at giv\u00ading me a score on the re\u00adsearch\u00aders \u2019 \u201c sys\u00adtem-jus\u00adti\u00adfic\u00ada\u00adtion scale , \u201d a meas\u00adure that cor\u00adrel\u00adates with one com\u00adpon\u00adent of where a per\u00adson falls on the lib\u00ader\u00adal-to-con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive spec\u00adtrum . People who score high on sys\u00adtem jus\u00adti\u00adfic\u00ada\u00adtion tend to be pat\u00adri\u00adot\u00adic and de\u00adfend\u00aders of the status quo . Those who score low tend to be the rebels . So far , with 100 par\u00adti\u00adcipants , Van Bavel \u2019 s group is find\u00ading mean\u00ading\u00adful dif\u00adfer\u00adences between the brains of high sys\u00adtem-jus\u00adti\u00adfi\u00aders and low sys\u00adtem-jus\u00adti\u00adfi\u00aders .\n( Col\u00adleagues joked that I might want to keep my test res\u00adults to my\u00adself if I wanted to con\u00adtin\u00adue work\u00ading as a non\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan journ\u00adal\u00adist in Wash\u00ading\u00adton . But \u2014 for the re\u00adcord \u2014 I \u2019 m a lab-cer\u00adti\u00adfied mod\u00ader\u00adate : \u201c Yeah , you were right in the heart of the dis\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtion , not only in the terms of your sys\u00adtem-jus\u00adti\u00adfic\u00ada\u00adtion tend\u00aden\u00adcies but also your amy\u00adg\u00addala volume is very healthy , \u201d Van Bavel tells me the day after , laugh\u00ading . )\nBUT WHEN IT COMES to Amer\u00adic\u00adan polit\u00adics , how troubled should we be by any of these find\u00adings ? Amer\u00adica \u2019 s par\u00adtis\u00adan di\u00advide is as old as Amer\u00adica \u2019 s demo\u00adcracy . And it \u2019 s neither feas\u00adible nor de\u00adsir\u00adable to hope for a na\u00adtion\u00adal con\u00adsensus on every is\u00adsue . Even if we all worked from the same set of facts , and even if we all un\u00adder\u00adstood those facts per\u00adfectly , dif\u00adfer\u00adences of opin\u00adion would \u2014 and should \u2014 re\u00admain . Those opin\u00adions are not the prob\u00adlem . The trouble is when we \u2019 re so blinded by our par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship that it over\u00adrides reas\u00adon \u2014 and re\u00adsearch sug\u00adgests that is hap\u00adpen\u00ading all the time .\nWith just a hint of par\u00adtis\u00adan prim\u00ading , an Ari\u00adzona State Uni\u00adversity re\u00adsearch\u00ader was able to in\u00adstantly blind Demo\u00adcrats to a non\u00adcon\u00adtro\u00adver\u00adsial fact , lead\u00ading them im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adately to fail to solve the easi\u00adest of math prob\u00adlems . In the 2010 ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment , polit\u00adic\u00adal sci\u00adent\u00adist Mark Ramirez asked sub\u00adjects two sim\u00adil\u00adar ques\u00adtions . The con\u00adtrol group saw this ques\u00adtion : \u201c Would you say that com\u00adpared to 2008 , the level of un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment in this coun\u00adtry has got\u00adten bet\u00adter , stayed the same , or got\u00adten worse ? \u201d A sep\u00adar\u00adate group saw this one : \u201c Would you say that the level of un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment in this coun\u00adtry has got\u00adten bet\u00adter , stayed the same , or got\u00adten worse since Barack Obama was elec\u00adted Pres\u00adid\u00adent ? \u201d\nThe key dif\u00adfer\u00adence between the two : the first men\u00adtions the time peri\u00adod for as\u00adsess\u00ading un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment , while the second frames the is\u00adsue around Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama . When asked the first ques\u00adtion , Demo\u00adcrats and Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans re\u00adspon\u00added sim\u00adil\u00adarly , with most say\u00ading un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment had re\u00admained about the same . But among sub\u00adjects who got the second ques\u00adtion , opin\u00adions shif\u00adted along par\u00adtis\u00adan lines : Around 60 per\u00adcent of Demo\u00adcrats said un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment had got\u00adten bet\u00adter or some\u00adwhat bet\u00adter , and about 75 per\u00adcent of Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans said the op\u00adpos\u00adite .\nIn fact , the un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment rate in\u00adcreased between Obama \u2019 s elec\u00adtion and Ramirez \u2019 s study . One can ar\u00adgue about wheth\u00ader this is a fair frame for eval\u00adu\u00adat\u00ading this or any pres\u00adid\u00adent \u2019 s eco\u00adnom\u00adic re\u00adcord , but from a raw-num\u00adbers per\u00adspect\u00adive , the rise in the un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment rate between 2008 and 2010 is in\u00addis\u00adput\u00adable .\nBut even giv\u00ading Demo\u00adcrats that in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion did not in\u00adcrease the ac\u00adcur\u00adacy of their re\u00adsponses . Ramirez \u2019 s study asked some par\u00adti\u00adcipants the fol\u00adlow\u00ading ques\u00adtion : \u201c The U.S. Bur\u00adeau of Labor Stat\u00adist\u00adics shows un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment has in\u00adcreased by 4.6 per\u00adcent since 2008 . Would you say that the level of un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment in this coun\u00adtry has got\u00adten bet\u00adter , stayed the same , or got\u00adten worse since Barack Obama was elec\u00adted Pres\u00adid\u00adent ? \u201d\nClearly , the an\u00adswer is in the sen\u00adtence that im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adately pre\u00adcedes the ques\u00adtion .

In the early 2000s , he cofoun\u00added the fact-check\u00ading web\u00adsite Spin\u00adsan\u00adity to com\u00adbat the \u201c he said , she said \u201d cov\u00ader\u00adage he saw in the me\u00addia . \u201c I \u2019 m very proud of the work we did , but it did il\u00adlus\u00adtrate how hard it was to change people \u2019 s minds , even among the se\u00adlect group of people who were will\u00ading to take the time to read a non\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan fact-check\u00ading web\u00adsite , \u201d Nyhan said .\nMore re\u00adcently , Nyhan at\u00adtemp\u00adted to de\u00adbunk an ar\u00adgu\u00adment that is grow\u00ading in pop\u00adular\u00adity but ut\u00adterly lack\u00ading in sci\u00adentif\u00adic sup\u00adport : that par\u00adents shouldn \u2019 t have their chil\u00addren vac\u00adcin\u00adated .\nNyhan and his col\u00adlab\u00ador\u00adat\u00adors wanted to con\u00advince par\u00adents who were against vac\u00adcin\u00ada\u00adtions that their op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion was un\u00adfoun\u00added . Work\u00ading with a large sample of 1,759 par\u00adents , the team sent them a vari\u00adety of ma\u00adter\u00adi\u00adal , in\u00adclud\u00ading pamph\u00adlets that ex\u00adplained the lack of evid\u00adence link\u00ading vac\u00adcin\u00ada\u00adtions with aut\u00adism , ex\u00adplan\u00ada\u00adtions of the dangers of measles , pho\u00adtos of sick chil\u00addren whose dis\u00adeases could have been pre\u00adven\u00adted , and a story about an in\u00adfant who al\u00admost died from in\u00adfec\u00adtion .

In the months lead\u00ading up to the 2012 elec\u00adtion , Nyhan and coau\u00adthor Jason Reifler per\u00adformed an ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment on 1,169 un\u00adwit\u00adting state le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adors . They wanted to see if fact checks could mo\u00adtiv\u00adate the politi\u00adcians to be more truth\u00adful . A third of the le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adors re\u00adceived a let\u00adter that con\u00adtained a veiled threat . It read : \u201c Politi\u00adcians who lie put their repu\u00adta\u00adtions and ca\u00adreers at risk , but only when those lies are ex\u00adposed. \u201d The let\u00adter then re\u00adminded the politi\u00adcians that Poli\u00adti\u00adFact , a fact-check\u00ading group , op\u00ader\u00adated in their state . The let\u00adter clearly im\u00adplied , \u201c Poli\u00adti\u00adFact will be watch\u00ading you. \u201d An\u00adoth\u00ader third of the law\u00admakers re\u00adceived a let\u00adter that ex\u00adcluded ref\u00ader\u00adences to fact check\u00ading . The last third re\u00adceived no let\u00adter .\nThroughout the elec\u00adtion cycle , Nyhan and Reifler logged the politi\u00adcians \u2019 Poli\u00adti\u00adFact rat\u00adings ( from \u201c true \u201d to \u201c pants on fire \u201d ) . They also had a re\u00adsearch as\u00adsist\u00adant comb through the me\u00addia cov\u00ader\u00adage of each le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00ador , search\u00ading for crit\u00adic\u00adal stor\u00adies .

Over\u00adall , only a very few le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adors \u2014 27 out of 1,169 \u2014 were called out on lies . But of those 27 , only five had re\u00adceived the threat\u00aden\u00ading let\u00adter \u2014 less than a third . That \u2019 s reas\u00adon enough to re\u00adsearch the idea fur\u00adther . \u201c This study was a first step , \u201d Nyhan says .\nOne way to help people look past their in\u00adnate par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship ?

Kev\u00adin Bin\u00adning , a Uni\u00adversity of Pitt\u00ads\u00adburgh psy\u00adcho\u00adlo\u00adgist , used it to re\u00adshape the way par\u00adtis\u00adans re\u00adacted to a 2008 pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial de\u00adbate .\nJust two days be\u00adfore the elec\u00adtion , Bin\u00adning as\u00adsembled 110 self-iden\u00adti\u00adfied Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and Demo\u00adcrats \u2014 60 Rs and 50 Ds \u2014 to watch a re\u00adcord\u00ading of a re\u00adcent de\u00adbate between Obama and Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan nom\u00adin\u00adee John Mc\u00adCain . Be\u00adfore they viewed the de\u00adbate , however , one group of par\u00adti\u00adcipants was giv\u00aden a list of non\u00adpolit\u00adic\u00adal val\u00adues such as \u201c so\u00adcial skills \u201d and \u201c cre\u00adativ\u00adity , \u201d and then asked to write briefly about an in\u00adstance when their own be\u00adha\u00advi\u00ador had em\u00adbod\u00adied one of those val\u00adues . ( The oth\u00ader group also wrote about non\u00adpolit\u00adic\u00adal val\u00adues , but they were asked to write about how those might be im\u00adport\u00adant to oth\u00ader people , not about their per\u00adson\u00adal ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adences . )\nBy hav\u00ading one group write about non\u00adpolit\u00adic\u00adal ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adences , Bin\u00adning wanted to get par\u00adti\u00adcipants think\u00ading of them\u00adselves as in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adals rather than par\u00adtis\u00adans . The idea was that af\u00adfirm\u00ading the hu\u00adman iden\u00adtity would make people would feel more re\u00adcept\u00adive to ideas that didn \u2019 t align with their world\u00adview .\nIt worked . When Bin\u00adning asked the par\u00adti\u00adcipants to judge the can\u00addid\u00adates \u2019 per\u00adform\u00adances , mem\u00adbers of that group were more likely than those in the oth\u00ader to give a fa\u00advor\u00adable rat\u00ading to the op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion can\u00addid\u00adate .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not like all of a sud\u00adden I say , \u2018 Well , yeah , Mc\u00adCain ac\u00adtu\u00adally won the de\u00adbate , \u2019 \u201d he ex\u00adplains , \u201c but we might say , \u2018 Well , yeah , Obama , I think he did have some good points , but Mc\u00adCain may have had some oth\u00ader good points as well . I don \u2019 t need to just blindly em\u00adbrace Obama. \u2019 \u201c\nWhich seems like the ideal way to con\u00adverse about polit\u00adics , right ? And it wasn \u2019 t a one-time ef\u00adfect . Ten days after the elec\u00adtion , Bin\u00adning asked the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans in the group what type of pres\u00adid\u00adent they thought Obama would be . Those who had been part of the group that wrote per\u00adson\u00adally about non\u00adpolit\u00adic\u00adal val\u00adues be\u00adfore watch\u00ading the de\u00adbate were sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adantly more op\u00adtim\u00adist\u00adic about the Obama pres\u00adid\u00adency .\nSo how might we per\u00adsuade people to set aside their blind par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship in oth\u00ader con\u00adtexts ? Let \u2019 s start with a for\u00adum in which the stakes are in\u00adfin\u00aditely lower than at the Middle East peace talks but where the par\u00adtis\u00adan vit\u00adri\u00adol runs every bit as high : In\u00adter\u00adnet com\u00adment sec\u00adtions .\nCom\u00adment sec\u00adtions bring out the worst in par\u00adtis\u00adan think\u00ading : ad hom\u00adinem at\u00adtacks , people who clearly will not be con\u00advinced of the oth\u00ader side , and stub\u00adborn ar\u00adgu\u00adments where users talk past one an\u00adoth\u00ader , not with each oth\u00ader . But maybe the struc\u00adture of com\u00adment sec\u00adtions , rather than the people do\u00ading the com\u00adment\u00ading , has turned them in\u00adto such in\u00adtel\u00adlec\u00adtu\u00adal sew\u00aders \u2014 and maybe a tweak or two at the mar\u00adgins could clean them up .\n\u201c You can think of com\u00adment sec\u00adtions as mini-in\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtions , \u201d Nyhan says . \u201c It \u2019 s a con\u00adtext in which de\u00adbate is hap\u00adpen\u00ading , and if we can help people be more civil to\u00adward each oth\u00ader , that might be a pos\u00adit\u00adive step . \u201d\nTalia Stroud is try\u00ading to take that step . As the dir\u00adect\u00ador of the En\u00adga\u00adging News pro\u00adject at the Uni\u00adversity of Texas ( Aus\u00adtin ) , she leads a re\u00adsearch group with the goal of mak\u00ading the In\u00adter\u00adnet more civil for polit\u00adics . \u201c It \u2019 s un\u00adbe\u00adliev\u00adably dif\u00adfi\u00adcult , \u201d she says .\nOne way to start , her re\u00adsearch sug\u00adgests , is to ree\u00advalu\u00adate the \u201c like \u201d but\u00adton , a com\u00admon fea\u00adture on com\u00adment threads . In the con\u00adtext of a polit\u00adic\u00adal-news art\u00adicle , \u201c lik\u00ading \u201d a com\u00adment or a post could ac\u00adtiv\u00adate us-versus-them think\u00ading . \u201c Lik\u00ading \u201d something means you as\u00adso\u00adci\u00adate with it . It re\u00adminds people of their par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship . \u201c So we did a study where we ma\u00adnip\u00adu\u00adlated wheth\u00ader it was a \u2018 like \u2019 but\u00adton or a \u2018 re\u00adspect \u2019 but\u00adton , \u201d Stroud says .

So if our brains are blind\u00ading us to in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion that chal\u00adlenges our par\u00adtis\u00adan pre\u00addis\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion, how can we hope ever to find com\u00admon ground?

They have no creases in their pla\u00adsticky skin, and their big, anime-style eyes shine death stares. They are dis\u00adtinctly non\u00adhu\u00adman. It\u2019s the ones in between that pose the prob\u00adlem, however. A face that\u2019s 90 per\u00adcent hu\u00adman and 10 per\u00adcent doll is plainly seen as hu\u00adman. But when the face is 50 per\u00adcent doll and 50 per\u00adcent hu\u00adman, that\u2019s where par\u00adtis\u00adan per\u00adspect\u00adive takes over.\n\nRe\u00adsearch\u00aders test par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship by ask\u00ading par\u00adti\u00adcipants to dis\u00adtin\u00adguish hu\u00adman from non\u00adhu\u00adman faces.

Be\u00adfore I see the first group, the Amer\u00adic\u00adan flag flashes, and I\u2019m told I\u2019m look\u00ading at my coun\u00adtry\u00admen. Be\u00adfore the second, a Rus\u00adsi\u00adan flag ap\u00adpears. These are faces of Rus\u00adsi\u00adans.\n\nAs I try to as\u00adsess which faces have a soul be\u00adhind them, a dark fa\u00adcet of par\u00adtis\u00adan psy\u00adcho\u00adlogy sur\u00adfaces. If the face be\u00adlongs to a team mem\u00adber \u2014 in my case, an Amer\u00adic\u00adan \u2014 I\u2019m more likely to as\u00adsign them hu\u00adman\u00adity. I\u2019m less in\u00adclined to do the same for Rus\u00adsi\u00adans.\n\nIt\u2019s not en\u00adtirely my fault \u2014 or, at least, not the fault of any con\u00adscious de\u00adcisions. In\u00adstead, it\u2019s just my brain pro\u00adcess fol\u00adlow\u00ading a well-worn pat\u00adtern. When Van Bavel looks at the brain scans of people in his doll\u00adhouse ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment, he finds that the brain re\u00adgions used to em\u00adpath\u00adize with oth\u00aders aren\u2019t as act\u00adive when a per\u00adson is eval\u00adu\u00adat\u00ading faces he or she has been told be\u00adlong to the oth\u00ader team.\n\nHU\u00adMANS\u2019 WILL\u00adING\u00adNESS TO de\u00adhu\u00adman\u00adize is of\u00adten men\u00adtioned along\u00adside some of the darkest chapters of his\u00adtory \u2014 the Holo\u00adcaust, gen\u00ado\u00adcide in Rwanda, the Kh\u00admer Rouge \u2014 when re\u00adgimes went to great lengths to build an\u00adger against \u201cthe oth\u00ader.\u201d In my case, the ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment re\u00adlies on a na\u00adtion\u00adal iden\u00adtity re\u00adin\u00adforced since birth.\n\nBut to cre\u00adate the base \u201cus and them\u201d struc\u00adture, none of that is needed. The brain is so hard\u00adwired to build such groups that Van Bavel says he can turn any\u00adone on the street in\u00adto a par\u00adtis\u00adan. \u201cI can do it in five minutes with a ran\u00addom stranger,\u201d he says. All it takes is a coin flip.\n\n\u201cSome\u00adbody comes in\u00adto your lab and you tell them, \u2018You\u2019re part of the blue team,\u2019 \u201d he ex\u00adplains. \u201cThe next per\u00adson who comes in, you flip a coin, let\u2019s say it comes up the oth\u00ader way. And you say, \u2018You\u2019re on the red team.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThat\u2019s it. The team\u00admates nev\u00ader have to meet. Or in\u00adter\u00adact. There doesn\u2019t need to be any\u00adthing at stake. But with\u00adin minutes, these in\u00adsta-par\u00adtis\u00adans like their team\u00admates bet\u00adter than they like the oth\u00ader guys. And it shows when Van Bavel puts his sub\u00adjects through his MRI doll\u00adhouse.\n\nRed-team mem\u00adbers are more likely to see hu\u00admans when they\u2019re told they\u2019re look\u00ading at fel\u00adlow red-team faces. Blue-team mem\u00adbers re\u00adspond the same way. Oth\u00ader tests re\u00adveal that red-team mem\u00adbers re\u00admem\u00adber red-team faces more ac\u00adcur\u00adately, and if Van Bavel asks sub\u00adjects to al\u00adloc\u00adate money, red-team mem\u00adbers will pay out more to their own. Team mem\u00adbers also have less sym\u00adpathy for those on the oth\u00ader side, and even ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adence pleas\u00adure while read\u00ading about their pain.\n\nI\u2019m not just in\u00adside the MRI to be stumped by Rus\u00adsi\u00adan dolls. The re\u00adsearch\u00aders are also check\u00ading to see if my brain has a con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive or lib\u00ader\u00adal shape.\n\nThe au\u00adthor be\u00ading loaded in\u00adto an MRI ma\u00adchine. (Reena Flores)In 2011, a team of Brit\u00adish sci\u00adent\u00adists pub\u00adlished a pa\u00adper that found that brain struc\u00adtures cor\u00adrel\u00adated with polit\u00adic\u00adal ori\u00adent\u00ada\u00adtion.

The res\u00adults ad\u00added to a body of re\u00adsearch that finds con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives and lib\u00ader\u00adals have dif\u00adfer\u00adent physiolo\u00adgic\u00adal re\u00adsponses to the en\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment, and even per\u00adceive the world dif\u00adfer\u00adently.\n\nAt NYU, they\u2019re test\u00ading that con\u00adclu\u00adsion, and the mag\u00adnets around me are meas\u00adur\u00ading the volume of my amy\u00adg\u00addala. Be\u00adfore my MRI, I took a test aimed at giv\u00ading me a score on the re\u00adsearch\u00aders\u2019 \u201csys\u00adtem-jus\u00adti\u00adfic\u00ada\u00adtion scale,\u201d a meas\u00adure that cor\u00adrel\u00adates with one com\u00adpon\u00adent of where a per\u00adson falls on the lib\u00ader\u00adal-to-con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive spec\u00adtrum. People who score high on sys\u00adtem jus\u00adti\u00adfic\u00ada\u00adtion tend to be pat\u00adri\u00adot\u00adic and de\u00adfend\u00aders of the status quo. Those who score low tend to be the rebels. So far, with 100 par\u00adti\u00adcipants, Van Bavel\u2019s group is find\u00ading mean\u00ading\u00adful dif\u00adfer\u00adences between the brains of high sys\u00adtem-jus\u00adti\u00adfi\u00aders and low sys\u00adtem-jus\u00adti\u00adfi\u00aders.\n\nDo You Have a Rebel\u2019s Brain? Quiz\n\n(Col\u00adleagues joked that I might want to keep my test res\u00adults to my\u00adself if I wanted to con\u00adtin\u00adue work\u00ading as a non\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan journ\u00adal\u00adist in Wash\u00ading\u00adton. But \u2014 for the re\u00adcord \u2014 I\u2019m a lab-cer\u00adti\u00adfied mod\u00ader\u00adate: \u201cYeah, you were right in the heart of the dis\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtion, not only in the terms of your sys\u00adtem-jus\u00adti\u00adfic\u00ada\u00adtion tend\u00aden\u00adcies but also your amy\u00adg\u00addala volume is very healthy,\u201d Van Bavel tells me the day after, laugh\u00ading.)\n\nBUT WHEN IT COMES to Amer\u00adic\u00adan polit\u00adics, how troubled should we be by any of these find\u00adings? Amer\u00adica\u2019s par\u00adtis\u00adan di\u00advide is as old as Amer\u00adica\u2019s demo\u00adcracy. And it\u2019s neither feas\u00adible nor de\u00adsir\u00adable to hope for a na\u00adtion\u00adal con\u00adsensus on every is\u00adsue. Even if we all worked from the same set of facts, and even if we all un\u00adder\u00adstood those facts per\u00adfectly, dif\u00adfer\u00adences of opin\u00adion would \u2014 and should \u2014 re\u00admain. Those opin\u00adions are not the prob\u00adlem. The trouble is when we\u2019re so blinded by our par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship that it over\u00adrides reas\u00adon \u2014 and re\u00adsearch sug\u00adgests that is hap\u00adpen\u00ading all the time.\n\nWith just a hint of par\u00adtis\u00adan prim\u00ading, an Ari\u00adzona State Uni\u00adversity re\u00adsearch\u00ader was able to in\u00adstantly blind Demo\u00adcrats to a non\u00adcon\u00adtro\u00adver\u00adsial fact, lead\u00ading them im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adately to fail to solve the easi\u00adest of math prob\u00adlems. In the 2010 ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment, polit\u00adic\u00adal sci\u00adent\u00adist Mark Ramirez asked sub\u00adjects two sim\u00adil\u00adar ques\u00adtions. The con\u00adtrol group saw this ques\u00adtion: \u201cWould you say that com\u00adpared to 2008, the level of un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment in this coun\u00adtry has got\u00adten bet\u00adter, stayed the same, or got\u00adten worse?\u201d A sep\u00adar\u00adate group saw this one: \u201cWould you say that the level of un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment in this coun\u00adtry has got\u00adten bet\u00adter, stayed the same, or got\u00adten worse since Barack Obama was elec\u00adted Pres\u00adid\u00adent?\u201d\n\nThe key dif\u00adfer\u00adence between the two: the first men\u00adtions the time peri\u00adod for as\u00adsess\u00ading un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment, while the second frames the is\u00adsue around Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama. When asked the first ques\u00adtion, Demo\u00adcrats and Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans re\u00adspon\u00added sim\u00adil\u00adarly, with most say\u00ading un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment had re\u00admained about the same. But among sub\u00adjects who got the second ques\u00adtion, opin\u00adions shif\u00adted along par\u00adtis\u00adan lines: Around 60 per\u00adcent of Demo\u00adcrats said un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment had got\u00adten bet\u00adter or some\u00adwhat bet\u00adter, and about 75 per\u00adcent of Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans said the op\u00adpos\u00adite.\n\nIn fact, the un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment rate in\u00adcreased between Obama\u2019s elec\u00adtion and Ramirez\u2019s study. One can ar\u00adgue about wheth\u00ader this is a fair frame for eval\u00adu\u00adat\u00ading this or any pres\u00adid\u00adent\u2019s eco\u00adnom\u00adic re\u00adcord, but from a raw-num\u00adbers per\u00adspect\u00adive, the rise in the un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment rate between 2008 and 2010 is in\u00addis\u00adput\u00adable.\n\nBut even giv\u00ading Demo\u00adcrats that in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion did not in\u00adcrease the ac\u00adcur\u00adacy of their re\u00adsponses. Ramirez\u2019s study asked some par\u00adti\u00adcipants the fol\u00adlow\u00ading ques\u00adtion: \u201cThe U.S. Bur\u00adeau of Labor Stat\u00adist\u00adics shows un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment has in\u00adcreased by 4.6 per\u00adcent since 2008. Would you say that the level of un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment in this coun\u00adtry has got\u00adten bet\u00adter, stayed the same, or got\u00adten worse since Barack Obama was elec\u00adted Pres\u00adid\u00adent?\u201d\n\nClearly, the an\u00adswer is in the sen\u00adtence that im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adately pre\u00adcedes the ques\u00adtion. But the men\u00adtion of Obama launched a par\u00adtis\u00adan men\u00adtal pro\u00adcess that led many astray: Nearly 60 per\u00adcent of Demo\u00adcrats said un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment had lessened since Obama\u2019s elec\u00adtion.\n\nEs\u00adsen\u00adtially, once Demo\u00adcrats fo\u00adcused on Obama, most of them largely ig\u00adnored the facts. (About 80 per\u00adcent of Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans got the an\u00adswer right when it was spoon-fed to them, but Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans temp\u00adted to cry vic\u00adtory should be cau\u00adtioned that re\u00adsearch\u00aders have found them to be sim\u00adil\u00adarly off base in as\u00adsess\u00ading the eco\u00adnomy when one of their own is in the Oval Of\u00adfice.)\n\nRamirez\u2019s ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment also re\u00adveals that our bi\u00adases don\u2019t com\u00adpletely blind us to in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion, however. When he gave Demo\u00adcrats the cor\u00adrect un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment stat\u00adist\u00adics, it did not change their an\u00adswers, but it did make them less con\u00adfid\u00adent in those re\u00adsponses, as re\u00adpor\u00adted in a post-test ques\u00adtion\u00adnaire. \u201cIt tells me that people might ac\u00adtu\u00adally be pro\u00adcessing the in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion in an un\u00adbiased way,\u201d Ramirez says.\n\nThe ques\u00adtion, then, is how to amp\u00adli\u00adfy that un\u00adbiased pro\u00adcessing to over\u00adcome the par\u00adtis\u00adan blind\u00adness.\n\nBRENDAN NYHAN KNOWS just how hard it is to move that men\u00adtal needle.\n\n\u201cI had the dream of, if we give people the right in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion, it\u2019ll make a dif\u00adfer\u00adence,\u201d says Nyhan, a polit\u00adic\u00adal sci\u00adent\u00adist at Dart\u00admouth and con\u00adtrib\u00adut\u00ador to The New York Times\u2018s The Up\u00adshot.\n\nBut after 15 years of throw\u00ading facts in people\u2019s faces, Nyhan has found the mat\u00adter to be much more com\u00adplic\u00adated. In the early 2000s, he cofoun\u00added the fact-check\u00ading web\u00adsite Spin\u00adsan\u00adity to com\u00adbat the \u201che said, she said\u201d cov\u00ader\u00adage he saw in the me\u00addia. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the work we did, but it did il\u00adlus\u00adtrate how hard it was to change people\u2019s minds, even among the se\u00adlect group of people who were will\u00ading to take the time to read a non\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan fact-check\u00ading web\u00adsite,\u201d Nyhan said.\n\nMore re\u00adcently, Nyhan at\u00adtemp\u00adted to de\u00adbunk an ar\u00adgu\u00adment that is grow\u00ading in pop\u00adular\u00adity but ut\u00adterly lack\u00ading in sci\u00adentif\u00adic sup\u00adport: that par\u00adents shouldn\u2019t have their chil\u00addren vac\u00adcin\u00adated.\n\nNyhan and his col\u00adlab\u00ador\u00adat\u00adors wanted to con\u00advince par\u00adents who were against vac\u00adcin\u00ada\u00adtions that their op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion was un\u00adfoun\u00added. Work\u00ading with a large sample of 1,759 par\u00adents, the team sent them a vari\u00adety of ma\u00adter\u00adi\u00adal, in\u00adclud\u00ading pamph\u00adlets that ex\u00adplained the lack of evid\u00adence link\u00ading vac\u00adcin\u00ada\u00adtions with aut\u00adism, ex\u00adplan\u00ada\u00adtions of the dangers of measles, pho\u00adtos of sick chil\u00addren whose dis\u00adeases could have been pre\u00adven\u00adted, and a story about an in\u00adfant who al\u00admost died from in\u00adfec\u00adtion. Some were ap\u00adpeals to pure reas\u00adon; some were ap\u00adpeals to pure emo\u00adtion.\n\nNoth\u00ading worked. One of the in\u00adter\u00adven\u00adtions \u2014 the pamph\u00adlet ex\u00adplain\u00ading the lack of evid\u00adence \u2014 ac\u00adtu\u00adally made anti-vac\u00adcin\u00ada\u00adtion par\u00adents even less in\u00adclined to vac\u00adcin\u00adate. \u201cSome of the con\u00adclu\u00adsions of that re\u00adsearch people find pretty de\u00adpress\u00ading,\u201d Nyhan says. \u201cMy\u00adself in\u00adcluded.\u201d\n\nIn an\u00adoth\u00ader study, Nyhan wanted to see if he could find a real-world way to press ac\u00adtu\u00adal politi\u00adcians to be bet\u00adter hand\u00adlers of the facts. In the months lead\u00ading up to the 2012 elec\u00adtion, Nyhan and coau\u00adthor Jason Reifler per\u00adformed an ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment on 1,169 un\u00adwit\u00adting state le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adors. They wanted to see if fact checks could mo\u00adtiv\u00adate the politi\u00adcians to be more truth\u00adful. A third of the le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adors re\u00adceived a let\u00adter that con\u00adtained a veiled threat. It read: \u201cPoliti\u00adcians who lie put their repu\u00adta\u00adtions and ca\u00adreers at risk, but only when those lies are ex\u00adposed.\u201d The let\u00adter then re\u00adminded the politi\u00adcians that Poli\u00adti\u00adFact, a fact-check\u00ading group, op\u00ader\u00adated in their state. The let\u00adter clearly im\u00adplied, \u201cPoli\u00adti\u00adFact will be watch\u00ading you.\u201d An\u00adoth\u00ader third of the law\u00admakers re\u00adceived a let\u00adter that ex\u00adcluded ref\u00ader\u00adences to fact check\u00ading. The last third re\u00adceived no let\u00adter.\n\nThroughout the elec\u00adtion cycle, Nyhan and Reifler logged the politi\u00adcians\u2019 Poli\u00adti\u00adFact rat\u00adings (from \u201ctrue\u201d to \u201cpants on fire\u201d). They also had a re\u00adsearch as\u00adsist\u00adant comb through the me\u00addia cov\u00ader\u00adage of each le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00ador, search\u00ading for crit\u00adic\u00adal stor\u00adies. The res\u00adults, pending pub\u00adlic\u00ada\u00adtion in the Amer\u00adic\u00adan Journ\u00adal of Polit\u00adic\u00adal Sci\u00adence, were lim\u00adited but prom\u00adising. Over\u00adall, only a very few le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adors \u2014 27 out of 1,169 \u2014 were called out on lies. But of those 27, only five had re\u00adceived the threat\u00aden\u00ading let\u00adter \u2014 less than a third. That\u2019s reas\u00adon enough to re\u00adsearch the idea fur\u00adther. \u201cThis study was a first step,\u201d Nyhan says.\n\nOne way to help people look past their in\u00adnate par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship? Pay them to do it.\n\n\u201cHu\u00adman psy\u00adcho\u00adlogy isn\u2019t go\u00ading to change,\u201d he says. \u201cThe factors that make people vul\u00adner\u00adable to mis\u00adin\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion aren\u2019t go\u00ading to change. But the in\u00adcent\u00adives fa\u00adcing elites can change, and we can design in\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtions that func\u00adtion bet\u00adter or worse un\u00adder po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion and that do a bet\u00adter or worse job at provid\u00ading in\u00adcent\u00adives to make ac\u00adcur\u00adate state\u00adments.\u201d\n\nTHERE\u2019S AN EASI\u00adER WAY to help people look past their in\u00adnate par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship: Pay them to do it.\n\nA 2013 study out of Prin\u00adceton found that mon\u00adet\u00adary in\u00adcent\u00adives at\u00adten\u00adu\u00adate the par\u00adtis\u00adan gap in an\u00adswers to ques\u00adtions about the eco\u00adnomy. The re\u00adsearch\u00aders de\u00adsigned an ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adment sim\u00adil\u00adar to Ramirez\u2019s un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment study but with a modi\u00adfic\u00ada\u00adtion: Some par\u00adti\u00adcipants were plainly in\u00adformed, \u201cWe will pay you for an\u00adswer\u00ading cor\u00adrectly.\u201d All it took was $1 or $2 to dra\u00admat\u00adic\u00adally im\u00adprove the chances of a right an\u00adswer, cut\u00adting the par\u00adtis\u00adan gap between Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and Demo\u00adcrats in half \u2014 half!\n\nOf course, a mass \u201cpay Amer\u00adic\u00adans to pay more at\u00adten\u00adtion to facts\u201d cam\u00adpaign isn\u2019t hap\u00adpen\u00ading. So the ques\u00adtion, then, is how do we get people to be more ob\u00adject\u00adive, without throw\u00ading money at them?\n\nJimmy Carter dis\u00adcovered one an\u00adswer dur\u00ading the 1978 peace ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adations between Egyp\u00adtian Pres\u00adid\u00adent An\u00adwar Sad\u00adat and Is\u00adraeli Prime Min\u00adis\u00adter Men\u00ada\u00adchem Be\u00adgin. The talks were on the brink of col\u00adlapsing in their fi\u00adnal hours, and the prime min\u00adis\u00adter was pre\u00adpared to walk. That\u2019s when Carter dir\u00adec\u00adted his sec\u00adret\u00adary to find out all the names of Be\u00adgin\u2019s grand\u00adchil\u00addren. Carter auto\u00adgraphed pho\u00adtos for them and per\u00adson\u00adally gave them to the Is\u00adraeli lead\u00ader. \u201cHe had taken a blood oath that he would nev\u00ader dis\u00admantle an Is\u00adraeli set\u00adtle\u00adment,\u201d Carter later re\u00adcalled in an in\u00adter\u00adview. \u201cHe looked at those eight pho\u00adto\u00adgraphs and tears began to run down his cheeks \u2014 and mine \u2014 as he read the names.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, Be\u00adgin was back at the ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adat\u00ading table. By ap\u00adpeal\u00ading to a non\u00adpolit\u00adic\u00adal idea Be\u00adgin cared about \u2014 his fam\u00adily \u2014 Carter was able to bring him to a place where he could bend.\n\nIn 1978, Jimmy Carter\u2019s ap\u00adpeal to Is\u00adraeli Prime Min\u00adis\u00adter Men\u00ada\u00adchem Be\u00adgin\u2019s sense of fam\u00adily kept Be\u00adgin at the ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adat\u00ading table with Egyp\u00adtian Pres\u00adid\u00adent An\u00adwar Sad\u00adat. (AP Photo/Bob Daugh\u00aderty)The tech\u00adnique works even when world peace isn\u2019t on the line. Kev\u00adin Bin\u00adning, a Uni\u00adversity of Pitt\u00ads\u00adburgh psy\u00adcho\u00adlo\u00adgist, used it to re\u00adshape the way par\u00adtis\u00adans re\u00adacted to a 2008 pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial de\u00adbate.\n\nJust two days be\u00adfore the elec\u00adtion, Bin\u00adning as\u00adsembled 110 self-iden\u00adti\u00adfied Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and Demo\u00adcrats \u2014 60 Rs and 50 Ds \u2014 to watch a re\u00adcord\u00ading of a re\u00adcent de\u00adbate between Obama and Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan nom\u00adin\u00adee John Mc\u00adCain. Be\u00adfore they viewed the de\u00adbate, however, one group of par\u00adti\u00adcipants was giv\u00aden a list of non\u00adpolit\u00adic\u00adal val\u00adues such as \u201cso\u00adcial skills\u201d and \u201ccre\u00adativ\u00adity,\u201d and then asked to write briefly about an in\u00adstance when their own be\u00adha\u00advi\u00ador had em\u00adbod\u00adied one of those val\u00adues. (The oth\u00ader group also wrote about non\u00adpolit\u00adic\u00adal val\u00adues, but they were asked to write about how those might be im\u00adport\u00adant to oth\u00ader people, not about their per\u00adson\u00adal ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adences.)\n\nBy hav\u00ading one group write about non\u00adpolit\u00adic\u00adal ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adences, Bin\u00adning wanted to get par\u00adti\u00adcipants think\u00ading of them\u00adselves as in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adals rather than par\u00adtis\u00adans. The idea was that af\u00adfirm\u00ading the hu\u00adman iden\u00adtity would make people would feel more re\u00adcept\u00adive to ideas that didn\u2019t align with their world\u00adview.\n\nIt worked. When Bin\u00adning asked the par\u00adti\u00adcipants to judge the can\u00addid\u00adates\u2019 per\u00adform\u00adances, mem\u00adbers of that group were more likely than those in the oth\u00ader to give a fa\u00advor\u00adable rat\u00ading to the op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion can\u00addid\u00adate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like all of a sud\u00adden I say, \u2018Well, yeah, Mc\u00adCain ac\u00adtu\u00adally won the de\u00adbate,\u2019 \u201d he ex\u00adplains, \u201cbut we might say, \u2018Well, yeah, Obama, I think he did have some good points, but Mc\u00adCain may have had some oth\u00ader good points as well. I don\u2019t need to just blindly em\u00adbrace Obama.\u2019 \u201c\n\nWhich seems like the ideal way to con\u00adverse about polit\u00adics, right? And it wasn\u2019t a one-time ef\u00adfect. Ten days after the elec\u00adtion, Bin\u00adning asked the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans in the group what type of pres\u00adid\u00adent they thought Obama would be. Those who had been part of the group that wrote per\u00adson\u00adally about non\u00adpolit\u00adic\u00adal val\u00adues be\u00adfore watch\u00ading the de\u00adbate were sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adantly more op\u00adtim\u00adist\u00adic about the Obama pres\u00adid\u00adency.\n\nSo how might we per\u00adsuade people to set aside their blind par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship in oth\u00ader con\u00adtexts? Let\u2019s start with a for\u00adum in which the stakes are in\u00adfin\u00aditely lower than at the Middle East peace talks but where the par\u00adtis\u00adan vit\u00adri\u00adol runs every bit as high: In\u00adter\u00adnet com\u00adment sec\u00adtions.\n\nCom\u00adment sec\u00adtions bring out the worst in par\u00adtis\u00adan think\u00ading: ad hom\u00adinem at\u00adtacks, people who clearly will not be con\u00advinced of the oth\u00ader side, and stub\u00adborn ar\u00adgu\u00adments where users talk past one an\u00adoth\u00ader, not with each oth\u00ader. But maybe the struc\u00adture of com\u00adment sec\u00adtions, rather than the people do\u00ading the com\u00adment\u00ading, has turned them in\u00adto such in\u00adtel\u00adlec\u00adtu\u00adal sew\u00aders \u2014 and maybe a tweak or two at the mar\u00adgins could clean them up.\n\n\u201cYou can think of com\u00adment sec\u00adtions as mini-in\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtions,\u201d Nyhan says. \u201cIt\u2019s a con\u00adtext in which de\u00adbate is hap\u00adpen\u00ading, and if we can help people be more civil to\u00adward each oth\u00ader, that might be a pos\u00adit\u00adive step.\u201d\n\nTalia Stroud is try\u00ading to take that step. As the dir\u00adect\u00ador of the En\u00adga\u00adging News pro\u00adject at the Uni\u00adversity of Texas (Aus\u00adtin), she leads a re\u00adsearch group with the goal of mak\u00ading the In\u00adter\u00adnet more civil for polit\u00adics. \u201cIt\u2019s un\u00adbe\u00adliev\u00adably dif\u00adfi\u00adcult,\u201d she says.\n\nOne way to start, her re\u00adsearch sug\u00adgests, is to ree\u00advalu\u00adate the \u201clike\u201d but\u00adton, a com\u00admon fea\u00adture on com\u00adment threads. In the con\u00adtext of a polit\u00adic\u00adal-news art\u00adicle, \u201clik\u00ading\u201d a com\u00adment or a post could ac\u00adtiv\u00adate us-versus-them think\u00ading. \u201cLik\u00ading\u201d something means you as\u00adso\u00adci\u00adate with it. It re\u00adminds people of their par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship. \u201cSo we did a study where we ma\u00adnip\u00adu\u00adlated wheth\u00ader it was a \u2018like\u2019 but\u00adton or a \u2018re\u00adspect\u2019 but\u00adton,\u201d Stroud says. She found that people were more will\u00ading to ex\u00adpress \u201cre\u00adspect\u201d for ar\u00adgu\u00adments that ran counter to their own.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cnot \u2018I like what you\u2019re say\u00ading\u2019 but \u2018I re\u00adspect it\u2019 even though I might not agree with you,\u201d she says. \u201cThat showed some of the power of really small things and changes that could be eas\u00adily im\u00adple\u00admen\u00adted.\u201d\n\nA MONTH OF SPEAK\u00adING TO sci\u00adent\u00adists about the polit\u00adic\u00adal brain pro\u00adduced no short\u00adage of de\u00adpress\u00ading con\u00adclu\u00adsions. Their re\u00adsearch re\u00adveals our brains to be frus\u00adtrat\u00adingly in\u00adept at ra\u00adtion\u00adal, ob\u00adject\u00adive polit\u00adic\u00adal dis\u00adcourse. And those rev\u00adel\u00ada\u00adtions come at a time when elec\u00adted of\u00adfi\u00adcials have strong in\u00adcent\u00adives to stay the par\u00adtis\u00adan course, and when the people who elect those of\u00adfi\u00adcials are in\u00adcreas\u00adingly get\u00adting their polit\u00adic\u00adal news through sources pre-tailored to re\u00adin\u00adforce their opin\u00adions.\n\nA scan of the au\u00adthor\u2019s brain. (Reena Flores)But the re\u00adsearch is more than just an\u00adoth\u00ader ex\u00adplan\u00ada\u00adtion for our cur\u00adrent par\u00adtis\u00adan mor\u00adass. On bal\u00adance, it of\u00adfers a bet\u00adter case for op\u00adtim\u00adism \u2014 about Con\u00adgress, about voters, about your out\u00adspoken ex\u00adtrem\u00adist uncle at Thanks\u00adgiv\u00ading, and about the power of reas\u00adon in demo\u00adcracy. Be\u00adcause the re\u00adsearch is also re\u00adveal\u00ading that our brains, while im\u00adper\u00adfect, are sur\u00adpris\u00adingly flex\u00adible, and that they can be nudged in a bet\u00adter dir\u00adec\u00adtion. Yes, we wall ourselves off from un\u00adap\u00adpeal\u00ading truths. But when mo\u00adtiv\u00adated \u2014 by money, by the right en\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment, by an af\u00adfirmed sense of self, by in\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtions that value truth and ci\u00advil\u00adity \u2014 those walls come down.\n\nOut\u00adside of the labor\u00adat\u00adory, people are put\u00adting that re\u00adsearch in\u00adto prac\u00adtice, de\u00advel\u00adop\u00ading civic for\u00adums with our men\u00adtal short\u00adcom\u00adings in mind.\n\nAfter a dis\u00adpute over a coal plant di\u00advided Tal\u00adl\u00ada\u00adhassee, Flor\u00adida, in\u00adto furi\u00adously par\u00adtis\u00adan camps, Al\u00adlan Katz, then a city com\u00admis\u00adsion\u00ader, de\u00adcided he had enough. \u201cIt was very nasty, it was very con\u00adten\u00adtious, it was very per\u00adson\u00adal,\u201d Katz re\u00adcalls of the 2006 de\u00adbates. \u201cFacts didn\u2019t mat\u00adter.\u201d\n\nKatz, who is also a former U.S. am\u00adbas\u00adsad\u00ador to Por\u00adtugal, joined with oth\u00ader com\u00admunity mem\u00adbers to cre\u00adate the Vil\u00adlage Square, which hosts events where the pub\u00adlic is in\u00advited to dis\u00adcuss on\u00adgo\u00ading is\u00adsues with ex\u00adperts and act\u00adiv\u00adists. In\u00adci\u00advil\u00adity and non-truths are not tol\u00ader\u00adated. Dur\u00ading de\u00adbates, the Vil\u00adlage Square em\u00adploys fact check\u00aders to keep people in line. \u201cSo people couldn\u2019t make s\u2014t up,\u201d Katz says. There\u2019s also a ci\u00advil\u00adity bell: If people start yelling, the bell is rung to re\u00admind them of their bet\u00adter nature.\n\nFor the first meet\u00ading, 175 people showed up. Now the Vil\u00adlage Square is run\u00adning 20 pro\u00adgrams a year in Tal\u00adl\u00ada\u00adhassee, and it has ex\u00adpan\u00added in\u00adto St. Peters\u00adburg, Kan\u00adsas City, and Sac\u00adra\u00admento. In Tal\u00adl\u00ada\u00adhassee, city of\u00adfi\u00adcials ask the Vil\u00adlage Square to host pub\u00adlic for\u00adums on di\u00advis\u00adive is\u00adsues.\n\nWhen people con\u00adsider them\u00adselves to be part of the same team, they do a much bet\u00adter job of drop\u00adping their com\u00adbat\u00adive stance and pro\u00adcessing the world through a less par\u00adtis\u00adan lens.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not try\u00ading to turn lib\u00ader\u00adals in\u00adto con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives or vice versa,\u201d Katz says. \u201cBut the only way to get people to see the oth\u00ader point of view, even if they don\u2019t agree with it, is to do it in per\u00adson.\u201d\n\nKatz and his fel\u00adlow or\u00adgan\u00adizers are re\u00adly\u00ading on people find\u00ading a com\u00admon hu\u00adman\u00adity, and in so do\u00ading, he is play\u00ading to one of the brain\u2019s great strengths: The same tri\u00adbal cog\u00adnit\u00adive pro\u00adcesses that make it easy to turn people against one an\u00adoth\u00ader can also be har\u00adnessed to bring them to\u00adgeth\u00ader.\n\nWhen people con\u00adsider them\u00adselves to be part of the same team, be it as Vil\u00adlage Square par\u00adti\u00adcipants, as fel\u00adlow Amer\u00adic\u00adans, or even \u2014 one might dream \u2014 as fel\u00adlow mem\u00adbers of Con\u00adgress, they do a much bet\u00adter job of drop\u00adping their com\u00adbat\u00adive stance and pro\u00adcessing the world through a less par\u00adtis\u00adan lens.\n\nAnd we make those iden\u00adtity jumps all the time, as our brains are wired to let us do.\n\nSome\u00adtimes, in the middle of his red team/blue team ex\u00ader\u00adcise, Van Bavel will switch a par\u00adti\u00adcipant from one group to the oth\u00ader. \u201cWe say, \u2018Listen, there\u2019s been a mis\u00adtake, you\u2019re ac\u00adtu\u00adally on the oth\u00ader team,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cAnd the mo\u00adment we do, we com\u00adpletely re\u00adverse their em\u00adpathy. Sud\u00addenly, they care about every\u00adbody who is in their new in-group.\u201d",
