Be the first to hear about Nation Travels destinations , and explore the world with kindred spirits .\nJulian Assange \u2019 s strange seven-year residence in Ecuador \u2019 s London embassy has ended , and Assange , thanks to the American president he helped elect , is now in British custody facing a US extradition request . The question now is what the freshly unsealed Trump Justice Department indictment against him means , and doesn \u2019 t mean\u2014for Assange , for the British courts , which must decide whether to hand him over , and for American press freedom . Ad Policy\nCompared with the worst that Assange and his supporters have always feared\u2014black-hooded rendition , indictment under the Espionage Act , the death penalty\u2014the indictment , filed under seal in 2017 , may seem like good news . It \u2019 s brief\u2014six pages . He is accused of conspiring with Chelsea Manning to hack one password on a classified government database . There \u2019 s no criminal allegation of spying , nothing touching Russia or the DNC , no broader list of WikiLeaks co-conspirators . As for punishment , while hacking a government password is a felony , the charge carries a maximum prison term of five years\u2014less time than Assange \u2019 s voluntary confinement in his diplomatic London quarters .\nThe indictment focuses on one brief period in March 2010 . According to the indictment , Manning , who had already leaked the vast Defense Department databases exposing an assortment of US abuses\u2014what WikiLeaks called the Iraq War Logs\u2014was trying to hack into a particular database without her own credentials . The indictment , citing decrypted chats , says Assange \u201c agreed to assist Manning in cracking a password . \u201d\nThis is a narrow offense . It also separates Assange , at least on technical grounds , from journalists who receive leaked material but who don \u2019 t directly participate in extracting secret files . It \u2019 s the difference between The New York Times \u2019 Neil Sheehan receiving the photocopied Pentagon Papers from Daniel Ellsberg , and a reporter actively breaking into a government office with a crowbar to yank the papers from their drawers . In the digital realm , that difference has sometimes tripped up journalists before Assange : In my journalism-ethics class every year , we examine the troubling , and ultimately tragic , case of a Cincinnati Enquirer reporter who in 1998 torpedoed an otherwise-brilliant investigative series on the Chiquita corporation by repeatedly hacking into that massively corrupt company \u2019 s voicemail system . That single illegal act gave an opening for Chiquita to successfully demand that the Enquirer un-publish and renounce the entire series , and it allowed prosecutors to threaten a criminal charge to force the reporter to name his source . Related Article The Indictment of Julian Assange Is a Threat to Press Freedom Bruce Shapiro\nI suspect some reporters and some press-freedom advocates will see Assange \u2019 s direct involvement in password-hacking as grounds to walk away from the case . The man violated journalistic norms , goes the argument\u2014and whether his hacking counts as misguided narcissism or a principled act of civil disobedience , it \u2019 s no longer about freedom of the press .\nYet read that six-page indictment more closely , and the alarm bells should sound afresh . Here \u2019 s why : Assange and Manning are not just being charged with a simple act of hacking . The indictment explicitly describes Assange \u2019 s password hack as part of a broader WikiLeaks conspiracy to \u201c publicly disseminate the information on its website. \u201d The indictment takes note of WikiLeaks \u2019 use of a cloud-based dropbox for confidential document dumps .\nMost significantly , the indictment\u2014again relying , irony of ironies , on hacked and decrypted Jabber chats\u2014delves deep into the source-publisher relationship , noting that Assange \u201c encouraged \u201d a weary Manning \u2019 s leaking , and then quoting this bit of chat : Current Issue View our current issue\nMANNING : After this upload , that \u2019 s all I really have got left . ASSANGE : Curious eyes never run dry in my experience .\nThere \u2019 s the rub . By actively hacking a password , Assange may have committed a crime . But \u201c conspiring \u201d to disseminate leaked information is something countless reporters do every day . Cloud-based confidential document dumps and other security measures specified in the indictment are now staples of investigative reporting , discussed openly at conferences and advertised on muckraking websites . Most significantly : Cajoling , encouraging , wheedling , and nurturing sources who have access to secret information is at the heart of independent journalism .\nWhat we have in the Assange indictment , in other words , is a narrow but still-consequential attack on the practice of investigative journalism . The same attack is evident in another aspect of this case that has received too little attention : the jailing of Chelsea Manning for her refusal to cooperate with this investigation . From the scope of today \u2019 s indictment , it \u2019 s clear that the Justice Department sought Manning \u2019 s cooperation in building their conspiracy case . In the long history of American prosecutors seeking to compel testimony from reporters , I can not think of another case in which a source has volunteered to go to jail to protect a publisher . Manning is an individual of exceptional courage and integrity , who deserves respect and defense from any reporter who \u2019 s ever been passed a file folder or flash drive .\nJulian Assange remains a confounding , contradictory character . But this indictment has nothing to do his atrocious political judgment in 2016 , his unreasonable expectations as a guest of the Ecuadoreans , or the sometimes-debatable ethical standards guiding WikiLeaks \u2019 editorial decisions . You can even argue that in stepping over the publishing line from receiving leaks to active hacking , Assange jeopardized Manning and WikiLeaks itself . But this indictment raises far more consequential questions , especially coming from an administration already committed to attacking press freedom on multiple fronts . In that context , this is a politically motivated prosecution . At bottom , it is about whether investigative journalists and publishers , from little community news outlets to transnational publishing platforms , enjoy First Amendment protection in their relationships with confidential sources . It is , in other words , about the future vigor of investigative reporting .",
