( Erin Scott/Reuters )\nIf the president can become a bit more presidential , his reelection will be all but assured .\nThis is the time for President Trump to deprive his enemies of the last weapon that could be employed against him that could cause him any harm : the largely false , but still troublesome , issue of his personality and routine behavior . Other lines of attack have come to naught : Collusion with Russia , accusations of racism provoking outbursts of mass murder ( by uttering \u201c racially charged statements , \u201d in the inadvertently Orwellian words of CNN \u2019 s most witless talking head , Don Lemon ) , the verbal recession confected by the world-renowned economists of CNN and MSNBC , all of it has collapsed . Illegal border crossings are in sharp decline as the wall is steadily extended , and Mexico cooperates in arresting the flow of illegal migrants to the United States , all within the framework of a new free-trade agreement and the steady relocation of manufacturing designed for the U.S. market from China to Mexico ( and other countries ) . The only arguments left to the puling and squabbling Democrats are ever more implausible lurches to the left and the lingering sense that Donald Trump , though not the extremist or the incompetent that many had declaimed and predicted , is just not suitable to be president .\nIt does the president no favors to pretend that there are not still a significant number of people who have an uneasy feeling that although his administration is in policy terms quite successful , and the president has faithfully tried to carry out most of what he promised in the raucous 2016 election campaign , he is yet too bombastic and evidently egocentric to maintain the dignity of his great office . This is a widely held view , even among many who support the president for his policy successes and the well-conceived initiatives that are still in the balance , especially trade and other negotiations with China , and the attempted revival of nuclear non-proliferation in respect of Iran and North Korea .\nThe entirely admirable Peggy Noonan ( Wall Street Journal and Fox News ) seems to me illustrative of the best type of these people . She is effectively nonpartisan , extremely knowledgeable , and always very fair , and she wishes every U.S. president well and hopes that whoever is in that position does a good job for the country . Because she worked so closely with President Reagan , she may tend to measure presidents against him , and few in history can live up to his quality , as a man and as a leader . But there is nothing wrong with having high standards . It is clear from some of her columns that she finds the president \u2019 s bellicosity toward his opponents , and his tendency to be nasty and personal toward them , disappointing and unsuitable to a president .\nIn Trump \u2019 s defense , no president since Richard Nixon \u2019 s last days in office has been subjected to such malicious and widespread hostility as this one , and while most of the obloquy directed against Nixon was based on a minor felony compounded by some more-serious obstructions of consequent investigations , all imputations of possibly illegal wrongdoing by our current president have collapsed and been exposed as malicious or negligent abuse of power by sections of the Justice Department and the intelligence agencies . History is finally beginning to record that Richard Nixon was an outstanding president who was overwhelmed by the propagation of public hysteria over trivial matters in which there is no evidence that he did anything illegal .

FDR and JFK were always elegant ; Truman , Eisenhower , and Obama never embarrassed anyone ; President Clinton was marred only by the tawdriness of his peccadilloes ; and LBJ , Ford , Carter , and the Bushes all had their verbal slips and minor gaucheries , but nothing seriously bothersome or embarrassing to the country .
