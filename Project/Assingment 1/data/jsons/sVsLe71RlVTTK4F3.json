Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Murdoch just have many more zeros behind their net worth , and global empires to match .\nTo project might , few things are as effective as owning big , throbbing media properties . Since returning to his company , Mr. Bloomberg , 72 , has dedicated a large amount of money to remaking his media operations , including a reorganized website unveiled last week . By all reports , he has spent time tinkering with even the most minute aspects of the redesign , despite that being a tiny part of his company .\nMr. Murdoch vastly overpaid for The Journal , and continues to support the money-losing New York Post . When News Corporation split two years ago , he protected his beloved newspaper assets in a well-funded new company . He is , by all accounts , highly involved with his papers and finds no detail too small to merit his interests .\nThese are extremely successful businessmen who spend many hours on noneconomic parts of their businesses . They do so for two reasons : because they can , and because it is fun .\nEven those of us who aren \u2019 t billionaires could tell you as much \u2014 creating media content is a diverting activity that rarely resembles actual work .\nAt 83 , Mr. Murdoch has seen a few presidential elections come and go , and , through Fox News and The Journal , has had a hand in influencing most of them . But that won \u2019 t be true forever , which may explain his antipathy at the prospect of Mr. Romney \u2019 s taking another shot at the White House .
