From the anchor chair , Gregory pretty much said high capacity magazines should be banned . Now , because the possession of 30-round magazines are illegal in the District of Columbia , Gregory is under investigation by police ; as he should be . Not only did he violate D.C. gun laws , but according to D.C. police [ who have confirmed multiple times ] , he knowingly violated the law after being denied the use of the illegal magazine on the show .\nNo person in the District shall possess , sell , or transfer any large capacity ammunition feeding device regardless of whether the device is attached to a firearm . For the purposes of this subsection , the term large capacity ammunition feeding device means a magazine , belt , drum , feed strip , or similar device that has a capacity of , or that can be readily restored or converted to accept , more than 10 rounds of ammunition .\nOh but what 's this ?
