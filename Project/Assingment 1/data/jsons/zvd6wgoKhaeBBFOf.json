    "content": "When Donald Trump launched his bid for the White House , one of his earliest initiatives was a promise to help Americans who had gone to war for their country . Or , as his campaign put it , to take care of \u201c all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently like a world-class business man can do , but a politician has no clue. \u201d Last summer , about a month after declaring his candidacy , Trump unveiled a hotline for veterans to share ideas about how to overhaul the bureaucracy that served them . A campaign aide said that Trump himself would personally respond to some of the messages . \u201c I love all veterans and will help them finally lead the kind of lives that they should be leading , \u201d Trump declared at the time . Many of the veterans who called the hotline\u2014855-VETS-352\u2014say they were sent to an automated voicemail message telling them to email the campaign . Those who reached a live human were similarly instructed to send an email , or to mail their medical records to campaign headquarters at Trump Tower . It soon became evident that Trump had no actual plan in place to help anyone who contacted him through the hotline . Calling it a \u201c publicity stunt , \u201d one veteran wrote on PopularMilitary.com , \u201c We are not sure what the estimated wait time is , but it is probably safe to say you should hold on to your [ Veterans Affairs ] card for now. \u201d This perfunctory effort was perhaps to be expected , since Trump has a long and colorful history of showing disrespect toward men and women in uniform . He did not serve himself , avoiding the Vietnam War via four education deferments , followed by a medical deferment for bone spurs in his feet . ( His campaign notes that Trump received a high number in the draft lottery and was unlikely to ever be called up . ) But on numerous occasions , he has dismissed the experiences of those who did . In the 2015 biography Never Enough : Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success , Trump is quoted as saying , \u201c I always thought I was in the military \u201d because of his time at the New York Military Academy , an expensive boarding school 60 miles north of New York City where Trump brought women onto campus so often that his yearbook nickname was \u201c Ladies \u2019 Man. \u201d The author , Michael D \u2019 Antonio , writes that Trump believed the academy \u201c provided him with more military training than most actual soldiers . \u201d\nIn the 1990s , Trump made headlines for lobbying the New York State legislature to ban disabled veterans from working as street vendors around Trump Tower . \u201c Do we allow Fifth Avenue , one of the world \u2019 s finest and most luxurious shopping districts , to be turned into an outdoor flea market , clogging and seriously downgrading the area ? \u201d he wrote to a state assemblyman .

In a 1997 interview with Howard Stern , Trump likened his determination to avoid sexually transmitted infections to serving in combat . His sex life in the 1980s was \u201c my personal Vietnam , \u201d he said . \u201c I feel like a great and very brave soldier. \u201d Last summer , he declared that Senator John McCain\u2014a former Navy pilot who was held prisoner for five and a half years and tortured by the North Vietnamese\u2014was \u201c not a war hero. \u201d His reasoning : \u201c I like people that weren \u2019 t captured. \u201d Meanwhile , when Trump has weighed in on national security questions , his remarks often reveal either ignorance or disdain for military expertise and the codes of conduct that govern the armed forces . \u201c I know more about ISIS than the generals do . Believe me , \u201d he boasted in one speech , adding , `` I \u2019 ve had a lot of wars of my own . I \u2019 m really good at war . '' His foreign policy prescriptions include proposals to \u201c bomb the shit out of ISIS , \u201d to \u201c take out \u201d the families of ISIS members and to torture terrorism suspects . ( \u201c Would I approve waterboarding ? You bet your ass I would , \u201d he told one crowd . \u201c And you know what ? If it does n't work , they deserve it anyway , for what they 're doing. \u201d ) When it was pointed out that soldiers couldn \u2019 t legally carry out those last two actions , Trump was unconcerned . `` They 're not going to refuse me . Believe me. \u201d ( He walked back that last statement the next day . ) The Geneva Conventions , he recently observed , have made American soldiers \u201c afraid to fight. \u201d Trump \u2019 s pronouncements on foreign policy , combined with his years of broadsides , have set off a very real fear within military circles about what might happen were he to become president . In the last two months , I spoke with dozens of people in the national security realm\u2014current and retired officers , veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and former White House , State Department , Pentagon and CIA officials .

A source with firsthand knowledge told me that Trump \u2019 s campaign pursued retired General David Petraeus , Middle East scholar Daniel Pipes and former U.N . Ambassador John Bolton , but all three men declined . In a TV appearance not long afterward , Trump said he wouldn \u2019 t hesitate to replace the members of his military team if they didn \u2019 t agree with him . ( Trump \u2019 s campaign didn \u2019 t respond to multiple requests for comment . ) For even the savviest of presidents , the relationship between a commander in chief and his military is famously fraught , an intricate dance of egos and agendas , worldviews and bureaucracies . A President Trump , however , could usher in a clash of historic proportions . \u201c If you take the man at his word , \u201d said Michael Breen , the president of the Truman National Security Project and a decorated former Army officer , \u201c we have a presidential candidate who seems to have committed himself to triggering what would probably be the greatest crisis in civil-military relations since the American Civil War . \u201d\nOne of the first tasks of a new president is finding the right people to surround himself with . His cabinet members are there to enact his agenda , and if they fail to do so , he can pressure them to resign or fire them . The president \u2019 s relationship with his military leaders is fundamentally different . While he gets to appoint both the secretary of defense as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the latter is an apolitical figure , not a partisan official . The incoming White House typically inherits the previous administration 's chair of the Joint Chiefs ( the leaders of the Army , Navy , Air Force , National Guard and Marines ) and combatant commanders . The president can not control what his generals say to Congress . And while he technically has the power to remove three- and four-star generals from service , it \u2019 s far riskier to dismiss a general than a cabinet member gone rogue . \u201c If a military official resigns , it \u2019 s a crisis in civil-military relations , \u201d said Peter Mansoor , a retired Army colonel and former executive officer under Petraeus . \u201c If a cabinet position does that , it \u2019 s just politics. \u201d Probably the most famous example of such a crisis was when President Harry Truman canned Douglas MacArthur\u2014and that didn \u2019 t end well for Truman . MacArthur was revered for his leadership in WWII . ( One of his aides praised him as \u201c the greatest man since Christ. \u201d ) But after Truman named the 70-year-old general the supreme commander of Allied forces in the Pacific during the Korean War , MacArthur started ignoring orders , withholding information about his operations , and publicly questioning Truman \u2019 s policy . So Truman removed him from his post , effectively ending his military career . It was a deeply unpopular decision . Letters poured into the administration demanding Truman \u2019 s impeachment and calling him \u201c a Judas \u201d and \u201c the pig in the White House. \u201d Meanwhile , when MacArthur returned to the United States he was greeted with parades and endless praise . The Senate held hearings on MacArthur \u2019 s dismissal , during which the general blasted his president \u2019 s foreign policy . Truman , who privately said MacArthur \u2019 s testimony was \u201c a bunch of damn bullshit , \u201d never recovered , and in March 1952 , he announced he would not run for re-election . The military leadership \u2019 s independent nature gives it considerable power to fight back against a president it doesn \u2019 t like . As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the 1990s , for instance , Colin Powell nearly derailed President Bill Clinton \u2019 s administration in its first year . The military brass was skeptical of Clinton long before he arrived at the White House . He was the first antiwar president , having avoided the Vietnam War and once writing of \u201c loathing \u201d the military . During the 1992 campaign , he \u2019 d pledged to rewrite the military \u2019 s laws to allow gays and lesbians to serve openly .\nPowell had no intention of letting this happen . The four-star general viewed the new president and his team as \u201c children , \u201d as diplomat Richard Holbrooke later recalled . Powell was a charming operator with an inspiring life story who had spent most of his nearly 35-year career in Washington and knew how to work the levers of power . ( \u201c You show me a general in Washington who ain \u2019 t political and I \u2019 ll show you a guy who ain \u2019 t going to get promoted again , and probably should not be a general in the first place , \u201d he once said . ) Shortly before Clinton \u2019 s inauguration , he told a class of Naval Academy midshipmen that if they found Clinton \u2019 s policy \u201c completely unacceptable and it strikes to the heart of your moral beliefs , then I think you have to resign. \u201d Five days after Clinton \u2019 s inauguration , Clinton met with Powell and the rest of the Joint Chiefs in the Roosevelt Room . \u201c [ Homosexuality ] is a problem for us , \u201d Powell informed the new president , according to a notetaker . One by one , the rest of the generals flatly opposed the president \u2019 s plan . Furthermore , as former White House aide George Stephanopoulos wrote in his memoir , the Joint Chiefs had already lined up congressional support for their position : \u201c Their message was clear : Keeping this promise will cost you the military . Fight us , and you \u2019 ll lose\u2014and it won \u2019 t be pretty. \u201d And that \u2019 s essentially what happened . Powell did little to quash rumors that the entire Joint Chiefs would resign if Clinton went through with the policy . During the next nine months , the battle over the issue cost Clinton dearly . Eventually , he agreed to Powell \u2019 s proposed compromise , which we now know as \u201c Don \u2019 t Ask , Don \u2019 t Tell. \u201d \u201c The new president had been rolled , \u201d wrote historian Matthew Moten in his book Presidents and Their Generals . The Bush administration , meanwhile , provided a disturbing preview of the damage that can be done when a civilian leadership pushes the armed services to adopt policies of dubious legality . Donald Rumsfeld , Bush \u2019 s defense secretary , was regarded as uninterested in the military \u2019 s advice and dismissive of the Joint Chiefs . After September 11 , 2001 , Rumsfeld authorized the use of \u201c enhanced interrogation techniques \u201d \u2014practices that exposed the U.S. to charges of violating the Geneva Conventions and the War Crimes Act . The decision set off years of turmoil within the armed services . Retired Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson , the former chief of staff to Colin Powell , who was by then secretary of state , said that there were numerous instances of individuals in the chain of command sitting on the order to introduce abusive\u2014and , some thought , illegal\u2014interrogation methods in December 2002 . \u201c There was never a collective agreement to do the things that Rumsfeld told people to do in that memo , \u201d Wilkerson recently told me . \u201c There were certain leaders that passed on and gave orders based on those documents , but there are lots and lots of people who walked away from it and refused to do it . \u201d\nFormer CIA general counsel John Rizzo predicted an employee \u201c exodus \u201d if Trump became president and followed through on his proposals .\nAlberto Mora , the Navy 's general counsel , memorably fought to ban any use of enhanced interrogation techniques , which he believed were torture . Mark Fallon , the deputy commander of the Pentagon 's Criminal Investigation Task Force , similarly argued that allowing his agents to witness the acts described in Rumsfeld 's order , let alone implement them , would be disastrous . `` Either they 'll watch the law being broken , or , as sworn law enforcement officers , seeing laws being broken , they may try to arrest the military interrogators , \u201d he told his boss , CITF Commander Colonel Brittain Mallow , as recounted in ex-FBI agent Ali Soufan \u2019 s book , The Black Banners . \u201c Nothing good can come of this . '' Retired military officers told me that the effect of this kind of internal dissension can be crippling . `` You have usually an enormous decrease in morale because you sense that there 's nothing you can do about it , '' Wilkerson told me . `` Your values are being disrupted ; you feel powerless . '' Andrew Bacevich , a retired Army colonel and military historian , said that `` any policy that is inconsistently applied creates confusion and consternation in a hierarchical organization . '' On some occasions , the military has been able to use the tools at its disposal\u2014the press , Congress , calculated leaks , endless bureaucratic maneuvering\u2014to reshape a president \u2019 s entire policy . President Barack Obama , for instance , arrived in office determined to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . But he encountered two formidable opponents in Petraeus , the head of the U.S. Central Command , which coordinates military activities across the Middle East and Central Asia , and Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal , who the new president had named the top commander in Afghanistan . McChrystal \u2019 s effort began with a 66-page classified review of the war effort that reached the opposite conclusion to the one favored by Obama . In McChrystal \u2019 s assessment , he argued that he needed at least 40,000 more troops in order to succeed in Afghanistan . Petraeus , the respected architect of the surge who was being talked about as a future presidential candidate , stumped for additional troops in the media . Admiral Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , tacitly endorsed McChrystal \u2019 s plan in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee . Then the classified McChrystal report was leaked to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward . On September 21 , 2009 , the Post ran Woodward \u2019 s story on the front page : \u201c McChrystal : More Forces or \u2018 Mission Failure. \u2019 \u201d The impact of this leak is hard to overstate . It essentially forced Obama to take ownership of the Afghan War\u2014a move he and his aides had resisted . If he stuck with his preferred option , he would be contradicting a respected general in the field who was predicting near-apocalyptic consequences unless additional troops were dispatched . At a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , McChrystal was asked if a more modest approach could work . \u201c A strategy that does not leave Afghanistan in a stable position is probably a shortsighted strategy , \u201d he said . Obama was furious , according to Woodward \u2019 s book Obama \u2019 s Wars , telling his aides : \u201c We \u2019 ve got to stop this. \u201d In the end , he couldn \u2019 t . In a December 1 speech at West Point , Obama ordered 30,000 new troops into Afghanistan . McChrystal could\u2014and did\u2014find another 10,000 soldiers from the ranks of the coalition forces , which meant he got his 40,000 . The generals had won .\nIn the many books by and about Trump , and in interviews given by his employees past and present , a clear picture emerges of his leadership style . Trump prides himself on his unpredictability\u2014 \u201c My moves are totally uncalculated , \u201d he boasted to one biographer . He \u2019 s known as a micromanager who insisted on personally signing company checks and calling people his employees had already contacted to check their work . By his own admission , he gets \u201c bored too easily \u201d and relishes shaking up a company or an industry . \u201c My attention span is short and probably my least favorite thing to do is maintain the status quo , \u201d he has written . \u201c Instead of being content when everything is going fine , I start getting impatient and irritable. \u201d The culture at Trump \u2019 s company has been described as Darwinian . \u201c He really believed that having people fighting and in conflict for approval made them work harder , \u201d Trump \u2019 s former executive secretary , Rhona Graff , once recounted .\nThe military leaders that Trump would inherit are , by all indications , less forceful personalities than Powell , Petraeus or McChrystal , but it \u2019 s hard to imagine them responding well to this kind of behavior . The current Joint Chiefs chairman , Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford , is known as an especially skillful operator able to bridge the diplomatic and military worlds , with a low-key demeanor that helped to win over Obama . And in recent months , Dunford has found subtle ways to signal disapproval of Trump \u2019 s statements . When he was asked during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about Trump \u2019 s support for torture and attacking the families of suspected terrorists , Dunford didn \u2019 t mention Trump by name , but observed that such orders would have an \u201c adverse effect \u201d on \u201c the morale of the force \u201d and \u201c aren \u2019 t legal for them to do anyway. \u201d He also pushed back against Trump \u2019 s assertion that NATO was \u201c very obsolete \u201d by telling reporters , \u201c In my mind , the relevance of NATO is not at all in question. \u201d In an indication of how much Trump \u2019 s statements on national security have triggered intense debate within the military , Defense Secretary Ash Carter has made it clear he doesn \u2019 t want officials weighing in on campaign politics . The nation \u2019 s intelligence agencies have also been gripped by similar anxieties about the prospect of a Trump presidency . CIA Director John Brennan recently told NBC News that he would refuse to execute orders from a future president to use waterboarding . John Rizzo , the former CIA general counsel who worked at the agency for 35 years , told me that the employees he still spoke with were \u201c terrified \u201d at the prospect of reopening the debates over the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques . \u201c Deep concern is a mild way of putting the prospect of their commander in chief basically ordering them to go down this road again given all the trauma , \u201d he said . If Trump won and followed through on his proposals , Rizzo predicted an employee \u201c exodus. \u201d \u201c At a minimum , \u201d he went on , \u201c people would refuse to participate in anything resembling the former interrogation program and insist on a transfer to another part of the agency where they wouldn \u2019 t be involved in these things. \u201d Meanwhile , with Trump still in a strong position to clinch the Republican nomination , some current members of the military bureaucracy are starting to game out exactly what they would do if he were elected . There are some who think Trump \u2019 s brash persona might actually be an asset . Wilkerson , the retired Army colonel , told me he \u2019 d recently spoken to an active-duty colonel who thought Trump might force through welcome changes to the military establishment . \u201c If Trump comes in and shakes up these graybeard idiots , \u201d Wilkerson said the colonel told him , \u201c I \u2019 m all for it. \u201d But such sentiments seem very much the minority view . Earlier this year , Bryan McGrath , a defense consultant and former Navy officer of 21 years , watched in shock as Trump climbed to the top of the Republican field . He dusted off an anti-Trump manifesto he \u2019 d written the previous fall and sent it to Eliot Cohen , a former State Department adviser and professor at Johns Hopkins University . McGrath and Cohen polished up the letter , sent it to their contacts in the foreign policy community , and on March 2 published it on the website War on the Rocks with nearly 100 signatories . The letter charged that Trump would \u201c make America less safe \u201d and was \u201c utterly unfitted to the office . \u201d",

(Getty Images, \u00a9 Seth Poppel/Yearbook Library.)\n\nIn the 1990s, Trump made headlines for lobbying the New York State legislature to ban disabled veterans from working as street vendors around Trump Tower. \u201cDo we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the world\u2019s finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area?\u201d he wrote to a state assemblyman.

His cabinet members are there to enact his agenda, and if they fail to do so, he can pressure them to resign or fire them. The president\u2019s relationship with his military leaders is fundamentally different. While he gets to appoint both the secretary of defense as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the latter is an apolitical figure, not a partisan official. The incoming White House typically inherits the previous administration's chair of the Joint Chiefs (the leaders of the Army, Navy, Air Force, National Guard and Marines) and combatant commanders. The president cannot control what his generals say to Congress. And while he technically has the power to remove three- and four-star generals from service, it\u2019s far riskier to dismiss a general than a cabinet member gone rogue. \u201cIf a military official resigns, it\u2019s a crisis in civil-military relations,\u201d said Peter Mansoor, a retired Army colonel and former executive officer under Petraeus. \u201cIf a cabinet position does that, it\u2019s just politics.\u201d Probably the most famous example of such a crisis was when President Harry Truman canned Douglas MacArthur\u2014and that didn\u2019t end well for Truman. MacArthur was revered for his leadership in WWII. (One of his aides praised him as \u201cthe greatest man since Christ.\u201d) But after Truman named the 70-year-old general the supreme commander of Allied forces in the Pacific during the Korean War, MacArthur started ignoring orders, withholding information about his operations, and publicly questioning Truman\u2019s policy. So Truman removed him from his post, effectively ending his military career. It was a deeply unpopular decision. Letters poured into the administration demanding Truman\u2019s impeachment and calling him \u201ca Judas\u201d and \u201cthe pig in the White House.\u201d Meanwhile, when MacArthur returned to the United States he was greeted with parades and endless praise. The Senate held hearings on MacArthur\u2019s dismissal, during which the general blasted his president\u2019s foreign policy. Truman, who privately said MacArthur\u2019s testimony was \u201ca bunch of damn bullshit,\u201d never recovered, and in March 1952, he announced he would not run for re-election. The military leadership\u2019s independent nature gives it considerable power to fight back against a president it doesn\u2019t like. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the 1990s, for instance, Colin Powell nearly derailed President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration in its first year. The military brass was skeptical of Clinton long before he arrived at the White House. He was the first antiwar president, having avoided the Vietnam War and once writing of \u201cloathing\u201d the military. During the 1992 campaign, he\u2019d pledged to rewrite the military\u2019s laws to allow gays and lesbians to serve openly.\n\nWhen presidents and generals clash: Barack Obama and David Petraeus; Bill Clinton and Colin Powell; Harry Truman and Douglas MacArthur.

Powell was a charming operator with an inspiring life story who had spent most of his nearly 35-year career in Washington and knew how to work the levers of power. (\u201cYou show me a general in Washington who ain\u2019t political and I\u2019ll show you a guy who ain\u2019t going to get promoted again, and probably should not be a general in the first place,\u201d he once said.) Shortly before Clinton\u2019s inauguration, he told a class of Naval Academy midshipmen that if they found Clinton\u2019s policy \u201ccompletely unacceptable and it strikes to the heart of your moral beliefs, then I think you have to resign.\u201d Five days after Clinton\u2019s inauguration, Clinton met with Powell and the rest of the Joint Chiefs in the Roosevelt Room. \u201c[Homosexuality] is a problem for us,\u201d Powell informed the new president, according to a notetaker. One by one, the rest of the generals flatly opposed the president\u2019s plan. Furthermore, as former White House aide George Stephanopoulos wrote in his memoir, the Joint Chiefs had already lined up congressional support for their position: \u201cTheir message was clear: Keeping this promise will cost you the military. Fight us, and you\u2019ll lose\u2014and it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d And that\u2019s essentially what happened. Powell did little to quash rumors that the entire Joint Chiefs would resign if Clinton went through with the policy. During the next nine months, the battle over the issue cost Clinton dearly. Eventually, he agreed to Powell\u2019s proposed compromise, which we now know as \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d \u201cThe new president had been rolled,\u201d wrote historian Matthew Moten in his book Presidents and Their Generals. The Bush administration, meanwhile, provided a disturbing preview of the damage that can be done when a civilian leadership pushes the armed services to adopt policies of dubious legality. Donald Rumsfeld, Bush\u2019s defense secretary, was regarded as uninterested in the military\u2019s advice and dismissive of the Joint Chiefs. After September 11, 2001, Rumsfeld authorized the use of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d\u2014practices that exposed the U.S. to charges of violating the Geneva Conventions and the War Crimes Act. The decision set off years of turmoil within the armed services. Retired Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, the former chief of staff to Colin Powell, who was by then secretary of state, said that there were numerous instances of individuals in the chain of command sitting on the order to introduce abusive\u2014and, some thought, illegal\u2014interrogation methods in December 2002. \u201cThere was never a collective agreement to do the things that Rumsfeld told people to do in that memo,\u201d Wilkerson recently told me. \u201cThere were certain leaders that passed on and gave orders based on those documents, but there are lots and lots of people who walked away from it and refused to do it.\u201d\n\nFormer CIA general counsel John Rizzo predicted an employee \u201cexodus\u201d if Trump became president and followed through on his proposals.\n\nAlberto Mora, the Navy's general counsel, memorably fought to ban any use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which he believed were torture. Mark Fallon, the deputy commander of the Pentagon's Criminal Investigation Task Force, similarly argued that allowing his agents to witness the acts described in Rumsfeld's order, let alone implement them, would be disastrous. \"Either they'll watch the law being broken, or, as sworn law enforcement officers, seeing laws being broken, they may try to arrest the military interrogators,\u201d he told his boss, CITF Commander Colonel Brittain Mallow, as recounted in ex-FBI agent Ali Soufan\u2019s book, The Black Banners. \u201cNothing good can come of this.\" Retired military officers told me that the effect of this kind of internal dissension can be crippling. \"You have usually an enormous decrease in morale because you sense that there's nothing you can do about it,\" Wilkerson told me. \"Your values are being disrupted; you feel powerless.\" Andrew Bacevich, a retired Army colonel and military historian, said that \"any policy that is inconsistently applied creates confusion and consternation in a hierarchical organization.\" On some occasions, the military has been able to use the tools at its disposal\u2014the press, Congress, calculated leaks, endless bureaucratic maneuvering\u2014to reshape a president\u2019s entire policy. President Barack Obama, for instance, arrived in office determined to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he encountered two formidable opponents in Petraeus, the head of the U.S. Central Command, which coordinates military activities across the Middle East and Central Asia, and Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal, who the new president had named the top commander in Afghanistan. McChrystal\u2019s effort began with a 66-page classified review of the war effort that reached the opposite conclusion to the one favored by Obama. In McChrystal\u2019s assessment, he argued that he needed at least 40,000 more troops in order to succeed in Afghanistan. Petraeus, the respected architect of the surge who was being talked about as a future presidential candidate, stumped for additional troops in the media. Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, tacitly endorsed McChrystal\u2019s plan in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Then the classified McChrystal report was leaked to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. On September 21, 2009, the Post ran Woodward\u2019s story on the front page: \u201cMcChrystal: More Forces or \u2018Mission Failure.\u2019\u201d The impact of this leak is hard to overstate. It essentially forced Obama to take ownership of the Afghan War\u2014a move he and his aides had resisted. If he stuck with his preferred option, he would be contradicting a respected general in the field who was predicting near-apocalyptic consequences unless additional troops were dispatched. At a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, McChrystal was asked if a more modest approach could work. \u201cA strategy that does not leave Afghanistan in a stable position is probably a shortsighted strategy,\u201d he said. Obama was furious, according to Woodward\u2019s book Obama\u2019s Wars, telling his aides: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop this.\u201d In the end, he couldn\u2019t. In a December 1 speech at West Point, Obama ordered 30,000 new troops into Afghanistan. McChrystal could\u2014and did\u2014find another 10,000 soldiers from the ranks of the coalition forces, which meant he got his 40,000. The generals had won.\n\nIn the many books by and about Trump, and in interviews given by his employees past and present, a clear picture emerges of his leadership style. Trump prides himself on his unpredictability\u2014\u201cMy moves are totally uncalculated,\u201d he boasted to one biographer. He\u2019s known as a micromanager who insisted on personally signing company checks and calling people his employees had already contacted to check their work. By his own admission, he gets \u201cbored too easily\u201d and relishes shaking up a company or an industry. \u201cMy attention span is short and probably my least favorite thing to do is maintain the status quo,\u201d he has written. \u201cInstead of being content when everything is going fine, I start getting impatient and irritable.\u201d The culture at Trump\u2019s company has been described as Darwinian. \u201cHe really believed that having people fighting and in conflict for approval made them work harder,\u201d Trump\u2019s former executive secretary, Rhona Graff, once recounted.\n\nAmerican heroes (plus Trump and Piers Morgan.) (Getty Images.)\n\nThe military leaders that Trump would inherit are, by all indications, less forceful personalities than Powell, Petraeus or McChrystal, but it\u2019s hard to imagine them responding well to this kind of behavior. The current Joint Chiefs chairman, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, is known as an especially skillful operator able to bridge the diplomatic and military worlds, with a low-key demeanor that helped to win over Obama. And in recent months, Dunford has found subtle ways to signal disapproval of Trump\u2019s statements. When he was asked during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about Trump\u2019s support for torture and attacking the families of suspected terrorists, Dunford didn\u2019t mention Trump by name, but observed that such orders would have an \u201cadverse effect\u201d on \u201cthe morale of the force\u201d and \u201caren\u2019t legal for them to do anyway.\u201d He also pushed back against Trump\u2019s assertion that NATO was \u201cvery obsolete\u201d by telling reporters, \u201cIn my mind, the relevance of NATO is not at all in question.\u201d In an indication of how much Trump\u2019s statements on national security have triggered intense debate within the military, Defense Secretary Ash Carter has made it clear he doesn\u2019t want officials weighing in on campaign politics. The nation\u2019s intelligence agencies have also been gripped by similar anxieties about the prospect of a Trump presidency. CIA Director John Brennan recently told NBC News that he would refuse to execute orders from a future president to use waterboarding. John Rizzo, the former CIA general counsel who worked at the agency for 35 years, told me that the employees he still spoke with were \u201cterrified\u201d at the prospect of reopening the debates over the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques. \u201cDeep concern is a mild way of putting the prospect of their commander in chief basically ordering them to go down this road again given all the trauma,\u201d he said. If Trump won and followed through on his proposals, Rizzo predicted an employee \u201cexodus.\u201d \u201cAt a minimum,\u201d he went on, \u201cpeople would refuse to participate in anything resembling the former interrogation program and insist on a transfer to another part of the agency where they wouldn\u2019t be involved in these things.\u201d Meanwhile, with Trump still in a strong position to clinch the Republican nomination, some current members of the military bureaucracy are starting to game out exactly what they would do if he were elected. There are some who think Trump\u2019s brash persona might actually be an asset. Wilkerson, the retired Army colonel, told me he\u2019d recently spoken to an active-duty colonel who thought Trump might force through welcome changes to the military establishment. \u201cIf Trump comes in and shakes up these graybeard idiots,\u201d Wilkerson said the colonel told him, \u201cI\u2019m all for it.\u201d But such sentiments seem very much the minority view. Earlier this year, Bryan McGrath, a defense consultant and former Navy officer of 21 years, watched in shock as Trump climbed to the top of the Republican field. He dusted off an anti-Trump manifesto he\u2019d written the previous fall and sent it to Eliot Cohen, a former State Department adviser and professor at Johns Hopkins University. McGrath and Cohen polished up the letter, sent it to their contacts in the foreign policy community, and on March 2 published it on the website War on the Rocks with nearly 100 signatories. The letter charged that Trump would \u201cmake America less safe\u201d and was \u201cutterly unfitted to the office.\u201d\n\nTrump avoided the draft, but called his sex life in the 1980s \u201cmy personal Vietnam.\u201d Citing his fear of sexually transmitted diseases, he said, \"I feel like a great and very brave soldier.\u201d (Getty Images, Gregory Pace/Sygma/Corbis, AP Photo/Jack Kanthal.)",
