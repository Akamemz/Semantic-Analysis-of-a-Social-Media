While federal statistics show only 313 births by nonresident mothers in 2016 , new research using hospital financial data puts the number at 3,223 that year . One of 5 births at Richmond Hospital in Richmond , British Columbia , an alleged center for birth tourism , is to nonresident mothers , those figures show .\nGranting citizenship based on place of birth is deeply rooted in Canada and the United States , but it is in fact otherwise a rarity among developed nations . And the practice has come under debate across North America in recent years . But unlike in the U.S. , where President Donald Trump 's threats to end the practice have come amid a context of illegal immigration , Canada 's rethink arises over a different concern : birth tourism .\nKerry Starchuk \u2019 s activism begins with homemade granola cookies \u2013 specifically , when she took a plate to her new neighbors .\nExcept the man and a toddler boy who she heard bouncing a basketball outside , and the two pregnant women with them , hadn \u2019 t moved into the house next door to hers , where she has lived since 1988 . Visitors from China , they were residing in her neighborhood only temporarily and didn \u2019 t respond to her greeting . After they awkwardly accepted her cookies , she never saw the group again .\nIt wasn \u2019 t the first time she \u2019 d seen pregnant women coming and going in her neighborhood or heard about why they were there . But the meeting began her personal battle against \u201c birth tourism , \u201d where wealthy mothers like the ones she encountered next door pay to give birth , get citizenship for their babies , and return home .\nIt is an issue gaining prominence across North America , where jus soli , or rules by which citizenship is determined by birthplace , is the standard practice ( yet otherwise rare among developed countries , as in Europe where citizenship is more restricted and often granted along bloodlines ) . An online petition that Ms. Starchuk started against the practice last year , garnering some 11,000 signatures , was supported by a federal Liberal lawmaker representing Richmond . Meanwhile , the federal Conservatives , in opposition during an election year , voted on a motion last summer to tighten laws around birthright citizenship . In the United States , President Donald Trump has said he will end it by executive order .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s threat drew widespread criticism by critics who call it anti-immigrant pandering . But concerns about citizenship rules span partisan lines . In Canada , a poll from the Angus Reid Institute in March showed that while more believe birthright citizenship is a good policy than a bad one ( 40 % versus 33 % ) , 60 % believed rules needed to be tightened to counter abuse of the system .\nMs. Starchuk , a part-time housecleaner , insists her position is not anti-Chinese or anti-immigrant but is about rules and values , especially in a region where foreign wealth and capital have changed the face of communities . In Richmond , the mothers hail mostly from China , lured by advertisements that sell all-inclusive packages including a stay at a \u201c birth hotel. \u201d Other hospitals in Toronto and Montreal have seen increases in mothers from Eastern Europe or Africa . A recent data analysis showed Richmond \u2019 s local hospital with the highest percentage of births to mothers residing outside Canada .\n\u201c It does undermine me , because I \u2019 m trying to build community and welcome my neighbors to the neighborhood , \u201d she says . \u201c And then I find out it \u2019 s not a single-family home where there \u2019 s going to be a new family but an international , underground birth-tourism hotel . ... It \u2019 s like selling citizenship . \u201d\nThe issue under debate in Canada , which established citizenship rules under the 1947 Canadian Citizenship Act , is largely about the power of foreign money and how it devalues citizenship . The debate in the U.S. , on the other hand , sometimes targets so-called anchor babies but revolves around undocumented migration . It was rekindled last fall with Mr. Trump \u2019 s threat , which has been highly polarizing .\nThe national conversations converge around questions of fairness and the changes people fear and perceive around them .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Joe Peschisolido , a Liberal lawmaker , says birth tourism is an abuse of the system . 'It 's a business where people are making money off of the goodness of Canadians . '\nMartha Jones , who wrote \u201c Birthright Citizens : A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America , \u201d says that citizenship is always an evolving political question . In the U.S. , questions about birthright citizenship arose in the early 19th century around the status of former slaves , which culminated in the 14th Amendment in 1868 .\nBut that didn \u2019 t settle the issue , and in some ways the debate today is analogous to the one around former slaves because it leaves an entire class of people in a legal limbo . \u201c It is a tragic example of the ways in which American lawmakers have failed in my view to fulfill their obligation to extend to people some basic sense of who they are , \u201d Ms. Jones says .\nIn Canada , the Conservatives last summer voted that the party should support the position that a baby born in Canada should receive citizenship only if one parent is a Canadian or permanent resident .\nNot all Conservatives agree with their party . Deepak Obhrai , a Tory lawmaker from Calgary , says that birth tourism abuses could be addressed with immigration procedures that target the parents but not the child . \u201c It takes away the fundamental right of the child , \u201d he says . \u201c A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian . \u201d\nThose fighting birth tourism have been accused of overexaggerating the problem .
