Another 36 percent is used for animal feed . And the remaining 9 percent goes toward biofuels and other industrial uses .

By contrast , more than 67 percent of crops \u2014 particularly all the soy grown in the Midwest \u2014 goes to animal feed . And a portion of the rest goes to ethanol and other biofuels .\nSome of that animal feed eventually becomes food , obviously \u2014 but it 's a much , much more indirect process . It takes about 100 calories of grain to produce just 12 calories of chicken or 3 calories worth of beef , for instance .\nThe map itself comes from Jonathan Foley 's fascinating , visually rich exploration in National Geographic of how we can possibly feed everyone as the world 's population grows from 7 billion today to 9 billion by mid-century .

And , making matters even trickier , humans have now cultivated most of the world 's arable land and are pushing up against the limits of freshwater consumption . So the traditional strategy of `` find new farmland to grow more food '' is getting even harder .\nThere are lots of possible strategies here . Farmers could increase agricultural productivity by boosting crop yields \u2014 either through new farming techniques or through improved crop genetics . But even if the rapid rate of improvement in crop yields over the 20th century continued , that still would n't produce enough food for everyone .\nAnother possibility , as the map above shows , is that the world could devote more existing farmland back to feeding people . Again , as the numbers suggest , just 55 percent of crop calories go directly toward people . The rest goes toward biofuels or animal feed . Humans ca n't eat biofuels , obviously . And animal feed is also an inefficient way of feeding people \u2014 about one-tenth as efficient , on a calorie basis , as eating crops directly .\nOne implication of that is that , as countries like China and India grow and consume more milk and meat , the pressure on global farmland will grow .
