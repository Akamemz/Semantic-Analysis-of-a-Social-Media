REUTERS/Letitia Stein/File Photo\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, whose hard line campaign approach dovetailed with Trump\u2019s, was projected to defeat Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, who had the endorsement of Deal, local media reported.\n\nKemp earned the president\u2019s backing last week, a surprise endorsement that analysts said gave him an edge in a race between the two conservatives.\n\nKemp thanked Trump for his support in a speech accepting his victory.\n\n\u201cWe had the momentum in this race and those endorsements by the president and the vice president, they poured gasoline on the fire and fueled the Kemp surge to victory,\u201d he told supporters.\n\nWith about 90 percent of the votes reported, Kemp was backed by 69 percent of the Republican voters against Cagle\u2019s 31 percent.\n\nKemp will face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is vying to become the first black woman to serve as a U.S. state governor in what is expected to be one of the most hotly contested races in November\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nTrump carried Georgia by 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nCagle, 52, bested Kemp, 55, by 13 points in the first round of the Republican primary in May, though none of the candidates at the time won more than 50 percent of the vote, setting up a run-off election.\n\nCagle\u2019s support diminished, however, after secret recordings surfaced where he acknowledged supporting a bill he called \u201cbad public policy\u201d to undercut a rival in the race and said the primary appeared to be a contest to see who could be \u201ccraziest.\u201d\n\nThat last comment likely referred to Kemp\u2019s political advertisements.
