    "content": "President Trump continued his criticism of NATO Tuesday before he headed to Europe for a meeting of leaders of the 29-nation alliance Wednesday , trading barbed tweets with European Council President Donald Tusk . The testy exchange was further evidence that the president is right when he says that NATO \u2013 created in 1949 \u2013 has become obsolete .\nThe U.S. president understands one of the great cardinal rules of geopolitics that others seem to have forgotten : no alliance lasts forever . After almost 70 years , America and its NATO partners in Europe may be heading for a new relationship , while still remaining friends .\nIn an early morning tweet Tuesday , President Trump wrote : \u201c Getting ready to leave for Europe . First meeting - NATO . The U.S. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them . Not fair to the U.S. taxpayer . On top of that we lose $ 151 Billion on Trade with the European Union . Charge us big Tariffs ( & Barriers ) ! \u201d\nAnd in another tweet President Trump wrote : \u201c NATO countries must pay MORE , the United States must pay LESS . Very Unfair ! \u201d\nTusk responded with a tweet of his own : \u201c Dear @ realDonaldTrump . US doesn \u2019 t have and won \u2019 t have a better ally than EU . We spend on defense much more than Russia and as much as China . I hope you have no doubt this is an investment in our security , which can not be said with confidence about Russian & Chinese spending . \u201d\nHistory teaches us obvious reasons for the breakup of alliances . Circumstances and threats change . One country \u2019 s mortal enemy one day could be the nation \u2019 s best friend the next . Just look back at World War II \u2013 our enemies Germany , Japan and Italy are our allies today . Our ally Russia ( part of the Soviet Union back then ) is our adversary .\nThere is only one constant when it comes to smart foreign policy . A nation seeks allies and partnership where it has common interests . Sometimes those alliances lose their value or importance over time and break up .\nNATO was formed to defend against the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies . But the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact died in 1991 \u2013 and NATO \u2019 s original mission died then as well . Soviet tanks are no longer primed to head into Europe to conquer our NATO partners . NATO is now a world-class military alliance looking for a mission .\nChina is the national security challenge of our time . Russia does not even come close .\nTo be clear , Moscow is certainly a dangerous adversary . Its occupation and annexation of Crimea \u2013 thanks to its growing military might \u2013 as well as brutal chemical weapons attacks on British soil prove a rogue Russia needs to be deterred and confronted if need be .\nBut today \u2019 s Russia is not the superpower threat that the Soviet Union was . Over the long-term , demographic issues , economic stagnation and questions of who succeeds Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly ensure Moscow is not the boogeyman it once was .\nRussia \u2019 s economy is roughly the size of Italy . But thanks to a tremendous amount of natural resources ( particularly oil and natural gas ) that it can sell , along with a military inheritance from the Soviet Union \u2013 including a large nuclear arsenal \u2013 Russia clearly poses a real threat to Europe that can \u2019 t be wished away .\nBut as President Trump has pointed out , if Europe really wanted to defend itself \u2013 and all NATO nations spent 2 percent their gross domestic products on defense , as they are supposed to be doing in the next few years \u2013 Russia would be no match for the might of just Britain , France and Germany alone .\nAdd in the capabilities of all the other members of the alliance \u2013 with America playing a small role as well \u2013 and Putin would , at least in theory , have every incentive to play nice for as long as he stays in power .\nInstead , we have a situation where many of Europe \u2019 s major powers have armed forces that can barely do anything anymore . Having focused on developing expensive social welfare programs that cost billions of dollars every year , Europe has instead outsourced its defense to the U.S. military and U.S. taxpayers .\nThis forces America to put vital resources into Europe that are sorely needed elsewhere \u2013 especially in Asia . Even having a military with a $ 700 billion annual budget that is the best in the world does not mean America can defend all our allies all over the world . They have a responsibility to pay their fair share for their own defense and fill the ranks of their own armed forces , as President Trump has repeatedly pointed out .\nAmerica \u2019 s power and might must be focused on the greatest of all threats , with our partners and friends taking on the burden in other areas of the world that are closer to their doorstep .\nWith Chinese economic and military power on the rise , the U.S. must concentrate its efforts on the rising Asian superpower that seeks to overthrow the international order in the Asia-Pacific and turn large sections of the sea into its own sovereign territory . China is the national security challenge of our time . Russia does not even come close .\nAnd then there is North Korea . As the world witnessed last weekend , Pyongyang will not be handing over its nuclear bombs anytime soon . Washington must focus as much of its diplomatic attention \u2013 and if need be , military might \u2013 on ensuring that we find a long-term solution to deal with North Korea . If we fail to do this , we are doomed to increased tensions like those that nearly brought East Asia to the brink of nuclear war last summer .\nAll this means that America \u2019 s available diplomatic and military bandwidth that it can devote to Europe must change . We must face up to the fact that NATO , in its present form , is obsolete . The alliance must evolve into an organization led and mostly resourced by Europeans .\nSo , is America going to quit NATO and go back across the Atlantic or abandon its allies in Europe ? Never . Does that mean a wave of isolationism has infected Washington and we won \u2019 t honor our treaty commitments or push back against Moscow in another crisis ? Not at all .\nBut it does mean a fundamental shift in burden that a Europe blessed with wealth and riches can easily maintain . However , if Europe is unwilling or unable to field a credible armed force to take on challenges from Russia or elsewhere , we must question the utility of an alliance that is a shell of what it used to be .\nDuring World War I , the U.S. Army produced an iconic recruiting poster showing Uncle Sam pointing a finger at the viewer saying : \u201c I WANT YOU FOR U.S. ARMY. \u201d We could use a similar poster today for our NATO allies , saying : \u201c I WANT YOU FOR YOUR OWN ARMIES . \u201d\nThis is the message I expect President Trump will deliver in Europe . And it \u2019 s one our partners on the continent need to listen to .",
