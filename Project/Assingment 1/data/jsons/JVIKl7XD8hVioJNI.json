    "content": "Obamacare has survived a pair of Supreme Court battles and half a decade of Republican repeal efforts .\nBut as the Obama administration enters its final year , the Affordable Care Act is facing formidable hurdles that are largely of Democrats ' making .\nBy voting to delay the so-called Cadillac tax as part of a year-end budget deal , Democrats knocked out an economic pillar critical to achieving one of the act 's central goals \u2014 tamping down U.S. health care spending . President Barack Obama and the Democrats pursued that goal at great political cost . But if it falls by the wayside , Obama may have his own party to blame for his diminished legacy .\nThe White House \u2019 s defeat on that , as well as several other Obamacare taxes , comes as a series of problems have piled up since coverage expansion kicked in two years ago , from collapsing co-op health plans to double-digit premium increases . No single one of them is likely to prove fatal , but together they have significantly weakened the law that Obama spent much of his presidency fighting for .\nBy joining with Republicans to delay the Cadillac tax , in particular , the president \u2019 s party chose the short-term demands of organized labor \u2014 a key ground-game player going into an election year \u2014 over the long-term goals of Obamacare . The party offered fresh ammunition to Republicans who say the law is a money pit . And it showed a lack of political will to make Americans change their habits on health care spending .\n\u201c Is it the death knell ? No . But it is harmful , \u201d said Peter Orszag , Obama \u2019 s Office of Management and Budget director during the drafting of the law .\nThe Cadillac tax was designed in part to help pay for Obamacare . But its main goal was to curb generous insurance policies that make health care virtually free to consumers , thereby encouraging its overuse and driving up spending .\nWhile health care spending has increased at historically low levels since passage of the health care law in 2010 , there 's no consensus on whether that slowdown is primarily attributable to the Great Recession or to Obamacare . Last year , health care spending shot back up and grew by 5.3 percent , easily surpassing overall inflation . If it does n't slow down , forecasters say health spending will cripple the U.S. economy within decades .\nThe White House emphasizes the health care law 's successes . More than 17 million people have acquired coverage under Obamacare , and the uninsured rate is the lowest ever recorded . Competition in the fledgling Obamacare marketplaces is robust . And HealthCare.gov , after a disastrous rollout , has become a reliable vehicle for Obamacare customers to shop for coverage . More broadly , Obamacare \u2019 s supporters argue that multiple provisions of the law , unaffected by the Cadillac tax , are fundamentally changing the economics of health care by paying doctors for quality , not quantity , of care .\nThe 2016 enrollment season is off to a good start , with more than 8 million signed up , and may well exceed admittedly modest expectations .\nObama touted the law \u2019 s accomplishments and the signup surge before he left for his Hawaii vacation . \u201c The more who sign up , the stronger the system becomes . And that 's good news for every American who no longer has to worry about being just one illness or accident away from financial hardship , \u201d he said .\nZeke Emanuel , an oncologist who advised Obama on the health care overhaul , said Obamacare so far has been a success \u201c by any stretch of any metric \u2014 especially access , especially cost control , to some degree quality , the solvency of the Medicare trust fund . \u201d\nEmanuel acknowledged , however , \u201c As they say in the stock brochures , past performance is no indication of future performance . \u201d\nIndeed , the recent travails of the health care law were sizable even before the budget deal reached last week knocked out funding .\nIn October , the Obama administration announced it could pay only a fraction of the funds that were supposed to protect insurers competing in the exchanges from big losses \u2014 not quite 13 cents on the dollar . Republicans had blocked fuller payments . That shortfall hastened the demise of half the nonprofit co-op plans established with Obamacare loan dollars and infuriated other insurers , which are crucial to the law \u2019 s success . One of them , UnitedHealth Group , has threatened to leave the exchanges .\nWhile UnitedHealth is only a minor player in most states , other big insurers are raising alarms about how sick and expensive their exchange customers are . Just this week , the trade group for the Blue Cross Blue Shield plans , which dominate many state exchanges , spelled out its concerns as it commented on proposed market regulations . \u201c The current risk pool is out of balance , '' the group wrote . `` A course correction is needed now or this unsustainable trend will only get worse in the future. \u201c\nBig price hikes have also been a headache for Obamacare supporters . Premiums for many plans rose by double digits for 2016 , and bigger deductibles are translating into higher out-of-pocket costs .\nUnions have been plotting to junk the Cadillac tax ever since it was proposed . It 's the persistent pull of Obama 's `` if you like your plan , you can keep it '' promise : Many of them negotiated generous employer-sponsored plans in place of increased wages , and they want to keep them . So they hate the tax because it would imperil those benefits \u2014 and that \u2019 s the whole point of it .\nRather than pay a 40 percent excise tax on expensive policies above a certain dollar amount , employers will likely cut back , the reasoning goes . Workers will have to pay more for their own health care , so they \u2019 ll comparison shop and think twice before agreeing to extensive tests and procedures that they might not actually need . The whole system will have to respond by focusing on quality .\nThat threatened to create a lot of unhappy middle-class families over the next few years as the tax hit their benefits , too , thanks to Obamacare and the Democrats .\n\u201c Almost everybody but health care economists was opposed to the thing , \u201d said former Sen.
