    "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden is finally speaking out against allegations of sexual assault , in a carefully orchestrated set of releases . On Friday , Biden released a statement on Medium denying the allegations made by his former Senate aide , Tara Reade . Soon after , he appeared on MSNBC \u2019 s Morning Joe to reiterate his innocence .

The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny . \u201d\nThis scrutiny , Biden implied , had been righteously exercised by his team , a practice of due diligence that affirms Reade \u2019 s claims are lies .
