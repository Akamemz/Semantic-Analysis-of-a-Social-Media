Using Amazon \u2019 s Mechanical Turk , they surveyed 317 U.S. adults about their news consumption habits , categorizing whether they were \u201c echo chamber builders \u201d or \u201c diversity seekers. \u201d The echo chamber folks \u201c find content providers ( both people and news sources or other websites ) they agree with and follow them ; when they come across a person or source they disagree with , that content or user is removed. \u201d The \u201c diversity seekers , \u201d meanwhile , \u201c purposefully seek out a variety of perspectives in their content feeds . These users \u2019 responses suggest they view social media as a way to expand their world view and engage with unlike others . \u201d\nThe researchers also asked questions to ascertain the participants \u2019 political leanings , and measured their levels of anxiety about current events .\nWhat they found was that people who diversify their online news streams reported lower levels of anxiety about current events :\nThe relationship between the diversity seeker subscale\u2026was statistically significant , while the relationship between the echo chamber builder subscale\u2026was not statistically significant\u2026In other words , participants who reported actively trying to diversify their online news streams by interacting with people and content espousing different points of view also reported lower levels of anxiety related to current events .
