    "content": "Last year , during the early days of the presidential campaign , Donald Trump boldly promised , \u201c I \u2019 m gon na win the Hispanic vote . \u201d\nThe past few days have suggested he was wrong . After Trump \u2019 s immigration speech focused on deporting millions of unauthorized immigrants and building a wall at the US\u2013Mexico border , several of his top Latino advisers resigned or threatened to resign . And a new , huge survey shows Trump isn \u2019 t just losing the Latino vote \u2014 he \u2019 s losing it by far more than the past few decades of Republican presidential candidates .\nThe survey , by America \u2019 s Voice and Latino Decisions , found that if the election were held today , 70 percent of registered Latino voters would vote for Hillary Clinton . Only 19 percent would vote for Trump . About 2 percent said they won \u2019 t vote for president , 4 percent said they \u2019 d vote for someone else , and 4 percent said they \u2019 re undecided or don \u2019 t know .\nThe findings are quite credible : The survey was huge , reaching 3,729 Latino registered voters online and by phone between August 19 and 30 . It has a margin of error of 1.6 percentage points .\nIf the election were held today , 70 percent of registered Latino voters would vote for Hillary Clinton . Only 19 percent would vote for Trump .\nThe findings are incredibly damning for Trump . To put this in context , this means that the Republican Party and Trump have effectively eliminated any gains the party made with Latino voters under President George W. Bush , who supported immigration reform that would have allowed unauthorized immigrants to gain legal status .\nIn 2000 and 2004 , Bush got 35 and 40 percent of the Latino vote . That was up from the share of the vote that Ronald Reagan ( 35 and 37 percent ) , George H.W . Bush ( 30 and 25 percent ) , Bob Dole ( 21 percent ) got . It was also higher than what John McCain ( 31 percent ) and Mitt Romney ( 27 percent ) got in subsequent elections .\nTrump \u2019 s numbers , then , are below the previous six Republicans to run for president . And they \u2019 re especially low at a time when the Latino population has grown \u2014 from 14.8 million people in 1980 to 55.2 million in 2014 .\nAs for why Trump has so little support among Latino voters , it \u2019 s basically what you 'd expect : 70 percent said that Trump has made the Republican Party more hostile to Latinos . And 68 percent said that Trump \u2019 s views on immigrants and immigration made them less likely to vote for Republicans in November .\nMeanwhile , 75-plus percent of Latino voters said President Barack Obama \u2019 s actions on immigration \u2014 such as letting undocumented immigrant youth stay in the country \u2014 made them more likely to vote for Democrats . And 64 percent said Hillary Clinton \u2019 s views on immigrants and immigration made them more likely to vote for Democrats .\nSo Republicans seemed to be on a downward trend with Latino voters after George W. Bush . But with Obama , Clinton , and Trump , that slide seems to have sped up by quite a bit .",
