But oddly enough , it was his IRA credentials , and the violence those entailed , that allowed him to become the statesman he was in the latter half of his life .\nFor me , as for most Irish people in their late 30s , McGuinness was one half of a double-act , along with Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams .
