I think these were youth coming out of the high school and they thought it was cute to throw cinder blocks at the police department and address it that way , '' he added.Violence erupted in West Baltimore Monday following Gray 's funeral and later spread to other neighborhoods in East Baltimore and downtown near Camden Yards.Two dozen people have been arrested and 15 police officers have been injured . Six officers were still in the hospital Monday night.Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has come under fire after some say she gave permission to rioters to engage in violence when she said `` while we tried to make sure that they were protected from the cars and the other things that were going on , we also gave to those who wished to destroy space to do that as well .
