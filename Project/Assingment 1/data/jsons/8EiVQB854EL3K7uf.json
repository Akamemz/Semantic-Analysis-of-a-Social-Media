    "content": "According to press accounts , a University of Alabama student was expelled for posting an Instagram video in which she said , among other things , `` I fucking hate niggers , '' and then some . The University president issued a statement condemning the video and saying the student `` is no longer enrolled here '' ; that does n't outright say that she was expelled , but I have no \u2588\u2588\u2588 to doubt the press accounts .\nNow no-one can confuse the video with a thoughtful argument . If empty hostility like this vanished from American life ( perhaps through some magical transfusion of decency and good judgment ) , the nation would be a better place .\nBut there 's a practical \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the First Amendment forbids expelling university students for saying such things\u2014or for that matter saying that they hate fucking Americans or Israelis , or love Hitler or Stalin or Mao or Che or whoever else . The last several years have made clear what the preceding decades should have shown as well : Attempts to punish people for their views are n't going to be neatly cabined just to the extreme .\nCondemnations of illegal immigration , of the Black Lives Matter movement , of affirmative action , of Israel , and of a wide range of other things are routinely excoriated as racist or anti-Semitic . Some such excoriation may be factually accurate in some instances ; but it means that , if supposedly racist speech can be suppressed , then any expression of such views risks being suppressed as well .\nLikewise , we 've routinely seen people on campuses try to suppress serious speakers alongside the ridiculous , and to suppress substantive arguments alongside epithets . Nor is this limited to race and ethnicity . Sharp criticism of Islam is viewed by many as morally equivalent to racism ( and is sometimes even outright labeled racism ) . Logically , the same should apply to sharp criticism of Catholicism , evangelical Christianity , and the like . Likewise , the notion that disapproval of homosexuality\u2014not just slinging epithets but any form of discrimination or support for discrimination\u2014is morally tantamount to racism is a commonplace of modern debates about gay rights .\nIf university students know that students can be freely expelled for racist rants , would they feel confident that they would n't be expelled\u2014or suspended or otherwise punished\u2014for expressing their views even without the epithets ? Would they feel confident that they would n't be punished for expressing views critical of illegal aliens or transgender rights , or for arguing that there are biological differences between the sexes or between racial groups ? Even apart from the rights of the particular student in this case , is there any safe harbor that officials like the University of Alabama president can offer to other students who want to express other views that the president may find `` highly offensive and deeply hurtful , '' and that `` do not represent \u2026 the values of [ the ] University '' ?\nJustice Black 's 1961 dissenting opinion in Communist Party of U.S. v.
