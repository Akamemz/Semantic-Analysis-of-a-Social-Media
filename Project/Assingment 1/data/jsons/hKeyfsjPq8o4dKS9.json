    "content_original": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nAttempting to regulate carbon dioxide is folly\n\nAll too many bad ideas get endlessly recycled \u2014 the carbon tax is one of them. A carbon tax could be a tax on coal, oil and gas carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants and other sources. Do you know how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere? It is a little less than 400 parts per million. Do you know what the optimum level of carbon dioxide is? No one does, even though some have the extreme conceit to think they do.\n\nThe earth\u2019s atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, about 21 percent oxygen, less than 1 percent argon, and only 0.038 percent carbon dioxide \u2014 plus a variable amount of water vapor. The gas is necessary for life. Plants cannot grow without it. They absorb it and release oxygen in exchange. Animals exhale carbon dioxide and inhale oxygen. There is evidence that as carbon-dioxide levels have risen, plants are growing faster, which means cheaper food.\n\nThe advocates of a carbon tax claim that the tax will help reduce dangerous emissions. The argument is that carbon dioxide is a \u201cgreenhouse\u201d gas and, everything else being equal, more of it in the atmosphere will result in higher atmospheric temperatures. The operative phrase here is \u201ceverything else being equal.\u201d When fossil fuels are burned, they produce small amounts of carbon dioxide but large amounts of water vapor. Increases in water vapor show up as more cloud cover. Clouds both trap heat (which increases warming) and reflect sunlight (which reduces warming), but there is no consensus about which effect is greater.\n\nWhat is known with a high degree of certainty is that at times in the past, the Earth has been both warmer and cooler at current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Those who think that also have a \u201cmainstream\u201d forecast of 3 degrees Celsius of global warming between now and the end of the century.
