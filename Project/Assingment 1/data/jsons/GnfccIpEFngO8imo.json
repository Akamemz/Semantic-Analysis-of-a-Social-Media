    "content": "A top Republican lawmaker countered warnings about the purportedly devastating impact of looming budget cuts , calling on the administration to lessen the blow by taking two simple steps -- stop hiring , and stop traveling .\nSen. Tom Coburn , R-Okla. , in a letter to the White House budget office , called Monday for a `` hiring freeze '' on non-essential positions . He pointed out that , amid pronouncements about the dire impact of spending cuts poised to hit starting this Friday , the administration is still advertising for a host of `` lower priority jobs '' -- like a staff assistant to answer phones at the Labor Department , and a policy coordinator to set up meetings at the Department of Health and Human Services .\nThe request follows a letter Thursday in which Coburn urged the Obama administration to cancel a 100-city tour aimed at connecting federal officials with local leaders .\nCoburn is among the Republicans on Capitol Hill who claim President Obama is exaggerating the impact of the cuts . Some claim the administration already has the flexibility to target the cuts ; others are looking to draft legislation to give the administration that flexibility .\nRegardless , Coburn disputed claims that the cuts automatically mean customs agents , Defense civilian workers and food inspectors will have to be furloughed or laid off , as the administration has warned . Perusing the roster of federal job openings , he listed 10 positions that `` could save as much as $ 1.4 million '' -- money that could be directed toward saving other jobs , he said .\nThe Labor Department staff assistant position pays up to $ 81,204 ; the HHS post pays up to the same amount . That 's a drop in the bucket compared with the $ 85 billion in cuts poised to hit this year . But Coburn suggested far more could be saved by instituting a broader hiring freeze , as he continued to draw attention to what he 's long described as Washington 's poor spending decisions .\n`` Instituting such a hiring freeze and re-assigning any of the necessary duties associated with each to current employees will allow federal agencies to adapt to the current fiscal realities without laying off or furloughing civil servants who are performing truly critical or absolutely necessary functions , '' Coburn wrote .\nDemocrats , though , argue that Obama 's hands are tied , and that the only way to avoid the so-called sequester is for Congress to pass a `` balanced '' package to avert the automatic cuts -- replacing them with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases , achieved by closing tax loopholes .\nObama , speaking Monday to a gathering of the nation 's governors at the White House , again urged Congress to pass an alternative package .\n`` The longer these cuts are in place , the bigger the impact will become , '' Obama said , adding that the cuts could be turned off `` with just a little bit of compromise .
