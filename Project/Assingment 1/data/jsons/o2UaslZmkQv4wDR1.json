    "content": "How Does A Red Seat Turn Blue ? Utah Race Tests Democrats ' Strategy To Take The House\nIn his very first answer in the recent debate between the candidates for Utah 's 4th Congressional District , Ben McAdams launched into a political origin story about his first encounter with burdensome government regulations .\nThe mayor of Salt Lake County told the audience about how he worked four jobs one summer during college to earn some extra income . `` Imagine my disappointment the following year when I was notified that I was denied federal student aid because I made too much money , '' he said . `` Government regulations and rules , they do n't always make sense . And they do n't always reward us for doing the right thing . ''\nThese kinds of anecdotes are common . It 's just that they usually come from Republicans . McAdams is a Democrat and , according to a recent poll from the Salt Lake Tribune , he is locked in a dead heat with Republican Rep. Mia Love .\nFor all the attention that the Democratic Party 's national leftward lurch has gotten over the past two years , it 's moderates like McAdams , running in Republican-leaning districts , who could put the party back in control of the House of Representatives .\nIn an interview with NPR , McAdams said he would give the Trump administration `` mixed reviews . '' He paused for a few moments before continuing . `` I will work with the Trump administration when I think it 's good for this country , when it 's good for Utah , '' he said . `` I 'll be there . I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in local roads and bridges . I want to be part of that . ''\nMcAdams criticizes Trump , for sure \u2014 on immigration policy , health care and other fronts . But like many Democratic candidates running in close contests this year , he is not regularly railing on Trump on the campaign trail . He is leery about pushing for impeachment , wanting to wait for not only the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation but for a bipartisan consensus on any congressional response . `` When you 're considering overturning the results of an election , that is a very serious thing , '' McAdams said . `` And it should be an issue of last resort , and it should n't be done on a partisan basis . ''\nAll of this is no accident . The county official and former state senator knows that while Democrats in other competitive House races have debated the tactical merits of working to energize and turn out the liberal base , compared with appealing to Republican voters to switch sides , he has no choice . Republicans have a 13-point advantage in this suburban Salt Lake district , and he needs to get them to cross the partisan divide .\n`` The votes I need to win this election I 've gotten twice before , '' he argued , pointing to county election results . `` I just need to reassure those people that I 'm not going to change . I 'm going to be the same person as a member of Congress that I 've been as mayor . ''\nMcAdams also has to persuade voters to dump Love , a two-term lawmaker who gained immediate national attention by being the first-ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican .\nLove is conservative , but running in a tight race , she has repeatedly framed herself as a pragmatist and an independent voice . `` I have built relationships on both sides of the aisle , '' she recently told the Salt Lake Chamber at a candidate forum . `` I 'm the only one in this delegation who has stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and have worked with him when he 's done something right , '' she proclaimed during the debate with McAdams .\nThe approach reflects Utah Republicans ' continued uneasiness about Trump . ( Trump won the district 's vote in 2016 , but with only 39 percent ; 22 percent of the 4th District broke for independent conservative candidate Evan McMullin . ) While Love repeatedly voted for Republican priorities in the House , and aggressively defends the Trump-signed GOP tax overhaul and last year 's attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act , she has highlighted the times she criticized Trump 's statements or actions .\nWhen Trump memorably referred to African nations and Haiti with a vulgar term during an Oval Office meeting on immigration , Love demanded an apology , calling the statement `` unkind , divisive , elitist , and [ flying ] in the face of our nation 's values . '' She was one of the first Republicans to try to force a House vote on a measure providing a permanent solution for the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 a move Trump repeatedly blocked by demanding legal immigration changes Democrats wo n't support . During the debate she called Trump 's policy of separating the families of people who enter the country illegally `` absolutely horrific . ''\nOccasional statements from congressional Republicans chiding Trump 's tweets , comments and , less frequently , policies are , of course , a common theme of the past two years . All the while the House and Senate have gone along with the president 's policy pushes and declined to provide any significant oversight of the Trump administration .\nBut as the party becomes more and more Trumpcentric , occasional criticism from another Republican on the campaign trail is rare . Indeed , many of the other GOP lawmakers who publicly split with Trump or criticized him opted to retire this year , rather than run again . Others , like Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham , have shifted gears to become close Trump allies .\nGiven all that , Love 's campaign is one of a handful of test cases on whether voters will reward a lawmaker for an arms-length embrace of the White House .\nMcAdams has repeatedly dismissed and criticized Love 's balancing act . `` Words are one thing . Actions and outcomes are another , '' he said again and again during their debate .\n`` I do n't get credit for what I try to do or what I say I want to do , '' he told NPR . `` I 'm judged based on what I accomplish .
