    "content": "President Obama , amid charges of class warfare , pushed Monday for a tax hike on families earning more than $ 250,000 -- and an extension of the Bush-era tax rates for families making less than that .\nThe president , speaking in the East Room of the White House , said he wants to break through the `` stalemate '' over taxes in Congress . He argued that sustaining the current tax rates for top earners puts too big a hole in the federal budget , saying `` we ca n't afford to keep that up . '' Obama called on Congress to extend those rates , for one year , for families earning less than $ 250,000 -- failure to do so , he said , would be a `` blow '' to families and a `` drag '' on the economy .\n`` We do n't need more top-down economics , '' Obama said . `` We need policies that grow and strengthen the middle class . ''\nThe president urged Congress to pass a bill that deals with the middle-class tax rates only , and then move on to a separate debate over extending the rates for top earners . Obama , though , made clear he is adamantly opposed to doing so .\n`` I will fight to end them , '' Obama said , adding that he does n't want that debate to `` threaten '' those making less than $ 250,000 .\nWhen asked later in a TV interview with North Carolina 's WRAL whether he would veto any bill that extended all the tax cuts , Obama said , `` yes , and the reason is , we ca n't afford it . ''\nThe proposal comes just days after Obama courted the blue-collar vote in the battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania , where he talked frequently about middle-class values .\nThe pitch is the latest proposal from a White House that has had a complicated relationship with the Bush-era tax rates , which have been in effect for nearly a decade . Obama at first held back on letting any of those rates expire during the height of the recession , saying in 2009 that would be `` the last thing you want to do '' because it would `` take more demand out of the economy . ''\nHe then negotiated with Republicans in 2010 to extend the rates for another two years .\nBut campaign adviser Robert Gibbs said over the weekend that Obama is now `` 100 percent committed '' to ending the rates for those making more than $ 250,000 .\nThe latest proposal would let the rates expire only for those whose incomes exceed $ 250,000 . It preempts a more sweeping proposal from congressional Republicans -- who will be negotiating for an extension of the Bush tax rates for everyone . Those rates expire at the end of the year .\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell 's office immediately panned the president 's plan as a `` call for tax hikes on small businesses .

On `` CNN 's State of the Union '' Sunday , McConnell noted , `` We have a slower growth rate today than we had then . ''\nHouse Speaker John Boehner offered a similar rebuke , accusing Obama of `` doubling down on his quixotic call for the same small businesses tax hikes that have been routinely rejected by the House and Senate .
