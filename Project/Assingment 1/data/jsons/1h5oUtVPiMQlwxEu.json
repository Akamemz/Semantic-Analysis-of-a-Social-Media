You know and I know it is very easy for politicians to run over a reporter -- they do n't care . There is no price to be paid for being rude to a reporter , not answering the question . But 80 undecided voters looking at you , and some of them getting up and going , `` Well , what about this ? '' It 's just harder to dodge .\nThere 's also the whole -- you know , if you want to get into the optics of it , there 's the whole wandering around the stage , and feeling their pain , and there 's this whole kind of other set of expectations that we 've come to want , or at least talk about afterwards , that now goes with modern television debates .\nCNN : How is a town hall debate different than other debates in terms of challenges and opportunities that presents itself ?\nCrowley : The challenge is that they 've got to connect not just with the people looking into the television and watching them , but the people who are on the stage with them .\nSome 80 or so undecided voters are chosen by Gallup , so they have to keep those folks in mind . It 's a much more intimate and up-close adventure with voters than talking through a reporter .\nCNN : Now , we heard a lot with all these debates about style versus substance . Does it become even more about style because it 's a town hall ?\nCrowley : No , I think it 's both about substance and style no matter what the debate is , and you do n't know which it 's going to be most about until it 's over .\nIf a voter gets up and says , `` I am unemployed and I have n't had a job in X amount of months and this happened and that to my health care , '' there has to be substance to that answer . You ca n't just be about , `` Oh my gosh , that 's terrible , I 'm so sorry to hear your story . '' It 's got to be , you know , give them something .\nSo I think it 's both , and I think there is a lot in common with the debates , in that we 're not going to know until after the debates are over -- where this is something where the message came through with style , or in substance , or maybe a little of both , which is generally the case .\nCNN : I guess with or without the podium and with the audience interaction it seems like you would kind of , everything would carry more weight .\nCrowley : Well , I think it does in a sense of these are real people that -- the audience does n't necessarily relate to either presidential candidates or media . They just do n't .\nBut they do relate to 80 people sitting on a stage that look like them , and maybe have stories similar to theirs . And so they can kind of see themselves through the town hall meeting participants .\nAnd I think that 's where a candidate has to make a connection , because the candidate that makes a connection with the person asking the question is also making a better connection with the person back at home .\nCNN : There is some sense , one of the people I interviewed talked about how a town hall setting is viewed maybe as a little bit more freewheeling , free-flowing , less predictable because of the audience interaction . Do you buy that ? Or do candidates always go back to their script and their talking points ?\nCrowley : Whenever candidates get a chance , they will return to their talking points . And I think that 's where we come in , like why I said , `` We know this . But the question was not oranges , it was apples , so could you please address apples , that would be good . ''\nJUST WATCHED Crowley on what keeps her awake at night Replay More Videos ...

But I think it is more difficult to stay in that zone when you have a person with a story asking you a question that relates to their life .\nCrowley : What 's interesting to me is when I look back at the debates , there are things that are kind of monumental . Now , one of them is more history to me than having actually having seen it , and that is when Gerry Ford talked about Poland as being free , and of course it was behind the Iron Curtain .

'' Bob Schieffer and I are different , Jim Lehrer and I are different , we come from different backgrounds , we 've had different experiences , and certainly , one of the differences between them and me is that I 'm female and they 're male , so that 's a part of it .
