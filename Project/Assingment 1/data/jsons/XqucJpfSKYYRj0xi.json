    "content": "A government watchdog who played a central role in the Hillary Clinton email investigation during the Obama administration told Fox News that he , his family and his staffers faced an intense backlash at the time from Clinton allies \u2013 and that the campaign even put out word that it planned to fire him if the Democratic presidential nominee won the 2016 election .\n\u201c There was personal blowback . Personal blowback to me , to my family , to my office , \u201d former Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough III said .\nThe Obama appointee discussed his role in the Clinton email probe for the first time on television , during an exclusive interview with Fox News aired on `` Tucker Carlson Tonight . '' McCullough \u2013 who came to the inspector general position with more than two decades of experience at the FBI , Treasury and intelligence community \u2013 shed light on how quickly the probe was politicized and his office was marginalized by Democrats .\nIn January 2016 , after McCullough told the Republican leadership on the Senate intelligence and foreign affairs committees that emails beyond the \u201c Top Secret \u201d level passed through the former secretary of state 's unsecured personal server , the backlash intensified .\n\u201c All of a sudden I became a shill of the right , \u201d McCullough recalled . \u201c And I was told by members of Congress , \u2018 Be careful . You 're losing your credibility . You need to be careful . There are people out to get you . \u2019 \u201d\nBut the former inspector general , with responsibility for the 17 intelligence agencies , said the executive who recommended him to the Obama administration for the job \u2013 then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper \u2013 was also disturbed by the independent Clinton email findings .\n\u201c [ Clapper ] said , \u2018 This is extremely reckless. \u2019 And he mentioned something about -- the campaign \u2026 will have heartburn about that , \u201d McCullough said .\nHe said Clapper 's Clinton email comments came during an in-person meeting about a year before the presidential election \u2013 in late December 2015 or early 2016 . \u201c [ Clapper ] was as off-put as the rest of us were . \u201d\nAfter the Clapper meeting , McCullough said his team was marginalized . \u201c I was told by senior officials to keep [ Clapper ] out of it , \u201d he said , while acknowledging he tried to keep his boss in the loop .\nAs one of the few people who viewed the 22 top secret Clinton emails deemed too classified to release under any circumstances , the former IG said , \u201c There was a very good reason to withhold those emails ... there would have been harm to national security. \u201d McCullough went further , telling Fox News that \u201c sources and methods , lives and operations \u201d could be put at risk .\nSome of those email exchanges contained Special Access Program ( SAP ) information characterized by intel experts as \u201c above top secret . \u201d\n\u201c I was told by members of Congress , \u2018 Be careful .

There are people out to get you. \u2019 \u201d \u2014 Former Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough III\nWikiLeaks documents show the campaign was formulating talking points as the review of 30,000 Clinton emails was ongoing .\nThe campaign team wrote in August 2015 that \u201c Clinton only used her account for unclassified email . When information is reviewed for public release , it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified . \u201d\nMcCullough was critical of the campaign \u2019 s response , as the classified review had barely begun . \u201c There was an effort \u2026 certainly on the part of the campaign , to mislead people into thinking that there was nothing to see here , \u201d McCullough said .\nIn March 2016 , seven senior Democrats sent a letter to McCullough and his State Department counterpart , saying they had serious questions about the impartiality of the Clinton email review . However , McCullough was not making the decisions on what material in Clinton \u2019 s emails was classified -- he was passing along the findings of the individual agencies who got the intelligence and have final say on classification .\n\u201c I think there was certainly a coordinated strategy , \u201d McCullough said .\nMcCullough described one confrontation with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein 's office just six weeks before the election , amid pressure to respond to the letter \u2013 which Feinstein had co-signed .\n\u201c I thought that any response to that letter would just hyper-politicize the situation , \u201d McCullough said . \u201c I recall even offering to resign , to the staff director . I said , \u2018 Tell [ Feinstein ] I 'll resign tonight . I 'd be happy to go . I 'm not going to respond to that letter .
