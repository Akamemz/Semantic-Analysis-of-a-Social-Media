    "content": "Pete Buttigieg , who has rapidly hurtled from obscurity in the Midwest to national prominence , is frustrated .\n`` We 've allowed our conservative friends to get a monopoly on the idea of freedom , '' the mayor of South Bend , Ind. , told voters in South Carolina earlier this month . Republicans talk in terms of freedom from government . Democrats , the upstart presidential candidate argued , should talk in terms of freedom to access government-guaranteed rights like abortion and gay marriage .\nAnd so Buttigieg wants a great rebranding . Normally , he would welcome the efforts of a group of operatives working to reclaim the \u201c freedom \u201d vocabulary . Their nonprofit organization , Future Majority , will serve as the branding consultant for 2020 , operate a war room to counter conservative messaging , and help Democrats win back the Midwest . They have $ 60 million in the bank . They are a political nonprofit capable of raising and spending unlimited amounts of so-called dark money without disclosing their donors or activities .\nAnd they are awkward for candidates like Buttigieg . Like the rest of the pack seeking the Democratic nomination , he has condemned big money in politics . He denounced Citizens United as \u201c a disaster , \u201d complaining that the Supreme Court decision , which allows unlimited political spending by corporations and unions , \u201c has come to mean that dollars can vote . \u201d\nThis raises an embarrassing question for each of the candidates competing to take on President Trump : Will they swear off dark money but let others spend it on their behalf ?\nThe irony isn \u2019 t lost on Mark Riddle , the executive director of Future Majority . While the group \u2019 s political engine burns through this kind of cash , he insisted his organization supports campaign finance reform . A link can be even found on its website to HR1 , legislation that would crack down on such spending .\nBut to get rid of excess money in politics , money in politics is apparently necessary . \u201c Democrats can not go into the 2020 elections with one arm tied behind their back , \u201d Riddle told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c Obviously we respect each individual candidate in the presidential horse race for trying to carve out a niche , \u201d Riddle said of the numerous candidates condemning dark money . \u201c But at the end of the day , we need a fully funded operation to beat Trump , McConnell , the RNC , the Russians , or whomever else . \u201d\nIn short , Democrats aren \u2019 t willing to unilaterally disarm -- mismatched messaging and political tactics be damned . After all , the America First Action super PAC , the scandal riddled Great America PAC , and Future 45 PAC are already up , running , and spending big to keep Trump in the White House another four years .\nRiddle wants a campaign apparatus ready to counter each of them .
