    "content": "Two of the standard-bearers for style and ethics across the news industry sent a message to journalists everywhere last week : When reporting about the group that \u2019 s dubbed itself \u201c the alternative right , \u201d make it clear that their movement isn \u2019 t simply a hip new twist on conservatism \u2014 and that , in fact , its racist beliefs and goals demand comparisons to America \u2019 s most infamous kind of hate groups .\nJohn Daniszewski , the Associated Press vice president for standards , told the AP \u2019 s reporters and the countless journalists across the industry who use its stylebook to be clear about what the alt-right is to readers .\nIn a November 28 blog post with the new guidance , he wrote that a story \u2019 s initial reference of the \u201c alt-right \u201d \u2014 always in quotation marks \u2014 should be accompanied by a description to help readers understand that it is \u201c an offshoot of conservatism mixing racism , white nationalism and populism , \u201d or , to put it plainly , \u201c a white nationalist movement . \u201d\nThe New York Times was even stronger , instructing its writers to put the phrase in quotes or preface it with \u201c so-called. \u201d They must then clearly express what the group stands for , every single time , avoiding even letting the phrase stand alone without its link to white nationalism \u2014 even in a headline . Assistant masthead editor Clifford Levy shared the text of the new rules December 2 .\nLet \u2019 s avoid using \u201c alt-right \u201d in isolation , without an explanation ( which means it will rarely be appropriate in headlines ) . We don \u2019 t need to adopt one-size-fits-all boilerplate , but any description can touch on some key elements , based on our own reporting about the \u201c alt-right \u201d : It \u2019 s a racist , far-right fringe movement that embraces an ideology of white nationalism and is anti-immigrant , anti-Semitic and anti-feminist . It is highly decentralized but has a wide online presence . Followers rail against multiculturalism and what they see as \u201c political correctness. \u201d So , for example , we might describe someone as \u201c a leader of the so-called alt-right , a far-right fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and anti-immigrant positions . \u201d\nGuidelines from the AP , Times , and several others have arrived not a moment too soon . The alt-right movement had been earning plenty of attention throughout the election cycle , especially for its members \u2019 fervent support for Donald Trump .\nBut it was thrust into the spotlight the weekend after the election , when the National Policy Institute held an alt-right conference in Washington , DC . There , its leader Richard Spencer delivered remarks calling America \u201c a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity. \u201d In a video shared by the Atlantic , Trump \u2019 s victory and Spencer \u2019 s statements were cheered by the crowd with Nazi salutes and chants of , \u201c Hail Trump , hail our people , hail victory ! \u201d That Sunday evening , Trump announced his chief strategist and senior counselor would be Breitbart News editor Steve Bannon , who once bragged that his publication was \u201c the platform for the alt-right . \u201d\nIt quickly became undeniable that the alt-right was no longer a small-time fringe group that lived on Twitter and 4chan \u2014 it had evolved into a formidable movement with political clout in the White House , all while openly spouting messages of white supremacy , xenophobia , misogyny , and other extreme ideas . News organizations know their decisions about how to describe a modern group with an age-old racist message will shape how Americans understood it .\nJournalists are weighing tradition and clarity when writing about the alt-right\nJournalists can \u2019 t just use any words and description they want : They \u2019 re bound by professional ethics , tradition , and a strong incentive to avoid libel suits that could result if subjects are mischaracterized . That \u2019 s why a crime is always \u201c alleged \u201d unless there \u2019 s been a conviction , and even a confessed killer isn \u2019 t a \u201c murderer \u201d unless a court has said so . The result : In many cases , words used in reporting can seem weak compared with harsher terms that would resonate more with audiences and that many would argue are the truth .\nSimilarly , there \u2019 s a strong tradition in journalism of using the names that people and organizations want to be known by . \u201c It comes from the ideal of reporting the news as it is , not what you want it to be , \u201d Paul Levinson , a professor of media and communications studies at Fordham University , said .\nIn the case of \u201c alt-right , \u201d white nationalist Richard Spencer is credited with coining the term for the largely internet-based movement when he launched his Alternative Right blog in 2010 . Its core ideals are defined by white nationalism , racist ideas around white identity , and the preservation of Western civilization .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Dylan Mathews has reported , the so-called alt-right is a loose , online-based group that also includes people like libertarians and neoreactionaries in its ranks . A close look reveals it \u2019 s \u201c the product of the intersection of a longstanding , long-marginalized part of the conservative movement with both the most high-minded and the basest elements of internet culture . This and other distinctions , he argues , make it more complicated than warmed-over white supremacy .\nBut according to the Southern Poverty Law Center , the differences are insignificant . In fact , the name is one key part of a package , along with neat dressing and a clean-cut appearance , that makes the alt-right seem more palatable \u2014 and maybe even inviting \u2014 to those fed up with status quo conservatism . \u201c We have to look good , \u201d Spencer once told Salon \u2019 s Lauren Fox , explaining that no one would want to join a movement that appeared \u201c crazed or ugly or vicious or just stupid. \u201d In the SPLC \u2019 s view , the innocuous name and efforts to appear sophisticated have a clear goal : to make a kind of extreme racism that is generally regarded as destructive and immoral appear mainstream .\nThat \u2019 s why Sophie Bjork-James , a postdoctoral anthropology fellow at Vanderbilt University who studies contemporary white supremacist movements , says she \u2019 s \u201c very passionate about this idea that we need to be very careful with that term . \u2018 Alt-right \u2019 sounds much more palatable than \u2018 neo-Nazi. \u2019 It is an attempt at reframing a violent ideology as a palatable political position . \u201d\nDespite concerns over the alt-right \u2019 s deceptive branding , many publications have found it sufficient to call the alt-right by its desired , Spencer-created name . Sometimes they \u2019 ll add that it is \u201c associated with \u201d or \u201c connected to \u201d white nationalism , white supremacy , or neo-Nazism \u2014 and sometimes they won \u2019 t .\nTake , for example , the Washington Post \u2019 s November 22 profile of Spencer , which waited a few paragraphs after it first mentioned the phrase \u201c alt-right \u201d to mention that the group wanted to create an \u201c ethno-state \u201d that would banish minorities , and described the way critics characterized the \u201c alt-right \u201d \u2014 racist , white supremacist , neo-Nazi \u2014 but presented the characterizations as perspectives rather than facts . Or the November 23 New York Post story that called Spencer a white nationalist but described the alt-right in its chosen words : \u201c an independent organization dedicated to the heritage , identity , and future of people of European descent in the United States , and around the world . \u201d\n\u201c Any effort to assign a different label to them can be at best challenging and at worst misleading and dangerous , \u201d said David Boardman , dean of the school of media and communication at Temple University . At the same time , he says , `` alt-right '' seems \u201c a woefully soft descriptor for the radical positions of this movement . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s why suddenly seeing \u201c alt-right \u201d everywhere ( without the \u201c white nationalist \u201d clarification , especially ) may be doing a disservice to readers . \u201c To call this the alt-right without defining it as white supremacist ideology is to normalize that ideology , \u201d said Bjork-James .\nThe problem isn \u2019 t just that shirking the \u201c white nationalist \u201d descriptor would leave readers less than fully informed . It \u2019 s that without this description , \u201c alt-right \u201d distracts from the agendas of those like Spencer in a way that may attract and radicalize new supporters .\n\u201c My concern is that if we help to normalize these ideas as just part of the political spectrum , then it can make it seem less radical than they are and less connected to racial violence \u2014 because if people espouse racist ideas and racial rhetoric , there \u2019 s always some kind of a correlation to racist violence , \u201d Bjork-James said . \u201c And if we don \u2019 t describe them for what they are , we \u2019 re kind of giving other white people a path to think these are legitimate ideas and a chance that more white people will become radicalized in adopting these ideas . \u201d\nAnti-hate activists and scholars of far-right movements aren \u2019 t the only ones who have these concerns or who have criticized the media for , in their view , giving in to the alt-right \u2019 s desire to look good .\nAuthor Jodi Picoult and journalist Soledad O \u2019 Brien were among the many who used Twitter to urge that Spencer and his ilk be called \u201c neo-Nazis \u201d or \u201c white supremacists . \u201d\nIf we \u2019 re gon na call white supremacists alt-right , then surely we should describe Dylann Roof as an alt-right terrorist . \u2014 Anil Dash ( @ anildash ) November 28 , 2016\nWords matter .

Don \u2019 t label . Explain a person or a group by their actions and statements . Let the facts speak for themselves , \u201d she said , pointing out that even Spencer himself once admitted in an interview with NPR that \u201c in some ways the \u2018 alt-right \u2019 is arbitrary . \u201d\nAs Jeff Cohen , a media critic and associate professor of journalism at Ithaca College , pointed out , journalists actually do have some leeway to decide when replacing or rejecting names is appropriate .\n\u201c An abject case was the US invasion of Iraq , which was dubbed \u2018 Operation Iraqi Freedom \u2019 by the White House and Pentagon , and a couple of the cable news channels adopted that name as their very own name for their invasion coverage , \u201d he said . \u201c By contrast , some groups or movements are not afforded the right to name themselves \u2014 for example , you might see mainstream media reporting on \u2018 a self-described democratic socialist \u2019 group or individual , as if to raise doubts about the legitimacy of the self-description . \u201d\nWhat makes the difference ? In Cohen \u2019 s view , the degree to which political movements or groups or enterprises are allowed by mainstream media to get away with their own self-identification has to do with one main factor : \u201c how \u2018 establishment \u2019 those groups are or how much those groups intimidate mainstream media . \u201d\nBoardman from Temple University said there is , in fact , precedent for news organizations rejecting a self-assigned label , particularly when that label is politically loaded . One example is the term \u201c pro-life , \u201d which is the preferred label of many groups who oppose abortion rights . \u201c While most news outlets used that term in earlier decades , most now reject it in favor of \u2018 anti-abortion \u2019 or \u2018 anti\u2013abortion rights \u2019 or \u2018 anti-choice , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nSo far , no major , mainstream publications have abandoned or replaced \u201c alt-right \u201d in this way \u2014 but none have said they won \u2019 t link the alt-right to white nationalism either .\nIt looks like the growing consensus in the industry hovers around Cohen \u2019 s view : \u201c It would not seem unethical for skeptical or independent-minded news outlets to use phrases such as \u2018 a white racist organization that describes itself as alt-right , \u2019 or \u2018 a white supremacist group that describes itself as alt-right , \u2019 \u201d he said . This mirrors the AP \u2019 s commitment not to \u201c limit ourselves to letting such groups define themselves , \u201d instead reporting \u201c their actions , associations , history and positions to reveal their actual beliefs and philosophy , as well as how others see them . \u201d\nFor now , it seems that major publications will continue to use the term \u201c alt-right. \u201d That \u2019 s arguably a win for the group \u2019 s branding and recruitment goals .
