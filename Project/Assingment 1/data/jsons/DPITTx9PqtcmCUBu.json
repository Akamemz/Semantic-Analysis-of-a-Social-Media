    "content": "We already know ObamaCare is a poorly conceived law that is unworkable in the real world . We know the law is already driving health care premiums through the roof contrary to what President Obama promised . For instance , in my home state , our largest health insurance provider reported recently that health care premiums could go up by more than 200 percent on some customers , and the average increase could be almost 30 percent according to one study .\nWe also know that implementation of the law has been a disaster so far . The Obama administration made the decision last month to delay the penalty provisions in the bill on employers for another year . So the boss gets spared , but no such luck for the working stiff .\nThis action is an acknowledgement from the administration that the law is not ready for primetime . Worse , the delay is going to increase the cost of the already too expensive bill by $ 12 billion . And there are clearly political motivations behind the delay as moving the tax on employers beyond the 2014 elections removes a burden on Democrats running to defend this terrible piece of legislation .\nThe writing is already on the wall -- the entire ObamaCare law needs to be repealed .\nBut wait , as they say in the infomercials , there \u2019 s more ! By August 15 , the Obama administration is expected to spend $ 54 million of our tax dollars to hire community organizers to push this law on the American people . The president was once a self-professed community organizer , so perhaps this is his way of \u201c giving back \u201d as they say .\nOver the next few weeks , the Obama administration is set to dole out grants and begin to hire thousands of marketers to help sell ObamaCare .
