    "content": "MINNEAPOLIS\u2014They have gathered in defiance of the freezing temperatures on a late February \u2019 s night , scores of them twirling Somali flags in one hand and American flags in the other , crowding around the arrivals terminal and waiting to welcome one of their own . The vast Somali community in the Twin Cities is like one sprawling extended family , explains Ali Aden , a 39-year-old engineer who came to the U.S. two decades ago , as we survey the scene . When a prominent member of the family arrives , it \u2019 s customary to greet them this way .\n\u201c Is it Congresswoman Omar they \u2019 re waiting for ? \u201d I ask , referencing the freshman Democrat whose district we \u2019 re standing in .\n\u201c Ilhan ? \u201d he smiles broadly . \u201c No , no . If it were Ilhan , the whole city would be here . \u201d\nAs it turns out , the reception is for an obscure Somali government dignitary . In normal times , his arrival would be the talk of the local expat community ; some 80,000 people of Somali descent are estimated to live in Minnesota , the largest community of the Somali diaspora in the United States , one that has distinctly flavored the Twin Cities \u2019 culture and caused some occasional unease on the right , such as when then-candidate Donald Trump warned in 2016 of the \u201c disaster \u201d of Somali refugees moving into Minnesota and becoming radicalized by Islamic State .\nBut these are not normal times . The voters of Minnesota \u2019 s 5th Congressional District knew they were making history last November : Omar \u2019 s victory made her both the first Somali-American to serve in Congress and , along with fellow newcomer Rashida Tlaib of Michigan , its first Muslim female member . What they didn \u2019 t expect was that in her first seven weeks on the job she would become one of the most prominent , polarizing and recognizable politicians in America\u2014the subject of fierce debates on the House floor and cable news , lauded on the left for standing up to Israel and vilified on the right for comments seen by many as anti-Semitic .\nOmar was destined to stand out : After Congress changed its 181-year-old rule prohibiting headwear to accommodate her , she became the first person to wear a hijab on the House floor . But it wasn \u2019 t her wardrobe , or her religion , or her gripping biography as the congresswoman who came of age in a refugee camp , that distinguished Omar in her early days on Capitol Hill . Rather , it was her usage of social media and the uproar that ensued .\nFirst , Omar tweeted that Lindsey Graham had been \u201c compromised , \u201d suggesting that his support for Trump\u2014whom he \u2019 d verbally mauled throughout the 2016 campaign\u2014owed to blackmail collected on the South Carolina senator . ( Conservatives accused Omar of playing on the long-running , unsubstantiated insinuation that Graham is gay ; she denied this , but apologized . ) Then , after being seated on the House Foreign Affairs Committee , Omar was lampooned for a 2012 tweet in which she wrote during an Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip , \u201c Israel has hypnotized the world , may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. \u201d ( Omar later apologized and deleted the tweet ; she claimed ignorance of the anti-Semitic trope that conceives of Jewish hypnosis . )\nFinally , in early February , after just over a month on the job , Omar made the jump from occasional agitator to permanent lightning rod . Arguing that U.S. lawmakers back Israel because of campaign donations from Jewish donors , the congresswoman tweeted , \u201c It \u2019 s all about the Benjamins baby , \u201d a reference to $ 100 bills . The fallout was fierce : The entire House Democratic leadership denounced Omar , forcing yet another apology , and both the president and vice president piled on , skewering the congresswoman for her remarks , with Trump even suggesting that she should resign from Congress . ( Notably , neither Trump nor Mike Pence has ever criticized Congressman Steve King despite his well-documented record of openly racist rhetoric . )\nAll of this proved agonizing for Omar \u2019 s constituents , particularly those in the Somali community . Her arrival in Congress was meant to bring them legitimacy and representation . Instead , almost immediately , it invited controversy and humiliation . \u201c I was shocked . I don \u2019 t like her on Twitter , \u201d Aden tells me . \u201c She \u2019 s very smart , and I didn \u2019 t think she would talk that way . It was an embarrassment for me as a Somali-American , because we do not like extreme left or extreme right . But she will do better . This is new to her\u2014she will learn how to handle it . \u201d\nThe more essential question , it seems , is whether the Democratic Party\u2014its base bursting with energy , riding high off the House takeover of 2018\u2014will learn to handle Omar .\nThe Minnesota congresswoman , along with the likes of Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , represents the unapologetic new guard of progressivism , pushing the party \u2019 s establishment to embrace tactics and positions that have heretofore been considered outside of the mainstream . Yet they face resistance not just from party elders but from many of their fellow freshmen , centrists who campaigned as fixers not firebrands , moderates who are watching warily as the Democrats \u2019 brand is being hijacked by the far left . One of these members is Omar \u2019 s neighbor in Minnesota : Dean Phillips , a wealthy businessman who represents the 3rd District .\nTo better understand these dueling visions for the Democratic Party , I sat down with both Omar and Phillips , spent several days in their communities and talked with some of their constituents . What I learned is that , despite the cautionary tale offered by years of vicious Republican infighting , Democrats are dangerously close to entering into their own fratricidal conflict . On matters of both style and substance , the fractures within this freshman class are indicative of the broader divisions in a party long overdue for an ideological reckoning .\nAnd Omar isn \u2019 t shying away from it . \u201c I am certainly not looking to be comfortable , and I don \u2019 t want everyone necessarily to feel comfortable around me , \u201d she told me , a mischievous smile tugging at her lips . \u201c I think really the most exciting things happen when people are extremely uncomfortable . \u201d\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine \u2019 s email of the week \u2019 s best , delivered to your inbox every Friday morning .

Amid a discussion of Omar and Ocasio-Cortez , he complained , \u201c Suddenly an entire party is being branded by the perspectives of two of its members who represent 1 percent of the caucus . \u201d\nFor Somali-Americans like Aden , the Democrats \u2019 identity crisis cuts more deeply . Joyful yet jittery in this era of anti-immigrant politics , they knew that she , as a Muslim woman born in Africa , would be a magnet for scrutiny , and it \u2019 s going to take more than a few careless tweets to diminish their immense pride in her success . What worries Aden and others in the Somali community I spoke with is that Omar has walked into a trap\u2014stumbling into these controversies not because she is motivated by anti-Semitism , but by a background in grassroots activism and a belief that the only way to defeat Trump is to play the game by his rules : accusing instead of inquiring ; wielding hyperbole as an everyday weapon ; tweeting first and asking questions later .\n\u201c Trump is a radical . Maybe I should say he \u2019 s a racist , because that \u2019 s what I believe . But I don \u2019 t want to see others becoming radical as the result , \u201d Aden , a naturalized citizen and a loyal Democrat , says . Like more than a few members of Pelosi \u2019 s team , he shudders at talk of impeaching the president\u2014not because he likes Trump , but because he thinks it will help the president paint his opponents as \u201c extreme , just like him , \u201d and benefit his reelection in 2020 .\n\u201c I just worry Ilhan will be too much left , like the woman in New York , \u201d Aden says . \u201c You know\u2014AOC . \u201d\nIn January , Democrats reclaimed the House majority with a freshman class of over 60 members , the party \u2019 s biggest in nearly a half-century . It has already distinguished itself as perhaps the most consequential crop of new lawmakers ever to arrive in Washington . Even more immediately than the 2010 wave of Tea Party Republicans rebranded the GOP just two years removed from George W. Bush \u2019 s presidency , this 2018 class has demonstrated at warp speed its capacity for manipulating the trajectory of the post-Barack Obama Democratic Party , its presidential hopefuls succumbing to the gravitational pull of the freshmen agitators within weeks of their taking office .\nFor Omar , there is no danger in calling for Trump \u2019 s impeachment , or in advocating the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , or in pushing \u201c Medicare for All , \u201d or in supporting the \u201c Green New Deal \u201d : Hillary Clinton carried her district by 55 percentage points in 2016 . The same can be said for Omar \u2019 s closest friends : Tlaib , Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley from Massachusetts . This clique of rookie lawmakers , who call themselves the \u201c Squad , \u201d represent four of the safest Democratic districts in America . They have come to Congress not to pursue incremental victories , but to push for wholesale change in the government and inside their own party , secure in the knowledge that their deep-blue backyards will buffer them from whatever recoil might damage other Democrats in less ideologically insulated parts of the country .\nThe dilemma for the party is that Democrats would not have won their majority without the influx of some 40 newcomers who flipped Republican-held battleground seats\u2014the vast majority of them running on platforms of good government and bipartisan productivity .\nIn Michigan , while Tlaib \u2019 s flamboyant liberalism suits the Detroit-anchored 13th District\u2014 \u201c We \u2019 re going to impeach the motherfucker ! \u201d she declared hours after being sworn in\u2014it makes life considerably harder for Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin , a pair of moderate freshmen who won difficult races in the suburban-heavy 11th and 8th Districts , respectively .\nAnd in New York , while Ocasio-Cortez puts the Bronx-based 14th District on the map with her championing of Democratic socialism , her fellow freshman Max Rose , a combat veteran who won a major upset in the 11th District by playing to the cultural conservatism of Staten Island , is forced to answer for his party \u2019 s lurch to the left .\nBut perhaps nowhere is the divergence inside today \u2019 s Democratic Party better crystallized than here in greater Minneapolis . Omar \u2019 s 5th District , which includes the airport , has not been represented by a Republican since 1962 . A five-minute cab ride away is the Mall of America , located in Minnesota \u2019 s 3rd District , which had not been represented by a Democrat since 1960\u2014until January , when Phillips took office after knocking off GOP incumbent Erik Paulsen last fall .\n\u201c The districts couldn \u2019 t be more remarkably different . They \u2019 re neighboring , but don \u2019 t have a lot of similarities , \u201d says Ken Martin , chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee .\nOmar \u2019 s district is entirely urban , a mix of the very prosperous and the very poor , with a median household income of $ 63,202 and a mean household income of $ 88,390 , according to the Census Bureau . Phillips \u2019 district is mostly suburban , enwrapping Minneapolis like a giant \u201c C , \u201d containing blue-collar boroughs to the north , affluent areas to the west and upper-middle-class communities to the south of the city . Its median household income is $ 89,442 , and its mean household income is $ 123,574 .\nThat Phillips is Jewish and Omar is a Muslim\u2014the only such neighboring members of Congress in American history\u2014makes their intersection all the more intriguing , particularly in light of recent events .\nYet to focus too narrowly on this unique dynamic is to obscure the phenomena of polarity that Omar and Phillips represent . With a new generation of Democratic leaders emerging , and the left splintered over some of the existential questions of governing in the age of Trump , two warring iterations of the modern Democratic Party can be found in one overlapping zip code . Where Omar and her fellow safe-seat Democrats prescribe a fearless liberalism and believe Trump \u2019 s scorched-earth approach calls for zero-sum political warfare , Phillips and his swing-district confederates preach cooperation and a post-ideological pragmatism , fearful that the president \u2019 s surest path to reelection is to portray their party as even more dogmatic than his own .\nThe weight of these circumstances is not lost on either lawmaker . In separate interviews , both Omar and Phillips had kind words for the other , downplaying intraparty rivalries while offering bromides of shared goals for their caucus .\nBut once I began drilling down on specifics\u2014of policy and strategy , ideological branding and political temperament\u2014the tensions quickly bubbled to the surface . Their responses revealed not just disagreements within the Democratic coalition that will prove difficult to reconcile on Capitol Hill amid an acrimonious presidential election cycle , but also a hint of distrust that if unchecked could yield the sort of bloody internecine struggle that crippled the GOP for much of the past decade .\nWelcome to the opening salvos of the Democrats \u2019 Civil War .\nPhillips has a pedigree that orients toward resolution , making him remarkably well-suited to the task ahead .\nThe grandson of renowned advice columnist Abigail Van Buren ( \u201c Dear Abby \u201d ) , he traffics in relationships and common ground , viewing no problem as too big for people collaborating in good faith . The first group he joined in Congress was the Problem Solvers Caucus , a club of business-minded centrists that accomplishes little legislatively ( and earns sneers on the far left and far right ) but provides something of a spiritual oasis for moderates in both parties . The closest friendships he has made on Capitol Hill are with Republicans , though as a courtesy he checked with them before giving me their names , not wanting to inadvertently damage their standing on the right . And when Omar tweeted what was panned as an anti-Semitic trope , Phillips held off for many hours on issuing a news release , much to the irritation of Jewish friends and colleagues . The reason : He hadn \u2019 t spoken with his fellow Minnesota freshman and wanted to have a private dialogue before commenting publicly on the matter .\n\u201c That 's how I wish more people would conduct themselves\u2014let \u2019 s share it face to face , \u201d Phillips says . \u201c You know , a little more talking , a little less tweeting . It \u2019 s the tweeting that gets us into trouble . \u201d\nPhillips in his Washington , D.C. , office . | Allison Shelley for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine\nEven as he said that , Phillips managed to show a level of empathy worthy of his grandmother . \u201c Our conversation was about as much about me expressing my feelings and why I was hurting , why such language and statements are destructive , as it was an invitation to work together and start a respectful understanding and talk about our differences in life experience , \u201d he said . \u201c I mean , Representative Omar \u2019 s life experience and mine couldn \u2019 t be more dissimilar\u2014but that \u2019 s the beauty of the United States . \u201d\nFifty years old and fabulously wealthy , with black-rimmed glasses and waves of toffee-colored hair swept neatly back and behind his ears , Phillips looks the part of an industry mogul . His family is corporate royalty in the Twin Cities , with a liquor distilling empire he took over after earning his MBA and various properties scattered across the metro area . On a Wednesday afternoon , we \u2019 re inside one of them , a historic downtown building two blocks from the Mississippi River , once owned by the Pillsbury family ( of biscuit fame ) and now being sold off by Phillips \u2019 family , which has used the estate to house its philanthropic work . Phillips mastered every gofer \u2019 s position in the distilling company before running it , then launched several other fruitful ventures of his own . It was only after he had established his own name , his own brand , that Phillips turned to politics .\nPaulsen , the GOP incumbent in the 3rd District , had cruised to a fifth term in 2016\u2014winning by 14 points\u2014despite Trump losing the district by nearly 10 points . Unbowed and armed with a personal fortune , Phillips convinced party elders that he was just the sort of Chamber of Commerce-friendly , compromise-minded Democrat who could win independents and disaffected Republicans in the Minneapolis suburbs . He was right : Running as a problem solver on issues of health coverage , gun violence and fiscal profligacy , Phillips thumped Paulsen by double digits , flipping a GOP district that had stymied Democrats for years .\nTwo things have stood out about Phillips , as a candidate and during his baptism by tweet-fire in Congress . The first is his tolerance of\u2014dare I say deference toward\u2014Trump , a man for whom reflexive loathing is a prerequisite on today \u2019 s left . Phillips labored throughout his campaign not to mention the president at all ; though Trump was deeply unpopular in the district , he says , voters rarely mentioned the chaos emanating from the White House . They were more interested in his bread-and-butter issues : expanding health-care coverage , getting corporate money out of politics , balancing the budget . To the extent Phillips talked about Trump , however , he came across as reverent , even appreciative , praising the president for channeling the angst of voters who felt abandoned by the governing class . This has continued since taking office : Several times in our conversation , unsolicited , Phillips cites Trump \u2019 s ability to connect with the neglected masses , once going so far as to credit him with showing Democrats how to campaign differently in 2018 .\nThe second thing that distinguishes Phillips is his allergy to labels . He talks frequently of \u201c outcomes \u201d but can prove impossible to pin down on policy details , the result of a studied effort to avoid being typecast either as a wild-eyed progressive or a weak-kneed moderate . ( According to the Minneapolis City Pages , he told voters at an event last year , \u201c I \u2019 m pro-life . And I \u2019 m also pro-choice . And I don \u2019 t think they \u2019 re mutually exclusive . I think it \u2019 s really important to be both . And I celebrate both . \u201d )\nIn one breath , Phillips tells me , \u201c I can \u2019 t think of many Americans who wouldn \u2019 t want better access to health care at a lower cost , wouldn \u2019 t want cleaner air , wouldn \u2019 t want to protect our environment , wouldn \u2019 t want to have better access to education at a lower cost , \u201d he says . \u201c These are all shared outcomes . \u2026 There isn \u2019 t a lot of daylight between what I want to see done and what some of my colleagues perhaps further to the left on the political spectrum may want . \u201d\nYet in the next breath , when quizzed on some of the specific proposals in question , the daylight becomes blinding . He promptly points out that he didn \u2019 t sign onto the Green New Deal , a plan calling for tens of trillions of dollars to transform America into an Elysium of renewable energy . He scoffs at the mention of \u201c modern monetary theory , \u201d the fashionable notion pushed by Ocasio-Cortez and others on that left that America \u2019 s national debt is a meaningless number . He does not support a single-payer , Medicare for All health care apparatus . Nor does he subscribe to the increasingly common proposal of tuition-free college .\nThis is not to accuse Phillips of duplicity or doublespeak . Like many rookie lawmakers\u2014at least , those of his moderate tribe\u2014he doesn \u2019 t want to rock the boat . Those Democrats who flipped red districts campaigned on promises not to clash emptily with Republicans ; the irony , of course , is that they arrived in Washington only to realize that the greater threat to their jobs is coming from the left flank of their own party .\nPhillips approaches the subject like he approaches every other political subject : gingerly . \u201c It \u2019 s creating some interesting challenges in that some very young and new members have followings . Two people , their collective following exceeds the entire remainder of the Democratic caucus , \u201d he says , deploying some digital hyperbole in referring to Omar and Ocasio-Cortez . \u201c By definition , they become to the public the voice of a party , they become even de facto leaders of a party . \u201d\nAs if this point isn \u2019 t explicit enough , Phillips adds , \u201c This majority was achieved not by winning in AOC \u2019 s district or Ilhan Omar \u2019 s district , [ but ] by victories in districts that had not been terribly favorable to Democrats in the past . \u2026 So if there \u2019 s a tension in the party , it \u2019 s how do you maintain that majority ? \u201d\n\u201c I think you endanger your majority by not doing what got you into the majority , \u201d she says . \u201c And this is something that the Republicans often are in tune with that the Democrats are not . We seem to be afraid of our own shadow . We \u2019 ve become too afraid , I think , to actually listen to the people , and to recognize who our base is . I \u2019 m fascinated by Republicans . They seem to have , for good or bad , a full understanding of their base and complete loyalty to them . We have a bigger base , but we seem to not understand them or have loyalty to them . When you are constantly trying to figure out how to appease everyone , you end up not appeasing anyone . \u201d\nThe congresswoman is leaning forward in her chair , a sudden urgency inflecting her voice as she evaluates the diverging paths before the Democratic Party . Seated inside her fifth-floor congressional suite , a brunet headscarf framing her face and a winter coat draped around her shoulders to fight the morning chill , Omar was cautious when we began speaking . Understandably so : Between the Lindsey Graham controversy , the two early incidents of alleged anti-Semitism , and a recent viral sparring match with Trump \u2019 s special envoy to Venezuela , Elliott Abrams , she has the wary look of a battle-scarred trouper rather than a rookie lawmaker not two months into her first term .\nBut her guard doesn \u2019 t stay up for long . Though she is just 37 , with delicate features , a puckish giggle and a strident social media voice that reflects her relative youth , Omar is a woman in a hurry .\nHaving fled the civil war in her native Somalia at age 8 , spending the next four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before finding asylum in America , her adolescence was spent questioning why the land of opportunity she had read so much about\u2014her new home , the United States\u2014was falling short of its promise . Landing briefly in the suburbs of Washington , D.C. , and then in Minneapolis , she saw dire poverty . She saw broken schools . She saw people without health care . Naturalized at age 17 , she set off for college in North Dakota , studying political science and beginning her journey as a community activist focused on nutrition and education . She knocked on doors and startled many a rural , white woman with her headscarf , only to form deep bonds over their shared anxieties , such as \u201c having affordable child care , making it work with school , holding down a job , and making it home in enough time to make dinner . \u201d\nAs the Somali population in her city continued to swell , so did the young activist \u2019 s discontent . By the time she ran for office in 2016 , knocking off a 22-term incumbent to win a seat in the Minnesota statehouse , Omar was fed up\u2014not so much with Trumpism , or with politics in general , as with the Democratic Party .\nAs she saw it , the party ostensibly committed to progressive values had become complicit in perpetuating the status quo . Omar says the \u201c hope and change \u201d offered by Barack Obama was a mirage . Recalling the \u201c caging of kids \u201d at the U.S.-Mexico border and the \u201c droning of countries around the world \u201d on Obama \u2019 s watch , she argues that the Democratic president operated within the same fundamentally broken framework as his Republican successor .\n\u201c We can \u2019 t be only upset with Trump . \u2026 His policies are bad , but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies . They just were more polished than he was , \u201d Omar says . \u201c And that \u2019 s not what we should be looking for anymore . We don \u2019 t want anybody to get away with murder because they are polished . We want to recognize the actual policies that are behind the pretty face and the smile . \u201d\n80,000 people of Somali descent live in Minnesota , a sizeable diaspora that lends a distinctive feel to the state 's major cities like Minneapolis , pictured above . | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine\nOmar embraces the comparisons between the Squad and the Tea Party . Despite the obvious philosophical differences , the models are strikingly similar : a two-term president leaves office with unfulfilled promises to the ideological core of his party \u2019 s base ; that core base is galvanized by the election of the other party \u2019 s president ; two years later , in that president \u2019 s first midterm election , the energy of that core base helps the out-of-power party retake control of Congress .\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Democrats follow the comparison to its natural conclusion , with the insurgent activist wing swallowing up the party \u2019 s establishment . It \u2019 s a thought that paralyzes lawmakers like Phillips\u2014and animates those like Omar . \u201c We look at the negative aspects of the Tea Party and not really at the part of them that spoke to the American people , that made them feel like there were people actively fighting for them , \u201d she says . \u201c There \u2019 s a resemblance there . A lot of us are not that much different in our eagerness to want to come here and fight for our constituents , fight for the American ideals we believe in . \u201d\nThe problem as Omar sees it\u2014and not coincidentally , as some Tea Party conservatives saw it back in 2011\u2014is that many of her fellow freshmen didn \u2019 t come to Washington to fight .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t believe that tiptoeing is the way to win the hearts and the minds of the people , \u201d she says . \u201c I get saddened by some of my freshman colleagues who can \u2019 t understand that within their districts the idea of Medicare for All is extremely popular . The Green New Deal is a very popular idea in their districts . Making sure that we have a final fix to our broken immigration system is very popular in their districts . What they pay attention to is the rhetoric that says , \u2018 This is a red-to-blue district , you have to be careful , you can \u2019 t talk about these policies. \u2019 Well , in reality , these people are like everyone else : They struggle with the cost of health care , they struggle with our broken infrastructure , they struggle with having an economy that brings them into the 21st century . And we have to be willing to have those conversations . \u201d\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California , center , holds a news conference on Friday , Nov. 30 , 2018 . | AP Photo/J . Scott Applewhite\nSome of Omar \u2019 s colleagues in the Democratic caucus grumble that those difficult conversations need to be handled sensitively\u2014and that the overzealous crop of young lawmakers are acting like bulls in a china shop . Indeed , just hours after I left her office , Omar was at the center of a fresh firestorm : This one owed to videotape that surfaced featuring comments made at an event in Washington the night before , in which she again took issue with Israeli influence over American policymaking , questioning some lawmakers \u2019 \u201c allegiance to a foreign country . \u201d\nFacing another round of denunciations , including from some of the most powerful members of her own party , Omar refused to back down . What ensued was a week of unmitigated chaos within House Democratic ranks : Senior Democrats pushed for a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism , younger Democrats rallied behind Omar and objected to her being singled out , and the party \u2019 s leadership , desperate to defuse the situation , finally settled on a catch-all version of the resolution condemning all forms of hate speech , including against Native Americans and Pacific Islanders . It was a clear-cut victory for Omar and her allies on the left .\nIn a preview of her defiance , just hours before the videotaped comments thrust the congresswoman back into the national limelight , Omar told me that Washington\u2014and especially her Democratic colleagues\u2014should get used to her troublemaking .\n\u201c As much as other people are uncomfortable , I \u2019 m excited about the change in tone that has taken place that is extremely positive . The insightful conversations that we \u2019 re having about money and its influence in Washington . And my ability , I think , to agitate our foreign policy discussions in a way that many of my colleagues who have been anti-intervention , anti-war have been unable to do in the past , \u201d she says . \u201c So , I \u2019 m OK with taking the blows if it means it will ignite conversations that no one was willing to have before . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s easy to overlook the fact that , as Phillips points out , Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House Democratic leadership made their legislative priority , H.R . 1 , a massive anti-corruption and voting-rights package that has near-unanimous support across the party \u2019 s internal divides .\nIt \u2019 s also easy to overlook the fact that , as Phillips also points out , the largest caucus within the House majority is that of the centrist , business-minded New Democrat Coalition . It boasts 101 members , many of them freshmen from swing districts . The group doesn \u2019 t get many headlines\u2014 \u201c we \u2019 re not filled with show horses , \u201d Phillips says\u2014but its sizable membership reflects an ideological equilibrium in the caucus that isn \u2019 t widely appreciated .\nAnd yet , if the divisions within the House Democratic caucus are a proxy war for the identity of the party , these insider battles are shaping up to be unfair fights . The intensity of the freshman progressives aside , leading Democrats hail primarily from areas of the country where working with Trump on virtually anything is a non-starter . For these members , even those inclined toward restraint , the realities of divided government and the zeal of their base provide an impetus for collision instead of collaboration .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not just the divide in the freshman class , it \u2019 s the divide between the Democrats who just got elected from swing districts and the Democrats who were elected to committees and committee chairmanships who come from ultra-safe districts and are now under heavy pressure from activists to investigate 10,000 different things in the executive branch , \u201d says Dave Wasserman , the House editor at the Cook Political Report . \u201c It was only a matter of time before these fissures in the Democratic caucus emerged , and they \u2019 re emerging with a vengeance . \u201d\nMeanwhile , in the nascent race for the right to take on Trump in 2020 , the hearts and minds of Democratic voters are waiting to be won . No two elections are alike , and it \u2019 s premature to handicap the presidential field based on the cult followings enjoyed by freshmen members of Congress . But it \u2019 s increasingly difficult to envision a Democrat capturing the party \u2019 s center of gravity without replicating some model of what Trump did in 2016 and what Omar is doing in 2019 : shunning the rules , turning up the volume and connecting with voters on their terms .\nIt \u2019 s a most discouraging thought for Phillips . \u201c The only way to build a national brand it seems in this day and age , the only way to be listened to on a broad scale , is to throw political bombs , \u201d he sighs . \u201c And that \u2019 s a misalignment of incentives . There is not an incentive to conduct ourselves respectfully and decently . \u201d\nInside the Mall of America on another snowy February night , a pair of local 25-year-old women , Duyen Lieu and Jeannie Farrell , can \u2019 t stop talking about the freshman congresswoman from Minneapolis . They praise Omar as courageous , trailblazing , a progressive visionary . Lieu says her supposedly anti-Semitic comments have been \u201c blown out of proportion \u201d by Democrats who fear her disruption of their clubby existence , and Farrell says \u201c there \u2019 s a target on her back \u201d because of her hijab , her refugee background and her Muslim faith .\nPhillips and Omar at a roundtable against gun violence on Friday , Oct. 26 , 2018 , in Minneapolis . | AP Photo/Jim Mone\nThey both follow Omar on social media . They also follow Ocasio-Cortez and other popular young Democrats . One person they don \u2019 t follow : Phillips , their representative in the 3rd District . In fact , they have never heard of him . ( Omar has 800,000 Instagram followers and about the same on Twitter between her personal and political accounts , while Phillips has about 6,000 followers on Instagram and just over 20,000 on Twitter . )\nIt \u2019 s an open question whether the views of young , swing-district Democrats like Lieu and Farrell\u2014who embrace the term \u201c socialism \u201d and are backing Bernie Sanders for president\u2014portend the sort of rapid , sweeping changes Omar and her allies see in the party \u2019 s future . ( Omar does not openly identify as a democratic socialist like Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez ; Phillips says the socialist labeling \u201c drives me nuts , \u201d and believes \u201c it \u2019 s a damn big problem for the country \u201d if his party gets branded that way because \u201c two members out of 200 \u201d are so affiliated . )\nWhat appears certain , however , is that the fault lines within this freshman class of House Democrats are the same ones shaping the contours of the party \u2019 s presidential nominating contest . Phillips , the business-oriented moderate , is backing Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar , someone who is \u201c pragmatic \u201d and will \u201c build bridges \u201d to win over independents and disaffected Republicans . Omar , the audacious progressive , has not endorsed , but says she is most excited by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , candidates who are \u201c not afraid \u201d and have offered \u201c bold proposals \u201d that will turn out the party \u2019 s base .\nOne defining question Democrats will be expected to answer in the months ahead\u2014both on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill\u2014is whether Trump should be subjected to articles of impeachment . While some progressives , including Tlaib , are actively pushing to begin impeachment proceedings , Democratic leaders have urged caution . They want members to wait for the release of special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s report on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign , fearful that the perception of overreaching could alienate the middle of the electorate and boost the president \u2019 s prospects for reelection .\nPhillips and his fellow majority-makers from purple districts don \u2019 t need to be told twice . They \u2019 ll be dependent on ticket-splitters to keep their own jobs in 2020 and have little to gain by so much as uttering the I-word .\nOmar is also reluctant , though , she professes , for a very different reason . She believes Trump is \u201c completely insane \u201d and has proved himself unfit for office . However , she adds , \u201c I think the vice president is more dangerous than the man who is running the circus . So , impeachment is something that I think might become necessary\u2014but I \u2019 m also afraid of it . \u201d",

The vast Somali community in the Twin Cities is like one sprawling extended family, explains Ali Aden, a 39-year-old engineer who came to the U.S. two decades ago, as we survey the scene. When a prominent member of the family arrives, it\u2019s customary to greet them this way.\n\n\u201cIs it Congresswoman Omar they\u2019re waiting for?\u201d I ask, referencing the freshman Democrat whose district we\u2019re standing in.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIlhan?\u201d he smiles broadly. \u201cNo, no. If it were Ilhan, the whole city would be here.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, the reception is for an obscure Somali government dignitary. In normal times, his arrival would be the talk of the local expat community; some 80,000 people of Somali descent are estimated to live in Minnesota, the largest community of the Somali diaspora in the United States, one that has distinctly flavored the Twin Cities\u2019 culture and caused some occasional unease on the right, such as when then-candidate Donald Trump warned in 2016 of the \u201cdisaster\u201d of Somali refugees moving into Minnesota and becoming radicalized by Islamic State.\n\nBut these are not normal times. The voters of Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District knew they were making history last November: Omar\u2019s victory made her both the first Somali-American to serve in Congress and, along with fellow newcomer Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, its first Muslim female member. What they didn\u2019t expect was that in her first seven weeks on the job she would become one of the most prominent, polarizing and recognizable politicians in America\u2014the subject of fierce debates on the House floor and cable news, lauded on the left for standing up to Israel and vilified on the right for comments seen by many as anti-Semitic.\n\nOmar was destined to stand out: After Congress changed its 181-year-old rule prohibiting headwear to accommodate her, she became the first person to wear a hijab on the House floor. But it wasn\u2019t her wardrobe, or her religion, or her gripping biography as the congresswoman who came of age in a refugee camp, that distinguished Omar in her early days on Capitol Hill. Rather, it was her usage of social media and the uproar that ensued.\n\nFirst, Omar tweeted that Lindsey Graham had been \u201ccompromised,\u201d suggesting that his support for Trump\u2014whom he\u2019d verbally mauled throughout the 2016 campaign\u2014owed to blackmail collected on the South Carolina senator. (Conservatives accused Omar of playing on the long-running, unsubstantiated insinuation that Graham is gay; she denied this, but apologized.) Then, after being seated on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Omar was lampooned for a 2012 tweet in which she wrote during an Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip, \u201cIsrael has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.\u201d (Omar later apologized and deleted the tweet; she claimed ignorance of the anti-Semitic trope that conceives of Jewish hypnosis.)\n\nAfter uproar over an Omar tweet that some called anti-Semitic, supporters placed notes on Omar's nameplate in the Longworth House Office Building on Feb. 11, 2019, in Washington, DC. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nFinally, in early February, after just over a month on the job, Omar made the jump from occasional agitator to permanent lightning rod. Arguing that U.S. lawmakers back Israel because of campaign donations from Jewish donors, the congresswoman tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins baby,\u201d a reference to $100 bills. The fallout was fierce: The entire House Democratic leadership denounced Omar, forcing yet another apology, and both the president and vice president piled on, skewering the congresswoman for her remarks, with Trump even suggesting that she should resign from Congress. (Notably, neither Trump nor Mike Pence has ever criticized Congressman Steve King despite his well-documented record of openly racist rhetoric.)\n\nAll of this proved agonizing for Omar\u2019s constituents, particularly those in the Somali community. Her arrival in Congress was meant to bring them legitimacy and representation. Instead, almost immediately, it invited controversy and humiliation. \u201cI was shocked. I don\u2019t like her on Twitter,\u201d Aden tells me. \u201cShe\u2019s very smart, and I didn\u2019t think she would talk that way. It was an embarrassment for me as a Somali-American, because we do not like extreme left or extreme right. But she will do better. This is new to her\u2014she will learn how to handle it.\u201d\n\nThe more essential question, it seems, is whether the Democratic Party\u2014its base bursting with energy, riding high off the House takeover of 2018\u2014will learn to handle Omar.\n\nThe Minnesota congresswoman, along with the likes of Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, represents the unapologetic new guard of progressivism, pushing the party\u2019s establishment to embrace tactics and positions that have heretofore been considered outside of the mainstream. Yet they face resistance not just from party elders but from many of their fellow freshmen, centrists who campaigned as fixers not firebrands, moderates who are watching warily as the Democrats\u2019 brand is being hijacked by the far left. One of these members is Omar\u2019s neighbor in Minnesota: Dean Phillips, a wealthy businessman who represents the 3rd District.\n\nTo better understand these dueling visions for the Democratic Party, I sat down with both Omar and Phillips, spent several days in their communities and talked with some of their constituents. What I learned is that, despite the cautionary tale offered by years of vicious Republican infighting, Democrats are dangerously close to entering into their own fratricidal conflict. On matters of both style and substance, the fractures within this freshman class are indicative of the broader divisions in a party long overdue for an ideological reckoning.\n\nAnd Omar isn\u2019t shying away from it. \u201cI am certainly not looking to be comfortable, and I don\u2019t want everyone necessarily to feel comfortable around me,\u201d she told me, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips. \u201cI think really the most exciting things happen when people are extremely uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

Amid a discussion of Omar and Ocasio-Cortez, he complained, \u201cSuddenly an entire party is being branded by the perspectives of two of its members who represent 1 percent of the caucus.\u201d\n\nFor Somali-Americans like Aden, the Democrats\u2019 identity crisis cuts more deeply. Joyful yet jittery in this era of anti-immigrant politics, they knew that she, as a Muslim woman born in Africa, would be a magnet for scrutiny, and it\u2019s going to take more than a few careless tweets to diminish their immense pride in her success. What worries Aden and others in the Somali community I spoke with is that Omar has walked into a trap\u2014stumbling into these controversies not because she is motivated by anti-Semitism, but by a background in grassroots activism and a belief that the only way to defeat Trump is to play the game by his rules: accusing instead of inquiring; wielding hyperbole as an everyday weapon; tweeting first and asking questions later.\n\n\u201cTrump is a radical. Maybe I should say he\u2019s a racist, because that\u2019s what I believe. But I don\u2019t want to see others becoming radical as the result,\u201d Aden, a naturalized citizen and a loyal Democrat, says. Like more than a few members of Pelosi\u2019s team, he shudders at talk of impeaching the president\u2014not because he likes Trump, but because he thinks it will help the president paint his opponents as \u201cextreme, just like him,\u201d and benefit his reelection in 2020.\n\nAbove: Omar campaigns on Election Day, Nov. 8, 2016 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Below: Phillips greets guests at a picnic in Excelsior, Minnesota, on Sept. 15, 2018. | STEPHEN MATUREN/AFP/Getty Images; Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call\n\n\u201cI just worry Ilhan will be too much left, like the woman in New York,\u201d Aden says. \u201cYou know\u2014AOC.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn January, Democrats reclaimed the House majority with a freshman class of over 60 members, the party\u2019s biggest in nearly a half-century. It has already distinguished itself as perhaps the most consequential crop of new lawmakers ever to arrive in Washington. Even more immediately than the 2010 wave of Tea Party Republicans rebranded the GOP just two years removed from George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, this 2018 class has demonstrated at warp speed its capacity for manipulating the trajectory of the post-Barack Obama Democratic Party, its presidential hopefuls succumbing to the gravitational pull of the freshmen agitators within weeks of their taking office.\n\nFor Omar, there is no danger in calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment, or in advocating the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or in pushing \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d or in supporting the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d: Hillary Clinton carried her district by 55 percentage points in 2016. The same can be said for Omar\u2019s closest friends: Tlaib, Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley from Massachusetts. This clique of rookie lawmakers, who call themselves the \u201cSquad,\u201d represent four of the safest Democratic districts in America. They have come to Congress not to pursue incremental victories, but to push for wholesale change in the government and inside their own party, secure in the knowledge that their deep-blue backyards will buffer them from whatever recoil might damage other Democrats in less ideologically insulated parts of the country.\n\nThe dilemma for the party is that Democrats would not have won their majority without the influx of some 40 newcomers who flipped Republican-held battleground seats\u2014the vast majority of them running on platforms of good government and bipartisan productivity.\n\nIn Michigan, while Tlaib\u2019s flamboyant liberalism suits the Detroit-anchored 13th District\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re going to impeach the motherfucker!\u201d she declared hours after being sworn in\u2014it makes life considerably harder for Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin, a pair of moderate freshmen who won difficult races in the suburban-heavy 11th and 8th Districts, respectively.\n\nAnd in New York, while Ocasio-Cortez puts the Bronx-based 14th District on the map with her championing of Democratic socialism, her fellow freshman Max Rose, a combat veteran who won a major upset in the 11th District by playing to the cultural conservatism of Staten Island, is forced to answer for his party\u2019s lurch to the left.\n\nBut perhaps nowhere is the divergence inside today\u2019s Democratic Party better crystallized than here in greater Minneapolis. Omar\u2019s 5th District, which includes the airport, has not been represented by a Republican since 1962. A five-minute cab ride away is the Mall of America, located in Minnesota\u2019s 3rd District, which had not been represented by a Democrat since 1960\u2014until January, when Phillips took office after knocking off GOP incumbent Erik Paulsen last fall.\n\n\u201cThe districts couldn\u2019t be more remarkably different. They\u2019re neighboring, but don\u2019t have a lot of similarities,\u201d says Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nOmar\u2019s district is entirely urban, a mix of the very prosperous and the very poor, with a median household income of $63,202 and a mean household income of $88,390, according to the Census Bureau. Phillips\u2019 district is mostly suburban, enwrapping Minneapolis like a giant \u201cC,\u201d containing blue-collar boroughs to the north, affluent areas to the west and upper-middle-class communities to the south of the city. Its median household income is $89,442, and its mean household income is $123,574.\n\nThat Phillips is Jewish and Omar is a Muslim\u2014the only such neighboring members of Congress in American history\u2014makes their intersection all the more intriguing, particularly in light of recent events.\n\nYet to focus too narrowly on this unique dynamic is to obscure the phenomena of polarity that Omar and Phillips represent. With a new generation of Democratic leaders emerging, and the left splintered over some of the existential questions of governing in the age of Trump, two warring iterations of the modern Democratic Party can be found in one overlapping zip code. Where Omar and her fellow safe-seat Democrats prescribe a fearless liberalism and believe Trump\u2019s scorched-earth approach calls for zero-sum political warfare, Phillips and his swing-district confederates preach cooperation and a post-ideological pragmatism, fearful that the president\u2019s surest path to reelection is to portray their party as even more dogmatic than his own.\n\nThe weight of these circumstances is not lost on either lawmaker. In separate interviews, both Omar and Phillips had kind words for the other, downplaying intraparty rivalries while offering bromides of shared goals for their caucus.\n\nBut once I began drilling down on specifics\u2014of policy and strategy, ideological branding and political temperament\u2014the tensions quickly bubbled to the surface. Their responses revealed not just disagreements within the Democratic coalition that will prove difficult to reconcile on Capitol Hill amid an acrimonious presidential election cycle, but also a hint of distrust that if unchecked could yield the sort of bloody internecine struggle that crippled the GOP for much of the past decade.\n\nWelcome to the opening salvos of the Democrats\u2019 Civil War.\n\n\n\n***\n\nPhillips has a pedigree that orients toward resolution, making him remarkably well-suited to the task ahead.\n\nThe grandson of renowned advice columnist Abigail Van Buren (\u201cDear Abby\u201d), he traffics in relationships and common ground, viewing no problem as too big for people collaborating in good faith. The first group he joined in Congress was the Problem Solvers Caucus, a club of business-minded centrists that accomplishes little legislatively (and earns sneers on the far left and far right) but provides something of a spiritual oasis for moderates in both parties. The closest friendships he has made on Capitol Hill are with Republicans, though as a courtesy he checked with them before giving me their names, not wanting to inadvertently damage their standing on the right. And when Omar tweeted what was panned as an anti-Semitic trope, Phillips held off for many hours on issuing a news release, much to the irritation of Jewish friends and colleagues. The reason: He hadn\u2019t spoken with his fellow Minnesota freshman and wanted to have a private dialogue before commenting publicly on the matter.\n\n\u201cThat's how I wish more people would conduct themselves\u2014let\u2019s share it face to face,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cYou know, a little more talking, a little less tweeting. It\u2019s the tweeting that gets us into trouble.\u201d\n\nPhillips in his Washington, D.C., office. | Allison Shelley for Politico Magazine\n\nEven as he said that, Phillips managed to show a level of empathy worthy of his grandmother. \u201cOur conversation was about as much about me expressing my feelings and why I was hurting, why such language and statements are destructive, as it was an invitation to work together and start a respectful understanding and talk about our differences in life experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, Representative Omar\u2019s life experience and mine couldn\u2019t be more dissimilar\u2014but that\u2019s the beauty of the United States.\u201d\n\nFifty years old and fabulously wealthy, with black-rimmed glasses and waves of toffee-colored hair swept neatly back and behind his ears, Phillips looks the part of an industry mogul. His family is corporate royalty in the Twin Cities, with a liquor distilling empire he took over after earning his MBA and various properties scattered across the metro area. On a Wednesday afternoon, we\u2019re inside one of them, a historic downtown building two blocks from the Mississippi River, once owned by the Pillsbury family (of biscuit fame) and now being sold off by Phillips\u2019 family, which has used the estate to house its philanthropic work. Phillips mastered every gofer\u2019s position in the distilling company before running it, then launched several other fruitful ventures of his own. It was only after he had established his own name, his own brand, that Phillips turned to politics.\n\nPaulsen, the GOP incumbent in the 3rd District, had cruised to a fifth term in 2016\u2014winning by 14 points\u2014despite Trump losing the district by nearly 10 points. Unbowed and armed with a personal fortune, Phillips convinced party elders that he was just the sort of Chamber of Commerce-friendly, compromise-minded Democrat who could win independents and disaffected Republicans in the Minneapolis suburbs. He was right: Running as a problem solver on issues of health coverage, gun violence and fiscal profligacy, Phillips thumped Paulsen by double digits, flipping a GOP district that had stymied Democrats for years.\n\nTwo things have stood out about Phillips, as a candidate and during his baptism by tweet-fire in Congress. The first is his tolerance of\u2014dare I say deference toward\u2014Trump, a man for whom reflexive loathing is a prerequisite on today\u2019s left. Phillips labored throughout his campaign not to mention the president at all; though Trump was deeply unpopular in the district, he says, voters rarely mentioned the chaos emanating from the White House. They were more interested in his bread-and-butter issues: expanding health-care coverage, getting corporate money out of politics, balancing the budget. To the extent Phillips talked about Trump, however, he came across as reverent, even appreciative, praising the president for channeling the angst of voters who felt abandoned by the governing class. This has continued since taking office: Several times in our conversation, unsolicited, Phillips cites Trump\u2019s ability to connect with the neglected masses, once going so far as to credit him with showing Democrats how to campaign differently in 2018.\n\nThe second thing that distinguishes Phillips is his allergy to labels. He talks frequently of \u201coutcomes\u201d but can prove impossible to pin down on policy details, the result of a studied effort to avoid being typecast either as a wild-eyed progressive or a weak-kneed moderate. (According to the Minneapolis City Pages, he told voters at an event last year, \u201cI\u2019m pro-life. And I\u2019m also pro-choice. And I don\u2019t think they\u2019re mutually exclusive. I think it\u2019s really important to be both. And I celebrate both.\u201d)\n\nTop: Dean Phillips talks with people outside City Hall during early voting in Plymouth, Minnesota, on Sept. 21, 2018. Bottom: A newly elected Omar speaks to a group of supporters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Nov. 6, 2018. | Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call; KEREM YUCEL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn one breath, Phillips tells me, \u201cI can\u2019t think of many Americans who wouldn\u2019t want better access to health care at a lower cost, wouldn\u2019t want cleaner air, wouldn\u2019t want to protect our environment, wouldn\u2019t want to have better access to education at a lower cost,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are all shared outcomes. \u2026 There isn\u2019t a lot of daylight between what I want to see done and what some of my colleagues perhaps further to the left on the political spectrum may want.\u201d\n\nYet in the next breath, when quizzed on some of the specific proposals in question, the daylight becomes blinding. He promptly points out that he didn\u2019t sign onto the Green New Deal, a plan calling for tens of trillions of dollars to transform America into an Elysium of renewable energy. He scoffs at the mention of \u201cmodern monetary theory,\u201d the fashionable notion pushed by Ocasio-Cortez and others on that left that America\u2019s national debt is a meaningless number. He does not support a single-payer, Medicare for All health care apparatus. Nor does he subscribe to the increasingly common proposal of tuition-free college.\n\nThis is not to accuse Phillips of duplicity or doublespeak. Like many rookie lawmakers\u2014at least, those of his moderate tribe\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat. Those Democrats who flipped red districts campaigned on promises not to clash emptily with Republicans; the irony, of course, is that they arrived in Washington only to realize that the greater threat to their jobs is coming from the left flank of their own party.\n\nPhillips approaches the subject like he approaches every other political subject: gingerly. \u201cIt\u2019s creating some interesting challenges in that some very young and new members have followings. Two people, their collective following exceeds the entire remainder of the Democratic caucus,\u201d he says, deploying some digital hyperbole in referring to Omar and Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cBy definition, they become to the public the voice of a party, they become even de facto leaders of a party.\u201d\n\nAs if this point isn\u2019t explicit enough, Phillips adds, \u201cThis majority was achieved not by winning in AOC\u2019s district or Ilhan Omar\u2019s district, [but] by victories in districts that had not been terribly favorable to Democrats in the past. \u2026 So if there\u2019s a tension in the party, it\u2019s how do you maintain that majority?\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nOmar has a simple answer to her colleague\u2019s question.\n\n\u201cI think you endanger your majority by not doing what got you into the majority,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd this is something that the Republicans often are in tune with that the Democrats are not. We seem to be afraid of our own shadow. We\u2019ve become too afraid, I think, to actually listen to the people, and to recognize who our base is. I\u2019m fascinated by Republicans. They seem to have, for good or bad, a full understanding of their base and complete loyalty to them. We have a bigger base, but we seem to not understand them or have loyalty to them. When you are constantly trying to figure out how to appease everyone, you end up not appeasing anyone.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman is leaning forward in her chair, a sudden urgency inflecting her voice as she evaluates the diverging paths before the Democratic Party. Seated inside her fifth-floor congressional suite, a brunet headscarf framing her face and a winter coat draped around her shoulders to fight the morning chill, Omar was cautious when we began speaking. Understandably so: Between the Lindsey Graham controversy, the two early incidents of alleged anti-Semitism, and a recent viral sparring match with Trump\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, she has the wary look of a battle-scarred trouper rather than a rookie lawmaker not two months into her first term.\n\nBut her guard doesn\u2019t stay up for long. Though she is just 37, with delicate features, a puckish giggle and a strident social media voice that reflects her relative youth, Omar is a woman in a hurry.\n\nOmar wore white with a group of female Democratic lawmakers at the State of the Union address on February 5, 2019. | Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHaving fled the civil war in her native Somalia at age 8, spending the next four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before finding asylum in America, her adolescence was spent questioning why the land of opportunity she had read so much about\u2014her new home, the United States\u2014was falling short of its promise. Landing briefly in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., and then in Minneapolis, she saw dire poverty. She saw broken schools. She saw people without health care. Naturalized at age 17, she set off for college in North Dakota, studying political science and beginning her journey as a community activist focused on nutrition and education. She knocked on doors and startled many a rural, white woman with her headscarf, only to form deep bonds over their shared anxieties, such as \u201chaving affordable child care, making it work with school, holding down a job, and making it home in enough time to make dinner.\u201d\n\nAs the Somali population in her city continued to swell, so did the young activist\u2019s discontent. By the time she ran for office in 2016, knocking off a 22-term incumbent to win a seat in the Minnesota statehouse, Omar was fed up\u2014not so much with Trumpism, or with politics in general, as with the Democratic Party.\n\nAs she saw it, the party ostensibly committed to progressive values had become complicit in perpetuating the status quo. Omar says the \u201chope and change\u201d offered by Barack Obama was a mirage. Recalling the \u201ccaging of kids\u201d at the U.S.-Mexico border and the \u201cdroning of countries around the world\u201d on Obama\u2019s watch, she argues that the Democratic president operated within the same fundamentally broken framework as his Republican successor.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be only upset with Trump. \u2026 His policies are bad, but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies. They just were more polished than he was,\u201d Omar says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not what we should be looking for anymore. We don\u2019t want anybody to get away with murder because they are polished. We want to recognize the actual policies that are behind the pretty face and the smile.\u201d\n\n80,000 people of Somali descent live in Minnesota, a sizeable diaspora that lends a distinctive feel to the state's major cities like Minneapolis, pictured above. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nOmar embraces the comparisons between the Squad and the Tea Party. Despite the obvious philosophical differences, the models are strikingly similar: a two-term president leaves office with unfulfilled promises to the ideological core of his party\u2019s base; that core base is galvanized by the election of the other party\u2019s president; two years later, in that president\u2019s first midterm election, the energy of that core base helps the out-of-power party retake control of Congress.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Democrats follow the comparison to its natural conclusion, with the insurgent activist wing swallowing up the party\u2019s establishment. It\u2019s a thought that paralyzes lawmakers like Phillips\u2014and animates those like Omar. \u201cWe look at the negative aspects of the Tea Party and not really at the part of them that spoke to the American people, that made them feel like there were people actively fighting for them,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a resemblance there. A lot of us are not that much different in our eagerness to want to come here and fight for our constituents, fight for the American ideals we believe in.\u201d\n\nThe problem as Omar sees it\u2014and not coincidentally, as some Tea Party conservatives saw it back in 2011\u2014is that many of her fellow freshmen didn\u2019t come to Washington to fight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that tiptoeing is the way to win the hearts and the minds of the people,\u201d she says. \u201cI get saddened by some of my freshman colleagues who can\u2019t understand that within their districts the idea of Medicare for All is extremely popular. The Green New Deal is a very popular idea in their districts. Making sure that we have a final fix to our broken immigration system is very popular in their districts. What they pay attention to is the rhetoric that says, \u2018This is a red-to-blue district, you have to be careful, you can\u2019t talk about these policies.\u2019 Well, in reality, these people are like everyone else: They struggle with the cost of health care, they struggle with our broken infrastructure, they struggle with having an economy that brings them into the 21st century. And we have to be willing to have those conversations.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, center, holds a news conference on Friday, Nov. 30, 2018. | AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\n\nSome of Omar\u2019s colleagues in the Democratic caucus grumble that those difficult conversations need to be handled sensitively\u2014and that the overzealous crop of young lawmakers are acting like bulls in a china shop. Indeed, just hours after I left her office, Omar was at the center of a fresh firestorm: This one owed to videotape that surfaced featuring comments made at an event in Washington the night before, in which she again took issue with Israeli influence over American policymaking, questioning some lawmakers\u2019 \u201callegiance to a foreign country.\u201d\n\nFacing another round of denunciations, including from some of the most powerful members of her own party, Omar refused to back down. What ensued was a week of unmitigated chaos within House Democratic ranks: Senior Democrats pushed for a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, younger Democrats rallied behind Omar and objected to her being singled out, and the party\u2019s leadership, desperate to defuse the situation, finally settled on a catch-all version of the resolution condemning all forms of hate speech, including against Native Americans and Pacific Islanders. It was a clear-cut victory for Omar and her allies on the left.\n\nIn a preview of her defiance, just hours before the videotaped comments thrust the congresswoman back into the national limelight, Omar told me that Washington\u2014and especially her Democratic colleagues\u2014should get used to her troublemaking.\n\n\u201cAs much as other people are uncomfortable, I\u2019m excited about the change in tone that has taken place that is extremely positive. The insightful conversations that we\u2019re having about money and its influence in Washington. And my ability, I think, to agitate our foreign policy discussions in a way that many of my colleagues who have been anti-intervention, anti-war have been unable to do in the past,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I\u2019m OK with taking the blows if it means it will ignite conversations that no one was willing to have before.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s easy to overlook the fact that, as Phillips points out, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House Democratic leadership made their legislative priority, H.R. 1, a massive anti-corruption and voting-rights package that has near-unanimous support across the party\u2019s internal divides.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to overlook the fact that, as Phillips also points out, the largest caucus within the House majority is that of the centrist, business-minded New Democrat Coalition. It boasts 101 members, many of them freshmen from swing districts. The group doesn\u2019t get many headlines\u2014\u201cwe\u2019re not filled with show horses,\u201d Phillips says\u2014but its sizable membership reflects an ideological equilibrium in the caucus that isn\u2019t widely appreciated.\n\nAnd yet, if the divisions within the House Democratic caucus are a proxy war for the identity of the party, these insider battles are shaping up to be unfair fights. The intensity of the freshman progressives aside, leading Democrats hail primarily from areas of the country where working with Trump on virtually anything is a non-starter. For these members, even those inclined toward restraint, the realities of divided government and the zeal of their base provide an impetus for collision instead of collaboration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the divide in the freshman class, it\u2019s the divide between the Democrats who just got elected from swing districts and the Democrats who were elected to committees and committee chairmanships who come from ultra-safe districts and are now under heavy pressure from activists to investigate 10,000 different things in the executive branch,\u201d says Dave Wasserman, the House editor at the Cook Political Report. \u201cIt was only a matter of time before these fissures in the Democratic caucus emerged, and they\u2019re emerging with a vengeance.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the nascent race for the right to take on Trump in 2020, the hearts and minds of Democratic voters are waiting to be won. No two elections are alike, and it\u2019s premature to handicap the presidential field based on the cult followings enjoyed by freshmen members of Congress. But it\u2019s increasingly difficult to envision a Democrat capturing the party\u2019s center of gravity without replicating some model of what Trump did in 2016 and what Omar is doing in 2019: shunning the rules, turning up the volume and connecting with voters on their terms.\n\nIt\u2019s a most discouraging thought for Phillips. \u201cThe only way to build a national brand it seems in this day and age, the only way to be listened to on a broad scale, is to throw political bombs,\u201d he sighs. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a misalignment of incentives. There is not an incentive to conduct ourselves respectfully and decently.\u201d\n\nInside the Mall of America on another snowy February night, a pair of local 25-year-old women, Duyen Lieu and Jeannie Farrell, can\u2019t stop talking about the freshman congresswoman from Minneapolis. They praise Omar as courageous, trailblazing, a progressive visionary. Lieu says her supposedly anti-Semitic comments have been \u201cblown out of proportion\u201d by Democrats who fear her disruption of their clubby existence, and Farrell says \u201cthere\u2019s a target on her back\u201d because of her hijab, her refugee background and her Muslim faith.\n\nPhillips and Omar at a roundtable against gun violence on Friday, Oct. 26, 2018, in Minneapolis. | AP Photo/Jim Mone\n\nThey both follow Omar on social media. They also follow Ocasio-Cortez and other popular young Democrats. One person they don\u2019t follow: Phillips, their representative in the 3rd District. In fact, they have never heard of him. (Omar has 800,000 Instagram followers and about the same on Twitter between her personal and political accounts, while Phillips has about 6,000 followers on Instagram and just over 20,000 on Twitter.)\n\nIt\u2019s an open question whether the views of young, swing-district Democrats like Lieu and Farrell\u2014who embrace the term \u201csocialism\u201d and are backing Bernie Sanders for president\u2014portend the sort of rapid, sweeping changes Omar and her allies see in the party\u2019s future. (Omar does not openly identify as a democratic socialist like Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez; Phillips says the socialist labeling \u201cdrives me nuts,\u201d and believes \u201cit\u2019s a damn big problem for the country\u201d if his party gets branded that way because \u201ctwo members out of 200\u201d are so affiliated.)\n\nWhat appears certain, however, is that the fault lines within this freshman class of House Democrats are the same ones shaping the contours of the party\u2019s presidential nominating contest. Phillips, the business-oriented moderate, is backing Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, someone who is \u201cpragmatic\u201d and will \u201cbuild bridges\u201d to win over independents and disaffected Republicans. Omar, the audacious progressive, has not endorsed, but says she is most excited by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, candidates who are \u201cnot afraid\u201d and have offered \u201cbold proposals\u201d that will turn out the party\u2019s base.\n\nOne defining question Democrats will be expected to answer in the months ahead\u2014both on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill\u2014is whether Trump should be subjected to articles of impeachment. While some progressives, including Tlaib, are actively pushing to begin impeachment proceedings, Democratic leaders have urged caution. They want members to wait for the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, fearful that the perception of overreaching could alienate the middle of the electorate and boost the president\u2019s prospects for reelection.\n\nPhillips and his fellow majority-makers from purple districts don\u2019t need to be told twice. They\u2019ll be dependent on ticket-splitters to keep their own jobs in 2020 and have little to gain by so much as uttering the I-word.\n\nOmar is also reluctant, though, she professes, for a very different reason. She believes Trump is \u201ccompletely insane\u201d and has proved himself unfit for office. However, she adds, \u201cI think the vice president is more dangerous than the man who is running the circus. So, impeachment is something that I think might become necessary\u2014but I\u2019m also afraid of it.\u201d",
