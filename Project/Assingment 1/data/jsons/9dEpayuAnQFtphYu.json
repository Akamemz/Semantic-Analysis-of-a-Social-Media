In 1,125 counties, Mr. Clinton won or lost by a margin of less than 10 percentage points.\n\nIn 2016, by contrast, Mr. Trump won or lost by a single-digit margin in only 310 counties\u2014even though the national popular vote was much closer than in 1996.

Missouri: In 1996 it was a battleground state full of closely-contested counties. In 2016, it voted for Donald Trump by almost 20 points and was home to only one single-digit county, Boone, in the state's center. 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION New Hampshire: The state stands out as an exception to the larger rule. There were more single-digit margin counties in 2016 (seven) than there were in 1996 (five). Dallas County, Texas: Republican Bob Dole won it by a point in 1996. In 2016, the winning margin was 26 points...for Hillary Clinton, a sign of the Democrats growth in urban areas.

Voters now live in two camps, a metropolitan America that leans Democratic, and regions beyond the nation\u2019s big metro areas that lean Republican. The country\u2019s political map is painted in red and blue, with little purple. Twenty years ago, many cities produced far closer election results than today. The 1996 election produced a one-point race in the county that\u2019s home to San Diego, for example, whereas Mr. Trump lost it by 20 points. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How have you seen the voting behaviors in your town change? Join the conversation below. Many rural areas show the same trend: Dodge County, Wis., for example, produced a one-point race in 1996, whereas Mr. Trump won it by close to 30 points. In Mineral County, Colo., Mr. Clinton won by 3 percentage points in 1996, while Mr. Trump won it by 16. While Reform Party candidate Ross Perot may have had an effect on the results in 1996, it was likely to be small. Mr. Clinton defeated Republican Sen. Bob Dole that year by 8.5 percentage points, despite Mr. Perot\u2019s presence in the race.
