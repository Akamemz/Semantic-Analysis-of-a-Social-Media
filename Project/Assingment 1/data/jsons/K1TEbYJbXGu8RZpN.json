( June 19 ) AP\nThe controversy surrounding family separations at the U.S. southern border has prompted outrage , opinions and finger-pointing . It has also raised a number of questions , including from our readers .\n\u201c Are there really children being separated from their parents at the border and being kept in cages ? \u201d one reader asked .\nIn April , Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a \u201c zero-tolerance policy \u201d regarding illegal immigration at the Southwest border . That was followed by a reported May directive by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen instructing her department to refer all unauthorized immigrants who cross the U.S. border to federal prosecutors for criminal prosecution . Such prosecution has resulted in the separation of parents and children who were apprehended illegally entering the country .\nAs we \u2019 ve explained before , parents are sent to federal court under the custody of the U.S . Marshals Service and then placed in a detention center , according to Homeland Security . In turn , their children \u2014 minors who can not be housed in detention centers for adults \u2014 are transferred to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for placement in a juvenile facility or foster care if they can \u2019 t be placed with another adult relative in the U.S. Those children , as well as those who cross without adults , are considered \u201c unaccompanied \u201d and become the responsibility of HHS \u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement .\nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly told NPR last month that family separation \u201c could be a tough deterrent \u201d for others considering immigrating illegally .\nThe criminal prosecution and subsequent separations do not apply to those who seek asylum at a legal port of entry , administration officials have said . But Nielsen has acknowledged \u201c limited resources \u201d at the border that have resulted in the U.S. telling some who arrive at the ports that they have to \u201c come back. \u201d Some immigrant advocates told The Arizona Republic that the backlog could exacerbate illegal crossings .\nSince the implementation of the zero-tolerance policy , between April 19 and the end of May , 1,995 minors were separated from adults at the border , the Department of Homeland Security confirmed to FactCheck.org .\nAnd , as of June 15 , there were 11,517 minors in the \u201c Unaccompanied Children \u2019 s Program , \u201d according to the Department of Health and Human Services \u2019 Administration for Children and Families . ( That figure doesn \u2019 t distinguish between those who crossed the border with their parents and those who did so alone . )\nHealth and Human Services uses about 100 shelters in 14 states . In congressional testimony in May , Steven Wagner , acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families , told a Senate subcommittee that children have spent an average of 57 days in custody during fiscal year 2018 . After that , minors are placed with a sponsor , who could be a parent , another relative or a non-family member .\nThe government has rejected the idea that it uses \u201c cages \u201d in its facilities . But that \u2019 s the term used by activists and others who oppose the administration \u2019 s immigration policy . Also , news organizations have used that term , including the Associated Press , which used the word to refer to the fencing enclosures at one Texas facility .\nWe have included pictures of that facility with this story , so readers can make their own determinations on what to call the enclosures .\nThe issue was highlighted earlier this month when Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon visited the central processing facility in McAllen , Texas , where those trying to enter the United States are separated . \u201c Unaccompanied \u201d minors , except in select cases , are to be transferred from the processing facility to a juvenile facility or other care under Health and Human Services within 72 hours .\n\u201c Yesterday morning at the McAllen Border Station , at the processing center , they have big cages made out of fencing and wire and nets stretched across the top of them so people can \u2019 t climb out of them , \u201d he told CNN on June 4 . \u201c Every time I probed yesterday on the circumstances ( of why they were held this way ) the response was just basically a generic , \u2018 That is what \u2019 s required for security , this is what is required for control . ' \u201d ( Merkley also likened the enclosures to a \u201c dog kennel . \u201d )\nThe Department of Justice disputed Merkley \u2019 s characterization of the structures .\n\u201c Before being transferred to HHS custody , DHS houses unaccompanied minors in short-term facilities , \u201d it said in a June 4 statement . \u201c These short-term facilities do not employ the use of \u2018 cages \u2019 to house UACs , but portions of the facility makes use of barriers in order to separate minors of different genders and age groups . This is for the safety and security of all minors in the custody of the United States government . \u201d\nMuch of the media coverage of Merkley focused on his attempt to visit a shelter in Brownsville , Texas , that houses immigrant children after they \u2019 re processed . He was rebuffed ( though in recent days he did visit the facility ) .\nNews outlets got a glimpse of life inside that shelter , called Casa Padre , during a tour last week . There were no reports of cages being used .\nNBC News described the conditions at the nonprofit shelter as \u201c more like incarceration than temporary shelter. \u201d The report detailed \u201c dorm-style rooms \u201d that were designed to sleep four but accommodate five because of overcrowding .\nThe former Walmart houses almost 1,500 boys , ages 10 to 17 , for an average of 52 days . According to The New York Times , whose reporter visited the shelter , it offers classroom instruction , recreational activities and other services . The minors are allowed outside two hours per day .\nSo what about that image of a young boy in a cage ?\nThe photo in question depicts a boy in distress as he looks out of a cage he is grasping with his hands . It has been turned into a meme that asks , \u201c Are you Trump fans really OK with this ? \u201d\nJournalist and activist Jose Antonio Vargas included the photo in a June 11 tweet that said : \u201c This is what happens when a government believes people are \u2018 illegal. \u2019 Kids in cages. \u201d ( Vargas openly discusses his own status as an immigrant living in the country illegally . )\nIn a subsequent tweet , Vargas acknowledged he wasn \u2019 t sure where the photo originated , but many others also shared the image , including the actor Ron Perlman .\nThis is what happens when a government believes people are \u201c illegal . \u201d\nKids in cages . pic.twitter.com/OAnvr9cl3P \u2014 Jose Antonio Vargas ( @ joseiswriting ) June 12 , 2018\nBut the image was actually taken during a June 10 rally in Dallas , Texas .\nLeroy Pena , the prime minister of the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter of the Brown Berets of Cemanahuac , said he took the photo during the demonstration .
