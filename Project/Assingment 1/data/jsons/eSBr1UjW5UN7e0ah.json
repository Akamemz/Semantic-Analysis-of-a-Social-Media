There are gun violence protective orders ; keeping guns out of the hands of criminals , domestic abusers , and the mentally ill . But we \u2019 ll never get there . It \u2019 s all a trap . Even bills that strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) are a dangerous game because if you give the Left an inch , they \u2019 ll take a mile . They admitted it yesterday . Delaney Tarr , a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student , gave an impassioned speech about how they \u2019 re going to do exactly that concerning gun control legislation , which is why Republicans , conservatives , pro-Second Amendment supporters , an any American who supports the Bill of Rights and the Constitution needs to start packing more sandbags and make sure our base turns out in 2018 .

However , I \u2019 m not here today for the media . I \u2019 m not here for the crowds , as great as you all are , for the fame , for the fun . I \u2019 m here on this stage today and I \u2019 ve been working everyday for my 17 fellow Eagles who were pronounced dead because of gunfire . I am here for every person that has died at the hands of gun violence and for the many more whose lives were irreparably changed because of it . I think , I hope that that is why we are all here . Because this is more than just a march . This is more than just one day , one event , then moving on . This is not a mere publicity stunt , a single day in the span of history . This is a movement . This is a movement reliant on the persistence and passion of its people . We can not move on . If we move on , the NRA and those against us will win . They want us to forget . They want our voices to be silenced . And they want to retreat into the shadows where they can remain unnoticed . They want to be back on top , unquestioned in their corruption , but we can not and we will not let that happen . Today , and every day , we will continue to fight for those things that are right . We will continue to fight for common sense . We will continue to fight for our lives . We will continue to fight for our dead friends . There will be no faltering , no pauses in our cause . Every moment will be dedicated to those pieces of legislation ? every march , every meeting , every moment . All for that assault weapons ban to keep these weapons of war out of the hands of civilians who do not need them . All for the prohibition of high-capacity magazines . Because no hunter will ever need access to a magazine that can kill 17 in mere minutes . All for the reinforcement of background checks and closing of loopholes , because there must be more of a requirement for a person to access a gun than just a wad of cash . There are so very many things , so many steps to take . Like right now , sign our petition . It takes two seconds and it matters . We will take the big and we will take the small , but we will keep fighting . When they give us that inch , that bump stock ban , we will take a mile . We are not here for bread crumbs . We are here for real change . We are here to lead . We are here to call out every single politician , to force them into enacting this legislation , to addressing this legislation , to doing more than a simple Band-Aid on a broken bone . The pressure is on for every person in power , and it will stay that way . Because they know what is coming . They know that if there is no assault weapons ban passed , then we will vote them out . They know that if there is no tightening of the background checks , we will vote them out . They know that if there is no shrinking of magazine capacity , then we will vote them out . If they continue to ignore us , to only pretend to listen , then we will take action where it counts . We will take action every day , in every way , until they simply can not ignore us anymore .
