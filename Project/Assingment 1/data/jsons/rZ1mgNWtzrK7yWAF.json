( Carlos Barria/Reuters )\nThe recurring dream \u2014 or nightmare \u2014 of being a \u2018 citizen of the world \u2019\nBy the early 21st century , cosmopolitans were gushing that high-tech , instant communications , transnational agencies and agreements , free-flowing capital , international corporations , and a new eerily uniform global elite had , finally , made nationalism , borders , and even the nation-state itself all irrelevant . Nationalism was apparently relegated to dustbin of history , as we hit peak Socratic citizen-of-the-worldism .\nThere were always two flaws to these adolescent giddy reports from world-bestriding New York Times op-ed journalists about win-win globalization , with their praise of gleaming airports and superior high-speed rail in what was otherwise Communist China , or accounts of flying first-class on Qatar Airlines was heavenly compared with backward United or American Airlines .\nOne , globalization was not the end of history . It is a recurrent , cyclical , and at best morally neutral phenomenon that has always , at least in relative terms , waxed and waned over the past 2,500 years of civilization \u2014 although recent transcontinentalism carries greater consequences in the era of electronic interconnectedness .\nBy a.d. 200 , there was a globalized Roman world of 2 million square miles , stretching from Hadrian \u2019 s Wall to the Persian Gulf , and from the Rhine to the Atlas Mountains . Like frogs around the pond of Mare Nostrum , all official business was conducted in Latin or , increasingly in the East , Greek . A Roman citizen could enjoy habeas corpus from Bithynia to the Atlantic . Thousands of small towns were marked by fora and agorae , colonnades , and basilicas . While multiracial and non-Italian , otherwise uniformly equipped and trained legions secured the vast borders . It was quite an achievement of providing aqueducts , security , and property rights to 70 million disparate peoples , but it was no longer really the earlier Roman Republic of the Scipios , either .\nYet by a.d. 500 , the vast sameness was eroding . Most of the Empire in the West and the old borders in East had been picked apart by Vandals , Visigoths , Osogoths , Huns , Sasanians , and a host of other tribes and migrant and aggressive peoples .\nHistory \u2019 s succession of subsequent would-be imperial globalists \u2014 the Byzantines , the Caliphates , the Ottomans , Napoleon , Stalin and Hitler \u2014 for a while collapsed national borders and spread uniform language , architecture , customs , and culture until their dreams eventually imploded , usually from overreach , military defeat , corruption , bankrupt ideology , demographic calcification , rampant inflation , or sheer inefficiency and bloated bureaucracy .\nIt was never set in stone that the European Union could forever abolish national borders and invent something permanent called Europeanism . Or that the new Chinese Silk Road would tie the world together under Chinese hegemony . Or that the World Health Organization \u2019 s international protocols would make something like the coronavirus virtually impossible . Or that the world would shrink as tens of millions flew on identical Boeing 737 Maxes .\nHistory does not end in something , it continues on with everything .\nTribalism , nations , empires , and globalizations all grow and collapse , not unlike natural long-term changes in climate . Or , as the Greeks believed , societies are like the endless cycles of natural birth , aging , and decline of humans themselves .\nA second problem : Why did we assume that globalization was inherently superior to , say , nationalism , or that pancontinental conglomeration was superior to small autonomous countries ? Of course , absorption of local customs and protocols into a uniform culture could be beneficial in some areas , but why by extension would it be in most all areas ? Why were globalized projects and empires per se to be preferred to local republics ?\nThe premise of Orwell \u2019 s dystopian 1984 is that the nations of the postwar world have been absorbed by just three transcontinental feuding empires , Oceania , Eurasia , and Eastasia ; and with such nightmarish aggregation comes the death of free expression and individualism itself .\nGlobalization \u2019 s supposed selling points \u2014 worldwide markets , shared popular tastes , a common commercial language and currency , a nationless elite culture , ease of travel , dissemination of information , and communications \u2014 were never so simple .
