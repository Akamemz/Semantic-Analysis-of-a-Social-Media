The party has dumped money into tough races in red states in recent years only to see their candidates and incumbents get blown out from Louisiana to Arkansas to Tennessee , but has also won tough races in Montana and West Virginia .\nFor now , there are mitigating factors that help explain Democrats \u2019 hesitation . The GOP does not yet have a nominee to face Jones . And because Alabama is not a presidential battleground , Democrats will be able to buy ads there later at a more affordable price than states like North Carolina and Colorado .\nMoreover , Jones is sitting on $ 8 million , more than 10 times the war chest of either former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions or former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville as they slug it out for the GOP nomination . Their runoff , initially scheduled for March 31 , was delayed until July because of worries over coronavirus .\nIf Jones were to win reelection this fall it would dramatically ease Democrats \u2019 pathway back to the majority . If Jones loses , they need to pick up at least four seats elsewhere .\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee \u2019 s primary job is to defend incumbent senators .

''\nJones \u2019 s seat is the \u201c one pick-up we figured we were going to get , \u201d said Sen.
