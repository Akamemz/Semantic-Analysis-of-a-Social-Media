    "content": "Trump drives the mainstream press to abandon the pretense of objectivity .\nFor years , reporters were content to obscure their ideological dogmas and partisan goals behind the pretense of objectivity and detachment . Though the Washington Post , New York Times , and CNN practiced combat journalism against conservatives and Republicans , they did so while aspiring to professional standards of facticity and fairness , and applying , every now and then , scrutiny to liberals and Democrats worthy of investigation .\nDonald Trump changed that , of course . He is so unusual a figure , and his behavior so outlandish , that his rise precipitated a crisis in a profession already decimated by the collapse of print circulation and advertising dollars . The forces that brought Trump to power are alien to the experience of the men and women who populate newsrooms , his supporters unlike their colleagues , friends , and neighbors , his agenda anathema to the catechism of social liberalism , his career and business empire complex and murky and sensational . Little surprise that journalists reacted to his election with a combination of panic , fear , disgust , fascination , exhilaration , and the self-affirming belief that they remain the last line of defense against an emerging American autocracy . Who has time for dispassionate analysis , for methodical research and reporting , when the president \u2019 s very being is an assault on one \u2019 s conception of self , when nothing less than the future of the country is at stake ? Especially when the depletion of veteran editors , the relative youth and inexperience of political and congressional reporters , and the proliferation of social media , with its hot takes and quips , its groupthink and instant gratification , makes the transition from inquiry to indignation all too easy .\nThere is still excellent journalism . I would point , for starters , to the work on charter flights that led to the resignation of Tom Price . But the overall tone of coverage of this president and his administration is somewhere between the hysterical and the lunatic . Journalists are trapped in a condition of perpetual outrage , seizing on every rumor of discontent and disagreement , reflexively denouncing Trump \u2019 s every utterance and action , unable to distinguish between genuinely unusual behavior ( the firing of Comey , the tenure of Anthony Scaramucci , the \u201c fine people on both sides \u201d quip after Charlottesville ) and the elements of Trump \u2019 s personality and program that voters have already , so to speak , \u201c priced in. \u201d Supposedly authoritative news organizations have in one case taken up bizarre mottoes , like \u201c Democracy Dies in Darkness , \u201d and in another acted passive-aggressively by filing Trump stories under \u201c entertainment , \u201d only to re-categorize the material as news with the disclaimer ( since dropped ) that Trump is \u201c a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist , and birther. \u201d The mode of knee-jerk disgust not only prevents the mainstream media from distinguishing between the genuinely interesting stories and the false , partisan , and hackwork ones . It also has had the effect of further marginalizing print and broadcast journalists from middle America .\nThe other day , for example , Bob Schieffer observed on Face the Nation that one in five journalists live in New York , D.C. , or Los Angeles . The news is manufactured by residents of the liberal bubble , where conservatives are few and far between ( and certainly do not sound like Sarah Palin ) , jobs are plenty , education is high , and the benefits of globalization manifest in cheap prices , exotic restaurants , and a reserve labor force of cleaners , contractors , and home-care specialists . Can \u2019 t say I was shocked when Schieffer \u2019 s finding passed barely noticed , the consciences of the press untroubled by the fact that their experiences and backgrounds are so unlike the majority of the public whose interest they presume to uphold .\nNor was I stunned when a major report from the Pew Research Center found that \u201c about six-in-ten news stories about Trump \u2019 s first 60 days ( 62 percent ) carried an overall negative assessment of his words and actions . That is about three times more negative than for Obama ( 20 percent ) and roughly twice that of Bush and Clinton ( 28 percent each ) . \u201d This , at a time when the stock market is at record highs , the economy is at full employment , and Americans are upbeat about the recovery . The president \u2019 s inability to register majority approval in opinion polls may be unprecedented , but so is the amount of negative coverage he has received . Perhaps there \u2019 s a connection .\nTrump does not change , but his critics in the media have . Their feelings of revulsion toward him have deepened . Their eagerness to oppose him has become more acute . The scope of their vision has constricted to include only Trump : what he says , tweets , and does . The context in which he operates is invisible to them . When he raises the question of what the ultimate outcome of the removal of Confederate statues might be , the critics slag him as a racist , but do not dwell for long on polling that shows him to be in the center of public opinion . When he voices what many have felt about the politicization of the NFL and the attack on the flag and national anthem , the critics say he is being divisive and insensitive . But why is it always Trump who is being divisive , and not those who say the flag and anthem are symbols of white supremacy , and who raise fists in the black-power salute ?\nTrump does not change , but his critics in the media have .
