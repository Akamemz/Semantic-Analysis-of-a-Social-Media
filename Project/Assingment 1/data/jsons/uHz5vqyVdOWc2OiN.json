    "content": "Justice Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Theresa May lead a five-way race to be the next Conservative Party leader and UK prime minister .\nMr Gove was a surprise addition to the race , having been expected to back Boris Johnson , who shocked the political world by ruling himself out .\nMinister Andrea Leadsom , MP Liam Fox and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb are also in the running .\nThe winner of the contest is set to be announced on 9 September .\nThe leadership battle has been sparked by David Cameron 's decision to step down as prime minister after losing the EU referendum , which saw the country vote by 52 % to 48 % to leave the EU .\nMr Gove 's announcement early on Thursday that he would challenge the leadership was unexpected , as the justice secretary had been expected to throw his weight behind fellow leading Leave campaigner Mr Johnson for Conservative leader .\nExplaining his decision , he said : `` I have repeatedly said that I do not want to be prime minister . That has always been my view . But events since last Thursday have weighed heavily with me .\n`` I respect and admire all the candidates running for the leadership . In particular , I wanted to help build a team behind Boris Johnson so that a politician who argued for leaving the European Union could lead us to a better future .\n`` But I have come , reluctantly , to the conclusion that Boris can not provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead . ''\n`` Shakespearian '' is the word being mumbled by dazed politicians and pundits at Westminster .\nThe ambitions , rivalries and duplicitous double-dealing unleashed before the Tory leadership contest even got underway has left onlookers groping for fictional comparisons .\nIt 's Richard III meets Scarface , with a bit of Godfather thrown in .\nRemember this : David Cameron , Boris Johnson , Michael Gove and George Osborne grew up together - personally and politically . Their families were close . But the EU referendum ripped through old loyalties .\nFirst Michael Gove backed the Leave campaign , knowing the damage it could do to Cameron and Osborne . The chancellor and Gove kept their friendship intact despite the strain of the campaign .\nBut it was Boris Johnson 's decision to lead the Leave campaign and put his own ambitions to be prime minister ahead of loyalty to David Cameron that severed his relationship with the now departing PM , destroyed by Leave 's victory .\nBoris Johnson believed the crown would be his and naively believed Michael Gove 's promises of support . But now Mr Gove , despite polite protestations he never coveted the top job , has ruthlessly dispatched his friend .\nWhat has been going on behind the scenes ? The truth will only emerge in memoirs .\nBut my sense is Mr Gove and his team of advisors clearly did not believe Boris Johnson had the spine to fully divorce Britain from the EU . Nor did a number of Tory Mps trust Mr Johnson to deliver the promises he was making in terms of personnel and jobs .\nWhen Mr Gove made his move , hardened Brexit believers instantly went with him , sinking Boris Johnson .\nThe irony of course is that Boris Johnson , who did so much to take Britain out of the EU , has seen his own ambitious crushed in the aftermath .\nIt could be that the big winner from this vicious Tory drama is the woman in charge of law and order - Theresa May .\nSetting out his pitch for the leadership , the cabinet minister - best known as a controversial education secretary before becoming one of the faces of the Leave campaign - said : `` I want there to be an open and positive debate about the path the country will now take .\n`` Whatever the verdict of that debate I will respect it . In the next few days I will lay out my plan for the United Kingdom which I hope can provide unity and change . ''\nConservative MP David Davis told BBC Radio 5 Live Mr Gove 's decision must have been taken `` very late '' , as Mr Gove 's assistant had asked him on Wednesday night to attend Mr Johnson 's campaign launch on Thursday .\nJustice minister and Leave campaigner Dominic Raab , who switched his support from Mr Johnson to Mr Gove , told the BBC 's Daily Politics that `` Boris was cavalier with assurances he made '' and had failed to put together a `` strong unifying team '' .\nHome Secretary Theresa May : The 59-year-old has overtaken Boris Johnson as the bookies ' favourite to win the contest . She 's held the Home Office brief - often something of a poisoned chalice - since 2010 , and is a former Tory party chairman . She says she can offer the `` strong leadership '' and unity the UK needs , and promised a `` positive vision '' for the country 's future . She backed staying in the EU .\nJustice Secretary Michael Gove : The 48-year-old former newspaper columnist was a key figure in the party 's modernisation that led to its return to power in 2010 . He was a reforming , if controversial , education secretary between 2010 and 2014 , and now holds the Ministry of Justice brief . He was a leading player in the Brexit campaign - which put a strain on his close friendship with David Cameron . He has pitched himself as the candidate that can provide `` unity and change . ''\nWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb : The 43-year-old was promoted to the cabinet in 2014 as Welsh secretary , and boosted his profile earlier this year when he took over as work and pensions secretary . A rising star of the Tory party he has promised to unite the party and country following the referendum result and provide stability . Raised on a council estate by a single mother , he has a back story to which many Tory MPs are attracted . Backed Remain .\nEnergy minister Andrea Leadsom : The 53-year-old former banker and fund manager was one of the stars of the Leave campaign . A former district councillor , she became MP for South Northamptonshire in 2010 and - after serving as a junior Treasury minister and as a member of the Treasury select committee - she was made a junior minister in the energy and climate change department in May last year .\nFormer cabinet minister Liam Fox : It 's second time around for the 54-year-old ex-defence secretary and GP , who came a close third in the 2005 leadership contest . His cabinet career was cut short in 2011 when he resigned following a lobbying row . A Brexit campaigner , and on the right of the party , he has said whoever becomes PM must accept `` the instruction '' of the British people and not `` try to backslide '' over EU membership .\nLaunching her leadership bid in central London , Mrs May - one of the longest-serving home secretaries in history - said the UK needed `` strong proven leadership to steer us through this period of economic and political uncertainty and to negotiate the best possible terms as we leave the European Union '' .\nShe also pitched herself as the candidate that could `` unite our party and our country '' and offer `` a bold , new positive vision '' for the country 's future that `` works not for a privileged few , but for every one of us '' .\nAlthough Mrs May - the daughter of a vicar - backed Remain she maintained a low profile during the campaign and , in her speech , insisted she would not back away from last week 's vote . `` Brexit is Brexit .
