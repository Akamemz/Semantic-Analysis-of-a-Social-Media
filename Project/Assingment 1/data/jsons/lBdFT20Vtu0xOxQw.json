Hillary \u2019 s campaign was lax on cybersecurity , inviting cyberattacks , hacks and leaks . By conspiring with the DNC to make sure Sanders did not have a chance of winning , Hillary invited backlash from Sanders-supporters within the DNC . This series of articles explores the evidence that Seth Rich , a young , progressive operative hired to an IT position by the DNC , leaked to WikiLeaks thousands of John Podesta \u2019 s emails .\nThe breakthrough in this series of articles is the attempt to apply intelligence analytical techniques to sort out the various known cybersecurity attacks on the Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign to determine the rogue agent responsible for each separate known cybersecurity attack .\nWASHINGTON , D.C. \u2013 The investigation of the Seth Rich murder begins with understanding the complex network of progressive data managers that were involved in the Democratic Party \u2019 s 2016 presidential campaign .\n\u201c There was a culture of really bad security , weak security , among progressive data practitioners in the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign , \u201d a trusted source from within the Sanders campaign told \u2588\u2588\u2588.com on deep background , under a promise of anonymity .\n\u201c There was some security at the DNC ( Democratic National Committee ) such that you had to have passwords and credentials to access certain data files , \u201d he explained .\n\u201c But clearly it wasn \u2019 t sufficient to keep a determined hacker out . In a campaign everything is always rushed , a crisis , so until after there was a data breach , nobody prioritized data security . I never spent much of my time thinking about it . \u201d\nStarting in 2015 , the DNC and the Clinton campaign experienced a series of computer hacks that appear to have originated from more than one attacker .\nIn addition , Seth Rich \u2019 s breach of data security was a leak , not an attack , in that Seth Rich reportedly stole emails off a DNC computer , whereas hackers were external agents attacking the DNC computer from the outside .\nIn August 2015 , Bernie Sanders \u2019 campaign hired Zack Exley , a George Soros-sponsored labor-union organizer and computer hacker to run his nationwide ground game .\nExley was dubbed by George W. Bush as \u201c the garbage man \u201d after hacking Bush \u2019 s 2000 presidential campaign website , tracing back to a \u201c political satire \u201d campaign website Exley had created in 1999 , georgewbush.com , on which Exley had posted a hacked photograph of Bush , with a straw up his nose , inhaling white lines in an obvious parody designed to suggest Bush had a history of cocaine use .\nBush charged the mock website was produced by a \u201c garbage man , \u201d when he filed a Federal Election Commission complaint , threatening to sue Exley for using photographs hacked from Bush \u2019 s official campaign website .\nAfter serving as the director of online communications and online organizing for the unsuccessful 2004 presidential campaign of Sens . John Kerry and John Edwards , Exley in 2015 co-founded the New Organizing Institute , NOI , as a think tank to produce computer-savvy field operatives for left-oriented Democratic Party political campaigns .\nServing with Exley on the advisory board of NOI was Nathaniel G. Pearlman , another leftist political operative .\nIn 1997 , Pearlman founded NGP Software Inc. , a computer-oriented company organized to provide political software identifying Democratic voters .\nPearlman also served as the chief technology officer for Hillary Clinton \u2019 s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign .\nClinton hired Pearlman and his then-fledgling NGP Software in her first 1999 Senate election campaign to clean up campaign data on donors that had contributed some $ 30 million .\nAs chief technology officer for Clinton \u2019 s 2008 presidential campaign , Pearlman supervised the campaign \u2019 s Internet technology director , Bryan Pagliano .\nAs I first reported for WND in March 2016 , Pagliano \u2019 s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on Linkedin.com notes he worked for Clinton from 2006-2009 .\nIn 2008 , he \u201c headed the design and build of the campaign headquarters \u2019 data center and orchestrated the continuous movement of technical equipment and staff among nationwide field officers in response to ever-changing organizational needs . \u201d\nWhen Clinton \u2019 s 2008 presidential campaign disbanded , Pagliano moved to working for her political action committee .\nIn March 2009 , Bryan Pagliano installed Hillary \u2019 s private email server in the basement of the Clintons \u2019 Chappaqua , NY home ; Bill and Hillary Clinton personally paid Pagliano $ 5,000 for \u201c computer services \u201d prior to his becoming a State Department employee , according to a financial disclosure form Pagliano filed in April 2009 .\nThe payment evidently was for establishing a private server for the Clintons in their home in Chappaqua , New York .\nIn May 2009 , the State Department employed Pagliano as a special adviser .\nThe record shows Pagliano lied to the State Department to hide continued payments from the Clintons to maintain the Chappaqua e-mail server .\nEven after he became a State Department employee , the Clintons continued paying Pagliano privately to maintain the server for Hillary Clinton .\nPagliano , however , neglected to list the outside income in the required financial disclosures he filed with the State Department each year until concluding his full-time employment in February 2013 , coincident with Hillary Clinton \u2019 s departure as secretary of state .\nIn 2010 , NGP ( National Geographical and Political Software , supposedly not an acronym based on Pearlman \u2019 s initials ) , the voter data company created in 1997 by Pearlman in Washington , D.C. , acquired with the Voice Activation Network , VAN , created by Mark Sullivan in 2001 , to form NGP VAN .\nAccording to the NGP VAN website , NGP VAN is the architect of the DNC \u201c Vote Builder \u201d database that developed originally for the Obama presidential campaign\nNGP , still today headquartered in Washington , D.C. , operates exclusively to manager donor contributions .\nVAN , headquartered today in Somerville , Massachusetts , operates to manage voter databases .\nMore specifically , voter records are seeded into VAN from various sources , Catalyst , a progressive voter database company that maintains data on virtually every adult in the United States , from the Democratic National Party , and from each campaign using the VAN system .\nIt is important to understand the NGP VAN system during the 2016 presidential campaign was installed in the DNC .\nSo , even though the Clinton and Sanders campaign each had their own databases for donors and for prospective voters , both campaigns had to access the DNC to use the NGP VAN system to manage their donor and voter databases .\nIn December 2015 , software technology expert Will Conway explained the DNC \u2019 s relationship to the NPG-VAN technology as follows :\nNGP VAN has a contract with the Democratic National Committee in which their customers \u2019 data is owned and retained by the DNC . In exchange , the DNC provides data to NGP VAN customers \u2014 those using NGP VAN get the data of every previous NGP VAN user and the DNC , which basically covers every Democrat to run for office in modern history .\n\u2026 campaigns don \u2019 t actually own the relationships they build in the software . The Democratic National Committee does . The deal struck with the DNC ensures an incredible competitive advantage for NGP VAN : use our software , or be cut off from all Democrats \u2019 data . Moreover , if you break our rules , we \u2019 ll kick you off the platform and cut you off from your own data .\nAlso note , the private email server Pagliano established for Clinton at the State Department involved email technology that was separate and distinct from the NGP VAN technology that both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns used to manage their donor and voter databases .\nUltimately , though the course of the 2016 campaign , Hillary \u2019 s personal email server was hacked , the NGP VAN system was hacked , the DNC was hacked , the Sanders campaign was hacked , and the Clinton campaign was hacked .\nSeth Rich was reportedly a leaker , not a hacker , and his sole offense was to steal and leak documents out of the Clinton campaign .\nAs we shall see in the second article in this series , identifying and distinguishing each hacking incident that plagued the Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign is critical in unraveling the mystery of Seth Rich \u2019 s murder .\nThe Democrats could have avoided all the hacking problems in 2016 had the progressives managing Democratic data been more diligent about cybersecurity issues .\nBut the Democrats could not prevent leaks from employees from within the DNC and the Clinton campaign who became disaffected with Hillary Clinton .\nThe leaks that plagued the DNC and Hillary \u2019 s campaign stemmed from internal conflicts of interest .\nThese conflicts developed when the Sanders campaign ( and Sanders loyalists working in the DNC and even within Hillary \u2019 s campaign ) realized the DNC under Debbie Wasserman Schultz was implementing a plan developed in conjunction with Clinton campaign top operatives to steal the Democratic Party nomination from Sanders by rigging the primary contests and subsequent delegate count in Clinton \u2019 s favor .\nIn March 2012 , Rich came to Washington from his hometown Omaha , Nebraska , to work as a Research Data Associate for the Greenberg Quinlan , Rosner , a Democratic Party political operative organization that posed as an opinion research and public relations firm .\nThe background for Rich \u2019 s hire involved a meeting arranged by Democratic Party operative Amy Dacey ( subsequently CEO of the DNC from January 2014 until August 2016 ) , attended by John Podesta and Progressive Insurance billionaire Peter Lewis , on Sept. 27 , 2007 , in New York City at the Fifth Avenue offices of the Soros Fund Management , followed by dinner at the Fifth Avenue home of George Soros .\nThe purpose of the meeting was to develop a new voter mobilization contact methodology for the DNC \u2013 a purpose which ultimately became Seth Rich \u2019 s job at the DNC when he was hired there in June 2014 as the DNC \u2019 s Voter Expansion Data Director , where his job was to adapt the \u201c Voter Builder \u201d component of VAN such that a prospective voter could print out a map of their nearest polling location .\nWhile reporting for WND , I investigated Greenberg , Quinlan , Rosner in 2010 .\n1 . Emanuel lived for five years rent-free in an apartment owned by Rep. Rosa DeLauro , D-Conn. , and her husband , Stanley Greenberg , whose consulting firm was a prime architect in BP \u2019 s efforts to recast itself as a \u201c green \u201d corporation and recipient of hundreds of thousands of dollars awarded through a committee chaired by Emanuel .\n2 . The Greenberg Quinlan Rosner ( GQR ) consulting \u201c helped BP plan and evaluate its successful re-branding campaign , focusing the company \u2019 s branding on energy solutions , including the development of solar and other renewable energy sources , \u201d according to a webpage that has since been removed from the GQR website .\n3 . Greenberg Quinlan Rosner \u2019 s research also contributed to a $ 200 million advertising campaign in which British Petroleum attempted to shorten its name to \u201c BP \u201d and redesign its corporate insignia to emphasize a \u201c Beyond Petroleum \u201d theme .\n4 . Critics have characterized the BP advertising campaign prompted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner research as \u201c greenwashing , \u201d a process in which corporations disingenuously portray their efforts as fitting into a politically correct , \u201c green , \u201d environment-oriented sensitivity to alternative energy .\n5 . Greenberg Quinlan Rosner is also tied heavily to the Democratic Party , as it created a sister political consulting company named \u201c GCS , \u201d an acronym based on the last names of the principals \u2013 Stanley Greenberg of GQR , James Carville , the long-term adviser of Bill Clinton , and Bob Schrum , the campaign manager for Sen. John Kerry \u2019 s unsuccessful 2004 presidential campaign .\nEmanuel served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , which gave Greenberg polling contracts worth $ 239,996 in 2006 and $ 317,775 in 2008 .\nIn 2011 , GQR was hired by Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga , a self-proclaimed communist who had accompanied then Sen. Barack and Michelle Obama in their 2006 tour of Kenya , setting the stage for Obama \u2019 s 2008 presidential run .\nOdinga hired GQR to assist him in a planned second attempt to win the presidency in Kenya , after Obama had assisted him in becoming Kenyan prime minister in a complex power-sharing agreement Obama negotiated in 2008 , after Odinga disputed the results of a presidential election he narrowly lost .\nIn 2013 , while Rich was working for GQR , the firm \u2019 s research was central to creating a strategy that Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe implemented to beat GOP gubernatorial challenger Ken Cuccinelli .\nMcAuliffe championed \u201c women \u2019 s rights \u201d issues to appeal to unmarried women voters by running a series of controversial television ads designed to frame Cuccinelli as a right-wing zealot on contraception and abortion issues .\nGQR \u2019 s research showing a Democrat running for election could beat a generic Republican candidate by winning two-thirds of the votes cast by unmarried women , provided the Democrat could brand the GOP opponent exactly as McAuliffe cast Cuccinelli during the Virginia 2013 gubernatorial contest \u2013 a prediction that turned out right as McAuliffe won the votes of unmarried women by 67 percent to 25 percent for Cuccinelli , while Cuccinelli beat McAuliffe among married women by a much narrower margin , 51 percent to 42 percent .\nBrian Pagliano and Seth Rich : A case study in loyalty\nSeth Rich shared much with Brian Pagliano \u2013 with both majoring in political science in college , neither were IT specialists \u2013 with Seth Rich graduating with a B.A . in political science from Creighton University in Omaha , Nebraska , in 2011 .\nLike Pagliano , Rich was committed to progressive Democratic Party politics , as evidenced by Pagliano joining Pearlman , the father of NGP VAN software used exclusively in Democratic Party election campaigns , and by Seth Rich coming to Washington to work for GQR , an opinions research and public relations firm that works exclusively for Democrats , when it comes to election campaigns .\nBut while Pagliano was firmly committed to Hillary Clinton , Seth Rich joined the DNC , an organization he may have presumed ( or wanted to make sure ) would be equally fair to all Democratic Party presidential candidates , treating Bernie Sanders as fairly as Hillary Clinton , despite Hillary being the party \u2019 s presumed nominee from the moment the 2016 presidential campaign began .\nPerhaps the most important point of comparison is that both Brian Pagliano and Seth Rich were implicated in breaches of email systems \u2013 for Pagliano , emails on Hillary \u2019 s private email server were hacked by the first Guccifer , the Romanian hacker currently in U.S. prison ; for Rich , emails of Podesta and several other key members of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 presidential campaign were leaked , ultimately to be published on WikiLeaks .\nNeither Pagliano nor Rich were involved in the hacking of Hillary Clinton voter data that demanded a breach of the VAN system \u2013 Pagliano never had access to the NGP VAN computer system , and Rich worked only indirectly with VAN , given that his job at the DNC was not IT manager , but a subordinate responsible to develop a way the Vote Builder system could print out poling locations for prospective Democratic voters .\nThe point is this : In 2016 , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s cybersecurity was so notoriously lax that many hackers \u2013 both known and not yet disclosed \u2013 freely hacked Hillary Clinton \u2019 s private email server , the DNC email server , as well as the campaign files and voter databases of the DNC and its various operations during the campaign .\nThe first sub-point is this : Hillary Clinton and the DNC left themselves open to leaks from within once Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Donna Bazile at the DNC decided to throw the primary elections for Hillary \u2013 all email leaks in 2016 involved Hillary Clinton , not Bernie Sanders .\nThe second sub-point is this : No information of any importance was ever hacked or leaked out of the Bernie Sanders campaign \u2013 certainly no emails , no campaign files , and no voter data .\nAs we shall see in the second article in this series , the only way to distinguish who was hacking into Hillary \u2019 s emails , Hillary \u2019 s campaign files , and Hillary \u2019 s voter databases , or who was leaking from within Hillary \u2019 s campaign and/or from within the DNC can only be distinguished by the content of what they stole and made public , plus what we can conclude from what we know of the various methodologies the hackers/leakers utilized to get their hands on the goods .\nPagliano remained loyal to Hillary , refusing to provide evidence against her , even after he was granted immunity by the FBI .\nSeth Rich remained loyal to his progressive ideals , finding himself at growing odds with Clinton as it became clear to him the DNC had rigged the primaries so Bernie Sanders would lose .",

In exchange, the DNC provides data to NGP VAN customers \u2014 those using NGP VAN get the data of every previous NGP VAN user and the DNC, which basically covers every Democrat to run for office in modern history.\n\nConway noted there is also the following problem:\n\n\u2026 campaigns don\u2019t actually own the relationships they build in the software. The Democratic National Committee does. The deal struck with the DNC ensures an incredible competitive advantage for NGP VAN: use our software, or be cut off from all Democrats\u2019 data.

Emanuel lived for five years rent-free in an apartment owned by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and her husband, Stanley Greenberg, whose consulting firm was a prime architect in BP\u2019s efforts to recast itself as a \u201cgreen\u201d corporation and recipient of hundreds of thousands of dollars awarded through a committee chaired by Emanuel.\n\n2. The Greenberg Quinlan Rosner (GQR) consulting \u201chelped BP plan and evaluate its successful re-branding campaign, focusing the company\u2019s branding on energy solutions, including the development of solar and other renewable energy sources,\u201d according to a webpage that has since been removed from the GQR website.\n\n3. Greenberg Quinlan Rosner\u2019s research also contributed to a $200 million advertising campaign in which British Petroleum attempted to shorten its name to \u201cBP\u201d and redesign its corporate insignia to emphasize a \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d theme.\n\n4.

Greenberg Quinlan Rosner is also tied heavily to the Democratic Party, as it created a sister political consulting company named \u201cGCS,\u201d an acronym based on the last names of the principals \u2013 Stanley Greenberg of GQR, James Carville, the long-term adviser of Bill Clinton, and Bob Schrum, the campaign manager for Sen. John Kerry\u2019s unsuccessful 2004 presidential campaign.\n\nEmanuel served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which gave Greenberg polling contracts worth $239,996 in 2006 and $317,775 in 2008.\n\nIn 2011, GQR was hired by Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, a self-proclaimed communist who had accompanied then Sen.

for Rich, emails of Podesta and several other key members of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign were leaked, ultimately to be published on WikiLeaks.\n\nNeither Pagliano nor Rich were involved in the hacking of Hillary Clinton voter data that demanded a breach of the VAN system \u2013 Pagliano never had access to the NGP VAN computer system, and Rich worked only indirectly with VAN, given that his job at the DNC was not IT manager, but a subordinate responsible to develop a way the Vote Builder system could print out poling locations for prospective Democratic voters.\n\nThe point is this: In 2016, Hillary Clinton\u2019s cybersecurity was so notoriously lax that many hackers \u2013 both known and not yet disclosed \u2013 freely hacked Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, the DNC email server, as well as the campaign files and voter databases of the DNC and its various operations during the campaign.\n\nThe first sub-point is this: Hillary Clinton and the DNC left themselves open to leaks from within once Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Donna Bazile at the DNC decided to throw the primary elections for Hillary \u2013 all email leaks in 2016 involved Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe second sub-point is this: No information of any importance was ever hacked or leaked out of the Bernie Sanders campaign \u2013 certainly no emails, no campaign files, and no voter data.\n\nAs we shall see in the second article in this series, the only way to distinguish who was hacking into Hillary\u2019s emails, Hillary\u2019s campaign files, and Hillary\u2019s voter databases, or who was leaking from within Hillary\u2019s campaign and/or from within the DNC can only be distinguished by the content of what they stole and made public, plus what we can conclude from what we know of the various methodologies the hackers/leakers utilized to get their hands on the goods.\n\nPagliano remained loyal to Hillary, refusing to provide evidence against her, even after he was granted immunity by the FBI.\n\nSeth Rich remained loyal to his progressive ideals, finding himself at growing odds with Clinton as it became clear to him the DNC had rigged the primaries so Bernie Sanders would lose.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Imran Awan, Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s IT staffer who is under investigation for data breaches, had easy access to internal DNC emails. Schultz was caught on tape threatening the Chief of Capitol Police to return one of Awan\u2019s laptops secured as evidence. Awan recently fled to Pakistan. If he had easy access, Rich would\u2019ve as well, and Rich, a progressive idealist, had more motive to leak DNC emails, as the article above reveals.",
