In a country where health coverage has long been treated as a luxury , linked to certain kinds of white-collar employment , the coronavirus has made health coverage an amenity fewer can afford . That \u2019 s according to the early findings of a study released this week conducted by the nonpartisan consumer advocacy group Families USA , which found that during the early stages of the pandemic a staggering 5.4 million laid-off Americans lost their health insurance in a matter of weeks . That \u2019 s a historic drop-off and nearly 40 percent higher than during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009 . And it \u2019 s not over\u2014the pandemic is getting worse , not better , and the economy might not be far behind .\nWhat makes the current lack of coverage of millions of Americans at the exact moment they need it most particularly galling is that there was a short-term alternative just sitting around\u2014Obamacare . When the virus sent people to their homes in March , taking millions of jobs with it , the Trump administration refused to reopen the federal exchanges\u2014which are only open to new sign-ups during a small six-week window at the end of each year\u2014to allow Americans to buy coverage to protect themselves during the coming pandemic . At that point , the Affordable Care Act was already seriously hobbled from a decade of Republican efforts to chip away at the law in the courts and in statehouses across the country until it served fewer and fewer people . Even still , it was better than the alternative , which doesn \u2019 t exist . In fact , the Trump administration and dozens of Republican state attorneys general are back before the Supreme Court again , a full decade on , to try to eliminate the Affordable Care Act once and for all .
