Just as I did back in my first campaign , I learned much about our people . I hope that by sharing these observations I can contribute to the cause of bringing all Americans together to confront some of the major challenges we face .\nIn that campaign , by day , I had town halls in cities throughout New Hampshire hollowed out by the new economy , and events in Iowa with Americans who esteemed the traditional values of hard work , family , faith , and community , but who felt that the people in charge of our country did not .\nBy night , I traveled to California , Chicago , Palm Beach , and New York to raise money at the homes of people who lived very different lives .
