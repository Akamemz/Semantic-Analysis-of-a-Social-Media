    "content": "( CNN ) President Donald Trump unveiled new guidelines on Thursday meant to help states loosen their social distancing restrictions , but in a retreat from his onetime claim of `` absolute authority '' to restart the economy , he told governors on an afternoon telephone call it was their decision on when and how to reopen .\n`` You are going to call your own shots , '' Trump said , according to a person familiar with the conversation . `` I 've gotten to know almost all of you , most of you I 've known and some very well . You are all very capable people , I think in all cases , very capable people . And you 're going to be calling your shots . ''\nIt was a turnabout from his Monday claim that `` the President of the United States calls the shots '' in how to ease restrictions that have kept most Americans indoors and forced closures of schools , restaurants , gyms and other businesses . And it was an indication that even as he tries to ease the country out of its virtual shutdown , Trump will place responsibility elsewhere should cases spike again .\nAs business leaders , lawmakers and governors warn persistent testing shortfalls could hamper any effort to reopen the country , Trump is pushing ahead with attempts to revive an economy moribund by the coronavirus pandemic . He said during his daily news conference the new guidelines amount to the start of the country 's `` rejuvenation . ''\n`` We 're starting our life again , '' Trump said , even as it remains to be seen just how quickly any state returns to normal .\nThe new guidelines , meant to speed Trump 's goal of restarting the country , wo n't be mandatory . Many governors have already extended restrictions into May or banded into regional collectives that will determine their own reopening plans .

And the document encourages employers to enact social distancing , temperature checks , testing and sanitation practices in their workplaces .\nIn the first phase of reopening , the document suggests schools that are currently closed should remain so and employees who are able to telework should keep working from home .\nLarge venues , including some restaurants , can operate under strict social distancing protocols . Gyms can open as long as they maintain social distancing guidelines , but bars should remain shuttered .\nThe guidelines still recommend minimizing nonessential travel , and indicate vulnerable populations should remain sheltered-in-place .\nTrump unveiled the guidelines publicly at an early evening news conference .\n`` We are not opening all at once but one careful step at a time , '' Trump said , indicating each state could `` tailor '' its own reopening plan . `` If they need to remain closed , we will allow them to do that . ''\nIn his call with governors , Trump previewed the plan but insisted it would be up to the individual governors to make the decision in their own states when they begin that process .\nTrump said the decision to target May 1 as the day to begin the process of reopening the country came in consultation with Drs . Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx , medical leaders of the administration 's coronavirus task force .\nTrump described the two doctors ' sign-off on May 1 date as a `` negotiation . ''\n`` It was a little bit of a negotiation that that 's the way it should be , '' Trump said . `` I guess , I hope it is that way usually , but we all do want to see things open .
