Mike Shields , the Republican National Committee \u2019 s chief of staff , sat with his data and modeling team at the committee \u2019 s Capitol Hill headquarters a week before Election Day to go over the Senate numbers : It was increasingly clear that the GOP was in for a big night , and possibly a very big night .\nFor months up to that point , the party \u2019 s internal polling had barely budged . The battle for the Senate was a neck-and-neck affair , with eight to 10 Senate races stuck within the margin of error .\nNow their data was telling a different story . Republicans were going to win the toss-up North Carolina race and prevail in Georgia without a runoff , the aides told Shields , whose office walls are adorned with inspirational World War II posters from Great Britain , where he lived as a child . And other races like Arkansas and Kentucky that the party \u2019 s own polls as well as public surveys showed as tight \u2014 and on which the party spent tens of millions of dollars as a result \u2014 actually weren \u2019 t close at all .\nFor two years , Republicans had been working to correct one of the party \u2019 s greatest embarrassments of recent years : the flawed polling that led so many in the party to believe Mitt Romney was on the cusp of victory in 2012 . But after dramatically underestimating Democratic turnout in 2012 , it was now obvious that the GOP had erred in the other direction in 2014 . Their pollsters had understated Republicans \u2019 leads in a number of states , causing the RNC and GOP campaign committees to pour money into places where it wasn \u2019 t needed and hold money back from places where it might have made a difference \u2014 such as Virginia , where Republican Ed Gillespie lost by less than a percentage point .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just as bad to be wrong by being too conservative , \u201d said Shields . \u201c It \u2019 s just as big a mistake to tell a client that you \u2019 re only winning by one point when they \u2019 re winning by eight . Especially at the party committee level , there are just too many decisions being made \u2026 That money can be used elsewhere . \u201d\nRepublicans , it turned out , weren \u2019 t the only ones with polling problems : The Democratic internals and public polls also overestimated the Democratic turnout . But the GOP , in particular , had spent months refining its methods just to avoid this problem .\nNow , as Republicans look ahead to 2016 , senior party strategists are preparing for yet another overhaul of their survey-research arm , despite all the work the party did to help its pollsters capture an increasingly diverse and harder-to-reach electorate . One idea for 2016 is to combine traditional telephone surveys with sophisticated computer modeling of the electorate , using demographic information and data such as consumer choices to establish voting patterns .\n\u201c I still believe we have a polling problem in the Republican Party , and I think the work still needs to be done \u2026 to set standards that all of the polling firms have to follow , \u201d said Shields . But the success of the data and modeling team gives Shields and other Republicans hope .\n\u201c We do not believe that voter scores are a replacement for telephone-survey data , \u201d he said , but quickly added : \u201c I think they can both make one another better . \u201d\nAnother Republican strategist with extensive knowledge of the party \u2019 s internal 2014 polling was blunter : \u201c I believe there were some pollsters that were holding their data back because of what happened in \u2019 12 .
