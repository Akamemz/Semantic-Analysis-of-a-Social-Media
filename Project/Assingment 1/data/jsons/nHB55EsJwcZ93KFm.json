    "content": "Republican presidential prospects like Ted Cruz , Rand Paul and Marco Rubio have tapped the tech industry \u2019 s fat wallets and mined its big-data expertise \u2014 but these 2016 hopefuls couldn \u2019 t be further from Silicon Valley when it comes to policy .\nA series of major divides \u2014 from the fate of net neutrality to the future of surveillance reform \u2014 still splits this trio of prominent pols from Internet giants in the country \u2019 s tech heartland , which helped catapult President Barack Obama to well-funded victories in 2008 and 2012 .\nWeb companies , for example , are pressing the Federal Communications Commission for new rules that would require Internet providers to treat all online traffic equally . But Cruz , Paul and Rubio are anything but neutral on net neutrality \u2014 they hate it , much less any government regulation at all .\nRepublicans also have a rift with the tech industry over domestic spying . More than a year of work by tech leaders like Facebook and Google to curtail the National Security Agency \u2019 s surveillance authorities failed this month in part because Rubio joined Paul , usually a supporter , in voting against it . And tech executives who have clamored for more high-skilled workers have heard only criticism lately from most Republicans , who slammed Obama after he issued an executive order on immigration reform .\nEven the GOP acknowledges it has plenty of work to do to woo Silicon Valley . \u201c If you look historically at who people donate to , it \u2019 s really been 9 or 10 to 1 , Democrat to Republican \u2014 we haven \u2019 t done as well , \u201d said Paul , who has been working to set up a new West Coast outpost .\nBut the senator stressed the GOP still has plenty to offer , especially on tax issues that matter to tech titans \u2019 bottom lines . \u201c Republicans are actually going to try to do something to help the economy , \u201d he said .\nTechnology companies represent some of the most successful firms in the country , and their executives form the ranks of the nation \u2019 s richest . That means there \u2019 s plenty of campaign cash for candidates to milk \u2014 and Democrats long have dominated that well . Beyond money , Democrats also have outpaced Republicans in attracting the sort of tech talent required to run modern , data-intensive campaigns .\nObama in his first presidential campaign formed powerful alliances at companies like Google , and his team by 2012 had set up an entire apparatus \u2014 Technology 4 Obama \u2014 to solicit donations from the likes of Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman . Entering the 2014 midterms , Democrats again returned repeatedly to Silicon Valley and San Francisco for a series of high-dollar fundraisers . Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Sam Altman , the leader of Y Combinator , for example , hosted the president earlier this year ; so did Mark Pincus , who founded Zynga .\n\u201c We \u2019 re talking about some very deep pockets here , \u201d said Larry Gerston , a professor focusing on U.S. public policy at San Jose State University . \u201c They \u2019 re just figuring out that money can buy them things they never imagined . \u201d\nBut , Gerston added , \u201c For all their efforts , certainly , Republican tech types and folks close to the Republican Party haven \u2019 t managed well . \u201d\nThe poor political odds have only spurred the GOP to action . Paul this summer began work to set up a technology hub of sorts in San Francisco \u2014 and the Kentucky senator returned there in October for a fundraiser alongside other prominent Senate Republicans . Cisco CEO John Chambers helped host the event at the Woodside , California , home of Oracle \u2019 s Larry Ellison . These tech hardware players \u2014 and others , like new Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz and HP CEO Meg Whitman , who unsuccessfully ran for governor in California \u2014 long have backed and funded Republican candidates .\n\u201c He \u2019 s hopeful it \u2019 s a libertarian incubator of future Ayn Rands , \u201d said Shawn Steel , a past chairman of the California Republican Party , when asked about Paul \u2019 s strategy . But even Steel acknowledged that many Internet company executives are \u201c deeply in the infrastructure of progressive Democrats . \u201d\nRubio , meanwhile , has tried to align himself with businesses \u2014 speaking , for example , at Uber \u2019 s Beltway headquarters about the threat of government regulation to ride-sharing apps and other tech disrupters . The Florida senator has also spoken at Google \u2019 s Washington office about immigration , and he \u2019 s paid a visit to 1776 , D.C. \u2019 s start-up incubator .\nAnd Cruz has ported his firebrand conservative style to tech : The Texas Republican traveled this month down to a start-up hub in Austin , where he plopped a rotary telephone down on a podium in a heated diatribe against what he called the FCC \u2019 s archaic approach to the Internet .\nFor many Republicans , their biggest challenge might have nothing to do with tech policy \u2014 and everything to do with culture . | AP Photo\nFor all their efforts , though , there \u2019 s still a widening policy gap between national Republicans and the Internet giants they \u2019 re trying to court .\nCompanies like Facebook , Google , Yahoo and Yelp \u2014 through their Washington trade group , the Internet Association \u2014 are public backers of net neutrality . They together have praised Obama for endorsing an approach that might subject the Internet to utility-like regulation . All three Republicans , however , rejected the president \u2019 s suggestion . Rubio hammered it as \u201c government regulation of the Internet \u201d that \u201c threatens to restrict Internet growth and increase costs on Internet users. \u201d And Cruz lambasted net neutrality as \u201c Obamacare for the Internet \u201d in a tweet that went viral \u2014 and drew plenty of criticism .\nA high-stakes vote over the future of the NSA further tested Republicans \u2019 relationships in the Valley . Paul and others had supported a major overhaul of the agency \u2019 s authorities to collect Americans \u2019 communications in bulk \u2014 but the senator shocked tech giants and civil-liberties groups when he pulled support at the last minute , as the so-called USA Freedom Act reached the Senate floor for a key procedural vote . Cruz did support the measure ; Rubio long had stated his opposition , citing emerging terrorist threats and the need for more intelligence .\nAnd for all the talk about the tech set \u2019 s need for more high-skilled workers , all three Republican stalwarts slammed Obama last week for acting on his own to advance immigration reform . Cruz and Paul previously voted against an immigration bill that tech companies had backed .\nTo hear Paul tell it , the party hasn \u2019 t hurt its standing among the tech crowd .
