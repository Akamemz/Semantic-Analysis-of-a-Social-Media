    "content": "The White House Correspondents ' Dinner has become a strange event . It is , ostensibly , an evening when the president and the press can come together to share a few lighthearted laughs . But it 's evolved into a recital of brutal truths \u2014 albeit one neither side ever really admits happened .\nThe joke of President Obama 's performance on Saturday was that he was n't joking . Everyone just had to pretend he was . Take this section , from the official White House transcript :\nAfter the midterm elections , my advisors asked me , `` Mr. President , do you have a bucket list ? '' And I said , `` Well , I have something that rhymes with bucket list. \u2019 '' ( Laughter and applause . ) Take executive action on immigration ? Bucket . ( Laughter . ) New climate regulations ? Bucket . It \u2019 s the right thing to do . ( Laughter and applause . )\nThe tip-off there is , `` It 's the right thing to do . '' That 's not a joke . That 's Obama 's actual justification for the aggressive executive actions of his second term \u2014 `` fuck it , it 's the right thing to do . '' But the norms of politics are such that he typically has to frame his actions as routine , dull , even necessary . He has to search for precedent and downplay the consequences .\nIt 's only on the evening of the White House Correspondents ' Dinner when he can say what everyone already knows : his actions are huge , they are controversial , they push the norms of American politics , but fuck it , at a moment when American politics seems increasingly broken , Obama has decided to just go ahead and do what he thinks is right .\nA few weeks ago , Dick Cheney says he thinks I \u2019 m the worst President of his lifetime . Which is interesting , because I think Dick Cheney is the worst President of my lifetime . ( Laughter and applause . ) It \u2019 s quite a coincidence .\nIt 's funny , sure . But he 's not kidding . It 's just the thing Obama ca n't usually say . The humor is in the shock of him actually saying it .\nBut the place where Obama stopped being polite and started getting real was when he brought out Luther , his personal anger translator . This was , itself , a way of giving up the game . The Luther joke comes from the Comedy Central sketch show Key and Peele , and the point of it is that Obama , as the first black president , is not allowed to express his anger , as America is terrified of angry black men . And so he 's got Luther \u2014 the angry black man who can say what he ca n't .\nOn Key and Peele , though , it really is a joke . Key plays Luther . Peele plays Obama . It 's two comedians commenting on race and politics . But at the White House Correspondents ' Dinner , the whole point was that the joke is n't a joke at all . It was Key playing Luther , but it was Obama playing Obama . Obama 's anger translator was actually translating for Obama , working off a script that had to be approved by Obama . And so when Luther spoke , now he really was speaking for Obama :\nTHE PRESIDENT : In our fast-changing world , traditions like the White House Correspondents \u2019 Dinner are important . LUTHER : I mean , really , what is this dinner ? ( Laughter . ) And why am I required to come to it ? ( Laughter . ) Jeb Bush , do you really want to do this ? ( Laughter . ) THE PRESIDENT : Because despite our differences , we count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day . LUTHER : And we can count on Fox News to terrify old white people with some nonsense ! ( Laughter . ) `` Sharia law is coming to Cleveland . Run for the damn hills ! '' ( Laughter . ) Y \u2019 all , it \u2019 s ridiculous . ( Laughter . ) THE PRESIDENT : We won \u2019 t always see eye to eye . LUTHER : Oh , and CNN , thank you so much for the wall-to-wall Ebola coverage . For two whole weeks , we were one step away from the Walking Dead . ( Laughter . ) And then you all got up and just moved on to the next day . That was awesome . Oh , and by the way , just if you haven \u2019 t noticed , you don \u2019 t have Ebola ! ( Laughter . ) THE PRESIDENT : But I still deeply appreciate the work that you do . LUTHER : Y'all remember when I had that big , old hole in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico and then I plugged it ? Remember that ? Which `` Obama \u2019 s Katrina '' was that one ? Was that 19 ? Or was it 20 ? Because I can \u2019 t remember . ( Laughter . )\nThere are no jokes there . There 's just Obama saying what he has to say and Luther saying what Obama actually believes .\nAnd what Obama believes is that the press is often sensational , trivial , and fearmongering . He thinks they hype negative stories for weeks on end and then refuse to admit their mistake when the horror fizzles . He thinks he gets the blame for catastrophes but little credit for solutions . He thinks the media has a deep bias toward negative stories ( which , of course , we do ) .\nBut if Obama is annoyed at the press , he is appalled at Republicans who deny climate change \u2014 and are trying to block him from taking action to stop climate change . Obama believes global warming a generational threat , and so when he sees James Inhofe , the chair of the Senate 's Committee on Environment and Public Works , throwing snowballs on the chamber 's floor , well , his thoughts on that would likely be seen as unpresidential if he gave them voice .\nExcept on the night of the White House Correspondents ' Dinner :\nTHE PRESIDENT : The science is clear . Nine of the ten hottest years ever came in the last decade . LUTHER : Now , I \u2019 m not a scientist , but I do know how to count to 10 . ( Laughter . ) THE PRESIDENT : Rising seas , more violent storms . LUTHER : We \u2019 ve got mosquitos . Sweaty people on the train , stinking it up . It \u2019 s just nasty . ( Laughter . ) THE PRESIDENT : I mean , look at what \u2019 s happening right now . Every serious scientist says we need to act . The Pentagon says it \u2019 s a national security risk . Miami floods on a sunny day , and instead of doing anything about it , we \u2019 ve got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate ! LUTHER : Okay , Mr. President .

Hey ! ( Applause . ) THE PRESIDENT : What ? ! LUTHER : All due respect , sir . You don \u2019 t need an anger translator . ( Laughter . ) You need counseling .\nSo the joke here was that Obama is so angry about the Republican Party 's climate denialism that he even managed to scare his anger translator . This is n't a joke . It 's just Obama 's opinion , delivered with a fury that 's rarely allowed in American politics .\nRead these sentences again : `` Every serious scientist says we need to act .

'' Is there a single one of them that you think Obama does n't believe ? He gets right up to the first syllable of calling it `` bullshit .
