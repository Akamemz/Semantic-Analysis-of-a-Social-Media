    "content": "Grocery shopping had never been one of my favorite activities , but it never used to be as cumbersome as it is now . I 'd fill up the cart with food , wait in line at the check-out counter and kibitz with the cashier as the bagger loaded up\u2014and double-bagged\u2014my groceries . Now , the lines are much slower because bagging has become an ordeal thanks to the `` Earth-protecting '' plastic-bag ban the state had passed a few years ago .\nConsider what happens now . Store employees ca n't simply place your food in the needed bags . They have to ask how many bags shoppers want to buy . `` As many as needed , '' I always say , given that I do n't really care if the $ 150 transaction costs another buck . It 's basically just another tax we pay to live in a former paradise . But that 's not how it works now . The employees dispense bags parsimoniously . Who can blame cashiers given the guff they might get if they sell someone an unnecessary bag ?\nBagging used to be an artform , where baggers carefully separated , say , the eggs from the bottle of Chivas Regal . Now they cram as much stuff as possible in a single bag . Heaven forbid you get stuck behind someone who pulls out a trove of bacteria-laden , reusable sacks . I put the new thick bags they sell right into the garbage , whereas I used to reuse the lightweight `` single use '' bags to pick up dog poo and line the bathroom waste baskets . Now I have to order those thinner ones online .\nThis has not improved the environment one iota , even though it has added to our daily annoyance . There always was plenty of evidence to debunk the push for the bag ban . Those bags comprised an infinitesimal portion of the waste stream .\nBut grocery stores supported it because , well , they can now charge for something they previously gave away . You can always count on a coalition of true believers and profit-seekers\u2014the `` Baptists and bootleggers '' from Prohibition lore\u2014to unite behind such edicts . And voters , who are easily swayed by uplifting ballot nonsense , rejected a referendum that would have overturned the ban . Those who promote these laws do n't view shoppers ' inconvenience as a downside . They often view it as a self-healing and education process .\n`` If we live in an environment that 's wounded \u2026 it hurts us , chipping away at our health and creating injuries at a physical , psychological , and spiritual level , '' wrote Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Wangari Maathai in a 2011 Huffington Post column . `` ( I ) f we help reclaim or save what is lost\u2026the planet will help us in our self-healing and indeed survival .

But they are n't doing much research before proposing an endless stream of these `` let 's annoy the public '' proposals . They certainly are n't looking at cost-benefit analyses , either . For instance , Gov .
