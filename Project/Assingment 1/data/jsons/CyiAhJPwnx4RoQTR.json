NEA slams 'botched ' Common Core\nThe nation \u2019 s largest teachers union is pulling back on its once-enthusiastic support of the Common Core academic standards , labeling their rollout \u201c completely botched . \u201d\nNational Education Association President Dennis Van Roekel said he still believes the standards can improve education . But he said they will not succeed without a major \u201c course correction \u201d \u2014 including possibly rewriting some of the standards and revising the related tests with teacher input .\n\u201c In far too many states , implementation has been completely botched , \u201d Van Roekel wrote in a letter Wednesday afternoon to his organization \u2019 s more than 3 million members .\nVan Roekel \u2019 s statement suggests quite a rocky road ahead for the Common Core standards , which are meant to instill more rigorous language-arts and math instruction in public schools \u2014 and which have been a priority of the Obama administration .\nForty-five states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards . Most of those decisions were not controversial .
