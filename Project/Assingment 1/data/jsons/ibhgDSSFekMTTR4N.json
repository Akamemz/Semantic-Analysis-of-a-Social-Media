    "content": "Matt covered the shocking slander of a good man led by Democratic representatives purely for the sake of thwarting President Trump . That man was Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson . As Matt sai :\nFrom Matt : \u201c Was it because Rear Admiral Ronny Jacksongave a health report on President Trump the media and the Democratic Party didn \u2019 t like ? Is it because he didn \u2019 t say Trump was mental unstable , a sex addict , a drug addict , or all in all dying from\u2026something ? It was the most deplorable pressers in recent memory , the one where Jackson gave the anticipated health report on the president last January . Then , came the attack on Jackson being a possible sycophant for Trump ; guys , he was Obama \u2019 s doctor too\u2014and trusted by him as well . Then , President Trump fired David Shulkin was fired as Veterans Affairs secretary . Jackson was nominated by Trump to replace him . This set the wheels in motion for Democrats to character assassinate Jackson as a pill pusher and someone who wrecked a car while intoxicated . Those were the two big charges lobbed against him by Democrats . Sen. Jon Tester ( D-MT ) quarterbacked this effort , releasing a two-page memo fraught with damning charges against Jackson . Charges the rear admiral denies vehemently . \u201d\nToday on Twitter , President Trump called for Sen. Jon Tester to resign .\nAllegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false . The Secret Service is unable to confirm ( in fact they deny ) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family . Tester should resign . The ..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) April 28 , 2018\n.... great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being . Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire , and now , for no reason whatsoever , his reputation has been shattered . Not fair , Tester ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) April 28 , 2018\nIndeed by all accounts it looks as if Sen. Jon Tester lied . Katie covered this extensively earlier in the week .\nFrom Katie : `` On Thursday , U.S. Navy Rear Admiral and longtime White House Doctor Ronny Jackson withdrew his nomination to be the next Veteran 's Affairs Secretary after being accused of professional misconduct through media reports . CNN reported earlier this week , on anonymous sourcing , that during an overseas trip in 2015 Jackson got drunk and belligerently banged on a female colleague 's hotel door . CNN also reported the Secret Service stopped Jackson and that agents were worried he might wake up President Obama . Turns out , the Secret Service has no record of the incident ( bolding is mine ) . `` Over the last 48 hours , media outlets have alleged that U.S. Secret Service personnel were forced to intervene during a Presidential foreign travel assignment in order to prevent disturbing ( former ) President Barack Obama , '' The Secret Service released in a statement . `` The Secret Service has no such record of any incident ; specifically , any incident involving Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson .
