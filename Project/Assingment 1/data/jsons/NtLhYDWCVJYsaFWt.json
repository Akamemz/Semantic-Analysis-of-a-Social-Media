Fox News ' Ed Henry even asked President Obama about the story at today 's press conference ( the president said he had no idea what Henry was talking about ) .\nIt 's worth noting that this is not Victoria Toensing 's first foray into Benghazi \u201c cover-up \u201d allegations . Back in November 2012 , Toensing wrote an op-ed for Fox News ( of course ) attempting to draw a sinister link between the Benghazi attack and the abrupt resignation of former CIA director David Petraeus . \u201c Something is rotten in Benghazi-Petraeus , \u201d wrote Toensing , who laid out an intricate conspiracy tying the two events together which ultimately fell completely apart .\nToensing 's argument was -- like most conspiracies -- dense and winding . According to Toensing , the fact that Petraeus supported the White House 's initial indications that an anti-Islam video had incited the Benghazi attackers was \u201c strange , \u201d given that Petraeus , in her view , must have known otherwise :\nBecause if an administration pushes a political agenda that applauds the killing of Bin Laden as the ultimate act for eradicating the radical Islamic threat , then that same administration ignores its Ambassador 's urgent pleas for more security for fear it will appear Bin Laden 's demise was not the answer to that threat . Our country 's chief spy is supposed to know which theory is held up by the evidence .\nThe question , as Toensing saw it , was what motivation Petraeus had for going along with the White House . One explanation she came up with was that Obama was blackmailing his own CIA director with knowledge of the extramarital affair that ultimately led to Petraeus ' resignation . And not only was Petraeus being blackmailed , per Toensing , but the administration had likely concealed knowledge of the affair it so it could be used against him at a later date .\nConsider : All candidates for CIA employment must take a polygraph . Does n't the nominee for DCI have to do so also ? And that nasty little catch-all embarrassment question is always asked by the polygrapher . Usually , the polygraphee is thinking back to college and confessing to smoking pot . In 2011 , it would not take a sterling memory for Petraeus to remember a 2011 affair . Why is the administration 's handling of the affair significant ? Because sloppy vetting of the country 's top spy and not giving timely notice to the oversight committees was either gross incompetence or a deliberate evasion of law .

Or there was a much bigger secret at Benghazi that all involved were ( and still are ) trying to cover up .\nToensing smelled smoke and yelled \u201c fire , \u201d noting that Petraeus resigned over the affair just before he was scheduled to testify before Congress on the Benghazi attack :\nThe two seemingly unrelated incidents are now merged .
