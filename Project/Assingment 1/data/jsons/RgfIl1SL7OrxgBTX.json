    "content": "House Republicans announced legislation Monday to permanently lock in last year \u2019 s tax cuts , looking to remind voters of the surging economy \u2014 and the Republicans \u2019 role in getting it there \u2014 in the weeks before the November elections .\nThe three bills have been dubbed Tax Reform 2.0 . They would make good on President Trump \u2019 s repeated calls on Congress to go beyond the $ 1.5 trillion package he signed last year and give Americans more breaks .\nThe legislation would make permanent last year \u2019 s tax breaks for individuals , preventing them from facing a tax increase in eight years , while boosting incentives for retirement savings and giving more lenient tax treatment to startups and small businesses .\n\u201c Under our new system , we \u2019 re seeing incredible job growth , bigger paychecks and a tax code that works on behalf of families and American businesses . Now it \u2019 s the time to ensure we never let our tax code become so outdated again , \u201d said Rep. Kevin Brady , Texas Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , which announced the bills .\nRepublican leaders say they want to hold a vote in the House by the end of September , giving their members a chance to crow about last year \u2019 s tax cuts and to force Democrats to explain their opposition amid a surging economy .\nThe bills are likely to end up as more of a political statement than a policy accomplishment because it \u2019 s doubtful they would survive a Democratic filibuster in the Senate .\nThe latest package is not protected by a budget , which would have circumvented the filibuster .\nThe cuts would add at least $ 650 billion to the deficit over the next decade , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a left-leaning think tank .\nLike with last year \u2019 s bill , the center said , most of the savings would benefit wealthier Americans .\n\u201c The first Republican tax law hasn \u2019 t helped workers get ahead . Wages aren \u2019 t keeping up with inflation , costs for health insurance and prescription drugs are rising , and companies are laying people off and shipping jobs overseas , \u201d said Rep. Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts , the top Democrat on Ways and Means . \u201c This new tax legislation is more of the same : It disproportionately benefits the wealthiest Americans while growing the nation \u2019 s debt even more . \u201d\nThe tax reform is the biggest legislative accomplishment of a Congress that has been controlled by Republicans since Mr. Trump took office . Republicans are counting on the tax cuts to persuade voters to keep them in charge .\nAmericans are increasingly pleased with the economy \u2019 s performance . A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found that 70 percent of respondents said the U.S. economy is \u201c excellent \u201d or \u201c good , \u201d matching the poll \u2019 s record high .\n\u201c The Economy is soooo good , perhaps the best in our country \u2019 s history , \u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter , adding that Democrats were \u201c flailing \u201d for a response .\nThe latest round of numbers included 4.2 percent quarterly growth in the gross domestic product , a continued low unemployment rate and even a significant boost in average wages .\nBut the president isn \u2019 t enjoying the fruit of those numbers . His approval rating stood at just 38 percent in the Quinnipiac poll , dragged down by what voters saw as personal failings of lack of honesty and leadership .\n\u201c The economy booms , but President Donald Trump \u2019 s numbers are a bust . An anemic 38 percent approval rating is compounded by lows on honesty , strength and intelligence , \u201d said Tim Malloy , the poll \u2019 s assistant director .\nAdding to Mr. Trump \u2019 s woes last week was former President Barack Obama , who said he deserved the lion \u2019 s share of credit for the soaring economy .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s just remember when this recovery started , \u201d the former president said in a speech marking his return to the campaign trail . \u201c I \u2019 m glad it \u2019 s continued , but when you hear about this economic miracle that \u2019 s been going on , when the job numbers come out , monthly job numbers , and suddenly Republicans are saying it \u2019 s a miracle , I have to kind of remind them , actually , those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016 . \u201d\nMr. Obama did oversee similar job numbers , with average monthly growth of 226,000 in 2015 and 195,000 in 2016 .\nMr. Trump presided over average monthly job growth of 182,000 last year . So far this year , it has been 207,000 .\nBut the White House said Mr. Trump has to be given credit for a broader set of data .\nSmall-business optimism , business confidence , real sales , real private nonresidential fixed investment and core capital goods orders and shipments have surged since Mr. Trump took office , said Kevin Hassett , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .\n\u201c If anyone were to assert that the capital spending boom that we \u2019 re seeing right now was a continuation of the trend that President Trump inherited , then , well , they wouldn \u2019 t get a high grade in graduate school for that assertion , \u201d Mr. Hassett said .\nAlthough he said Mr. Obama is often unfairly blamed for the Great Recession that he inherited , Mr. Hassett said there were \u201c a whole bunch of policies that I think were very negative for growth . \u201d\nMr. Hassett did have to correct Mr. Trump \u2019 s math in a tweet Monday that said growth in gross domestic product , at 4.2 percent , was higher than the unemployment number , at 3.9 percent , \u201c for the first time in over 100 years ! \u201d\nThe statistic is wrong .
