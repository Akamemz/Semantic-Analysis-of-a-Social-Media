Who are we to believe : Mr. Comey , who would have no reason to accuse the president of obstruction of justice , and who has apparently preserved meticulous notes of his conversations ? Or the president , who fact-checkers have demonstrated has told more lies in less time than any other modern occupant of the Oval Office ?\nWhile Mr. Trump might have been within his rights to fire Mr. Comey , this pattern of demands to protect himself and Mr. Flynn , followed by retaliation when the demands were not met , if proven , is a textbook case of wrongful conduct .
