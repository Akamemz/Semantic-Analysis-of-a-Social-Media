But this enrollment season will be a challenge as the Obama administration and insurers try to lure holdouts who haven \u2019 t previously signed up for ACA coverage , even as premiums for many products appear set to rise sharply . Premiums for a type of plan that is closely watched as a signal of consumer costs\u2014the second-lowest-priced insurance product in the law \u2019 s \u201c silver \u201d metal tier\u2014will increase 7.5 % on average across the roughly three dozen states that rely on the HealthCare.gov marketplace , according to the administration .\nBehind those shifts is a tough business reality : Under the ACA , insurers have seen an influx of new membership in individual plans and in Medicaid plans they administer for the government , expanding the industry \u2019 s total U.S. revenue to $ 743 billion in 2014 , the year the law \u2019 s biggest changes took effect , from $ 641 billion the year before , according to a new analysis by consulting firm McKinsey & Co .\nBut much of that growth has been unprofitable . Health insurers lost a total of $ 2.5 billion , or on average $ 163 per consumer enrolled , in the individual market in 2014 , McKinsey found . A number are also expecting to lose money on their marketplace business for 2015 .\nNow , a lot of insurers are recalibrating their approach for 2016 , with changes visible at all levels of the industry\u2014from pricing to product design .\nAt big insurer Aetna Inc. , the evidence of the law \u2019 s impact could be spotted last month in a Phoenix classroom , where Aetna was training a class of customer-service hires who will support a suite of re-engineered ACA marketplace plans dubbed \u201c Leap. \u201d Those products will have a different service approach , with fewer automated phone prompts and a completely new staff that is supposed to spend more time solving customers \u2019 problems .\nA trainee stood at a whiteboard , drawing stick figures with speech bubbles in a Pictionary-style game . \u201c Conversation ? \u201d asked a class member . \u201c Transition of care ? \u201d ventured another . The teacher gave the answer : The new reps had to keep commitments to consumers . That meant calling them back if needed .\nThe health law remade the individual market , forcing insurers to sell plans to all consumers and banning them from charging rates based on health conditions . Insurers struggled to predict their costs , and many didn \u2019 t set rates high enough to cover the care of those they enrolled .\nNow , a number of insurance startups are shutting down , including many of the law \u2019 s 23 cooperative insurers , which won \u2019 t have products for this fall \u2019 s open enrollment shoppers .\nFor larger companies , the losses were survivable . But rate increases create a risk that consumers may get sticker shock despite the availability of federal subsidies that reduce the cost sharply for many .\nPeter Wainwright , 63 years old , who retired from a telecommunications job , currently has a plan bought on California \u2019 s ACA marketplace . He and his wife don \u2019 t get a subsidy and pay about $ 2,230 a month , and the rate is increasing for 2016 . \u201c Everything has gone up , \u201d said Mr. Wainwright , of Half Moon Bay , Calif .\nThe administration \u2019 s goal is to have about 10 million people with paid-up coverage on the state and federal ACA exchanges by the end of 2016 . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office earlier this year estimated that at least 20 million people would buy policies under the law for 2016 coverage .\nStill , insurers believe over time that the overall consumer-oriented market is likely to grow , including burgeoning private Medicare plans , and approaches pioneered there are expected to spread into the larger employer-based business .\n\u201c The ACA is an accelerant , or a catalyst \u201d for changes , said Brad Wilson , chief executive of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina . \u201c The market is , and will continue to evolve to , a consumer-centric , retail type . \u201d\nThe nonprofit , which lost money on its exchange business in 2014 and expects to do so again in 2015 , sought a roughly 35 % rate increase for next year and is making other moves to rein in costs , including calling enrollees who have frequent emergency-room visits to encourage other options such as primary-care doctors .\nMany insurers are tweaking their health-care-provider networks . Health Care Service Corp. , which owns Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in five states , lost money on its 2014 exchange business .
