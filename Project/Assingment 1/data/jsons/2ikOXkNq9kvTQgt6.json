In the meantime , Congress and the White House are moving toward another pandemic bill that \u2019 s expected to carry a price tag of at least $ 1 trillion .\nOne of the latest flashpoints to emerge is implementation of the $ 660 billion Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) , an initiative designed to extend forgivable loans to small businesses during the pandemic to keep workers on the payroll .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t have a full picture from the information that we \u2019 ve received so far , so it \u2019 s hard to say whether the program is working , \u201d said Liz Hempowicz , director of public policy at the Project on Government Oversight , a watchdog group .\nShe said recently released government figures for the program are inadequate .\n\u201c In the PPP loan data , the administration is claiming that they know how many jobs have been retained under this program and how many jobs have been saved , but there \u2019 s no way for the government to know that , \u201d she said , noting that the numbers just represent \u201c how many people are employed by those entities that got these loans rather than how many jobs have been supported by this program . \u201d\nThe CARES Act , signed into law on March 27 , set up three oversight arms : the special inspector general for pandemic recovery ( SIGPR ) , tasked with overseeing coronavirus spending ; the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee , an interagency panel designed to promote cooperation among the various inspectors general ; and a special Congressional Oversight Commission .\nThe Pandemic Response Accountability Committee has not received the spending data that some lawmakers thought it would when they voted for the CARES Act , which mandated that PPP recipients report in detail how many jobs were saved or created because of federal assistance .\nFor the SIGPR , staffing up is a problem . The inspector general doesn \u2019 t have the authority to speed up the lengthy government hiring process .\nCritics also argue that while the SIGPR has subpoena power , it has limited authority over criminal matters .
