( Kate Munsch/Reuters )\nRadicals from the 1960s and 1970s now hold powerful positions in government and academia\nWeather Underground terrorists , who made no secret of being anti-AmeriKKKan \u201c small-c \u201d communists , are having more success than they could have dreamed of in the 1960s .\nThey are dominating the language . You know that whole \u201c white privilege \u201d nostrum that we \u2019 re paying universities $ 60K per year to drum into our children \u2019 s brains ? It is derived from their lamentation of \u201c white skin privilege. \u201d In their ideology , the revolution to overthrow the capitalist , racist , imperialist system summoned them \u2014 lily white radicals \u2014 to abandon their privilege and embrace the armed struggle .\nAmong their most influential thinkers was Bill Ayers . He got a windfall from the government \u2019 s failure to prosecute him for the bombings he carried out and the mass murders he planned but was insufficiently competent to execute . It was a second career as a \u201c Distinguished Professor of Education \u201d at the University of Illinois . As Sol Stern relates in a 2006 City Journal essay that should be required reading today , this entailed designing curricula used by today \u2019 s hard-Left academics , based on what Ayers saw as a moral imperative to convert schools into social-justice indoctrination labs .\nOf course , in the days before they brought the revolution into the classroom , they pursued it on urban streets , prioritizing war on cops . To the avant-garde , the police are the pointy end of the oppressive government spear , enforcing its laws and imposing the racist society \u2019 s caste system . For the revolution to succeed , the police have to be discredited , defunded , and defanged . For the Weather Underground , that meant branching into such radical offshoots as the May 19 Communist Organization and conspiring with black separatists .\nSo it was that such Weather confederates as Susan Rosenberg , Kathy Boudin , and David Gilbert , among others , teamed with the Black Liberation Army to carry out the infamous 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck at the Nanuet Mall near Nyack , N.Y. At the time , Rosenberg was already a suspect in the 1979 New Jersey jailbreak of Joanne Chesimard , also known as Assata Shakur , a Black Liberation Army leader who had been convicted of murdering New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster . Chesimard fled the country and was given asylum by Fidel Castro \u2019 s Communist regime in Cuba , where she has lived ever since .\nIn robbing the Brinks truck , the terrorists shot at the security guards , murdering one of them , Peter Paige . In a firefight with Nyack police while trying to escape , they killed Sergeant Edward O \u2019 Grady and Officer Waverly Brown \u2014 the latter a Korean War veteran who had joined the force in 1966 , the first African American to serve in Nyack \u2019 s police department . Rosenberg went on the lam , finally captured three years later in possession of over 700 pounds of explosives she and her fellow radicals were planning to use in additional mayhem . A federal judge in New Jersey sentenced her to 58 years \u2019 imprisonment .\nBoudin and Gilbert had left their 14-month-old son , Chesa , with a sitter in order to participate in the Brinks heist . But unlike Rosenberg , they were captured right after the bloody shootouts . Boudin was sentenced to a minimum 20 years \u2019 imprisonment ( with a maximum life sentence ) , and Gilbert to 75 years \u2019 imprisonment .\nWith his parents in custody , young Chesa Boudin was raised by their confederates , Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn . Like Ayers , Dohrn was a Weather Underground leader who became an academic after eluding significant prosecution for their bombings and mass-murder conspiracies \u2014 though she did do a short stint of jail time for contempt after defying a grand-jury subpoena to testify about Rosenberg .\nIn addition to his American academic work , Ayers became a supporter of the late Communist dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s education programs in Venezuela . There , in a 2006 speech with the strongman looking on , Ayers proclaimed , \u201c Teaching invites transformations , it urges revolutions small and large . La educaci\u00f3n es revoluci\u00f3n ! \u201d Later , Chesa Boudin would follow in Ayers \u2019 s footsteps , working as a translator and think-tank researcher for Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s regime .\nMeanwhile , in Chicago , Ayers and Dohrn seamlessly became prominent in Democratic Party politics . At their Hyde Park home in 1995 , they held a coming-out party for an ambitious political unknown , a community organizer named Barack Obama . Two years later , the future president breathlessly endorsed Ayers \u2019 s polemic , A Kind and Just Parent ? , as a \u201c searing and timely account. \u201d The book is an indictment of the U.S. criminal-justice system , which Ayers likens to South Africa under apartheid . As Stanley Kurtz has recounted , Ayers helped pave Obama \u2019 s way into the radical Left \u2019 s extensive fundraising networks ; the two collaborated as board members of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge , doling out more than $ 100 million to community organizers and education \u201c reformers . \u201d\nSusan Rosenberg \u2019 s terrorism sentence was commuted by President Bill Clinton in 2001 , part of the scandalous array of clemency grants on his last day in office . ( I was then a senior federal prosecutor and had just spent months successfully arguing against her release . ) Instantly , she was offered teaching positions at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and , later , Hamilton College , though protests by parents and alumni forced the first to be short-lived and the second declined .\nNot to worry , though .

To navigate around this inconvenience , the BLM Global Network Foundation is sponsored by Thousand Currents , which has non-profit status \u2014 meaning donors can make tax-deductible contributions to Thousand Currents , which , in turn , supports BLM . The arrangement appears to trace back to 2016 , when the Kellogg Foundation provided Thousand Currents with $ 900,000 for \u201c building the infrastructure and capacity of the national # BlackLivesMatter to support and strengthen their local chapters \u2019 organizing capacity . \u201d\nLike Rosenberg , Kathy Boudin has landed on her feet .
