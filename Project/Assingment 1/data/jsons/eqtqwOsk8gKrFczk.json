Mass shootings are defined for the study as having four or more victims and do n't include gang killings or slayings that involve the death of multiple family members . These shootings include the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in June 2016 -- the worst mass shooting in US history -- and others in an Aurora , Colorado , movie theater and at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Connecticut , both in 2012 .\nThe 90 US mass shootings are nearly one-third of the 292 such attacks globally for that period . While the United States has 5 % of the world 's population , it had 31 % of all public mass shootings .\n`` People have been a little surprised by these statistics , '' said Adam Lankford , an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Alabama , who did the analysis . Lankford presented his work at the American Sociological Association 's annual conference last year and said it 's the first research of its kind to do a global comparison .\nLankford combed through the records of every incident and found a few common factors that set the US incidents apart from the rest of the world 's .\nIn the United States , people have a greater chance of dying in mass shootings if they 're at work or at school .

In the other 171 countries Lankford studied , the average was 8.8 victims per incident .\nLankford said he thinks there are fewer people killed in these mass shootings in the United States because American police routinely train on how to deal with this kind of incident , even though it happens rarely compared with other kinds of crime .\n`` Police were slower to respond in other countries and were more likely to be ill prepared when they did respond , '' he said .\nWhat 's behind all these mass slayings in the United States ?\nMany of the shooters in the United States were mentally ill , according to the data .
