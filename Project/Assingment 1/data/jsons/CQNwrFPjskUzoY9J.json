Be the first to hear about Nation Travels destinations , and explore the world with kindred spirits .\nAll columnists have their hobbyhorses\u2014topics they obsessively ride at the risk of testing the patience of their readers . For Bret Stephens of The New York Times , the sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 de la maison is academic freedom and the supposed threat to robust debate posed by politically correct students huddling in safe spaces . In a 2017 commencement address at Hampden-Sydney College , he defined safe spaces as places \u201c where like-minded people\u2014often sharing the same race , gender , sexual orientation or political outlook\u2014can spend time together without having to encounter the expression of any ideas or opinions that they do not endorse. \u201d Ad Policy\nStephens \u2019 s frequent huffing and puffing on this topic made him an easy and deserving target of derision when it was revealed that the columnist tried to get a professor in trouble for the trivial offense of insulting him . On Monday , David Karpf , an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University , tweeted out a link to an article reporting that the New York Times newsroom suffered from bedbugs . \u201c The bedbugs are a metaphor , \u201d Karpf joked . \u201c The bedbugs are Bret Stephens . \u201d\nIn response , Stephens raised the threat level to DEFCON 2 . In a letter sent to both Karpf and his provost at George Washington University , Stephens wrote , \u201c I \u2019 m often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people\u2014people they \u2019 ve never met\u2014on Twitter . I think you \u2019 ve set a new standard. \u201d The columnist invited the professor to come over to his house and repeat the bedbug comment to his face . Stephens also sent a separate letter to another university higher-up , the director of Karpf \u2019 s program .\nDespite Stephens \u2019 s demurrals , he was clearly trying to get Karpf in trouble with George Washington University . This created an easy opening for critics to accurately zing Stephens as not just a hypocrite but a snowflake as well . Yet there \u2019 s something more than bad faith at work . MORE FROM Jeet Heer Like Dr. Frankenstein , Republicans Now Face the Monster They Created Yesterday 12:03 pm Nikki Haley Has Decided That Trumpism Is the Future November 11 , 2019 Michael Bloomberg Should Stay Home\u2014and Pay His Taxes November 8 , 2019 Author page\nStephens has , in fact , proven his argument about the dangers of safe spaces\u2014although not in a way that he \u2019 s likely to understand . To understand why Stephens reacted with such fury to what was in fact a mild rebuke , we must first recognize that the columnist has spent most of his adult life pampered in a right-wing cocoon , so he \u2019 s not used to the rough-and-tumble of political debate . Prior to being hired by The New York Times , Stephens had two major employers , The Jerusalem Post and The Wall Street Journal . During Stephens \u2019 s tenure at the Post , the paper was owned by Hollinger , run by disgraced press baron Conrad Black . I worked at another Hollinger operation , the National Post , during that era and can testify that the upper management of that firm was securely ensconced in a right-wing cone of silence , where few liberal or left-wing ideas ever penetrated .\nAfter The Jerusalem Post , Stephens \u2019 s other major place of employment was The Wall Street Journal , owned for most of Stephens \u2019 s tenure by another far-right press baron , Rupert Murdoch . As Mark Schmitt of the New America Foundation tweeted , \u201c I \u2019 ve long thought that WSJ editorial page is a terrible place to spend one \u2019 s 20s and 30s . It is an extraordinarily insulated environment w/ colleagues , editors and readers who nod along to an identical world view . \u201d\nStephens fell victim to the Megyn Kelly Syndrome , the pattern whereby those who were groomed by the peculiar insular culture of right-wing media find it hard to adjust to the norms of the outside world . While at Fox News , Kelly was freely able to race bait all she wanted , with many segments warning of the supposed dangers of the New Black Panthers . Since this was on Fox , Kelly didn \u2019 t have to deal with viewers who found her racist demagoguery offensive . When she was hired by NBC , she quickly floundered , with her career at the network crashing after she suggested on air that blackface was fine for a Halloween costume . It wasn \u2019 t just her comments that got her in trouble but also her sputtering apology , which made it clear that the objections to blackface remained a mystery to her . Current Issue View our current issue\nOther examples of the Megyn Kelly Syndrome include Rush Limbaugh ( fired from ESPN after four weeks when he suggested that black quarterbacks benefited from affirmative action ) and Kevin Williamson ( a writer quickly dismissed from The Atlantic after it turned out that he had misled his employer about his commenting that women who had abortions should be executed ) .\nNot everyone who emerges from right-wing media suffers from the Megyn Kelley Syndrome . Usually writers who are adept at reporting or reasoned debate have no trouble shifting from right-wing to mainstream outlets . Examples include Tim Alberta , Betsy Woodruff , and Richard Brookhiser . But these are all writers who are genuinely thoughtful .\nBy contrast , the Megyn Kelly Syndrome tends to strike those who emerge from what might be called the trolling culture of the right , where the main goal is not persuasion but outrage . The Wall Street Journal \u2019 s editorial page represents the high end of this trolling culture . It \u2019 s more refined than Rush Limbaugh or Fox News\u2014but just as committed to performative mudslinging . Stephens , a Never Trump conservative , often poses as someone who is more high-minded than the partisan right , but he \u2019 s been indelibly stamped by that environment , as can be seen in his minimizing of climate change , his dismissal of rape culture , and his talk of the \u201c disease of the Arab mind . \u201d\nStephens has spent his entire career in one of the most insular safe spaces in America : the intellectual gated community of the right . No wonder he is having so much trouble handling the criticism he gets from New York Times readers . He \u2019 s never had to face the challenge of genuine disagreement\u2014and freaks out when confronted . Clearly , the safe spaces of the right need to be broken down .",
