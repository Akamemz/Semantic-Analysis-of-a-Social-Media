It is Elizabeth Warren .\n100 daze of Trump : euphoria and nausea on the White House rollercoaster Read more\nStanding before the faithful of the National Rifle Association in Atlanta on Friday , the president predicted a surfeit of candidates . \u201c You \u2019 ll have plenty of those Democrats coming over and you \u2019 re going to say , \u2018 No , sir , no thank you \u2013 no , ma \u2019 am , \u2019 \u201d the president said . \u201c Perhaps ma \u2019 am . It may be Pocahontas , remember that . \u201d\nPocahontas is the racially charged term that Trump used on the campaign trail to dismiss Warren , who has claimed Native American heritage . Clearly , she had got under his skin . The Massachusetts senator was a self-declared \u201c nasty woman \u201d with a message for Trump : \u201c Women have had it with guys like you. \u201d She went toe to toe with him on his favourite medium , Twitter , hammering him for delivering a \u201c one-two punch of bigotry and economic lies \u201d .\nIt is small wonder that , if asked who now personifies the anti-Trump resistance , Warren would come top of many people \u2019 s lists . At 67 , the former Harvard law professor is a formidable figure with a reputation for reticence bordering on aloofness when approached by reporters in the corridors of Capitol Hill . But the woman who walks into Senate Democratic offices in Washington for this interview , wearing a blue jacket and dark trousers , is the opposite of aloof .\n\u201c Elizabeth Warren , \u201d she says , despite being instantly recognisable to anyone following US politics , offering a handshake and warm smile .\nShe reminisces about her first visit to this room , when she was on her way to becoming a senator in 2012 , and jokes about \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s voice recorder resembling a Taser . But when she turns to business , she is characteristically forthright and makes clear that Barack Obama \u2019 s grace period \u2013 a presidential afterglow in which he is beyond criticism in the Democratic party \u2013 is over .\nMost Americans are being left behind in this economy . Worse than being left behind , they \u2019 re getting kicked in the teeth\n\u201c I think President Obama , like many others in both parties , talks about a set of big national statistics that look shiny and great but increasingly have giant blind spots , \u201d she says . \u201c That GDP , unemployment , no longer reflect the lived experiences of most Americans . And the lived experiences of most Americans is that they are being left behind in this economy .\n\u201c Worse than being left behind , they \u2019 re getting kicked in the teeth . \u201d\nIn the topsy-turvy election , both Trump and the leftwing candidate for the Democratic nomination , Bernie Sanders , spoke of a rigged economy . Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee , has articulated the view that Obama did not get the credit he deserved from rescuing America from the financial crisis of 2007-08 . That , it transpired , was small comfort to voters in decaying industrial towns who felt the globalisation train had left the station without them .\nWith Sanders still a leading voice and energy coming from the progressive base , and centrist politics around the world in retreat , it might be tempting for the Democrats to turn left . Warren \u2013 who grew up in deep red Oklahoma but now lives in Massachusetts , the state of the Kennedys \u2013 frames the question in a different way . Again , she demonstrates a willingness to criticise her own party .\n\u201c I think left-right is less and less an accurate description of the political landscape , \u201d she says . \u201c Now , having said that , I think there are real differences between the Republicans and the Democrats here in the United States . The Republicans have clearly thrown their lot in with the rich and the powerful , but so have a lot of Democrats . You know , it \u2019 s a question of walking the walk on working people , on fighting for working people . I think that was the real point . \u201d\nWarren did not not name any individuals . Some commentators have criticised Bill and Hillary Clinton for becoming too close to wealthy elites .\nMuch has been written in the electoral postmortems over the definition of a Democrat : whether economic populism was neglected during the election in favour of identity politics relating to gender , race and sexuality . For progressives , it might be argued that Warren represents the best of Clinton and Sanders rolled into one : strong on issues such as equal pay and reproductive rights but equally strong on class inequality and economic opportunity . This is also what makes her such a tempting target for Trump and the Republicans .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a false choice , \u201d she says . \u201c To talk about the economics of survival in the 21st century is also to include a woman \u2019 s right to make decisions over her own body , a woman \u2019 s meaningful access to birth control . That is as deeply woven into the economic stability of that woman individually , her family , her community , this entire nation . I think those are deeply tied to each other . Not either-ors . \u201d\nThe senator \u2019 s choice of abortion as an example is timely . Sanders triggered fierce soul searching in the party last week by rallying in Omaha , Nebraska for a mayoral candidate who opposes abortion rights but promises economic justice . Pro-choice activists described it as a betrayal of the women who have been in the vanguard of the resistance to Trump .\nWould Warren endorse a Democratic candidate who was anti-abortion ? \u201c Probably not , \u201d she says . \u201c But let me be clear . Look , I \u2019 m pro-choice , I \u2019 m strongly pro-choice , I \u2019 ve been in these fights forever and forever and forever and at the federal level this is powerfully important to me \u2026 I get that not everyone in the Democratic party agrees with me but I am in this fight all the way . \u201d\nTrump has energised and galvanised the apathetic and apolitical . He made politics great again in the sense of getting people to care instead of allowing it to hum softly in the background . Suddenly , it is no longer a tepid struggle within the grey managerial class . Suddenly it matters . Newspaper readership and news channel viewership have revived after years of decline ; late-night TV comedians are thriving . What Trump Did Next is a constant topic of conversation at dinner tables . It may yet prove to be his legacy .\nMany call Trump a fascist . 100 days in , is he just a reactionary Republican ? | Victoria de Grazia Read more\nOn 21 January , for example , more than 400,000 protesters took part in a women \u2019 s march in Washington , with millions more marching across America and around the world . For Warren , it was an awakening : \u201c I think that when the history of this time period is written it will be about Donald Trump \u2019 s election , no doubt , but it will be about the Women \u2019 s March the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated . Democracy changed in America on that day .\n\u201c We are no longer a country that believes we can do politics only once every four years , or even once every two years , no longer a country that says that democracy is only about elections and that it will tend to itself in the time periods between elections . People are deeply engaged in issues right now . The healthcare fight . Immigration . \u201d\nWarren advocates marches and rallies , online protests , viral videos , collective action and running for office . \u201c Let me give a giant hug to the resistance . Resistance , persistence , insistence \u2013 every part of it \u2013 and how to bring more people into the fight . Look , Democrats are in the minority in the House , in the Senate , our tools are very limited to block Trump \u2019 s actions but democracy is working in an entirely new way .\n\u201c This is one of the things I now talk about everywhere we go , about how to get more engaged and how people can make their voices more effective , and how they can make sure they get heard in Washington , and it is changing the United States Congress . Not fast enough , but it \u2019 s changing it . \u201d\nTrump has tried to undermine a free press . He \u2019 s shown no respect for the courts . Those are the steps authoritarians take\nWarren , a mother of two and grandmother of three , is at the tip of that particular spear . She has never met Trump \u2013 the closest she came was at the inauguration \u2013 but she clashed with him on Twitter last year . \u201c Thumbs at 30 paces , \u201d she jokes , miming the typing action in mid-air . On 21 March 2016 , she posted : \u201c Many of history \u2019 s worst authoritarians started out as losers \u2013 and @ realDonaldTrump is a serious threat. \u201d In her new book , This Fight is Our Fight , she recalls on inauguration day seeing protesters carrying a giant banner that said just one word : \u201c FASCIST . \u201d\nAsked if she considers Trump an authoritarian , a fascist , she replies forcefully : \u201c Look at what he has done . He has expressed his admiration for Mussolini , for Vladimir Putin . He has tried to undermine a free press . He \u2019 s shown no respect for the courts . Those are the steps that authoritarians take . \u201d\nCan America withstand it ? \u201c That \u2019 s ultimately what the book is about . It \u2019 s the narrative arc of how America built a middle class and then corporate CEOs and billionaires took the legs out from underneath the middle class , how their tool was money , and the final chapter , whether or not we can withstand the punch that Donald Trump delivers to our working families and to our democracy . And yet , I would say , this book ends on a note of optimism . \u201d\nTrump may be a one-off but the conditions that produced him are not . The disillusionment in towns across America that felt forgotten by flashy big cities , that felt they had nothing to lose by voting for Trump , rhymed with what led to the Brexit vote in the UK . America had Reagan and trickle-down economics ; Britain had Thatcher and the invisible hand of the market .\n\u201c There are certainly parallels , \u201d Warren says . \u201c Billionaires and corporate CEOs have figured out that for an investment of millions of dollars \u2013 they can get returns of billions of dollars . So if they can get their snout to the trough of government money , government handouts , government gifts , government loopholes , they can get richer and richer and richer . It \u2019 s not a secret that was developed here in the United States alone . It \u2019 s a point that \u2019 s spread all around the globe . \u201d\nIn This Fight is Our Fight , Warren recalls a conversation with her husband , Bruce Mann , over whether to run for president in 2016 . He pointed out how difficult the first Senate race was . \u201c It was hard for him to see me ridiculed and called names , hard to see our children dragged into political attacks , hard to see both his sister and my brothers worry , \u201d she writes . He gave her his blessing but talking it through with him decided her against .\nTrump 's promise for healthcare act contradicts Republicans ' proposal Read more\nWill this deter her again in 2020 ? Clinton recently said she believes misogyny played a part in her own defeat . Reviewing Warren \u2019 s book for the New York Times , economist Paul Krugman wrote : \u201c Let \u2019 s be honest : Republicans have gone after Warren herself , in a way they haven \u2019 t gone after Sanders , in part because of her gender . \u201d\nWarren does not say no . But first , she reminds us , she has a Senate race to run in 2018 \u2013 a midterm election that should provide a clue as to the durability of the resistance at the ballot box . \u201c I said I \u2019 m in this fight , there \u2019 s no pause about that , \u201d she says . \u201c I can take whatever somebody wants to throw at me . It \u2019 s harder when things get thrown at your family but that \u2019 s become the reality of 21st-century politics . \u201d\nShe recalls her own journey , from janitor \u2019 s daughter to Harvard academic to senator , thanks to opportunities she believes were lost to today \u2019 s children when Washington decided it was more important to give tax breaks to billionaires and giant corporations .\n\u201c So that \u2019 s what drives me , \u201d she says , passionately . \u201c And if you told me that what it would take for me to make a difference would be to get up every day and walk across broken glass but that I have a chance to open some doors for the next kid who comes along , I \u2019 d do it . \u201d",
