Lindsey Graham \u2019 s complete aversion to email might be an extreme case even in the technologically antiquated Senate , where lawmakers still file their campaign finance reports on paper , but he certainly has plenty of company in the Luddite Caucus .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t use email , \u201d said Sen. Pat Roberts ( R-Kansas ) . \u201c I haven \u2019 t used it since I was chairman of the Intelligence Committee and learned that any emails would be going to the Chinese and to the Russians and to the French and to the British and to everybody else , including everything I said on my iPhone . \u201d\nNow , the 78-year-old Roberts said , texting his grandson is the most frequent way he uses his cellphone .\nSen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) isn \u2019 t fond of emailing , either , blaming his resistance on his notoriously emotional personality .\n\u201c How do I communicate ? Tweet , statements , tweet , statements and sometimes we put out emails on general subjects , not really to communicate with people , \u201d McCain , 78 , said in an interview . He added in jest , \u201c Because I \u2019 m always calm and placid and never excitable so I [ do ] not have to worry about saying something that later I would regret . \u201d\nSen. Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) , meanwhile , reports that his preferred method of communication with staff is the old-fashioned handwritten note .\n\u201c I have an iPhone and it belongs to the Senate and it \u2019 s all I use \u2026 I have [ sent emails ] . Not a lot , \u201d Shelby said . \u201c The best thing is person-to-person like I \u2019 m talking to you . To my staff , talk to them on the phone but also notes . Hand notes . I write a lot . I \u2019 ve been here a while ; I \u2019 m a little older than y \u2019 all . \u201d\nThe preference for face-to-face or telephone conversations is hardly based on age . A spokesperson for Sen. Jim Inhofe \u2014 who at 80 years and 112 days is the fifth-oldest senator currently serving in Congress \u2014 said the Oklahoma Republican uses email \u201c on a regular basis and with an official Senate e-mail account . \u201d\nThe second-oldest senator , 81-year-old Sen. Chuck Grassley , was briefly a Twitter phenom for his off-the-cuff tweets . A spokeswoman for the Iowa Republican said he \u201c uses email quite a bit . He uses his own Senate email account for emailing with other senators and to communicate with his staff \u201d on everything from \u201c policy to scheduling and from meeting arrangements to media interviews . \u201d\nAt the other end of spectrum , the Senate \u2019 s likely most prolific user of technology , 45-year-old Sen. Cory Booker ( D-N.J. ) , said he couldn \u2019 t imagine working without email .\n\u201c Email habits ? Can you imagine what my habits on digital communications are ? I use Twitter , I use Instagram to communicate with constituents , I use Facebook to communicate with constituents . I do not use Snapchat and I \u2019 ve never used Tinder , \u201d Booker said .\nHe added , \u201c The best I can do on a really busy day is meet with a few hundred , maybe a few thousand constituents , but with one push of a button I can communicate with hundreds of thousands of my constituents through social media platforms . \u201d\nGraham set the chattering class atwitter over the weekend when he said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d that he hasn \u2019 t sent a single email in his life . Ever .\n\u201c You can have every email I \u2019 ve ever sent , \u201d he said in discussing the Hillary Clinton email controversy . \u201c I \u2019 ve never sent one. \u201d Graham \u2019 s office says his email avoidance isn \u2019 t a hindrance in the job . His staffers send him a text message if they need him urgently , and fellow senators can find him either on the Senate floor or via text .\n\u201c It \u201d s a system that works for him , \u201d a spokesman for the South Carolina Republican said . \u201c He has his cellphone with him at all times . It \u2019 s easier to get in touch with Sen. Graham than it is our legislative director , who has about 100 emails . \u201d\nBut Graham \u2019 s declaration is still surprising given his prominent position on the Senate Judiciary subcommittee that deals with privacy and , yes , technology , matters .
