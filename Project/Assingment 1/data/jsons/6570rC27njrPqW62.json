    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Monday said his administration is looking at ways to ease economic restrictions it stressed just days earlier even as the U.S. braces for a jump in coronavirus cases and states tighten restrictions on people and businesses .\n`` I 'm not looking at months , '' Trump said of the duration of social distancing guidelines that have led to school and business closures . `` We will be back in business as a country pretty soon . ''\nTrump \u2019 s suggestion comes as others are taking their most strict measures yet . On Monday , four U.S. states announced more rigid orders for residents and businesses , an International Olympic Committee member revealed this year 's games would be postponed and U.S. deaths approached 600 , according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard .\nThe federal government , Trump said , will use data `` to recommend new protocols \u201d to allow local economies to \u201c cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time . ''\nHe did not say when those protocols would be rolled out as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S .\nThe remarks were a major departure from Trump 's prediction just days ago that the guidelines could potentially be in place through the summer . Trump appeared to signal that parts of the country that are less hard hit could be placed under less strict guidelines than states like New York and California .\nAt the same time , Trump admitted the outbreak will only get worse in the U.S. Trump said he agreed with his surgeon general \u2019 s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump .\n\u201c This is going to be bad , \u201d Trump said . \u201c We \u2019 re trying to make it so it \u2019 s much , much less bad . \u201d\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday that first lady Melania Trump tested negative for coronavirus .\n`` She 's great , she 's fine , '' said Trump , hesitating slightly before answering a question about his wife 's test : `` Negative . ''\nBoth Trump and Vice President Mike Pence initially declined to be tested , noting that they did not have symptoms . But pressure grew for both officials amid reports that they had contact with others who tested positive . Pence 's office said last week that one of his aides tested positive for the virus .\nTrump said he got the test only after facing questions from reporters .\nPresident Donald Trump offered rare words of praise for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday .\nTrump , a frequent critic of the central bank and especially its chairman , said Powell has done a good job in trying to boost the economy during the coronavirus pandemic . Trump said he even called Powell on Monday .\n\u201c I called up Jerome Powell and said , Jerome , you \u2019 ve done a really good job , \u201d Trump told reporters . \u201c I was proud of him . \u201d\nJust a little more than a week ago , Trump complained that the central bank needed to be \u201c more proactive \u201d and argued it had not done enough to juice the economy . But his criticism has softened since the Fed cut short-term interest rates to zero on March 15 .\n\u201c That took courage , \u201d Trump said , adding that Powell did \u201c the right thing . \u201d\n\u201c He has really stepped up over the last week , \u201d Trump said .\nAsked if he has any regrets about how he has responded to the coronavirus pandemic , Trump said he had none . \u201c I think we \u2019 ve handled it really well , \u201d he said , adding that he looks forward , not backward .\nDr. Anthony Fauci , the nation \u2019 s highly respected infectious disease expert , did not attend Monday \u2019 s briefing on coronavirus at the White House \u2013 an absence that reporters noticed immediately .\nIt was particularly noteworthy because Fauci gave a remarkably candid interview to Science magazine , posted Sunday evening , in which he admitted being at odds with Trump over several issues .\nTrump said he had just been with Fauci and did not express any irritation with the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a good man . I like Dr. Fauci , \u201d Trump said . \u201c He \u2019 s not here because we weren \u2019 t discussing \u201d issues that he is best at addressing , the president said .\nAsked if Fauci agrees with him on the need to reopen the economy soon , Trump said `` he does n't not agree . ''\nBirx : If Paul followed guidelines , he would not have put other senators at risk\nDr. Deborah Birx , leader of the White House coronavirus task force , seemed to suggest Sen. Rand Paul , who has tested positive for COVID-19 , had not been adhering to the government \u2019 s social distancing guidelines .\n\u201c Each person has to be responsible in the way that they decrease their interaction with others , \u201d she said . Everyone needs to keep six feet apart and assume that \u201c everyone you \u2019 re interacting with could be positive , '' she added .\nHer remarks came in response to a question about contradictory messages : Birx and others have said that Americans should not get tested if they don \u2019 t have symptoms or exposure to the virus .\nBut Paul got tested even though he had no symptoms . In between taking the test and getting the results , Paul had lunch with other lawmakers and even went swimming in the Senate gym .\n\u201c If he had been following these guidelines , he would n't have been infecting others because of the social distancing , washing your hands , doing everything that we talked about , \u201d Birx .\nDr. Deborah Birx , a member of the White House coronavirus task force , said the U.S. is learning from China and South Korea .\n`` The two areas that have moved through their curve is China and South Korea . So those are the two countries that we \u2019 re learning from . Those were 8-10 week curves . Each state and each hot spot in the United States is going to be its own curve because the seed came in at different times . \u201d\nTrump declines to say whether he will ease social distancing measures\nPresident Donald Trump declined to say directly that he would ease social distancing measures in order to restart the economy next week , but suggested guidelines could be different based on how hard a state or location has been hit .\n\u201c You \u2019 ll see what happens , \u201d Trump said . `` It \u2019 s not going to be three or four months \u201d before life returns to normal , Trump said . \u201c Parts of our country are very lightly affected . \u201d\n\u201c At a certain point we have to get open , \u201d Trump said . \u201c We have to get moving . We don \u2019 t want to lose these companies\u2026We \u2019 ll be doing something relatively quickly . \u201d\nPresident Donald Trump said he agreed with the surgeon general \u2019 s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump .\nTrump said he agreed with the surgeon general \u2019 s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump .\n\u201c This is going to be bad , \u201d Trump said . \u201c We \u2019 re trying to make it so it \u2019 s much , much less bad . \u201d\nTrump said he agreed with public health officials that the death rate from the virus would be `` bad , '' but he also returned to comparing coronavirus to the seasonal flu .\n`` It \u2019 s going to be bad , '' Trump said . `` We have a lot of people dying from the flu . Certainly this is going to be bad . And we \u2019 re trying to make it so that it \u2019 s much , much less bad . ''\nVice President Mike Pence said \u201c self-collected swabs \u201d for the coronavirus would soon be available , so Americans can test themselves for infection .\n\u201c This will expedite the testing process , \u201d Pence said , and also \u201c reduce the risk to health care providers . \u201d\nHe said the tests would be available at clinics and drive-through testing sites , but did not say where or how soon .\nPence said the test is \u201c less invasive , '' collected at the end of the nasal passage . Trump and others have described the test as unpleasant because the swab goes so far up the nose .\nPence said 313,000 coronavirus tests have been completed in the U.S. A little more than 41,000 Americans have contracted the virus , he added .\nVice President Mike Pence said Facebook donated its reserve of over 700,000 masks , which they had because of wildfires in California .\n`` Health workers urgently need more protective gear , '' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Sunday . `` To help , Facebook donated our emergency reserve of 720,000 masks that we had bought in case the wildfires continued . We 're also working on sourcing millions of more to donate . I hope you 're all staying healthy and safe ! ''\nPresident Donald Trump abandoned the term `` Chinese virus '' in his opening remarks at a press conference about the coronavirus Monday , the first time he has done so in days .\nTrump , who has drawn criticism for echoing the term , generally uses it in his opening remarks . Instead , Trump echoed an earlier tweet suggesting that Asian Americans should be `` protected '' and not blamed for a virus that researchers believe began in China .\n`` The spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form , '' Trump said .\nTrump had frequently referred to coronavirus as the \u201c Chinese virus \u201d despite mounting criticism among Asian-American advocates , health experts and Democratic lawmakers who warn referring to the virus by a location-specific name stigmatizes ethnic groups .\nDr. Deborah Birx , a member of the White House coronavirus task force , said one child age 14 died of the virus in China , but no child under 15 has died of the virus in Europe .\n\u201c That should be reassuring to the moms and dads out there , \u201d she said .\nBirx also said the New York metro area of New Jersey , New York City and parts of Long Island have an attack rate close to one in 1,000 , which fives times what other areas are seeing .\nPresident Donald Trump said he signed an executive order to prohibit the hoarding medical equipment and supplies , including hand sanitizers and face masks .\nThe order designates certain medical supplies as `` scarce , '' he said , which makes it a crime to stockpile these items .\n`` We will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit , '' Trump said .\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department plans to identify cases in which hoarding may be interfering with efforts to address large medical supply shortages at hospitals across the country . Barr said the administration convened their first task force meeting to address issues of price gouging .\nHe added the Justice Department was not seeking out consumers or businesses stockpiling supplies for their own operations , but people hoarding on an industrial scale .\n\u201c If you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house this is not something you have to worry about , '' he said . But if you 're hoarding masks in a warehouse , `` then you 're going to get a knock on the door . ''\nTrump : new protocols being considered to allow local economies to 'cautiously resume '\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday the federal government will use data `` to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time . ''\nHe did not say when those protocols would be rolled out as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S .\n`` America will again , and soon , be open for business \u2013 a lot sooner than three or four months , which somebody was suggesting , '' he said .\nCoronavirus : Should Congress move immediately to remote voting ? Sen. Rand Paul \u2019 s coronavirus diagnosis adds to debate\nHe said once the medical community \u201c gives the OK , \u201d certain places will be free to end the social distancing practices and other restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the virus .\nTrump also encouraged Congress to pass a stimulus now being negotiated in the Senate .\n`` Now Congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the Senate bill as written , and avoid playing any more partisan games , '' he said .\nTrump said coronavirus started out as a medical problem , and the U.S. will not allow it to become a financial problem .\nTrump announced the postponement for the deadline for compliance with real ID requirements .\nTrump said the U.S. brought home 103 American citizens stranded in Brazil . Most of them were senior citizens .\nTrump said 148 countries are now affected by coronavirus . But , `` we will be back in business as a country pretty soon . ''\nPresident Donald Trump called for protecting the Asian American community on Monday amid criticism that by using the term \u201c Chinese virus \u201d to describe the coronavirus pandemic he has stigmatized Chinese Americans .\n\u201c It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States , and all around the world , \u201d Trump tweeted Monday minutes before a White House briefing on coronavirus . \u201c They are amazing people , and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way , shape , or form . They are working closely with us to get rid of it . WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER ! \u201d\nCoronavirus : Trump weighs easing of tough coronavirus guidelines amid growing alarm about economy\nTrump reiterated his call to protect the Asian American community at a Monday evening press conference .\nTrump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the \u201c Chinese virus \u201d despite mounting criticism among Asian-American advocates , health experts and Democratic lawmakers who warn referring to the virus by a location-specific name stigmatizes certain ethnic groups .\nThe World Health Organization has urged people to be careful with language used to describe COVID-19 , insisting that it not be referred to as the `` Chinese '' or `` Wuhan '' virus . Any mention of location could lead to discrimination or stigmatization , the group warns . Researchers say coronavirus originated in China and Trump has defended his use of the term as \u201c accurate . \u201d\n`` It 's not racist at all , no , '' Trump told reporters last week when pressed on the term . `` It comes from China . I want to be accurate . ''\nPoll : More Americans approve of governors ' response to coronavirus than Trump 's\nMore Americans say the country 's governors are handling the unfolding coronavirus crisis better than President Donald Trump , according to a Monmouth University poll released Monday .\nThe poll found 72 % of Americans said they approved of their state governor 's response to COVID-19 compared to 50 % who said Trump was doing a good job . Just 18 % disapproved of their state 's governor while 45 % said Trump was doing a bad job dealing with the outbreak .\nThe poll also fell along partisan lines , with 89 % of Republicans , 48 % of Independents and 19 % of Democrats approving of Trump 's handling of the virus . The governors ' praise appeared to be more bipartisan with 73 % of Republicans , 76 % of Democrats and 67 % of Independents who said their governor was doing a good job .\nThe poll was conducted between March 18th and 22nd with a margin of error of 3.4 % .\nHouse Democrats are proposing a financial rescue plan to help the nation recover from the coronavirus pandemic that , at $ 2.5 trillion , would dwarf the roughly $ 2 trillion package Republicans and the Trump administration have been touting .\nThe package , released Monday afternoon by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , would provide $ 1,500 to every individual , up to $ 7,500 for a family of five . The benefit \u201c would be available to anyone with an individual taxpayer identification number , as well as to our nation \u2019 s retirees and unemployed individuals , \u201d according to an outline obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nEliminate medical costs for all Americans , even those uninsured , for treatments and vaccines ( When one is developed ) relating to COVID-19 .\nProvide $ 150 billion to hospitals for costs related to fighting the disease .\nGive up to $ 600 to workers affected by COVID-19 and eligible for unemployment compensation benefits .\nCreate a $ 500 billion pool of grants and interest-free loans for small businesses .\nSupply nearly $ 60 billion for schools and universities to help them keep running .\nEnsure states can carry out 2020 elections with $ 4 billion in grant funding for states ,\nImposes a national requirement that states provide both 15 days of early voting and \u201c no-excuse \u201d absentee vote-by-mail .\nAlabama Rep. Mike Rogers , the top Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee , called the proposal \u201c left-wing nonsense . \u201d\n\u201c While Americans are trying to figure out how to keep their loved ones safe and pay this month \u2019 s rent , Speaker Pelosi is trying to use this outbreak to her political advantage , \u201d he said . \u201c The House Democrats \u2019 bill is just a wish list of everything they haven \u2019 t been able to accomplish . \u201d\nWASHINGTON \u2013 An effort in the Senate to move forward with a nearly $ 2 trillion economic stimulus package to combat the coronavirus crisis has stalled for the second day in a row over continued disagreements between Republicans and Democrats .\nThe largely party-line vote ( with Republican for and Democrats against ) was 49-46 to end debate and move forward . Sixty votes were needed to advance the measure for a final floor vote .\nThe measure is designed to provide direct payments to most Americans , throw a lifeline to small businesses shuttered across the country , and rescue large industries , such as the airlines , battered by the coronavirus crisis . But Democrats want more protections for workers from layoffs and loss of heath coverage , more money for states to deal with the crisis , and more aid for students facing student debt repayment .\nAfter the vote , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell angrily dismissed the Democratic opposition as \u201c procedural obstruction \u201d that could delay a vote on the measure until the end of the week .\n`` Democrats take responsibility for our workers who require that any corporation that takes taxpayer dollars must protect their workers wages and benefits , not CEO pay , stock buybacks or layoffs , '' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after the Senate vote . `` The Senate Republican bill put corporations first , but because of the insistence of leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats , progress has been made . ''\nThe State Department is tracking at least 13,500 Americans who are stranded abroad and need U.S. help getting back to the United States , a senior official told reporters on Monday .\nThe State Department has already brought about 5,000 Americans home from 17 countries , and officials are hoping to bring another 1,600 U.S. citizens back this week from countries across the globe .\n\u201c We \u2019 re looking at 16 or so flights in the next five days and about 1,600 passengers identified for those flights with room for more , \u201d said this official , who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity .\n\u201c It has been a lot of hard work and it is going to be a lot of hard work going forward , \u201d this person said . \u201c We are devoting all of our resources to this . \u201d\nThe State Department has set up a call center to help marooned Americans , but officials say the best way to get on the agency \u2019 s radar is to register online with the agency \u2019 s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program , called STEP .\n\u201c The only way to find someone is if they are registering with STEP . That \u2019 s how we build the manifests for these flights , '' the person said .\nThe call center phone number is 202-501-4444 for those overseas and 888-407-4747 for those calling within the U.S. on behalf of stranded family or friends .\nThe Pentagon plans to deploy field hospitals to New York and Seattle later this week to help those cities deal with the coronavirus pandemic , Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday .\nThe Army \u2019 s largest field hospitals can accommodate 248 beds , he said . More of the mobile facilities will be offered in coming weeks . Meanwhile , the U.S. Navy \u2019 s hospital ship , the Mercy , is set to sail to Los Angeles as soon as today . The USS Comfort , the Navy \u2019 s other hospital ship , is being repaired . It is scheduled to sail to New York in April .\nThe disease has forced the military to cancel some training exercises , and Esper acknowledged that the virus could affect the Pentagon \u2019 s readiness to conduct combat missions if it worsens . He said 133 troops were being treated for the illness .\nAt the Pentagon , about 60 % of the workforce has been telecommuting , Esper said . Security has tightened , he said , and screening of visitors for fever may begin soon .\nA day after announcing he became the first senator to contract coronavirus , Sen. Rand Paul urged his colleagues on Capitol Hill to get tested for COVID-19 as well .\n\u201c I believe we need more testing immediately , even among those without symptoms , \u201d the Kentucky Republican said in a statement shared with reporters . \u201c I had no symptoms and no specific encounter with a COVID-19 positive person . I had , however , traveled extensively in the U.S. and was required to continue doing so to vote in the Senate . That , together with the fact that I have a compromised lung , led me to seek testing . Despite my positive test result , I remain asymptomatic for COVID-19 . \u201d\nFederal guidelines discourage testing for those who are not showing symptoms even if they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive or is believed to have been exposed .\nWhat Congress is considering : Congress ' $ 2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package , visualized\n\u201c For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine , realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee , I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol , \u201d Paul said . \u201c The current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined . It was my extra precaution , out of concern for my damaged lung , that led me to get tested . \u201d\nPaul is one three members of Congress , including Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart , R-Fla. , and Ben McAdams , D-Utah who have announced they \u2019 ve tested positive .\nTensions rose on the Senate floor Monday as lawmakers struggled to reach an agreement on a historic bailout package while the health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus continued to escalate .\n\u201c Take a deep breath , \u201d Minority Whip Dick Durbin , D-Ill. , said as senators bickered over whose fault it is that there \u2019 s no deal yet . \u201c Everyone is emotional at this moment on both sides of the aisle . But we have a job to do . \u201d\nDurbin \u2019 s comments came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , went after his Democratic counterparts \u2013 particularly House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif .\nMcConnell blamed Pelosi for undermining negotiations , saying things were going fine until she got involved .\n\u201c Get with the program , \u201d McConnell said . \u201c It \u2019 s time to pass historic relief . The country doesn \u2019 t have time for these political games . \u201d\nDurbin said he knows Pelosi \u201c really unnerves a lot of people on that side of the aisle . '' But , he said Pelosi wanting to be part of negotiations `` is not an outrageous idea . \u201d\nAt one point , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , blocked a routine request to speak from Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine .\nSchumer said he objected to get clarity on the schedule as he continues to negotiate changes Democrats want to make to GOP package .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled on Monday a counter-offer to the GOP stimulus proposal that includes priorities congressional Democrats have been pushing for in round-the-clock negotiations with GOP leaders and the Trump administration .\nRequiring President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to order private companies to manufacture respirators , masks and other needed equipment .\nUsing nearly $ 40 billion to help states stabilize school funding and help colleges continue operating during the crisis .\nGiving states billions in grant funding to help hold elections , including expanding early , absentee and mail voting .\nSpeaking on a conference call with reporters , Pelosi said the bill Democrats would introduce this afternoon would be `` worker-oriented , not giving away the store '' to corporations .\nSpeaking on the Senate floor Monday , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , blamed Pelosi for undermining negotiations on a nearly $ 2 trillion package designed to provide direct payments to most Americans , throw a lifeline to small businesses , and rescue large industries , such as the airlines , battered by the coronavirus crisis .\n\u201c We were this close and then the speaker of the House flew back from San Francisco ( Sunday ) and turned this into this left-wing episode of Supermarket Sweep , \u201d he said , referring to the TV game show where contestants race through a grocery store grabbing items before time runs out . \u201c Unrelated issues left and right . ''\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer remained optimistic a deal would be reached Monday .\n\u201c We \u2019 re very close to reaching a deal . Very close . Our goal is to reach a deal today . And we \u2019 re hopeful , even confident , that we will meet that goal , \u201d said Schumer , D-N.Y . But , he added , \u201c We have the obligation to get the details right . \u201d\nRepublican governors in Maryland and Massachusetts on Monday ordered the closure of non-essential businesses , stopping short of shelter-in-place orders but taking the most drastic actions to date in both states .\nThe Maryland order goes into effect 5 p.m. EDT , while the Massachusetts order begins Tuesday at noon and extends to April 7 .\nMaryland Gov . Larry Hogan said he felt the measure was necessary because too many people were ignoring his order to avoid crowds of 10 or more , `` literally endangering the lives '' of others .\nThe executive orders in both states do not include industries deemed essential in guidelines issued last week by the federal government such as health care , food , agriculture , energy , first responders , transportation and public works . Liquor stores will also be exempt and restaurants can continue to serve to-go food .\n\u201c By taking this action now , we can significantly improve our position in this fight to slow down the spread of this virus , \u201d Massachusetts Gov . Charlie Baker said .\nBaker issued a stay-at-home advisory , which urges everyone to stay home and limit `` unnecessary activities , '' but he made clear he does n't believe ordering people to their homes is the right call .\nFauci and Trump : ' I ca n't jump in front of the microphone and push him down ' : Fauci addresses Trump coronavirus claims\nHe added : \u201c There \u2019 s been a lot of talk about a government mandating people shelter in their homes . I do not believe I can or should order U.S. citizens to be confined to their homes days on end . It doesn \u2019 t make sense from a public health point of view and it \u2019 s not realistic . \u201d\nIn Massachusetts , there have been 646 confirmed cases of the coronaries virus and five deaths . Maryland has 288 confirmed cases .\nIn Indiana , Gov . Eric Holcomb ordered his state 's residents to remain in their homes except for certain permitted activities , such as caring for others and ordering supplies .\nDozens of House lawmakers are calling on House leaders to adopt a temporary rule that allows remote voting by members during national emergencies , such as the current coronavirus crisis .\n\u201c My constituents need a voice in Congress right now , \u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell , D-Calif. , said after he and 66 other members asked the Rules Committee to make the change . \u201c It is critical that no matter how this crisis develops , I can continue to advocate for working families in my district\u2014no matter where I am physically . And every Member of Congress should be able to do the same . \u201d\nThe request to the Rules Committee , which is examining the issue , comes a day after Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul \u2019 s announcement that he tested positive for COVID-19 rattled the Senate . Nearly three dozen congressional lawmakers have announced steps to self-quarantine , or otherwise isolate themselves as a precaution .\nNorth Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer backed the change as well , tweeting that \u201c extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures . \u201d\nIllinois Sen. Dick Durbin implored his colleagues to move to remote voting during a speech on the Senate floor Monday , calling it \u201c na\u00efve for us to believe that that is the end of the challenge to our membership . \u201d\n\u201c We should not be physically present on this floor at this moment , \u201d said Durbin , the No . 2 Senate Democrat . \u201c Too many of our colleagues and their families are falling prey to this disease . \u201d\nNot long after he spoke , Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri could be seen wiping down the desk of the presiding officer after taking over floor duties as debate continued .\nPressure was building on Congress to break its logjam on a coronavirus rescue package .\nStocks slid again Monday despite the Federal Reserve \u2019 s decision to launch an expansion of lending programs to help the economy .\nA week after the U.S. markets posted their worst week since the financial crisis , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down as much as 500 points in the opening minutes of trading .\nThe Fed said it plans to purchase an unlimited amount of Treasurys and mortgage securities in a bid to support financial markets . It also said that it would purchase commercial mortgage-backed securities as part of an expansion in its asset purchases , known in the market as quantitative easing .\nRemote voting : Tradition-bound Congress considers voting remotely as coronavirus illnesses hit home\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got a lot of promise from the Fed , but they \u2019 re still going to need help from Congress , \u201d says Scott Colyer , chief executive at Advisors Asset Management . \u201c Does the Fed \u2019 s latest move solve our virus problem ? No . Does it solve our unemployment problem ? No . But it does allow markets to function . At the end of last week , we were sorely in need of that . \u201d\nOn anniversary of signing , Obama says ACA needed more than ever\nFormer President Barack Obama recognized the 10-year-anniversary of his signing of the Affordable Care Act Monday in a tweet about the significance of the landmark law to the current health care crisis .\n\u201c It \u2019 s still under attack right when we need care the most , \u201d Obama tweeted . \u201c We have to protect it , build on it , until we cover everyone . \u201d\nThe law expanding health insurance coverage and protections is once again in the courts , under a challenge brought by Republican attorneys general that is supported by the Trump administration .\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden , who famously described the law as a \u201c big ( expletive ) deal \u201d in a private comment that was picked up by a microphone at the bill signing ceremony , sent a letter to Trump and the lead GOP attorneys general Monday urging them to drop the lawsuit . Biden is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to take on Trump in the fall .\nTrump was asked Sunday at the daily White House briefing on the coronavirus whether he would reconsider his position because of the pandemic .\n\u201c What we want to do is get rid of the bad health care and put in a great health care , \u201d Trump said .\nThe administration has not put forward an alternative to ACA after Republicans in Congress were unable to pass their bill .\nThe U.S. Supreme Court , which has already upheld the law twice , will take up the latest suit in their next term . It \u2019 s likely to be scheduled for oral argument in the fall and a decision in 2021 .\nThe husband of Sen. Amy Klobuchar has been hospitalized with COVID-19 and pneumonia , the Minnesota Democrat and former presidential candidate announced Monday .\nKlobuchar said she is not getting tested for the virus , on the advice of her doctor , because she and her husband have not been together for the past two weeks and she is outside the 14-day period for getting sick .\n\u201c As everyone is aware , there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don \u2019 t qualify to get one under any standard , \u201d Klobuchar said in a statement .\nShe said her husband , John Bessler , professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law , immediately quarantined himself when he started to feel sick even though he thought it was just a cold .\nBut his high temperature and bad cough persisted . When he started coughing up blood , he got tested and was checked into a Virginia hospital because his blood showed low oxygen levels , among other concerns . Bessler is now receiving oxygen but is not on a ventilator , according to Klobuchar \u2019 s statement .\n\u201c I love my husband so very much and not being able to be there at the hospital by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease , \u201d Klobuchar said . She and their daughter , Abigail , have been \u201c constantly calling and texting and emailing . \u201d\nBessler is the first congressional spouse who is known to have COVID-19 .\nThree members of Congress \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , and Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart , R-Fla. , and Ben McAdams , D-Utah \u2013 have announced they \u2019 ve tested positive .\nThe Pentagon reported Monday that cases of coronavirus had nearly doubled to 243 troops , their family members and civilian employees .\nThat \u2019 s an increase of 119 patients since Friday when the number of cases totaled 124 .\nOn Sunday , the Navy announced that three special warfare sailors training in Washington state had tested positive for the disease . They join a Navy commando who was diagnosed with COVID-19 last month .\nOf the 243 COVID-19 cases , 133 are troops , seven of whom are hospitalized . Over the weekend , the Pentagon also reported its first death , that of a contract employee . So far , four troops and one civilian employee have recovered .\nPresident Donald Trump signaled in a tweet overnight that he is considering lifting social distancing guidelines that may be slowing the spread of the coronavirus but are hurting the economy .\n\u201c WE CAN NOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF , \u201d Trump posted on Twitter just before midnight in Washington . \u201c AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD , WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO ! \u201d\nMissed opportunity : The US had a chance to learn from anthrax , SARS , H1N1 and Ebola . So why is the federal coronavirus response so messy ?\nPublic health officials , including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , have recommended Americans work from home when they can and not congregate at restaurants or other businesses . The administration rolled out a 15-day plan on March 16 to \u201c bend the curve \u201d of new coronavirus cases .\nMany of those officials , including Surgeon General Jerome Adams , have said that two weeks is \u201c likely not enough time \u201d to halt the spread of the virus in the country .\n\u201c If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now , we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus , \u201d Trump said at the time . \u201c And we 're going to have a big celebration all together . \u201d\nTrump retweeted two users Monday morning who used similar language to urge that , at the end of 15 days , only \u201c high risk groups \u201d be isolated and that the rest of Americans go \u201c back to work . \u201d\nYet the restrictions are having a major impact on the economy . The Labor Department reported a 30 % increase in unemployment claims last week . James Bullard , president of the St. Louis branch of the Federal Reserve Bank , predicted the unemployment rate could hit 30 % in the U.S .\nSeveral states , including New York , California and Illinois , have imposed stricter social distancing requirements . Even if Trump eased the federal guidelines next week it would not affect orders signed by governors in those and other states .\nAnthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , has become the face of the White House 's scientific and medical response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak , frequently appearing alongside President Donald Trump during task force news conferences .\nBut he and the president have not always agreed on the facts surrounding the outbreak .\nRemote voting : Tradition-bound Congress considers voting remotely as coronavirus illnesses hit home\nFor example , after Trump played up a drug used to treat malaria as a potential `` game-changer '' in the fight against coronavirus , Fauci said the only evidence that the drug could be helpful was `` anecdotal . '' Fauci has also contradicted Trump on the timetable for a vaccine and the severity of the outbreak .\nIn an interview with Science magazine , Fauci said that he and Trump do n't disagree on substantive issues .\n`` Even though we disagree on some things , he listens . He goes his own way . He has his own style , '' Fauci said . `` But on substantive issues , he does listen to what I say . ''\nBut he said during news conferences , the president says things `` in a way that I would not express it , because it could lead to some misunderstanding about what the facts are about a given subject . ''\nWhen asked about Trump 's claim that China could have told the world about the coronavirus three or four months earlier , Fauci grew defensive .\n`` What do you want me to do ? I mean , seriously Jon , let \u2019 s get real , what do you want me to do ? '' he asked Science staff writer Jon Cohen .\nAs Congress negotiates over the stimulus package , here are the main sticking points :\nBoth sides want to give businesses a lifeline amid shutdowns that threaten to plunge the economy into a deep recession . Democrats want tough provisions to prevent corporations that receive federal bailouts from later engaging in stock buybacks that enrich their executives . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , said his bill already includes Democrats ' demands for conditions on loans and other aide to major businesses .\nDemocrats have called for provisions that would temporarily block evictions and foreclosures as families struggle with lost income . They also want additional funding for food stamps and an expansion of unemployment benefits .\nDemocrats and Republicans are also wrangling over how much money should go to hospitals and health providers to help them deal with the crisis .\nThe Senate will try again Monday to break its logjam over an emergency stimulus package intended to stem the damage from the coronavirus pandemic . Democrats , who are pushing for more restrictions on corporate bailouts , negotiated late into the night with the Trump administration on the details of the legislation .\nThe impasse in Congress weighed heavily on the battered stock market , which had its worst week since the financial crisis last week .\nOn Sunday evening , futures for the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 900 points while Standard & Poor \u2019 s 500 futures fell 5 % , triggering an automatic shock absorber .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , blasted Democrats Sunday for opposing the GOP-crafted coronavirus rescue package and said he hoped they would have a \u201c change of heart \u201d after the U.S. financial markets opened Monday morning . McConnell noted there were already signs of another bad day on Wall Street as Congress remained gridlocked over how to help laid-off workers and shuttered businesses .",
    "content_original": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Monday said his administration is looking at ways to ease economic restrictions it stressed just days earlier even as the U.S. braces for a jump in coronavirus cases and states tighten restrictions on people and businesses.\n\n\"I'm not looking at months,\" Trump said of the duration of social distancing guidelines that have led to school and business closures. \"We will be back in business as a country pretty soon.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s suggestion comes as others are taking their most strict measures yet. On Monday, four U.S. states announced more rigid orders for residents and businesses, an International Olympic Committee member revealed this year's games would be postponed and U.S. deaths approached 600, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.\n\nThe federal government, Trump said, will use data \"to recommend new protocols\u201d to allow local economies to \u201ccautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time.\"\n\nCoronavirus:Trump signals growing impatience with coronavirus-related economic shutdowns\n\nHe did not say when those protocols would be rolled out as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.\n\nThe remarks were a major departure from Trump's prediction just days ago that the guidelines could potentially be in place through the summer. Trump appeared to signal that parts of the country that are less hard hit could be placed under less strict guidelines than states like New York and California.\n\nAt the same time, Trump admitted the outbreak will only get worse in the U.S. Trump said he agreed with his surgeon general\u2019s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be bad,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it so it\u2019s much, much less bad.\u201d\n\n- John Fritze and Sean Rossman\n\nTrump: first lady Melania Trump tests negative for coronavirus\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday that first lady Melania Trump tested negative for coronavirus.\n\n\"She's great, she's fine,\" said Trump, hesitating slightly before answering a question about his wife's test: \"Negative.\"\n\nBoth Trump and Vice President Mike Pence initially declined to be tested, noting that they did not have symptoms. But pressure grew for both officials amid reports that they had contact with others who tested positive. Pence's office said last week that one of his aides tested positive for the virus.\n\nTrump said he got the test only after facing questions from reporters.\n\n- John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump offers rare praise for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\n\nPresident Donald Trump offered rare words of praise for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday.\n\nTrump, a frequent critic of the central bank and especially its chairman, said Powell has done a good job in trying to boost the economy during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump said he even called Powell on Monday.\n\n\u201cI called up Jerome Powell and said, Jerome, you\u2019ve done a really good job,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI was proud of him.\u201d\n\nJust a little more than a week ago, Trump complained that the central bank needed to be \u201cmore proactive\u201d and argued it had not done enough to juice the economy. But his criticism has softened since the Fed cut short-term interest rates to zero on March 15.\n\n\u201cThat took courage,\u201d Trump said, adding that Powell did \u201cthe right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has really stepped up over the last week,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAsked if he has any regrets about how he has responded to the coronavirus pandemic, Trump said he had none. \u201cI think we\u2019ve handled it really well,\u201d he said, adding that he looks forward, not backward.\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nWhere is Fauci?\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s highly respected infectious disease expert, did not attend Monday\u2019s briefing on coronavirus at the White House \u2013 an absence that reporters noticed immediately.\n\nIt was particularly noteworthy because Fauci gave a remarkably candid interview to Science magazine, posted Sunday evening, in which he admitted being at odds with Trump over several issues.\n\nTrump said he had just been with Fauci and did not express any irritation with the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good man. I like Dr. Fauci,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s not here because we weren\u2019t discussing\u201d issues that he is best at addressing, the president said.\n\nAsked if Fauci agrees with him on the need to reopen the economy soon, Trump said \"he doesn't not agree.\"\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nBirx: If Paul followed guidelines, he would not have put other senators at risk\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, leader of the White House coronavirus task force, seemed to suggest Sen. Rand Paul, who has tested positive for COVID-19, had not been adhering to the government\u2019s social distancing guidelines.\n\n\u201cEach person has to be responsible in the way that they decrease their interaction with others,\u201d she said. Everyone needs to keep six feet apart and assume that \u201ceveryone you\u2019re interacting with could be positive,\" she added.\n\nHer remarks came in response to a question about contradictory messages: Birx and others have said that Americans should not get tested if they don\u2019t have symptoms or exposure to the virus.\n\nBut Paul got tested even though he had no symptoms. In between taking the test and getting the results, Paul had lunch with other lawmakers and even went swimming in the Senate gym.\n\n\u201cIf he had been following these guidelines, he wouldn't have been infecting others because of the social distancing, washing your hands, doing everything that we talked about,\u201d Birx.\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nBirx: US learning from China South Korea\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said the U.S. is learning from China and South Korea.\n\n\"The two areas that have moved through their curve is China and South Korea. So those are the two countries that we\u2019re learning from. Those were 8-10 week curves. Each state and each hot spot in the United States is going to be its own curve because the seed came in at different times.\u201d\n\n- Jeanine Santucci\n\nTrump declines to say whether he will ease social distancing measures\n\nPresident Donald Trump declined to say directly that he would ease social distancing measures in order to restart the economy next week, but suggested guidelines could be different based on how hard a state or location has been hit.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said. \"It\u2019s not going to be three or four months\u201d before life returns to normal, Trump said. \u201cParts of our country are very lightly affected.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a certain point we have to get open,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to get moving. We don\u2019t want to lose these companies\u2026We\u2019ll be doing something relatively quickly.\u201d\n\n- John Fritze\n\nTrump agrees coronavirus cases will jump\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he agreed with the surgeon general\u2019s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump.\n\nTrump said he agreed with the surgeon general\u2019s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be bad,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it so it\u2019s much, much less bad.\u201d\n\nTrump said he agreed with public health officials that the death rate from the virus would be \"bad,\" but he also returned to comparing coronavirus to the seasonal flu.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be bad,\" Trump said. \"We have a lot of people dying from the flu. Certainly this is going to be bad. And we\u2019re trying to make it so that it\u2019s much, much less bad.\"\n\n- Michael Collins and John Fritze\n\nPence: 'self-collected swabs' for tests will soon be available\n\nVice President Mike Pence said \u201cself-collected swabs\u201d for the coronavirus would soon be available, so Americans can test themselves for infection.\n\n\u201cThis will expedite the testing process,\u201d Pence said, and also \u201creduce the risk to health care providers.\u201d\n\nHe said the tests would be available at clinics and drive-through testing sites, but did not say where or how soon.\n\nPence said the test is \u201cless invasive,\" collected at the end of the nasal passage. Trump and others have described the test as unpleasant because the swab goes so far up the nose.\n\nPence said 313,000 coronavirus tests have been completed in the U.S. A little more than 41,000 Americans have contracted the virus, he added.\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nPence: Facebook donated more than 700,000 masks\n\nVice President Mike Pence said Facebook donated its reserve of over 700,000 masks, which they had because of wildfires in California.\n\n\"Health workers urgently need more protective gear,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Sunday. \"To help, Facebook donated our emergency reserve of 720,000 masks that we had bought in case the wildfires continued. We're also working on sourcing millions of more to donate. I hope you're all staying healthy and safe!\"\n\n- Jeanine Santucci\n\nTrump abandons 'Chinese virus' in opening remarks\n\nPresident Donald Trump abandoned the term \"Chinese virus\" in his opening remarks at a press conference about the coronavirus Monday, the first time he has done so in days.\n\nTrump, who has drawn criticism for echoing the term, generally uses it in his opening remarks. Instead, Trump echoed an earlier tweet suggesting that Asian Americans should be \"protected\" and not blamed for a virus that researchers believe began in China.\n\n\"The spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump had frequently referred to coronavirus as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d despite mounting criticism among Asian-American advocates, health experts and Democratic lawmakers who warn referring to the virus by a location-specific name stigmatizes ethnic groups.\n\n- John Fritze\n\nBirx: no child under 15 has died in Europe\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said one child age 14 died of the virus in China, but no child under 15 has died of the virus in Europe.\n\n\u201cThat should be reassuring to the moms and dads out there,\u201d she said.\n\nBirx also said the New York metro area of New Jersey, New York City and parts of Long Island have an attack rate close to one in 1,000, which fives times what other areas are seeing.\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nTrump signs order prohibiting hoarding\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he signed an executive order to prohibit the hoarding medical equipment and supplies, including hand sanitizers and face masks.\n\nThe order designates certain medical supplies as \"scarce,\" he said, which makes it a crime to stockpile these items.\n\n\"We will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit,\" Trump said.\n\nBarr: Hoarders, expect 'a knock on the door'\n\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department plans to identify cases in which hoarding may be interfering with efforts to address large medical supply shortages at hospitals across the country. Barr said the administration convened their first task force meeting to address issues of price gouging.\n\nHe added the Justice Department was not seeking out consumers or businesses stockpiling supplies for their own operations, but people hoarding on an industrial scale.\n\n\u201cIf you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house this is not something you have to worry about,\" he said. But if you're hoarding masks in a warehouse, \"then you're going to get a knock on the door.\"\n\n- Courtney Subramanian and John Fritze\n\nTrump: new protocols being considered to allow local economies to 'cautiously resume'\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday the federal government will use data \"to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time.\"\n\nHe did not say when those protocols would be rolled out as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.\n\n\"America will again, and soon, be open for business \u2013 a lot sooner than three or four months, which somebody was suggesting,\" he said.\n\nCoronavirus:Should Congress move immediately to remote voting? Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis adds to debate\n\nHe said once the medical community \u201cgives the OK,\u201d certain places will be free to end the social distancing practices and other restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nTrump also encouraged Congress to pass a stimulus now being negotiated in the Senate.\n\n\"Now Congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the Senate bill as written, and avoid playing any more partisan games,\" he said.\n\nWhat else was said at the news conference:\n\nTrump said coronavirus started out as a medical problem, and the U.S. will not allow it to become a financial problem.\n\nTrump announced the postponement for the deadline for compliance with real ID requirements.\n\nTrump said the U.S. brought home 103 American citizens stranded in Brazil. Most of them were senior citizens.\n\nTrump said 148 countries are now affected by coronavirus. But, \"we will be back in business as a country pretty soon.\"\n\n- John Fritze and Michael Collins\n\nTrump: 'We totally protect our Asian American community'\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for protecting the Asian American community on Monday amid criticism that by using the term \u201cChinese virus\u201d to describe the coronavirus pandemic he has stigmatized Chinese Americans.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday minutes before a White House briefing on coronavirus. \u201cThey are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!\u201d\n\nCoronavirus:Trump weighs easing of tough coronavirus guidelines amid growing alarm about economy\n\nTrump reiterated his call to protect the Asian American community at a Monday evening press conference.\n\nTrump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d despite mounting criticism among Asian-American advocates, health experts and Democratic lawmakers who warn referring to the virus by a location-specific name stigmatizes certain ethnic groups.\n\nThe World Health Organization has urged people to be careful with language used to describe COVID-19, insisting that it not be referred to as the \"Chinese\" or \"Wuhan\" virus. Any mention of location could lead to discrimination or stigmatization, the group warns. Researchers say coronavirus originated in China and Trump has defended his use of the term as \u201caccurate.\u201d\n\n\"It's not racist at all, no,\" Trump told reporters last week when pressed on the term. \"It comes from China. I want to be accurate.\"\n\n- John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian\n\nPoll: More Americans approve of governors' response to coronavirus than Trump's\n\nMore Americans say the country's governors are handling the unfolding coronavirus crisis better than President Donald Trump, according to a Monmouth University poll released Monday.\n\nThe poll found 72% of Americans said they approved of their state governor's response to COVID-19 compared to 50% who said Trump was doing a good job. Just 18% disapproved of their state's governor while 45% said Trump was doing a bad job dealing with the outbreak.\n\nThe poll also fell along partisan lines, with 89% of Republicans, 48% of Independents and 19% of Democrats approving of Trump's handling of the virus. The governors' praise appeared to be more bipartisan with 73% of Republicans, 76% of Democrats and 67% of Independents who said their governor was doing a good job.\n\nThe poll was conducted between March 18th and 22nd with a margin of error of 3.4%.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nWhat's in the Democrats' stimulus counter-offer?\n\nHouse Democrats are proposing a financial rescue plan to help the nation recover from the coronavirus pandemic that, at $2.5 trillion, would dwarf the roughly $2 trillion package Republicans and the Trump administration have been touting.\n\nThe package, released Monday afternoon by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would provide $1,500 to every individual, up to $7,500 for a family of five. The benefit \u201cwould be available to anyone with an individual taxpayer identification number, as well as to our nation\u2019s retirees and unemployed individuals,\u201d according to an outline obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe plan also would:\n\nEliminate medical costs for all Americans, even those uninsured, for treatments and vaccines (When one is developed) relating to COVID-19.\n\nProvide $150 billion to hospitals for costs related to fighting the disease.\n\nGive up to $600 to workers affected by COVID-19 and eligible for unemployment compensation benefits.\n\nCreate a $500 billion pool of grants and interest-free loans for small businesses.\n\nSupply nearly $60 billion for schools and universities to help them keep running.\n\nEnsure states can carry out 2020 elections with $4 billion in grant funding for states,\n\nImposes a national requirement that states provide both 15 days of early voting and \u201cno-excuse\u201d absentee vote-by-mail.\n\nAlabama Rep. Mike Rogers, the top Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee, called the proposal \u201cleft-wing nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Americans are trying to figure out how to keep their loved ones safe and pay this month\u2019s rent, Speaker Pelosi is trying to use this outbreak to her political advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cThe House Democrats\u2019 bill is just a wish list of everything they haven\u2019t been able to accomplish.\u201d\n\n- Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu\n\nStimulus package stalls again in Senate\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 An effort in the Senate to move forward with a nearly $2 trillion economic stimulus package to combat the coronavirus crisis has stalled for the second day in a row over continued disagreements between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nThe largely party-line vote (with Republican for and Democrats against) was 49-46 to end debate and move forward. Sixty votes were needed to advance the measure for a final floor vote.\n\nThe measure is designed to provide direct payments to most Americans, throw a lifeline to small businesses shuttered across the country, and rescue large industries, such as the airlines, battered by the coronavirus crisis. But Democrats want more protections for workers from layoffs and loss of heath coverage, more money for states to deal with the crisis, and more aid for students facing student debt repayment.\n\nAfter the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell angrily dismissed the Democratic opposition as \u201cprocedural obstruction\u201d that could delay a vote on the measure until the end of the week.\n\n\"Democrats take responsibility for our workers who require that any corporation that takes taxpayer dollars must protect their workers wages and benefits, not CEO pay, stock buybacks or layoffs,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after the Senate vote. \"The Senate Republican bill put corporations first, but because of the insistence of leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats, progress has been made.\"\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nState Department tracking 13,000 Americans stranded abroad\n\nThe State Department is tracking at least 13,500 Americans who are stranded abroad and need U.S. help getting back to the United States, a senior official told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe State Department has already brought about 5,000 Americans home from 17 countries, and officials are hoping to bring another 1,600 U.S. citizens back this week from countries across the globe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at 16 or so flights in the next five days and about 1,600 passengers identified for those flights with room for more,\u201d said this official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cIt has been a lot of hard work and it is going to be a lot of hard work going forward,\u201d this person said. \u201cWe are devoting all of our resources to this.\u201d\n\nThe State Department has set up a call center to help marooned Americans, but officials say the best way to get on the agency\u2019s radar is to register online with the agency\u2019s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, called STEP.\n\n\u201cThe only way to find someone is if they are registering with STEP. That\u2019s how we build the manifests for these flights,\" the person said.\n\nThe call center phone number is 202-501-4444 for those overseas and 888-407-4747 for those calling within the U.S. on behalf of stranded family or friends.\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nPentagon to deploy field hospitals to New York, Seattle\n\nThe Pentagon plans to deploy field hospitals to New York and Seattle later this week to help those cities deal with the coronavirus pandemic, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday.\n\nThe Army\u2019s largest field hospitals can accommodate 248 beds, he said. More of the mobile facilities will be offered in coming weeks. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy\u2019s hospital ship, the Mercy, is set to sail to Los Angeles as soon as today. The USS Comfort, the Navy\u2019s other hospital ship, is being repaired. It is scheduled to sail to New York in April.\n\nThe disease has forced the military to cancel some training exercises, and Esper acknowledged that the virus could affect the Pentagon\u2019s readiness to conduct combat missions if it worsens. He said 133 troops were being treated for the illness.\n\nAt the Pentagon, about 60% of the workforce has been telecommuting, Esper said. Security has tightened, he said, and screening of visitors for fever may begin soon.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nRand Paul: people without symptoms need testing\n\nA day after announcing he became the first senator to contract coronavirus, Sen. Rand Paul urged his colleagues on Capitol Hill to get tested for COVID-19 as well.\n\n\u201cI believe we need more testing immediately, even among those without symptoms,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said in a statement shared with reporters. \u201cI had no symptoms and no specific encounter with a COVID-19 positive person. I had, however, traveled extensively in the U.S. and was required to continue doing so to vote in the Senate. That, together with the fact that I have a compromised lung, led me to seek testing. Despite my positive test result, I remain asymptomatic for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nFederal guidelines discourage testing for those who are not showing symptoms even if they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive or is believed to have been exposed.\n\nWhat Congress is considering:Congress' $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, visualized\n\n\u201cFor those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined. It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested.\u201d\n\nPaul is one three members of Congress, including Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah who have announced they\u2019ve tested positive.\n\n- Ledyard King\n\n'This is unbelievable': Senators get testy over stimulus delay\n\nTensions rose on the Senate floor Monday as lawmakers struggled to reach an agreement on a historic bailout package while the health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus continued to escalate.\n\n\u201cTake a deep breath,\u201d Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said as senators bickered over whose fault it is that there\u2019s no deal yet. \u201cEveryone is emotional at this moment on both sides of the aisle. But we have a job to do.\u201d\n\nDurbin\u2019s comments came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., went after his Democratic counterparts \u2013 particularly House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nMcConnell blamed Pelosi for undermining negotiations, saying things were going fine until she got involved.\n\n\u201cGet with the program,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass historic relief. The country doesn\u2019t have time for these political games.\u201d\n\nDurbin said he knows Pelosi \u201creally unnerves a lot of people on that side of the aisle.\" But, he said Pelosi wanting to be part of negotiations \"is not an outrageous idea.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blocked a routine request to speak from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.\n\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d\n\nSchumer said he objected to get clarity on the schedule as he continues to negotiate changes Democrats want to make to GOP package.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nPelosi unveils counter-offer to GOP stimulus bill\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled on Monday a counter-offer to the GOP stimulus proposal that includes priorities congressional Democrats have been pushing for in round-the-clock negotiations with GOP leaders and the Trump administration.\n\nIt includes:\n\nRequiring President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to order private companies to manufacture respirators, masks and other needed equipment.\n\nProviding more workers guaranteed paid family and medical leave.\n\nUsing nearly $40 billion to help states stabilize school funding and help colleges continue operating during the crisis.\n\nGiving states billions in grant funding to help hold elections, including expanding early, absentee and mail voting.\n\nSpeaking on a conference call with reporters, Pelosi said the bill Democrats would introduce this afternoon would be \"worker-oriented, not giving away the store\" to corporations.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blamed Pelosi for undermining negotiations on a nearly $2 trillion package designed to provide direct payments to most Americans, throw a lifeline to small businesses, and rescue large industries, such as the airlines, battered by the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cWe were this close and then the speaker of the House flew back from San Francisco (Sunday) and turned this into this left-wing episode of Supermarket Sweep,\u201d he said, referring to the TV game show where contestants race through a grocery store grabbing items before time runs out. \u201cUnrelated issues left and right.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer remained optimistic a deal would be reached Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very close to reaching a deal. Very close. Our goal is to reach a deal today. And we\u2019re hopeful, even confident, that we will meet that goal,\u201d said Schumer, D-N.Y. But, he added, \u201cWe have the obligation to get the details right.\u201d\n\n- Ledyard King and Maureen Groppe\n\nMaryland, Massachusetts, Indiana tighten coronavirus measures\n\nRepublican governors in Maryland and Massachusetts on Monday ordered the closure of non-essential businesses, stopping short of shelter-in-place orders but taking the most drastic actions to date in both states.\n\nThe Maryland order goes into effect 5 p.m. EDT, while the Massachusetts order begins Tuesday at noon and extends to April 7.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he felt the measure was necessary because too many people were ignoring his order to avoid crowds of 10 or more, \"literally endangering the lives\" of others.\n\nThe executive orders in both states do not include industries deemed essential in guidelines issued last week by the federal government such as health care, food, agriculture, energy, first responders, transportation and public works. Liquor stores will also be exempt and restaurants can continue to serve to-go food.\n\n\u201cBy taking this action now, we can significantly improve our position in this fight to slow down the spread of this virus,\u201d Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said.\n\nBaker issued a stay-at-home advisory, which urges everyone to stay home and limit \"unnecessary activities,\" but he made clear he doesn't believe ordering people to their homes is the right call.\n\nFauci and Trump:'I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down': Fauci addresses Trump coronavirus claims\n\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about a government mandating people shelter in their homes. I do not believe I can or should order U.S. citizens to be confined to their homes days on end. It doesn\u2019t make sense from a public health point of view and it\u2019s not realistic.\u201d\n\nIn Massachusetts, there have been 646 confirmed cases of the coronaries virus and five deaths. Maryland has 288 confirmed cases.\n\nIn Indiana, Gov. Eric Holcomb ordered his state's residents to remain in their homes except for certain permitted activities, such as caring for others and ordering supplies.\n\n- William Cummings and Joey Garrison\n\n67 House members call for remote voting\n\nDozens of House lawmakers are calling on House leaders to adopt a temporary rule that allows remote voting by members during national emergencies, such as the current coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cMy constituents need a voice in Congress right now,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said after he and 66 other members asked the Rules Committee to make the change. \u201cIt is critical that no matter how this crisis develops, I can continue to advocate for working families in my district\u2014no matter where I am physically. And every Member of Congress should be able to do the same.\u201d\n\nThe request to the Rules Committee, which is examining the issue, comes a day after Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s announcement that he tested positive for COVID-19 rattled the Senate. Nearly three dozen congressional lawmakers have announced steps to self-quarantine, or otherwise isolate themselves as a precaution.\n\nNorth Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer backed the change as well, tweeting that \u201cextraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.\u201d\n\nIllinois Sen. Dick Durbin implored his colleagues to move to remote voting during a speech on the Senate floor Monday, calling it \u201cna\u00efve for us to believe that that is the end of the challenge to our membership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should not be physically present on this floor at this moment,\u201d said Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. \u201cToo many of our colleagues and their families are falling prey to this disease.\u201d\n\nNot long after he spoke, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri could be seen wiping down the desk of the presiding officer after taking over floor duties as debate continued.\n\n- Ledyard King and Maureen Groppe\n\nFed says it will purchase securities to support markets\n\nPressure was building on Congress to break its logjam on a coronavirus rescue package.\n\nStocks slid again Monday despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to launch an expansion of lending programs to help the economy.\n\nA week after the U.S. markets posted their worst week since the financial crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down as much as 500 points in the opening minutes of trading.\n\nThe Fed said it plans to purchase an unlimited amount of Treasurys and mortgage securities in a bid to support financial markets. It also said that it would purchase commercial mortgage-backed securities as part of an expansion in its asset purchases, known in the market as quantitative easing.\n\nRemote voting:Tradition-bound Congress considers voting remotely as coronavirus illnesses hit home\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of promise from the Fed, but they\u2019re still going to need help from Congress,\u201d says Scott Colyer, chief executive at Advisors Asset Management. \u201cDoes the Fed\u2019s latest move solve our virus problem? No. Does it solve our unemployment problem? No. But it does allow markets to function. At the end of last week, we were sorely in need of that.\u201d\n\n- Jessica Menton and Ledyard King\n\nOn anniversary of signing, Obama says ACA needed more than ever\n\nFormer President Barack Obama recognized the 10-year-anniversary of his signing of the Affordable Care Act Monday in a tweet about the significance of the landmark law to the current health care crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still under attack right when we need care the most,\u201d Obama tweeted. \u201cWe have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone.\u201d\n\nThe law expanding health insurance coverage and protections is once again in the courts, under a challenge brought by Republican attorneys general that is supported by the Trump administration.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who famously described the law as a \u201cbig (expletive) deal\u201d in a private comment that was picked up by a microphone at the bill signing ceremony, sent a letter to Trump and the lead GOP attorneys general Monday urging them to drop the lawsuit. Biden is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to take on Trump in the fall.\n\nTrump was asked Sunday at the daily White House briefing on the coronavirus whether he would reconsider his position because of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is get rid of the bad health care and put in a great health care,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe administration has not put forward an alternative to ACA after Republicans in Congress were unable to pass their bill.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, which has already upheld the law twice, will take up the latest suit in their next term. It\u2019s likely to be scheduled for oral argument in the fall and a decision in 2021.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s husband hospitalized with COVID-19\n\nThe husband of Sen. Amy Klobuchar has been hospitalized with COVID-19 and pneumonia, the Minnesota Democrat and former presidential candidate announced Monday.\n\nKlobuchar said she is not getting tested for the virus, on the advice of her doctor, because she and her husband have not been together for the past two weeks and she is outside the 14-day period for getting sick.\n\n\u201cAs everyone is aware, there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don\u2019t qualify to get one under any standard,\u201d Klobuchar said in a statement.\n\nShe said her husband, John Bessler, professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, immediately quarantined himself when he started to feel sick even though he thought it was just a cold.\n\nBut his high temperature and bad cough persisted. When he started coughing up blood, he got tested and was checked into a Virginia hospital because his blood showed low oxygen levels, among other concerns. Bessler is now receiving oxygen but is not on a ventilator, according to Klobuchar\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cI love my husband so very much and not being able to be there at the hospital by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease,\u201d Klobuchar said. She and their daughter, Abigail, have been \u201cconstantly calling and texting and emailing.\u201d\n\nBessler is the first congressional spouse who is known to have COVID-19.\n\nThree members of Congress \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah \u2013 have announced they\u2019ve tested positive.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nPentagon: COVID-19 cases nearly double over weekend\n\nThe Pentagon reported Monday that cases of coronavirus had nearly doubled to 243 troops, their family members and civilian employees.\n\nThat\u2019s an increase of 119 patients since Friday when the number of cases totaled 124.\n\nOn Sunday, the Navy announced that three special warfare sailors training in Washington state had tested positive for the disease. They join a Navy commando who was diagnosed with COVID-19 last month.\n\nOf the 243 COVID-19 cases, 133 are troops, seven of whom are hospitalized. Over the weekend, the Pentagon also reported its first death, that of a contract employee. So far, four troops and one civilian employee have recovered.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nTrump signals he may lift federal coronavirus guidelines\n\nPresident Donald Trump signaled in a tweet overnight that he is considering lifting social distancing guidelines that may be slowing the spread of the coronavirus but are hurting the economy.\n\n\u201cWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,\u201d Trump posted on Twitter just before midnight in Washington. \u201cAT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!\u201d\n\nMissed opportunity:The US had a chance to learn from anthrax, SARS, H1N1 and Ebola. So why is the federal coronavirus response so messy?\n\nPublic health officials, including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have recommended Americans work from home when they can and not congregate at restaurants or other businesses. The administration rolled out a 15-day plan on March 16 to \u201cbend the curve\u201d of new coronavirus cases.\n\nMany of those officials, including Surgeon General Jerome Adams, have said that two weeks is \u201clikely not enough time\u201d to halt the spread of the virus in the country.\n\n\u201cIf everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cAnd we're going to have a big celebration all together.\u201d\n\nTrump retweeted two users Monday morning who used similar language to urge that, at the end of 15 days, only \u201chigh risk groups\u201d be isolated and that the rest of Americans go \u201cback to work.\u201d\n\nYet the restrictions are having a major impact on the economy. The Labor Department reported a 30% increase in unemployment claims last week. James Bullard, president of the St. Louis branch of the Federal Reserve Bank, predicted the unemployment rate could hit 30% in the U.S.\n\nSeveral states, including New York, California and Illinois, have imposed stricter social distancing requirements. Even if Trump eased the federal guidelines next week it would not affect orders signed by governors in those and other states.\n\n\u2013 John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nFauci addresses Trump's coronavirus claims\n\nAnthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become the face of the White House's scientific and medical response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, frequently appearing alongside President Donald Trump during task force news conferences.\n\nBut he and the president have not always agreed on the facts surrounding the outbreak.\n\nRemote voting:Tradition-bound Congress considers voting remotely as coronavirus illnesses hit home\n\nFor example, after Trump played up a drug used to treat malaria as a potential \"game-changer\" in the fight against coronavirus, Fauci said the only evidence that the drug could be helpful was \"anecdotal.\" Fauci has also contradicted Trump on the timetable for a vaccine and the severity of the outbreak.\n\nIn an interview with Science magazine, Fauci said that he and Trump don't disagree on substantive issues.\n\n\"Even though we disagree on some things, he listens. He goes his own way. He has his own style,\" Fauci said. \"But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.\"\n\nBut he said during news conferences, the president says things \"in a way that I would not express it, because it could lead to some misunderstanding about what the facts are about a given subject.\"\n\nWhen asked about Trump's claim that China could have told the world about the coronavirus three or four months earlier, Fauci grew defensive.\n\n\"What do you want me to do? I mean, seriously Jon, let\u2019s get real, what do you want me to do?\" he asked Science staff writer Jon Cohen.\n\n\u2013 William Cummings\n\nWhy can't Congress agree?\n\nAs Congress negotiates over the stimulus package, here are the main sticking points:\n\nBoth sides want to give businesses a lifeline amid shutdowns that threaten to plunge the economy into a deep recession. Democrats want tough provisions to prevent corporations that receive federal bailouts from later engaging in stock buybacks that enrich their executives. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said his bill already includes Democrats' demands for conditions on loans and other aide to major businesses.\n\nDemocrats have called for provisions that would temporarily block evictions and foreclosures as families struggle with lost income. They also want additional funding for food stamps and an expansion of unemployment benefits.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are also wrangling over how much money should go to hospitals and health providers to help them deal with the crisis.\n\n\u2013 Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nSenate to convene at noon EDT\n\nThe Senate will try again Monday to break its logjam over an emergency stimulus package intended to stem the damage from the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats, who are pushing for more restrictions on corporate bailouts, negotiated late into the night with the Trump administration on the details of the legislation.\n\nSenators are planning to reconvene at noon.\n\nThe impasse in Congress weighed heavily on the battered stock market, which had its worst week since the financial crisis last week.\n\nOn Sunday evening, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 900 points while Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 futures fell 5%, triggering an automatic shock absorber.\n\nThe Senate is expected to convene at noon EDT.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blasted Democrats Sunday for opposing the GOP-crafted coronavirus rescue package and said he hoped they would have a \u201cchange of heart\u201d after the U.S. financial markets opened Monday morning. McConnell noted there were already signs of another bad day on Wall Street as Congress remained gridlocked over how to help laid-off workers and shuttered businesses.\n\n\u2013 Caren Bohan, Ledyard King, Jessica Menton",
