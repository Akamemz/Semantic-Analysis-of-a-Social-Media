Its offices in Jackson , the state capitol , and Washington D.C. were put on the case .\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has been doing that kind of work for decades . It was the FBI , under pressure from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , that sent scores of agents to Philadelphia , Mississippi in June of 1964 to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers : Michael Schwerner , Andrew Goodman and James Chaney , who had themselves been investigating the firebombing of a black church that was to serve as a \u201c freedom school , \u201d in preparation for registering black Mississippians to vote . When the three men were found dead\u2014lynched and discarded in an earthen dam\u2014it was FBI agents who made the discovery , acting on an informant \u2019 s tip .\nThe FBI has had its dark days , too . It was the federal law enforcement agency , under director J. Edgar Hoover , that tried to harass Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. literally to death ; and that infiltrated , sabotaged and set up members of the civil rights movement , anti-war movement , the Black Panthers , and more ; from COINTELPRO to infiltrating and spying on groups opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq . The most recent target of massive surveillance by the FBI : protest movements organized under the broad banner of Black Lives Matter , which collectively are aimed at reforming policing , to reduce often fatal violence against unarmed black civilians .\nAmericans have , at various times , leaned on the FBI for a measure of justice that local and state police couldn \u2019 t be counted on to deliver , and recoiled in fear at their exercise of raw federal power . That uneasy trust ; the combination of need and dread , is the lot that FBI agents live with day to day .\nThe events of the past two weeks have made it all but impossible to have much faith in the FBI now . The agency has , through the actions of a minority cell of unknown size , been severely tainted , potentially dragging down the reputations of even the finest agents in its ranks .\nAfter all , how can we trust the nation \u2019 s foremost federal law enforcement agency now that it has become clear that a faction of its agents used a conspiracy theory-hawking political book to launch a partisan probe into a presidential candidate ?\nThat unprecedented prospect : that federal law enforcement could take it upon themselves to try and swing a national election using allegations gleaned from a partisan hatchet job financially linked to the target \u2019 s political opponent , is Third World stuff .
