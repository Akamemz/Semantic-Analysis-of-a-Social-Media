Instead , the 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals panel punted on the constitutional claim , deciding the program was simply not authorized by federal law .\nOne of the big reasons it is hard to discern congressional intent in this case , the court wrote , is that the bulk collection program has been shrouded in secrecy . So it can not `` reasonably be said '' that Congress OK 'd `` a program of which many members of Congress \u2014 and all members of the public \u2014 were not aware . ''\nThe court concludes that it has no qualms about taking this step because if Congress wants to `` authorize such a far\u2010reaching and unprecedented program , it has every opportunity to do so , and to do so unambiguously . ''\nAccording to The New York Times , this is `` the first time a higher-level court in the regular judicial system has reviewed the program , which since 2006 has repeatedly been approved in secret by a national security court .
