Trump , whose tweets this week went after the Freedom Caucus , has the potential to weaken the group , a key source of obstruction in Congress since 2010 , and that could appeal to Democrats .\nA crafty Trump could do this while continuing to move forward with his very aggressive deregulatory agenda , combined with a Reaganesque supply side tax cut , that keeps Republicans as a whole happy with having him in the White House .
