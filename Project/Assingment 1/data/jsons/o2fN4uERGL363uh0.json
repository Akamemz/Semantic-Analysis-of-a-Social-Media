The claim was even repeated by Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail .

The respondents were not selected in a manner to ensure a representative sample ; those who responded may have been more likely to perceive problems than those who did not .

Despite SPLC \u2019 s rhetoric about the \u201c tremendous response \u201d to their survey , the 10,000 responses they received represents less than one-third of one percent of all teachers . Responses to the survey were solicited through left-leaning publications and organizations like Teaching Tolerance and the American Federation of Teachers , a major teachers union that was one of the first unions in the country to endorse Hillary Clinton for president .
