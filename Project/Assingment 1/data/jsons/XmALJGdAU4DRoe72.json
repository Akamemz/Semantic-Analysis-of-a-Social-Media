    "content": "The issue arose most recently during the Nevada debate , when Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that everyone onstage besides her and Sen. Amy Klobuchar had taken money from super PACs , which can take in and spend money for candidates with fewer restrictions than a campaign . Her statement cast shade on Sanders , and seemed to raise questions whether the political spending is at odds with the Vermont senator \u2019 s rejection of money in politics . Warren didn \u2019 t mention names , but Pete Buttigieg tweeted about the \u201c nine dark money groups \u201d that make up a coalition called People Power for Bernie and include Our Revolution , the youth-led climate group Sunrise Movement , and a super PAC affiliated with the National Nurses union . Our Revolution in particular has received scrutiny because it is a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) , which allows it to accept large donations without disclosing its donors , unlike super PACs .\nRival presidential candidates have been attacking Sen.

Last year , the average individual contribution to Our Revolution was $ 17.73 , with 99.99 percent of its donations coming in under $ 5,000 , according to the group .\nThe six big contributions totaled $ 78,289.53 last year , or roughly 4 percent of its revenue .

When asked to identify the six donors , Paco Fabian , a spokesperson for Our Revolution , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that a few donors , not wanting to be solicited by other groups , didn \u2019 t want the size of their contributions to be listed .
