The deal with enemy forces in Afghanistan is a continuation of Obama \u2019 s effort to get all U.S. forces out of Afghanistan within two years . This is part of a new , more limited foreign policy approach that Team Obama refers to as \u201c Don \u2019 t do stupid sh * t. \u201d But some people think this sh * t is pretty stupid . The move is highly controversial , even aside from the legal questions of Obama again circumventing Congress . Former comrades of the freed American believe that he deserted the Army amid a difficult forward deployment , adding additional danger to their mission as they were dispatched to search for him . The soldier \u2019 s father further complicated things with his remarks with the president in the Rose Garden Saturday , in which he praised Allah and spoke Pashto , the language of the Taliban . So what does the person most likely to succeed Obama as president think about all of this ?\n[ WSJ provides details about the prisoners from Guantanamo Bay who were released , while Reuters reports that Afghan officials have said the freed Islamist militants will definitely go back to the fight . ]\nPrivileged conversations - Democratic 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton is campaigning today in Colorado , a swing state where she is struggling with voters . ( The Clinton campaign commitment to Colorado will also extend to a three-day Denver event at the end of this month paid for by the corporate backers of her family \u2019 s foundation and featuring big names like NBC News \u2019 David Gregory . ) The Denver Post reports that today \u2019 s events will include stops to tout worker training programs at a plastics factory , meetings with local power brokers and a big speech in suburban Broomfield . Clinton scrubbed an event hosted by a chemical industry trade group amid protests from liberals about the group \u2019 s involvement in fracking , but she will still be spending a lot of time today campaigning in a key state . Will reporters find a way to press her on her view of the Taliban prisoner deal ? Or the unraveling of Libya ? Or new global warming regulations from the Obama Administration ? Or fracking ? Or anything ? The big speech tonight is being co-sponsored by The Denver Post , so perhaps its reporters could find a way to get substantive answers . But one suspects that the Clinton strategy of using the trappings of celebrity to insulate the candidate from normal scrutiny will continue to be in force .\n[ Pro-GOP group America Rising is releasing \u201c Failed Choices \u201d to rebut the claims Hillary makes in her forthcoming book \u201c Hard Choices . \u201d ]\nWarren not denying a possible bid to block Clinton \u2019 s path - Sen.

Obama will also have trade negotiations with the leaders of other countries with large economies and pay his respects Friday at Normandy , France for the 70th anniversary of the Allied invasion of occupied Europe .\nPresident Obama is set to announce new global warming regulations on power plants today that would cut allowable emissions of carbon dioxide by nearly a third in the years to come . If the rules go fully into effect , the use of coal , which produces more than 40 percent of the nation \u2019 s electricity , would be severely limited . The expected replacement , natural gas , is likely to prove more expensive for consumers and is far less labor intensive , meaning higher costs and fewer jobs . While the move is exciting many in the president \u2019 s political base and helping to polish Obama \u2019 s legacy as a foe of carbon emissions , the consequences will be harsh for several of his fellow Democrats , especially those in red states and those with high energy costs already . But for one Democratic Senate hopeful , Obama \u2019 s decision to crack down on coal may burn away any hope of a victory .\nKentucky woman - Previously , President Obama argued that his environmental policies did not constitute a \u201c war on coal , \u201d but the new emissions targets out today make it clear that not only is Obama at war with the coal industry , but that \u2019 s he \u2019 s winning . That \u2019 s very bad news for Alison Lundergan Grimes , the Kentucky secretary of state who was once favored to defeat incumbent Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell . Coal is important to Kentucky \u2019 s economy and has an even more important role in the state \u2019 s identity . Plus , the counties outside of Louisville traditionally most hospitable to Democrats are the coal-producing counties of Eastern Kentucky . The transparency of this move against coal makes Grimes \u2019 argument that she can be a better advocate for the industry as a Democrat moot .\nRNC offers greatest hits from Obama \u2019 s coal war - The Republican National Committee released a web video highlighting Democrats \u2019 war on coal . \u201c Against Coal , Against Jobs \u201d features clips of President Obama saying , \u201c If they want to build coal-fired plant they can it \u2019 s just that it will bankrupt them , \u201d and Senate Majority leader Harry Reid \u2019 s \u201c coal makes us sick , \u201d contrasted with West Virginia Senate GOP candidate Shelley Moore Capito \u2019 s , R-W. Va. , and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2019 s calls for an all of the above policy that includes coal .\nBut Tom Steyer will be pleased - WaPo : \u201c The regulations\u2026 will shine a spotlight on a growing division within the Democratic Party : On one side are major donors , who take a particular interest in environmental causes and are becoming increasingly important to the party . On the other are the candidates whose fates will decide control of the Senate and who hail from energy-producing states , where regulations on coal-fired power plants could have the most detrimental effects . \u201d\nIf you can afford it , that is . Coffee prices have skyrocketed in recent months thanks to a double whammy of a drought in Brazil coupled with the spread of a destructive fungus that afflicts coffee plants in Central America . As AP reports , some Central American farmers have seen their yields fall 95 percent as the fungus , known as \u201c coffee rust \u201d ravages their crops . We know that coffee and its cultivation have shaped world events for a long time , but what will the consequences be of this latest shortage ? National Geographic suggests that the unmatched American devotion to coffee may override the growing movement away from genetically modified agricultural products . But even if that works , the lengthy timeframe for such a fix may have permanently changed the economy of coffee .
