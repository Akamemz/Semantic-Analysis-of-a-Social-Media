    "content": "At least the man is consistent . From failed jobs programs to major speeches , he 's always inclined to go green . The Republican National Committee has produced a new video comparing Obama 's acceptance speech in Charlotte to the rhetoric he employed on the campaign trail in 2008 . Similarities abound :\nI understand why they wanted to limit the clip to under a minute , but I 'm confident the RNC had much more material to work with -- especially if they 'd cast a wider net to include the president 's tired bromides of the last four years . As I wrote last week , there was virtually zero new material in Obama 's remarks . Despite an underwhelming speech on Thursday and a convention marred by damaging economic news and procedural embarrassments , Obama 's enjoying a polling bounce . I suspect much of it is attributable to effective prime time speeches delivered by the First Lady and former President Clinton . At the moment , both Gallup and Rasmussen show Obama with a five-point national lead . ( Democratic pollster PPP indicates Obama holds a similar edge in Ohio .. assuming record Democrat turnout ) . Prior to the conventions , Rasmussen 's daily tracker put Obama ahead by two , and Gallup 's showed a one-point Romney lead , so Obama 's bounce is somewhere in the four-point range . Romney saw increased favorability after Tampa but did n't see much of a head-to-head poll jump . More people watched the DNC than the RNC in the key primetime hour . It remains to be seen if and when Obama 's meh speech and the August jobs report will drag his numbers back down -- plus , pollsters have yet to measure the effects of Romney 's new ad onslaught . In an attempt to quell concerns about tracking polls , the Romney campaign has issued a memo from its top internal polling guru . Bottom line ? The fundamentals of the economy and the race have n't changed ( via the campaign ) :\nDo n't get too worked up about the latest polling . While some voters will feel a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions , the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly . The reality of the Obama economy will reassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the Obama Presidency , and Mitt Romney will win this race . The Obama Economy : The stakes are very high in this election , and voters understand the future of our country is on the line . This may be lost on those living within the hyper-political world in and around the Beltway , but it is not lost in communities in battleground states . In short , the Romney-Ryan campaign understands Americans struggling in the Obama economy will determine the outcome of the race , and once the preponderance of information about the President \u2019 s failed policies \u2013 combined with Mitt Romney \u2019 s vision to strengthen the middle class \u2013 are communicated , our nation will move in a different direction . All Signs Point to a Tight Race : Those watching the daily tracking polls know that , while the President has seen a bounce from his convention , his approval has already begun to slip , indicating it is likely to recede further . In eight states , Pollster.com \u2019 s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts the margin between the two candidates at less than three points , virtually guaranteeing a tight race . Next , the battlefield has actually expanded , not contracted . Note that Wisconsin is now in play and our campaign is now up with ads in that state , while the latest poll numbers from the Albuquerque Journal in New Mexico show the race closing there . And this tightening is not an anomaly . Consider the traditional Democratic strongholds of New Jersey and Connecticut , won by President Obama in 2008 by margins of 15 points and 22 points , respectively . In both states , Pollster.com \u2019 s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts Obama \u2019 s lead at only seven points in each of these states . In North Carolina , fresh off of hosting the Democratic National Convention , the Obama campaign is laying the groundwork for a stealth withdrawal . In a state the President won by a mere 14,000 votes in 2008 , all one has to do is look at the Obama campaign \u2019 s television buy in the state to understand how they view their chances there . The Obama campaign \u2019 s North Carolina television buy has dropped 35 % compared to June , and they have run more than twice as much advertising over the past two weeks in Rochester , Minnesota ( hitting a small slice of Iowa ) , than they have in any North Carolina market . Historical Data : Political campaign historians will recall President Jimmy Carter led Ronald Reagan by a near double digit margin late in the fall in 1980 . In that race , the voters made their decision based on the key issues confronting the nation and it determined the outcome . On the economy , the most important issue of this race , Mitt Romney leads by 51 % -45 % , according to the most recent CNN/ORC poll . Targeted Campaign : The Romney-Ryan campaign is running deeply local and targeted efforts in each of the states focusing on the voter groups that will make the difference on Election Day . Anyone asserting a \u201c one-size-fits-all-campaign \u201d effort is being put forward is simply misinformed , as evidenced by the 15 different ads released by the Romney Ryan campaign this past Friday and now running in nine states , including Wisconsin . New Money Advantage : All of this is not possible without resources , and the Romney-Ryan campaign and the Republican Party have a real advantage . In August alone , the Romney Victory effort raised more than $ 111 million , marking the third straight fundraising month of more than $ 100 million , putting us on a very strong financial footing for the final two months . Energy and Enthusiasm : CNN/ORC \u2019 s most recent polling shows that 62 % of Republicans are \u201c extremely \u201d or \u201c very \u201d excited about this election , while only 56 % of Democrats report being \u201c extremely \u201d or \u201c very \u201d excited . This Republican enthusiasm advantage has manifested itself in an unprecedented and historic grassroots effort that will have a significant impact on turnout in battleground states on Election Day . For instance , as of today , Victory volunteers have already knocked on more doors than during the entire 2008 campaign . ( 2.72 million in 2012 through September 8 compared to 2.43 million overall in 2008 . ) Romney 's Ground Game : During last weekend \u2019 s \u201c Super Saturday , \u201d we crossed the 20 million volunteer voter contact threshold . Also , the Romney campaign knocked on more doors last week than in any week during the 2008 campaign . More than 55,000 volunteers have knocked doors or made phone calls for Victory this year and that number is growing by the week . And volunteers have collected person-to-person identification information on nearly 1.7 million swing voters in battleground states thus far . And the numbers are even more startling when one looks at individual states . For instance , in Ohio alone , five times more phone calls and 28 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008 . This past Saturday , more than 100,000 doors were knocked on by Victory volunteers in the Buckeye State . And in Wisconsin , five times more phone calls and 72 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008 . And the list goes on and on .\nThat 's all well and good , but the real question is whether the new polls actually reflect a temportary `` sugar high , '' or whether as more people tune into the race , they 're more inclined to just stick with the guy they view as more likeable . Niall Ferguson , an Obama critic , believes the president is leading the race , suggesting `` it 's the economy , stupid '' might not win the day in 2012 :\nThe economy isn \u2019 t the No . 1 issue , despite what people say . The more I watch of this election , the more I incline toward this last explanation . True , when asked to rank issues , voters mostly put the economy at the top of the list . And yet when asked to make a choice between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney , their choices don \u2019 t seem to be economically based . Many people subscribe to the view that Romney just isn \u2019 t likable . They can more readily imagine having a beer or shooting hoops with Obama .\nThis could be the ultimate dynamic of the 2012 election : Do voters see it as a policy choice between disparate economic visions for the country , or as a high school popularity contest ?

The first presidential debate is schedule for October 3rd in Denver . It will be interesting to see whether Romney makes up any ground between now and early October , or if he 'll need to rely on dominant debate performances to shake things up .
