    "content": "Last week , a Georgia state judge dismissed a lawsuit filed against talk-show host Dr. Oz over claims made on his show last year that much of the olive oil sold in U.S. grocery stores is fraudulent . The suit alleged that Oz wrongly disparaged the corrupt olive oil industry .\nThe lawsuit was brought against Oz by an industry trade group , the New Jersey-based North American Olive Oil Association ( NAOOA ) , under Georgia 's so-called veggie libel law . It 's one of about a dozen states with these awful laws\u2014which allow a party to sue for damages if a person allegedly disparages their agricultural products\u2014on the books .\nOz won in court thanks to Georgia 's anti-SLAPP law . Such laws gives people who speak out on issues of public concern a useful tool to counter lawsuits that seek to intimidate them into silence . ( `` SLAPP '' is an acronym that stands for `` strategic lawsuit against public participation . '' )\nSeveral domestic olive oil brands had also been sued alongside Oz .\nFraud in the olive oil business is , in fact , a longstanding problem . A 1917 Missouri court case , Lo Buono v. V. Viviano & Bros Macaroni Mfg . Co. , centered on fraudulent olive oil , as did a 1950 federal case involving another producer . In the past decade , The New Yorker has dedicated at least two lengthy pieces to the issue of fraudulent olive oil . And Congress recently held hearings on the issue .\nThe fictional Corleone crime family in Mario Puzo 's The Godfather used its olive oil business , Genco , as a cover for its criminal activities . That depiction of mafia involvement in the olive oil trade is n't far from the truth in some cases . Facing U.S. tax fraud charges in 1951 , mafia boss and drug trafficker Francisco Paolo Coppola claimed to earn much of his income as an olive oil producer .\nHow does such fraud play out ? An olive oil might be misbranded , claiming to be of higher quality than it really is\u2014from an earlier pressing , for example\u2014or to be from one country but hail from another . Or it might be adulterated , containing\u2014for example\u2014a mix of olive oil and other less expensive food oils .\nIn fact , the NAOOA , which represents many foreign olive oil producers , whose products make up the bulk of the olive oil sold in the United States , is itself keen to identify and prevent such fraud in the industry . A 2015 report issued by the group , for example , raises `` significant questions '' about the quality of California olive oils tested by NAOOA .\nListen , I think Oz is a quack . Forbes writer Kavin Senapathy , whose writings expose quackery around food , was probably right when she called Oz 's olive oil segment as `` yet another gag in his lineup of shady antics .
