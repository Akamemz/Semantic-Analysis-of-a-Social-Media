Finish it for our children . ''\nHe said negotiators had resolved all but two issues -- teacher evaluations and provisions dealing with jobs for laid-off teachers .\nHowever , Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis said teachers had no choice but to strike , despite `` intense but productive '' bargaining sessions .\nThe primary disagreement appears to be teacher job security in the wake of a new program that evaluates teachers based on students ' standardized test scores . Chicago Teachers Union board member Jay Rehak called the idea `` data-driven madness . ''\nAs many as 6,000 teachers could lose their jobs under the evaluation system , according to Lewis , who called the system `` unacceptable . '' The mayor 's office , the city of Chicago , and school officials have questioned that job loss figure .\n`` This is no way to measure the effectiveness of an educator , '' Lewis said Sunday . `` Further , there are too many factors beyond our control which impact how well some students perform on standardized tests such as poverty , exposure to violence , homelessness , hunger and other social issues beyond our control . ''\nAnother sticking point is a `` recall '' policy that would put laid-off teachers in line for job openings at other schools within the district . Emanuel said such a policy , supported by the union , would take hiring decisions away from school principals and put them in the hands of central administrators and union leaders .\n`` Direction and dictation should not come out of downtown , '' the mayor said .\nTeachers also want to block changes to their health benefits and win concessions on classroom conditions .\nPay is also an issue . However , the union said the two sides are close to a pay agreement after school officials offered to increase salaries 16 % over four years on average for most teachers . The average teacher salary in Chicago was $ 74,839 for the 2011-2012 school year , according to the district .\nIn addition to the pay raise , the school system 's offer includes paid maternity leave and short-term disability coverage . It would also freeze health care cost increases for two-thirds of the union 's membership .\nThe high school day would also be shortened slightly , and teachers would be limited to teaching five classes , the district said .\nThe district 's existing proposal would cost $ 400 million over four years , according to school board President David Vitale .\nChicago schools ca n't afford more concessions , Vitale said . `` We have no more flexibility when it comes to finance , '' he told CNN on Monday .\nAt a midday news conference , Emanuel called the plan on the table an `` honest compromise that respects our teachers , does right by our kids and is fair to our taxpayers . ''\nUnion officials have said they are puzzled by the stance of Emanuel , the city 's Democratic mayor , whom they accused of going back on promises to teachers , police officers and other civil servants , according to Rehak , the union board member .\n`` He has definitely been a huge disappointment , '' Rehak said . `` He has disrespected virtually every middle-class person in this city .
