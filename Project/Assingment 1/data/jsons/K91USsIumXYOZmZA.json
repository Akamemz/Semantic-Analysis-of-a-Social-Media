We are well equipped to meet it . And we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement , good intelligence and in concert with our values . ''\nThat 's meaningless ! Do we have `` dumb '' law enforcement now ? Bad intelligence ? What will Clinton do about it ? She does n't say . Reporters do n't ask .\nWhen Trump was asked how he 'll handle terrorism , he replied , `` I am very unhappy when I look at the world of radical Islam . I 'm very unhappy with it .
