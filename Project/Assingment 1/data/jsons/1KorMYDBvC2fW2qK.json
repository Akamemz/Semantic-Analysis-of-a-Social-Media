Ted\u2019s choice\n\nCruz has decided to shelve his Mr. Nice Guy routine with Trump. After a week of Trump suggesting Cruz has an eligibility problem because he was born in Canada to an American mother, the senator has hit back \u2014 hard. \u201cDonald comes from New York,\u201d Cruz said Tuesday, \u201cand he embodies New York values.\"\n\nIf Trump comes after Cruz in Charleston, many expect Cruz to strike back in no uncertain terms.

Marco\u2019s fight\n\nTeam Rubio is bracing for an avalanche of attacks. In recent days, Cruz has gone after him on immigration and Jeb Bush has hammered him over his Senate attendance \u2014 attacks that could play out onstage.\n\nBut the hardest hits could well come from Chris Christie, who has drawn a bead on Rubio \u2014 going so far as to say in a radio interview last week that Hillary Clinton would \u201cpat him on the head and then cut his heart out\u201d if he were the GOP nominee.\n\nBoth candidates are making a serious play in New Hampshire, and Christie \u2014 whose path to the nomination depends on a strong showing in the state \u2014 wants to ensure that Rubio doesn\u2019t finish ahead of him there.\n\nThose close to Rubio say he\u2019s preparing a counteroffensive. The senator has been hard at work on debate prep, tucking away for a practice session while on the trail in Iowa last week. He also held a Tuesday afternoon session at his Capitol Hill headquarters, a source close to the campaign said. Rubio has been relying on a small group of advisers to help him prepare, with strategist Todd Harris guiding the effort.\n\nThe debate\u2019s format plays to Rubio\u2019s strengths. Fox Business is allowing candidates to give 90-second answers, a boost from the 60 seconds it granted in its November debate. That means Rubio, a rhetorically talented candidate who likes to give detailed answers, will have more time to talk \u2014 or, as the case may be, defend himself.\n\nSome Rubio supporters say that, after remaining above the fray for much of the campaign, they\u2019re eager to see the senator show a more assertive side. With less than three weeks until the Iowa caucuses, and with Rubio yet to hold a lead in any early primary state, the pressure is on.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to elevate himself,\u201d said Barry Bennett, Ben Carson\u2019s former campaign manager. \u201cThe whole concept that someone can wait for six weeks and then turn it on, that\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d\n\n3. Bush vs. Trump\n\nIf Bush is going down, he\u2019s going down swinging. The former Florida governor, who remains stuck in the middle of the pack, targeted Trump aggressively during the last debate and hasn\u2019t let up since. During one campaign stop last month, the mild-mannered former governor called the bomb-throwing real estate mogul a \u201cjerk.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than any other candidate, Jeb has to show he can successfully attack Trump to convince voters that he\u2019s both ready to be president, and that Trump is not,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\n\nThe stakes are high for Bush, who, like most establishment contenders, is pinning his hopes on the New Hampshire primary. Accompanying Bush on the trail in Iowa on Tuesday was Jon Kraushar, the longtime GOP debate coach and image consultant who has been advising the former governor. During one campaign stop. Kraushar was seen conferring with Bush staffers Michael Steel and Trent Wisecup, who have also been working on debate prep.\n\nWhile Bush\u2019s team is eager to frame the race as a showdown between the former governor and the real estate mogul, some Bush supporters aren\u2019t convinced that going after Trump is the best route. Since he began his anti-Trump offensive last month, they point out, the former governor hasn\u2019t seen a substantial uptick in his polling numbers.\n\n4. Action movie or college seminar?\n\nFox Business\u2019s November debate was a wonkfest \u2014 a policy-packed two-hour program full of questions about economic matters and foreign affairs.\n\nThose who\u2019ve spoken with the network about its plans say they\u2019re expecting much the same this time around. (One campaign adviser joked that reporters might even be bored.) If that\u2019s the case, it could be bad news for Trump or Carson, who are usually less at ease when it comes to delving into policy specifics.\n\nYet others point out that, with the first primaries nearing, the campaign has taken on a different tone in recent days. Attacks, both on the trail and on the TV airwaves, have grown noticeably sharper since the start of the year.

Four-car pileup\n\nEstablishment candidates have so far been stymied in their efforts to slow down the Trump-Cruz train \u2014 in no small part because they\u2019ve been busy fighting amongst themselves.\n\nThat dynamic is almost certain to play out again on Thursday night. With Bush, Christie, Rubio, and John Kasich all competing aggressively in New Hampshire \u2014 and all within striking distance of one another \u2014 there\u2019s simply little incentive for them to play nice.\n\n\u201cThat group of people that are bunched up need to separate themselves,\u201d Wiley said.\n\nAs the establishment race in New Hampshire has narrowed, the skirmishing has permeated the campaign. In recent days, Ray Washburne, Christie\u2019s national finance chair, has been calling around to major Republican donors in Ohio, Kasich\u2019s home turf, in hopes of bringing them aboard.\n\nIf the establishment-on-establishment violence becomes the focus of the debate, some are convinced that Trump will escape unscathed.\n\n\u201cThe problem with any of the candidates attacking each other is that it lets Trump have a pass when they need to be engaging him directly with little time left before the voting begins,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\n\nShane Goldmacher and Eli Stokols contributed to this report.",
