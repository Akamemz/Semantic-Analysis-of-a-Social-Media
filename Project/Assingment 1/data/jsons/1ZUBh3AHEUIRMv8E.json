Arguably , the party hasn \u2019 t even reached a conclusion yet this cycle . But this doesn \u2019 t mean we can \u2019 t look for clues as to where party elites might be leaning . There are , of course , endorsements from party leaders , and as I \u2019 ve written about for \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the preferences of early-state activists to consider , but there \u2019 s another metric we haven \u2019 t looked at yet \u2014 donors who contribute to both candidates and party committees .\nThese donors are different than , say , the army of small donors who have fueled Sen.

I then grouped donations made to the candidates based on the following criteria :\nFirst , to establish a baseline , I looked at the share of all donors who gave to a candidate in 2019 .
