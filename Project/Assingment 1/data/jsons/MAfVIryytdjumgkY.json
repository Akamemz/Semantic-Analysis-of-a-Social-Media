I guess it \u2019 s now \u201c patriotic \u201d to want to impinge on the constitutional rights of fellow Americans . She doesn \u2019 t explain why .\nShe also warbles about how gun rights come with \u201c responsibilities , \u201d using some version of that term eight times . Except the point of a \u201c right \u201d is that it isn \u2019 t contingent upon fulfilling \u201c responsibilities. \u201d It is a foundational element of our social contract and is not subject to infringement by leftists simply because they cloak their oppression with focus group-erriffic labels like \u201c responsibilities . \u201d\nIf you misuse a gun , the judicial system deals with you afterwards .
