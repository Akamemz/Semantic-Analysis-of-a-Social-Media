But Spicer made the first mention of the use of barrel bombs \u2013 crude munitions that can cause indiscriminate casualties .\nPressed on whether chemical warfare as opposed to conventional warfare constitutes a red line , he replied : \u201c I think the president \u2019 s been very clear that there were a number of lines crossed last week ... The answer is if you gas a baby , if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people , I think you will see a response from this president . That is unacceptable . \u201d\nThe White House said later that Spicer was referring to barrel bombs carrying industrial chemicals like chlorine . But that would still represent a substantial expansion of the US rules of engagement in Syria . The regime is suspected of using chlorine gas in its attacks on dozens of occasions since 2013 .\nTillerson made his remarks during a visit to the site of a 1944 Nazi massacre in Italy , but they clearly referred to the Trump administration \u2019 s decision on Thursday to launch missile strikes against a Syrian airbase from which the US said a regime chemical attack had been launched against civilians in a rebel-held town .\nTillerson is in Italy for a G7 foreign ministers \u2019 meeting dominated by discussion of western policy towards Damascus and Moscow . The UK foreign secretary , Boris Johnson , who cancelled his own planned visit to Moscow on Monday , said the ministers would be \u201c discussing the possibility of further sanctions certainly on some of the Syrian military figures and indeed on some of the Russian military figures who have been involved in coordinating the Syrian military effort \u201d .\nThe ministers met again early on Tuesday Morning before Tillerson flies on to Moscow . According to one G7 source , Tillerson plans to offer the Putin regime a bald choice , between cutting Bashar al-Assad loose and being rewarded with a thaw in relations with the west ; or continuing to back him , and risking a Libyan-style outcome . The Libyan leader , Muammar Gaddafi , was violently deposed and killed in 2011 by rebels lent air support by Nato powers , including the UK .\nWhitehall sources say Britain has been instrumental in helping to persuade the US to support the idea that Assad \u2013 and his family \u2013 must be removed from power before progress can be made . Johnson is pushing for the strongest possible conclusion , including the threat of targeted sanctions against Syrian and Russian military commanders \u2013 a proposal he judges more likely to win support than wider economic penalties against Moscow .\nThe decision to approve the missile strike on the Shayrat Syrian air force base marked a sharp change in direction for Donald Trump , who had furiously opposed any such intervention by the Obama administration , and had pledged an \u201c America first \u201d foreign policy that would focus on counter-terrorism and narrowly defined US national interests .\nTrump emphasised the child victims of the poison gas in justifying the launch of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles aimed at infrastructure at the Shayrat base , Spicer \u2019 s comments suggested the president \u2019 s concern for Syrian children extended to victims of conventional bombing too . Over half a million people have been killed in the six years of the Syrian war . Tillerson \u2019 s comments suggested that the administration was even open to humanitarian intervention elsewhere .\nSpeaking to journalists at the site of the 1944 massacre in the Tuscan village of Sant \u2019 Anna , the secretary of state said : \u201c We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world . \u201d\nThe remarks appeared to conflict with Tillerson \u2019 s own comments on Sunday in which he claimed the administration \u2019 s priority in Syria had not changed ; it remained the defeat of Isis , and only after that could Syria \u2019 s political stability be considered . On the same today , the US envoy to the UN , Nikki Haley , said \u201c getting Assad out \u201d was one of \u201c multiple priorities \u201d held by the administration .\nMike Dubke , Trump \u2019 s communications director , conceded at a meeting of White House staffers last Tuesday before the missile strike that the president lacked a coherent foreign policy and said that \u201c there is no Trump doctrine \u201d , according to an account of the meeting by Politico .\n\u201c It \u2019 s head-spinning , \u201d said Philip Gordon , a special assistant to the president on the Middle East in the Obama administration . \u201c They went from vehement opposition to any kind of military intervention to executing those strikes and saying that \u2019 s what we would be doing any time chemical weapons are used .\n\u201c This is on a whole new level , if Tillerson is really saying we would defend the innocent anywhere in the world , \u201d Gordon added . \u201c If that \u2019 s the new standard , we are going to be doing a lot of intervening . \u201d\nRussia has denied the Syrian regime carried out the Khan Sheikhun chemical attack , which killed more than 80 people ( including in strikes on hospitals after the attacks ) , and has denounced the US missile strike as illegal .
