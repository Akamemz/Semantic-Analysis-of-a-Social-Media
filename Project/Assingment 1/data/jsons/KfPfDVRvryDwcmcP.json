Reagan, like many other presidents and politicians, lauded the country for its \u201cAmerican exceptionalism,\u201d the set of beliefs that the country\u2019s history, values and politics make it distinct and worthy of respect and leadership on the world stage.\n\nBut amid dueling crises \u2014 the coronavirus pandemic and the racial reckoning \u2014 belief in American exceptionalism has been deeply shaken.

And months into the crisis, Americans marched for racial justice as the protests against the police killings of Black Americans became what may be the largest protest movement in the history of the country.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nThe U.S. coronavirus response and the racial reckoning have brought into question where America stands on the world stage. Most agree \u2014 and polls show \u2014 that the U.S.\u2019s response to the pandemic has negatively affected its global reputation.\n\nSome believe this is the end of American exceptionalism.
