    "content": "During a recent interview with NPR , President Obama was asked if Donald Trump was right : has political correctness gone too far ?\n`` This is a tricky issue , '' Obama answered . `` Because the definition of political correctness is all over the map . I suspect the president-elect 's definition would be different than mine . ''\nThe president then offered two definitions of political correctness : the first is simply having good manners . It 's wrong to shout racial epithets at people , or to verbally harass them . Objecting to abusive treatment is n't an example of political-correctness-run-amok\u2014or if it is , then political correctness is a good thing . Most people probably want to live in a country where people are encouraged not to scream obscenities at each other .\nThe second definition of political correctness , according to Obama , is `` hypersensitivity that ends up resulting in people not being able to express their opinions at all without someone suggesting they 're a victim . ''\nMy advice to progressives like myself , and advice I give my daughters who are about to head off to college is do n't go around just looking for insults . You 're tough . If someone says something you do n't agree with , engage them on their ideas , but you do n't have to feel that somehow because you 're a black woman , you 're being assaulted . But speak up for yourself .\nThe president went on to point out that when it comes to political correctness , conservatives are hypocrites .

I call it `` patriotic correctness . '' It 's a full-throated , un-nuanced , uncompromising defense of American nationalism , history and cherry-picked ideals . Central to its thesis is the belief that nothing in America ca n't be fixed by more patriotism enforced by public shaming , boycotts and policies to cut out foreign and non-American influences . Insufficient displays of patriotism among the patriotically correct can result in exclusion from public life and ruined careers . It also restricts honest criticism of failed public policies , diverting blame for things like the war in Iraq to those Americans who did n't support the war effort enough .\nIt 's important to point out double standards . Nowrasteh and Obama are right : conservatives play the victim card , too . That 's one big \u2588\u2588\u2588 that I doubt Trump will follow through on his campaign promise to destroy political correctness .
