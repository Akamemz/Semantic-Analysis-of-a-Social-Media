    "content": "Orman is putting his business record front and center in his campaign . Orman 's wealth gives GOP fodder\nOLATHE , Kan. \u2014 Greg Orman wanted to turn the capital of shrimp cocktails into a shrimp-producing powerhouse .\nA few years ago , the businessman-turned-independent Kansas Senate candidate had become a director of Ganix Biotechnologies . With the help of $ 2.5 million in federal loan guarantees and $ 128,000 in state tax breaks , he and fellow investors pledged to build a $ 5 million- $ 6 million organic shrimp farm smack dab in the Nevada desert .\n\u201c We consume more shrimp per capita in Las Vegas than anywhere else in the world \u2014 22 million pounds of it annually , \u201d Orman told Las Vegas \u2019 KLAS-TV in 2011 .\nThe venture collapsed within a year . Ganix defaulted on a $ 725,000 bank loan , and a Kansas bank foreclosed on the shrimp farm property , according to public documents . The project had been pegged to create 30 jobs and eventually pump millions into the coffers of financially struggling North Las Vegas , according to news reports at the time .\nThe sudden frontrunner against GOP Sen. Pat Roberts in the most competitive Senate race no one saw coming , Orman is putting his business record front and center in his campaign . The 45-year-old Princeton graduate tells voters he knows what it takes to create jobs and that he \u2019 d bring much-needed business savvy to Washington .\nAnd there \u2019 s no question about this : Orman has become spectacularly wealthy over the course of a two-decade-plus career that includes investments in ventures as far flung as energy-efficient lighting , spinal surgery screws and an obscure Jeff Goldblum film . Any successful investor is bound to have some failures , but Orman appears to have more wins than losses , creating several successful companies along the way .\nBut triumph in the business world , as Mitt Romney learned , doesn \u2019 t necessarily translate into success on the campaign trail . And Republicans are seizing on the less-flattering aspects of his business past to bring Orman \u2019 s campaign back to earth . In addition to his well-publicized business and personal relationship with a person convicted of securities fraud , Orman has ties to companies that took advantage of offshore or low-tax havens and was once sued by a woman who alleged that Orman threatened to wipe out her children \u2019 s college fund if he wasn \u2019 t included in a deal , records show .\nThe outcome of the race may well turn on which portrayal of Orman \u2019 s background prevails : the non-ideological entrepreneur or the shady investor who won \u2019 t level with voters about where he stands on issues .\nGoing after a candidate \u2019 s business record is an unusual turn for Republicans , considering they \u2019 re typically the ones fending off rich-guy attacks . But it \u2019 s the hand they \u2019 ve been dealt and they are playing it .\n\u201c Greg Orman \u2019 s offshore tax havens , business partnerships with a convicted Wall Street banker and ties to liberal Democrats raise serious questions , \u201d said Corry Bliss , campaign manager for Roberts .\nSaid Orman campaign manager Jim Jonas : \u201c We \u2019 re happy to compare Greg \u2019 s successful record as a businessman creating jobs with Sen. Roberts \u2019 failed record as a Washington politician any day . \u201d\nOrman \u2019 s emergence also puts Democrats in the peculiar position of at least tacitly backing the candidate of the 1 percent . Not that there \u2019 s another alternative .\nAsked if Orman \u2019 s past business dealings might turn off Democrats , the party \u2019 s state chairwoman , Joan Wagnon , said : \u201c Where would they go ? \u201d\nShe predicted the GOP attacks \u201c won \u2019 t work on Republicans because Republicans are not offended by rich people . \u201d\nOrman , who has avoided saying which party he \u2019 d caucus with in an evenly split Senate , declined to be interviewed for this story . At a coffee shop in Topeka , Kansas last week , he was asked if he thought his wealth would be an asset or liability for his campaign .\n\u201c You know , I haven \u2019 t thought of it , \u201d he told reporters .\nOrman has amassed a personal fortune of at least $ 21.5 million , according to his financial disclosure documents \u2014 and likely much more because assets and liabilities are reported in broad ranges . He would be the fifth-wealthiest senator , based on a 2012 ranking by the Center for Responsive Politics .\nFresh out of Princeton in 1991 , Orman joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and wasted little time methodically building a diverse array of business interests . He created Environmental Lighting Concepts in 1992 , growing the firm to $ 10 million in annual revenue then selling it to Kansas City Power & Light in 1996 . He created a successful Minnesota commercial real estate firm , FRM Associates , in which he now holds between $ 5 million and $ 25 million in assets .\nSince 2004 , Orman has worked at his private equity firm , Denali Partners , investing in small and mid-sized firms . In 2012 , Orman purchased a Kansas boxing equipment company , Combat Brands , saying he helped \u201c save the brand \u201d and protect 50 jobs . ( He owns between $ 1 million to $ 5 million in the company . ) Orman is now named as a defendant in a $ 30 million lawsuit with a rival company , Everlast , which the campaign dismisses as frivolous .\nAll told , Orman reports holding assets and positions in 43 companies . At least 17 are incorporated in Nevada , two are in Delaware and one in the Cayman Islands ; all three locales give corporations preferable tax treatments .
