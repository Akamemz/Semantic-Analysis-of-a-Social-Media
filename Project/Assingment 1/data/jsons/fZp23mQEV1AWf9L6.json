Obama is exploring the chances of forging a middle path that blends new taxes and modest curbs to government benefit programs .\nThe sharp contrast over the 2014 budget and beyond came as the House cleared away last year 's unfinished budget business -- a sweeping , government-wide funding bill to keep Cabinet agencies running through the 2013 budget year , which ends Sept. 30 .\nThe House passed the bipartisan 2013 measure by a sweeping 318-109 vote .

The measure proposes shifting programs like Medicaid to the states but is sometimes scant on details about the very cuts it promises .\nThe Ryan measure revives a controversial plan to turn the Medicare programs for the elderly into a voucher-like system -- for future beneficiaries born in 1959 or later -- a program in which the government would subsidize the purchase of health insurance instead of directly paying hospital and doctor bills . Critics say the idea would mean ever-spiraling out-of-pocket costs for care , but Ryan insists the plan would inject competition into a broken system .\nThe cuts to domestic agencies like the FBI , Border Patrol and National Institutes of Health could approach 20 percent when compared with levels agreed to as part of a hard-fought budget deal from the summer of 2011 .
