    "content": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics is out today with its estimate of how many jobs the economy added in July - and it 's 209,000 . It 's down from the huge gains in June but still relatively good news - it 's the sixth straight month with jobs gains over 200,000 .\nThe unemployment rate , however , actually ticked up in July , to 6.2 % . It 's a result of a few different things - the labor force participation rate ticked slightly up by a tenth of a percentage point , for example . The broader , seasonally-adjusted U-6 measure of unemployment also ticked up , by one tenth of a percentage point , to 12.2 % . U-6 takes into account discouraged and underemployed workers , which means those people who may have long been looking for a job but left the labor force are counted .\nThe jobs number narrowly missed expections . ADP , the nationwide payroll firm , estimated that there would be 218,000 jobs this month .\nMany indicators were unchanged this month . What 's interesting to note is that all of these indicators are much better than where we were a year ago :\nIn July , 2.2 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force , down by 236,000 from a year earlier . ( The data are not seasonally adjusted . ) These individuals were not in the labor force , wanted and were available for work , and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months . They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey . ( See table A-16 . ) Among the marginally attached , there were 741,000 discouraged workers in July , down by 247,000 from a year earlier . ( The data are not seasonally adjusted . ) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them . The remaining 1.4 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in July had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities . ( See table A-16 . )\nThis report follows heartening news on the economic front : this week , government economists estimated that the economy grew at a 4 % rate in the second quarter of 2014 , which was a huge improvement after a contraction in the first quarter .",
