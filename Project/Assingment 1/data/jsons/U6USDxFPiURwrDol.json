Luther Strange and former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore. The winner will face Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney, in the Dec. 12 general election. Brian Lyman / Advertiser\n\nTuesday marks the end of one expensive and heated contest \u2014 and possibly the beginning of another.\n\nAlabama voters will head to the polls Tuesday to decide who will get the Republican Senate nomination \u2014 the incumbent, Sen. Luther Strange, or former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore.\n\nThe vote will end a contest pitting Moore\u2019s solid base against Strange\u2019s tireless efforts to transform himself into a proxy for President Trump, who remains popular among GOP voters in the state. The winner will face former U.S. attorney Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, in a Dec. 12 general election.\n\nWhile the policy differences between Strange and Moore are negligible, the campaign has turned into a proxy war for factions within the national Republican Party, both seeking Trump\u2019s favor while crossing swords over the party\u2019s congressional leadership, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nBelow are five questions whose answers will be key to the outcome.\n\n1. Will voters see Donald Trump in Luther Strange?\n\nStrange\u2019s campaign has one overriding theme: He loves the president \u2014 a whole lot \u2014 and hopes you understand the depths of his commitment. The incumbent speaks of Trump in terms that are never less than reverent (and sometimes, biblical). He gives unqualified support for a border wall with Mexico and (like Moore) bills repealing the Affordable Care Act \u2014 many of which included Medicaid cuts with potentially serious consequences for Medicaid recipients, Alabama hospitals and primary care providers.\n\nThe senator attacks Moore for slights real or perceived against Trump and suggested at a debate Thursday that Moore resented Strange's friendship with the president. The strategy helped Strange slide into the runoff ahead of Rep. Mo Brooks on Aug. 15 and helped him secure an appearance by Trump at a rally in Huntsville last week.\n\nMoore, though, has also said he will support the president\u2019s agenda in the Senate and that he's not running against the president. Consultants said Friday that Strange\u2019s relentless invocation of Trump has meant Strange has disappeared as a person.

Will voters see Robert Bentley in Luther Strange?\n\nStrange\u2019s appointment to the Senate by former governor Robert Bentley \u2014 when Strange was Alabama attorney general \u2014 continues to haunt the campaign. Bentley pleaded guilty to two campaign finance violations and resigned from office in April after an investigation by a unit of the attorney general\u2019s office. Strange interviewed for and accepted the appointment while the investigation was underway.\n\nThe incumbent has declined to say what role, if any, he had in the investigation. Moore tried to press him on the issue at Thursday\u2019s debate. Strange did not answer, nor did he answer when asked by reporters following the debate.\n\nMoore has said little about the appointment in his advertising, but outside groups opposed to Strange have repeatedly brought it up.\n\n3. Can Roy Moore\u2019s base carry him to another victory?\n\nMoore has run the same race he\u2019s run since 2000, counting on enthusiastic supporters and high name recognition to make up for deficits in fundraising and television exposure. He has done so against a virtual tsunami of money coming into the race: Strange and the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund (SLF) spent a combined $10 million on the campaign through Sept. 6, and even more in the weeks after.

Which will be more decisive \u2014 national politics or Alabama dynamics?\n\nThis race is an oddity: an off-year primary that has become a battleground among GOP factions. Vice President Pence traveled to Birmingham on Monday to campaign for Strange, and both the National Rifle Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are trying to push the incumbent over the finish line.

In a race with turnout projected between 12% and 15%, the performance of Moore\u2019s traditional bastions could prove crucial.\n\n5. Where does this leave Doug Jones?\n\nThe Democratic nominee will have his work cut out for him, mo matter who wins Tuesday. No Democrat has won an election to the U.S. Senate in Alabama since 1992, and the last statewide election the party won took place in 2008. If turnout in the Republican primary (423,000 voters) was low, turnout for the Democratic primary \u2014 won overwhelmingly by Jones \u2014 was still lower (165,000).
