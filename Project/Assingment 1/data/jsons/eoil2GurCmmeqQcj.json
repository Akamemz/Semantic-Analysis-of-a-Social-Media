This is \u201c the next step in a process that \u2019 s been intensifying for some period of time . \u201d\nAnd the lack of federal action on climate , says Mr. Hayes , has meant that some states have tried to step into the void .\n\u201c Traditionally , states \u2019 rights are considered a conservative principle , but it \u2019 s the more progressive states now that are showing the way to environmental protection in the climate area in particular , so it \u2019 s kind of flipped the script a little bit , \u201d says Mr. Hayes .\nIn California , the biggest shot across the bow came last month when the Trump administration announced it was revoking California \u2019 s waiver that allows it to set its own auto emissions standards . The state has held this waiver since 1967 , when Congress made the exception in recognition of the unusual pollution challenges that California faces . Since 2009 , California \u2019 s waiver has expanded to include greenhouse gases in its list of pollutants , affecting Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) standards . That was a more unusual move ( and was denied by the Bush administration when the state first made the request in 2007 ) , but several automakers voluntarily joined with California , pledging to raise CAFE standards to nearly 50 mpg by 2026 .

Also under attack , he says , have been states \u2019 right to approve or disapprove projects based on their water-quality standards , to petition the EPA to take action against upwind states that negatively impact their air quality , and to determine what kind of energy they want , as fossil fuels claim they \u2019 re being unfairly pushed out by states that want clean energy .\nIt \u2019 s a consistent enough pattern that last month , the Environmental Council of the States , a nonpartisan association of state environmental agency leaders , sent a letter to Administrator Wheeler raising their concerns .
