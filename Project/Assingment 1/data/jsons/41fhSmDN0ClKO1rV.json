Only in Justice Breyer \u2019 s concluding paragraphs is there anything that reads like a concurrence : \u201c I agree that the pretextual nature of the secretary \u2019 s decision provides a sufficient basis to affirm the District Court \u2019 s decision to send the matter back to the agency. \u201d It \u2019 s hard to read these few paragraphs as anything other than a last-minute addition to a carefully crafted dissenting opinion , one that had rather suddenly become superfluous .\nThere were two other opinions filed in the case , one by Justice Clarence Thomas that was joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh , and another by Justice Samuel Alito . Both disagreed vigorously with the chief justice \u2019 s bottom line . All four opinions scrupulously avoided any mention of what everybody knew : that documents brought to light in the weeks following the April 23 argument showed that the citizenship question was part of a plan not to help minority groups vote , but the opposite . The plan was to create and entrench Republican majorities in state legislatures by providing data for use if the Supreme Court gives the green light to counting only eligible voters in legislative redistricting . Conservative groups are poised to send such a case to the Supreme Court in the near future , part of a strategy to keep rapidly diversifying red states like Texas from turning blue .\nThere is no doubt that the justices were aware of this late-breaking development ; during the days leading up to the decision , one of the plaintiff groups challenging the citizenship question had filed a brief with the court detailing the findings from the computer files of a recently deceased Republican redistricting specialist . If I \u2019 m right about the chief justice \u2019 s late-in-the-day change of heart , did these revelations play a part , even a subconscious one ?

Suffice it to say that it \u2019 s hard to imagine the administration \u2019 s litigating position undermined in a more devastating fashion .\nIt \u2019 s that observation that brings me to the DACA case .
