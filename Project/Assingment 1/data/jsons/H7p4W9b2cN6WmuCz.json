The country launched a five-year study to unravel the mystery of the long-term health effects that plague survivors of the viral disease. Since the epidemic started more than a year ago in a remote village in Guinea, more than 11,000 people have died, the vast majority in three West African nations, according to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization . And that number is believed to be low, since there was widespread under-reporting of cases, according to WHO.

U.N. leaders estimate they need $1 billion to fight the epidemic, with about half needed for the worst-hit country, Liberia.\n\nPolitical systems and infrastructure are fragile in the countries where the virus is concentrated. Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea are still rebuilding their economies after suffering through years of civil wars.\n\n\"Now their capacity to deliver the necessities of daily life for their people is on the brink of collapse,\" Amos said. \"The Ebola outbreak poses a serious threat to their post-conflict recovery.\"\n\nMore people are believed to have died in these countries from secondary diseases like malaria and tuberculosis and from chronic illnesses and pregnancies with complications than from Ebola because the health care systems are so strained.\n\nHeavy rain adds to the risk of waterborne diseases like malaria.\n\nFood security has also become a problem. Quarantines keep workers from their jobs and have slowed the delivery of food to certain areas, according to the U.N.\n\n\"We must act now if we want to avoid greater humanitarian consequences in future,\" Amos said.",
