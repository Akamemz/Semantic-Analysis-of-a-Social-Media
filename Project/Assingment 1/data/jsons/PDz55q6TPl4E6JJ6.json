    "content": "DAYTON , Ohio \u2014 Leaving behind the string of presidential debates that have put his re-election bid in doubt , President Obama embarked Tuesday on a blitz of battleground states in the final two weeks of the campaign , promoting an economic plan for a second term and portraying Republican rival Mitt Romney as unpatriotic and unprepared to lead .\nWith the race closer than ever , thanks in part to Mr. Obama \u2019 s mixed performance in debating , the Obama campaign launched a multimedia advertising offensive focusing on \u201c economic patriotism , \u201d detailing the president \u2019 s plan for economic recovery with millions of direct-mail leaflets and 60-second TV ads in nine battleground states .\nNeeding to secure hotly contested states such as Ohio , part of the president \u2019 s theme is that Mr. Romney lacks confidence in American workers , accusing the Republican of wanting to allow U.S. automakers to go bankrupt during the recession .\nIt was a point that Vice President Joseph R. Biden relished driving home during a joint appearance with Mr. Obama in Dayton .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve never met two guys who were more down on America , \u201d Mr. Biden said of Mr. Romney and his running mate , Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin . \u201c Every time I turn around , [ they say ] \u2018 America \u2019 s in decline , \u2019 \u2018 American people won \u2019 t take responsibility. \u2019 I don \u2019 t know where they live , but it \u2019 s not where we live . Regardless of what our opponents say , America is not in decline . Americans are not a dependent people . We \u2019 re independent . We take responsibility . \u201d\nThe president told Ohioans that Mr. Romney \u201c looked you right in the eye , looked me in the eye , tried to pretend he never said \u2018 Let Detroit go bankrupt . \u2019\n\u201c The people of Ohio don \u2019 t forget , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c If Mitt Romney had been president when the auto industry was on the verge of collapse , we might not have an American auto industry today . I bet on American workers . I understand that American workers can compete . \u201d\nIn a New York Times op-ed in November 2008 , Mr. Romney wrote that he favored a \u201c managed bankruptcy \u201d that would give Detroit a \u201c path to the fundamental restructuring the industry needs. \u201d This was more or less what happened eventually , albeit under government auspices . Contrary to what Mr. Obama has said , Mr. Romney never proposed the liquidation of General Motors Co. or Chrysler LLC .\nMr. Romney , campaigning in Nevada and Colorado , said the debates have \u201c supercharged \u201d his supporters even as Mr. Obama \u2019 s campaign is \u201c taking on water . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s been reduced to trying to defend characters on \u2018 Sesame Street , \u2019 \u201d the Republican presidential nominee told supporters who overflowed the Henderson Pavilion in the Las Vegas suburbs .\nMr. Ryan joined him at the events , where the Republican ticket gloated over Mr. Romney \u2019 s performances in all three debates .\n\u201c Look , the president has run out of ideas , \u201d Mr. Ryan said . \u201c That \u2019 s why he \u2019 s running a small campaign about small things and hoping he can distract people from the reality in front of us . \u201d\nTrying to convince voters that he is more concerned about Americans \u2019 economic welfare , Mr. Obama put out a five-point economic plan that he will emphasize over the campaign \u2019 s final two weeks . The plan has no new proposals , and even the president seemed to acknowledge that the effort was more about crafting a fresher campaign message than forging a new agenda .\n\u201c Throughout this campaign , I \u2019 ve laid out a plan for jobs and middle-class security , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c I want to talk about what \u2019 s in my plan , just so everybody knows exactly what I intend to do over the next four years . \u201d\nIt includes reducing dependency on foreign oil , encouraging American manufacturing and cutting the deficit , all items that the president has attempted in his first term but hasn \u2019 t sunk in with some voters .\nRepublicans derided the effort as a \u201c repackaging \u201d of the same policies that haven \u2019 t worked for the past four years , following criticism that Mr. Obama has failed to lay out an agenda for a second term .\nThe second tactic that the president and his surrogates hit hard Tuesday was the notion that Mr. Romney would be a dangerously inept commander in chief .\n\u201c In a world of new threats and profound challenges , America needs leadership that is strong and steady , \u201d Mr. Obama told nearly 10,000 boisterous supporters at an outdoor tennis stadium in Delray Beach , Fla. , on Tuesday morning . \u201c Gov . Romney \u2019 s foreign policy has been wrong and reckless . \u201d\nThe president \u2019 s rally in South Florida followed his third and final debate Monday night with Mr. Romney .\nSince the first debate , the president \u2019 s polling advantage in some crucial states such as Florida have disappeared . Especially after his lackluster performance in the first debate on Oct. 3 , Mr. Obama has been trying to regain his footing as he has fallen behind the Republican in some national polls .\nThe president ridiculed Mr. Romney \u2019 s foreign policy pronouncements Tuesday as being \u201c all over the map . \u201d\n\u201c During the debate , he said he didn \u2019 t want more troops in Iraq , but he was caught on video saying it was unthinkable not to leave 20,000 troops in Iraq , troops that would still be there today , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c Early in this campaign , he said he \u2019 d do the opposite of whatever I do in Israel . But last night I reminded him that cooperation with Israel has never been stronger . \u201d\nRomney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said Mr. Romney \u201c convincingly \u2019 won the foreign policy debate .\n\u201c The American people saw an experienced executive and leader with a strong command of foreign policy who could be the next commander in chief , \u201d she said . \u201c While Gov . Romney laid out a clear , optimistic vision for America based on a strong economy , President Obama still failed to lay out a second-term agenda or put forth any new ideas for the future . \u201d\nThe president began a three-day campaign swing , twice to Ohio , and to Iowa , Colorado , Nevada , Florida again and Virginia . In between those campaign stops , Mr. Obama will find time to tape an appearance on \u201c The Tonight Show \u201d with Jay Leno in Los Angeles and to vote early in Chicago .\nIn Florida and across the country Tuesday , Mr. Obama and his supporters fanned out with the message that the president is the more experienced hand at foreign policy .\nThe Obama campaign \u2019 s heightened focus on the president \u2019 s experience in international affairs underscored advisers \u2019 concern that Mr. Obama has lost some of his foreign policy edge over Mr. Romney in polls .\nA month ago , the president had a clear advantage among likely voters on foreign policy . But after the terrorist attack in Libya on Sept. 11 that killed four Americans , and the administration \u2019 s shifting explanations for the assault , the president has lost much of his edge over Mr. Romney on the question of who would be a better commander in chief .\nFormer Florida Gov . Charlie Crist , appearing at the rally in Delray Beach , said the president \u201c knows you only have once chance to get it right . \u201d\nRep. Theodore E. Deutch , Florida Democrat , said Mr. Obama made it clear in the debate that \u201c his administration and this great country stand with our ally Israel . \u201d\nThe president \u2019 s supporters also chided Mr. Romney for giving what they said was short shrift to military veterans in the final debate on foreign policy Monday night .\n\u201c Mitt Romney failed to mention our veterans even once during a 90-minute debate focused on foreign policy , wars abroad and America \u2019 s future in the world , \u201d said Rob Diamond , the Obama campaign \u2019 s vote director for veterans and military families . \u201c While Mitt Romney wrote off half of our country as people who see themselves as \u2018 victims , \u2019 which includes veterans receiving the benefits they \u2019 ve earned , President Obama understands that war has consequences and that we have an obligation to our service members , not just when they are serving , but when they return home as well . \u201d\nHowever , Mr. Ryan said the Republican nominee showed in the debate that he would be a more effective steward of America \u2019 s foreign policy . He said voters got from Mr. Romney \u201c clear answers , a clear vision for foreign policy , very clear distinctions and how we should go forward with this country . \u201d\n\u201c What we got from President Obama were mostly attacks on Mitt Romney . That \u2019 s not an agenda , \u201d Mr. Ryan said on \u201c Good Morning America , \u201d paraphrasing a line from Mr. Romney on Monday night . \u201c We really actually didn \u2019 t get an agenda for how we should move our country forward on foreign policy . \u201d\nThe debates also have helped to boost Mr. Romney \u2019 s likability , according to polls , another area in which the president had been far ahead of the Republican in public-opinion surveys .\nGary Berg of Boca Raton , a retiree who said he is a \u201c big time \u201d Obama supporter , agreed that Mr. Romney has become \u201c a little bit \u201d more likable as a result of the debates .\n\u201c He came off a little more articulate than we \u2019 d ever seen him before , \u201d Mr. Berg said at the rally for the president in Florida . \u201c His previous debate performances within the Republican Party were just average .
