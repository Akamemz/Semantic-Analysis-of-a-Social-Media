Disney will also get Fox 's stakes in Hulu and European pay-TV provider Sky ( SKYAY ) .\nPrior to the deal closing , 21st Century Fox ( FOX ) will separate the Fox broadcasting network , Fox News Channel , Fox Business Network , and some national sports networks into a new company that will be spun off to its shareholders .
