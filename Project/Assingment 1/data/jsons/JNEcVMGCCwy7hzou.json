    "content": "This weekend in Tulsa , the president held his first campaign rally since March , after the coronavirus pandemic suspended the campaign trail . \u201c So we begin , Oklahoma we begin . Thank you , Oklahoma ! \u201d It was also the weekend of Juneteenth . For many black Americans , Juneteenth is a celebration of the end of slavery in this country . This was a moment that resulted in scenes like this . \u201c You are a sellout ! \u201d \u201d Black people die [ inaudible ] \u201d [ shouting ] The timing of the president \u2019 s rally , on the weekend of Juneteenth , also comes at a time where there have been weeks of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality . \u201c Hands up ! Don \u2019 t shoot ! \u201d It is particularly poignant in the South , and in Tulsa , because of the history of racial oppression here . Rather than a president that showed deference to the racial history of this city or to try to further the efforts of racial reconciliation , we saw him upend them . \u201c About the first grade , we came to Tulsa . We moved to Tulsa . So , I kind of grew up on Greenwood . When I entered college and took black history , and my professor , he said , \u2018 Do you all know about the race massacre ? \u2019 And we were all like , \u2018 No . We had a riot here ? \u2019 You know . And he was just like , \u2018 OK , so everybody sit down and listen to this story. \u2019 \u201d In the early 1900s , the Greenwood area of Tulsa was a thriving black neighborhood . \u201c African-Americans , two generations out of slavery , pursued and exhibited black excellence. \u201d \u201c We had our own banks and hospitals and theaters and restaurants. \u201d But that success didn \u2019 t sit well with the white community . And in 1921 , after a black man was accused of disrespecting a white woman , things escalated . A white mob burned and looted Black Wall Street . \u201c The violence lasted roughly 16 hours. \u201d \u201c They shot . They looted . They bombed. \u201d \u201c They threw bodies in the river . They threw them in mass graves. \u201d \u201c When the dust settled , some 100 to 300 people were killed . At least 1,250 homes were destroyed in the black community . Schools , churches and business were destroyed as well. \u201d \u201c Total devastation , like a war zone . What happened here was a momentous tragic event. \u201d \u201c That was the worst horrific story that I ever heard in my life. \u201d \u201c This church , we were building in 1921 , our sanctuary \u2014 they destroyed that . And our basement miraculously survived . The damage on this pillar comes from when concrete burned . In this room , also we have soil collections from the different sites where people were killed. \u201d After years of ignoring the massacre , many in Tulsa want to make it front and center of the community \u2019 s conversation . They set up this bipartisan commission to do a number of initiatives to bring forward the issue of racial reconciliation and commemorate the centennial anniversary of the massacre . And some institutions have apologized . \u201c I \u2019 m sorry that the police department did not protect its citizens during the tragic days of 1921. \u201d The hard part has been what to do next . \u201c We demand reparations in honor of all those Americans that were killed ! We demand reparations now ! \u201d \u201c Saying \u2018 I \u2019 m sorry \u2019 is not repentance . You know , saying \u2018 I \u2019 m sorry \u2019 just recognizes what you did is wrong . Repentance is turning away from what you did that makes you sorry . Before you can even get to atonement , we have to have a society that admits that white supremacy is wrong . We \u2019 ve got to have a society that admits that black lives matter. \u201d The president has tried to present himself as a unifying figure , as someone who can bring the country together , particularly in times of these dual crises : the coronavirus pandemic and the national unrest around race and racial inequality . But this weekend shows his challenges on that front and the inability of this administration to , frankly , get out of its own way . Juneteenth is , for many black Americans , a celebration of the emancipation of slavery . The president initially announced a rally on Juneteenth . When you talk to people , they say there was a moment of disbelief that the president was coming to Tulsa . \u201c My first reaction was , \u2018 How disrespectful. \u2019 I felt like it was a slap in the face. \u201d And after pleas , even from Republican senators in the state , he moved the rally to the next day. \u201d \u201c Beep beep . Beep beep . It \u2019 s important to me because it \u2019 s history , it \u2019 s freedom . Girl , you \u2019 re looking good . It \u2019 s good to see you , long time . It \u2019 s education. \u201d \u201c You want to make America great again ? You have to make Black Wall Street great again. \u201d \u201c And it \u2019 s important this year because people get to see that , hey , they \u2019 re still fighting for a cause , but they \u2019 re celebrating our freedom. \u201d \u201c To come on the weekend of Juneteenth shows that he has still not that much respect for our sacred day. \u201d Ultimately , the president \u2019 s rally wasn \u2019 t as big as his campaign had hoped . But the significance of this weekend is seen in scenes like this . \u201c I see you back there shaking your head . Yes , sir , black lives matter. \u201d And one of the takeaways around this moment , around race in this country , has been the shifting public opinion about questions of systemic racism and persistent inequality . \u201c No justice ! \u201d \u201c No peace ! \u201d \u201c No justice ! \u201d \u201c No peace ! \u201d That lack of acknowledgement puts him at odds with even some members of his own party . The president \u2019 s strategy on race and on other issues has just narrowed his path to re-election . He has not shown a willingness to try to expand his base , leaving him fairly reliant on a similar group of voters that got him elected in 2016 to do so again in 2020 .",
