And [ it frees ] up state resources to protect the health and safety of the people in their state . ''\nTrump also said his administration is committed to providing the three states with mobile medical centers that offer thousands of hospital beds . Some hospitals are depleting their medical supply reserves as they deal with the virus .\nAdditional supplies , including N95 masks and gloves , will be delivered to California and New York in the next 48 hours , Trump said .\nThe president 's remarks came hours after New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo appealed to Trump to nationalize the effort to acquire protective medical supplies \u2014 including masks , gowns and gloves \u2014 that are increasingly scarce .\nCuomo said so many states are attempting to acquire a depleted supply that governors are outbidding one another for essential equipment and driving prices up .\n`` I think the federal government should order factories to manufacture masks , gowns , ventilators , '' Cuomo said . `` The essential medical equipment , that 's going to make a difference between life and death . ''\nMeanwhile Trump says the federal government is marshaling all of its resources to help ease the burden states are shouldering .\nThe USNS Mercy hospital ship , now based in San Diego , will move to Los Angeles to help free up space in hospitals overwhelmed by coronavirus patients .\nThe USNS Comfort , the Mercy 's counterpart , was set to head to New York Harbor to help alleviate virus-related hospital strain .\n`` They are wartime ships . They 're meant for war , '' Trump said . `` These rooms are as good as anywhere in the nation . ''\nThe Sunday evening update from the task force came as a procedural vote on a massive but not-yet-finalized coronavirus relief package failed in the Senate , putting the measure 's prospects in limbo .\nIn his briefing , Trump said `` we 'll work with whoever we have to '' on a stimulus package to help an economy likely to be ravaged by the coronavirus .\nHe also said the U.S. was reaching out to North Korea , Iran and other countries to help them fight the coronavirus , and at one point digressed to complain about how often he is sued and to discuss the sacrifices he said he has made to run for president .\nVice President Pence said the White House 's coronavirus task force will update guidance on Monday for the nation 's law enforcement and others working on critical infrastructure .\nOn coronavirus testing , Pence said more than 250,000 Americans had received tests and results as of Sunday .
