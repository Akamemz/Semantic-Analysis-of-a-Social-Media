    "content": "The administration announced a new policy Friday to detain nearly all illegal immigrant families nabbed at the border , offering the latest bold ante in an ongoing battle over President Trump \u2019 s attempt to stop a new surge of migration .\nThe policy will be controversial not only with congressional Democrats and immigrant-rights activists , but also with a federal judge who had ordered that children could be held no longer than 20 days in immigration detention .\nGovernment lawyers , though , said yet another judge \u2019 s ruling earlier this week making most family separations illegal supersedes the 20-day rule and other restrictions , and gives the government the ability to hold families together until their immigration cases are completed .\n\u201c The government will not separate families but detain families together during the pendency of immigration proceedings when they are apprehended at or between ports of entry , \u201d the Justice Department said in a filing with Judge Dolly M. Gee .\nThe arguments come as lower courts are increasingly asserting control of the immigration system \u2014 leaving the executive branch struggling to carry out its own policies amid potentially competing rulings and judges working at cross purposes .\nIn Friday \u2019 s filing the Justice Department said it was getting caught between a 2015 ruling in the so-called Flores settlement , which governs the treatment of illegal immigrant children caught at the border , and this week \u2019 s ruling in a case known as Ms. L v. ICE .\nThe Flores settlement says children must be released from immigration detention within 20 days , and turned over either to a Health Department dorm or to relatives or sponsors living in the U.S .\nFor nearly 20 years that ruling only applied to children who arrived at the border unaccompanied by parents . Judge Gee in 2015 updated the ruling to apply to all illegal immigrant children , saying they need to be released \u2014 and so should their parents .\nThat created what critics call a \u201c catch-and-release \u201d policy , which they blamed for the new surge in families streaming to the border .\nOn Wednesday another federal judge ruled in the Ms. L case that children should be kept with their parents .\nThe Trump administration says the only way that can happen \u2014 without a full-scale release of all illegal immigrant families \u2014 is to detain the families together .\n\u201c The Ms. L ruling addresses reunification of children with their parents , and specifically requires reunification \u201c when the parent is returned to immigration custody \u201d after a release from criminal custody , \u201d the government said . \u201c But this aspect of the Ms. L ruling would make little sense if that reunification would necessitate an immediate release of the parents from immigration custody under the Flores Agreement . \u201d\nThe Trump administration said after this week \u2019 s ruling , the only way children can generally be released is if a parent agrees to a separation .\nThe Justice Department said in a statement it believes its hands are tied .\n\u201c We are beholden to a broken immigration system that Congress has refused to fix and that courts have exacerbated , \u201d the department said in a statement . \u201c While Congress has recessed for the 4th of July holiday , we continue to urge them to act decisively in order to solve the crisis at our border and end \u2018 catch and release . \u2019 \u201d",
