Because if the GOP does want to set up reconciliation again , they can \u2014 by passing a new budget resolution with new \u201c reconciliation instructions . \u201d\nFor now , it seems that the GOP intends to put the health care issue to the side and focus on setting tax reform on that reconciliation track .\nIf they do get a tax bill signed into law , however , they could return to the health care issue \u2014 by passing yet another budget resolution with new reconciliation instructions . So far from cleanly ending the story of Obamacare repeal , the September 30 deadline will likely only lead to a new period of uncertainty .\nBear with me as we descend into the morass of Senate rules .\nTo start off : The key assumption underlying the GOP \u2019 s choices here is that they believe both Obamacare repeal and tax reform can only pass through the special filibuster-proof budget reconciliation process .\nThis assumption appears to be accurate . It takes 60 votes to advance an ordinary bill past a filibuster , Republicans only have 52 Senate seats , and Democrats have remained united against every version of Obamacare repeal all year . So , repeal effectively has to happen through budget reconciliation \u2014 where it can pass with just 50 Republican senators plus a tie-breaker vote from Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 or it won \u2019 t happen at all .\nNow , for tax reform , a few Senate Democrats have indicated they might want to work with the GOP . But winning eight of them would be a tall order without major policy compromises that Republicans would really prefer not to make .\nRepublicans , then , decided to try to use budget reconciliation twice in 2017 \u2014 first for Obamacare repeal and then for tax reform . To actually put this strategy into action , though , they had to jump through some procedural hoops . Specifically :\nTo set up budget reconciliation , Congress first has to pass a budget resolution for a particular fiscal year that contains \u201c reconciliation instructions . \u201d\nOnce they do that , those reconciliation instructions can only be used for one bill that affects both spending and revenue ( as Obamacare repeal does ) .\nAnd they belatedly learned there was one more catch : Those reconciliation instructions expire at the end of the fiscal year \u2014 that is , September 30 .\nSo back in January , congressional Republicans did pass a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017 , which set up the reconciliation process for Obamacare repeal . They hoped that they would then get repeal passed and signed into law , and then pass a new budget resolution to set up reconciliation again for tax reform .\nBut this plan has gone off the rails . The Senate has failed to use reconciliation to actually pass a health bill ( or anything else ) . And at the end of this month , their magical reconciliation vehicle will turn into a pumpkin .\nSo Republicans are trying to pass a new budget resolution , to get a new reconciliation vehicle\nYet all this doesn \u2019 t mean the death knell for Obamacare repeal \u2014 because Republicans will now try to set up the reconciliation process again .\nTo do so , they need to pass a new budget resolution . This is something that is theoretically within their capabilities , since it can be done with a simple majority in each house of Congress .\nThe GOP \u2019 s plan was , originally , that Obamacare repeal would be over and done with by now , so this new budget resolution could be used purely to put tax reform on the reconciliation track .\nIn recent days , a few Republican senators like Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) , Ron Johnson ( R-WI ) , and Rand Paul ( R-KY ) have all argued that the new resolution should be written in a way that keeps open the possibility of Obamacare repeal .\nThat seems entirely possible , should Republican leaders want to do so . \u201c They don \u2019 t have to choose between health care and tax reform in the budget resolution , \u201d Ed Lorenzen of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget tells me . Instead , the resolution can be written in a vague way that would let them later use reconciliation for either ( 1 ) tax reform , ( 2 ) health reform , or ( 3 ) both together in one bill .\nNow , though it \u2019 s often said that reconciliation can only be set up for one bill at a time , that \u2019 s not technically true . According to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis , a budget resolution can only set up reconciliation for one bill that affects both spending and revenues at a time . Theoretically , reconciliation could be set up for one bill that only affects revenues and a separate bill that only affects spending . So theoretically , if Republicans can manage to write a health bill that only impacts spending , and a tax bill that only impacts revenue , they could use reconciliation twice .\nHowever , the experts I talked to don \u2019 t think that this is a viable strategy for the GOP . Major features of Obamacare \u2014 such as the subsidies for the individual insurance market exchanges \u2014 have been deemed by the Congressional Budget Office to impact both spending and revenue . Meanwhile , some features of tax reform , like refundable tax credits , have been scored as impacting spending .\nSo though a decision on this can be punted for now , Senate rules and congressional scoring practices do seem to suggest that Republicans will eventually have to decide on either using reconciliation for either health care , tax reform , or one bill combining both .\nBut despite all that , Republican leaders signaled Tuesday that they prefer to focus on tax reform in the new resolution for now . And that makes sense the GOP is desperate for a major legislative accomplishment and are said to fear that combining the two issues together could sink both .\nThen , of course , keep in mind that if Republicans pass a new budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year with new reconciliation instructions , they \u2019 ll face a similar deadline of the end of that fiscal year : September 30 , 2018 .\nOne more option : Republicans can later pass another budget for fiscal year 2019\nEven if the GOP decides to focus on tax reform with this next budget reconciliation effort , there \u2019 s one more way they could get another bite at the reconciliation apple \u2014 by passing a new budget at some point next year . This could be for the 2019 fiscal year , which Sen. John Thune ( R-SD ) mentioned this as a possibility in an interview with Politico this week . Some experts told me that it might even be possible to do a second budget for the 2018 fiscal year .\nEither way , this would essentially be the reverse of the GOP \u2019 s original strategy . First , they \u2019 d pass a budget setting up reconciliation for tax reform , and then pass tax reform . Then , they \u2019 d pass a budget setting up reconciliation for Obamacare repeal , and then pass that .\nAll this may seem a bit fanciful and unlikely to transpire , considering how soon this would take us to the 2018 midterms . Tax reform itself is hardly guaranteed to succeed . And of course , none of these procedural maneuvers would solve Republicans \u2019 core problem of how to unite 50 senators around an Obamacare repeal bill .\nStill , it \u2019 s possible the political situation , and the tenuous balance of power in the Senate , could change . For instance , Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) is ailing of brain cancer , and if his seat should become vacant , his replacement would be appointed by Arizona \u2019 s governor and would be more likely to support repeal .\nOne final nightmare scenario for Democrats is that Republicans could take a drubbing in the 2018 midterm elections \u2014 and then finally find their resolve to repeal Obamacare in the lame duck before the new Congress is sworn in , knowing for sure that this would be their last chance to do it .\nSo yes , Obamacare repeal may look dead for now .
