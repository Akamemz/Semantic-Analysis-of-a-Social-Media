''\n`` This is the height of political correctness , '' Cruz continued . `` And frankly , the concern is not of the Caitlyn Jenners of the world , but if the law is such that any man , if he feels like it , can go in a woman 's restroom and you ca n't ask him to leave , that opens the door for predators . ''\nJenner , a reality TV star and activist for transgender causes , posted a video to Facebook on Wednesday knocking Cruz for his support of a controversial North Carolina law that requires people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their `` biological sex '' stated on their birth certificate , rather than how they self-identify .\nAfter using a women 's bathroom in the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City -- following a recent comment by Trump in which he said Jenner could use whichever bathroom she wanted at the tower -- Jenner , a Republican , quipped : `` By the way , Ted , nobody got molested .
