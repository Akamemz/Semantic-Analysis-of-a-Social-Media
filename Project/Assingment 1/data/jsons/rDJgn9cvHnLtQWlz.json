    "content": "A majority of the United States is enveloped in bitterly cold temperatures that is expected to last the remainder of the week and could shatter record low temperatures , reports Weather.com . `` Over 100 daily record lows and record cool highs may be threatened Tuesday and Wednesday , combined , from the Plains and Midwest to the Deep South , Florida , and East , '' predicts meteorologist Jon Erdman.There is no doubt it is cold , but just how cold depends on which part of the country in which you live and which statistics you employ to measure how `` cold '' it is , argues meteorologist David Epstein of Boston.com . Epstein acknowledges the last week has seen `` a lot of cold records being set , '' which means certain towns and cities had cold high temperatures which were records . But , that does not necessarily mean those are record temperatures . `` Simply put , those cities and towns saw their coldest daily highs ever recorded . These records are for a particular date , not all-time , '' he writes.For example , Epstein looks at the Boston area and the number of days when the temperature was under 40 in November since 1994 . He finds that the average is 2 degrees and the maximum is 6 degrees . However , if you `` expand the period of record to include all the data the average jumps to 9 [ degrees ] and the maximum goes up to 13 [ degrees ] ! I can \u2019 t fit all those numbers since 1875 on one chart , '' says Epstein.He notes that even while the New England region is not expected to set any daily records , residents ' short memories will not prevent them from proclaiming like `` it \u2019 s too early for this '' or `` I \u2019 m not ready for this yet . `` And , of course , the media coverage contributes to our sense of dread about cold weather or any particular severe weather event . `` Even in our daily weather forecasts , the prospect of what if scenarios is too often used to garner a reaction , usually to gain eyeballs or followers . There will be cold and snow this winter and no matter how much or how little there is , spring will arrive sometime in March . Traffic will be impacted , schools closed and too much milk purchased , '' Epstein noted in a recent blog post .",
