Then , he tweeted that Tesla \u2019 s share price was too high , sending its shares down . Then he tweeted part of \u201c The Star Spangled Banner , \u201d America \u2019 s difficult-to-sing national anthem . He encouraged us all to \u201c rage , rage against the dying of the light of consciousness , \u201d which somewhat mangles the meter of Dylan Thomas \u2019 best-known poem . He announced his girlfriend , the musician Grimes , was mad at him .\nTrue , May only started today and Musk has been melting down all week . For instance , there was the unhinged ranting on his earnings call about the \u201c fascist \u201d stay-home orders California implemented to slow the coronavirus spread . \u201c We are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area , and that should be identified as a serious risk , \u201d Musk began on the call . ( Six Bay Area counties jointly extended the shelter-in-place orders affecting Tesla \u2019 s Fremont factory through May 31st , with only some minor relaxing of restrictions . ) Then he went on : \u201c The expansion of shelter-in-place , or as we call it , forcibly imprisoning people in their homes , against all their constitutional rights , is , in my opinion , breaking people \u2019 s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong , and not why people came to America and built this country . What the fuck ! \u201d\nWhat the fuck , indeed . Being dangerously wrong about the coronavirus has been something of a Musk hobby lately . For instance , he promoted a dubious paper on chloroquine , which was immediately ripped apart \u2014 the authors were blockchain hucksters , not medical researchers . On March 6th , he called \u201c the coronavirus panic \u201d dumb ; on March 14th , he said that panic was worse than \u201c corona. \u201d On March 19th , he predicted \u201c close to zero new cases in US too by end of April . \u201d\nMore than a million people in the US have been confirmed to have COVID-19 , as of April 28 . This is almost certainly an undercount , since these case numbers are artificially constrained by a lack of widespread testing for the illness .\nSo Musk spent March being wrong about COVID-19 . Okay . That \u2019 s not illegal . But securities fraud is . Ladies and gentlemen , my fellow dirtbags , and everyone else : the SEC disrespector has logged on .\n\u201c His use of \u2018 imo \u2019 also puts his statement into the realm of personal opinion , for which there is latitude . \u201d\nIt is not immediately obvious to me whether tweeting that Tesla is overpriced is securities fraud , because I am not a lawyer . So I called some . \u201c I don \u2019 t see anything actionable here , \u201d says Evelyn Cruz Sroufe , a partner at Perkins Coie who specializes in corporate governance . For today \u2019 s tweets to qualify as securities fraud , the SEC or a plaintiff would have to show that Musk would have profited from a drop in the stock price by \u2014 for instance \u2014 having a short position or a put . \u201c This looks instead to be just Musk sounding off , \u201d she says in an email . \u201c His use of \u2018 imo \u2019 also puts his statement into the realm of personal opinion , for which there is latitude . \u201d\nUsually , when a company wants to convey to its shareholders that it may be overvalued , it does so by providing facts and risk factor , says Alma Angotti , a partner and co-head of the global investigations and compliance practice at Guidehouse who \u2019 s previously worked in enforcement at the SEC , among other agencies . \u201c You give facts so the market can analyze those facts , \u201d she says . \u201c There \u2019 s not a good reason for him to say he thinks it \u2019 s overvalued that I can think of , especially in an informal way . \u201d\nAccording to Angotti , market manipulation \u2014 that is , when someone takes steps to artificially affect the prices of a security \u2014 requires only intent . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t need to benefit , though benefit is often how the government proves intent , \u201d she says . And the SEC is already watching him because of his previous actions .\n\u201c It \u2019 s uncommon but not necessarily illegal for a public company CEO to essentially call on the market to mark down the value of his company \u2019 s stock . \u201d\nJohn Reed Stark , president of John Reed Stark Consulting , who previously worked in SEC enforcement , doesn \u2019 t see it the same way as Agnotti . \u201c Intent is a hard thing to prove , \u201d Stark says . Greg Shill , a law professor at the University of Iowa , told me bluntly that he doesn \u2019 t know if this counts as securities fraud or not . \u201c It \u2019 s uncommon but not necessarily illegal for a public company CEO to essentially call on the market to mark down the value of his company \u2019 s stock , \u201d Shill says .\nThe worst circumstances for Musk would be if he were buying shares of Tesla , or the company were participating in a buyback program , says Steve Diamond , a law professor at Santa Clara University . \u201c I assume neither is the case , \u201d Diamond says .\nWhat about that SEC settlement and scrutiny , though ? Perhaps you recall , in the depths of very recent history , that on August 7th , 2018 , Musk tweeted : \u201c Am considering taking Tesla private at $ 420 . Funding secured. \u201d Funding was not , in fact , secured , the SEC investigation found \u2014 Musk had a few meetings with Saudi Arabia \u2019 s sovereign wealth fund but hadn \u2019 t discussed a go-private transaction . \u201c In truth and in fact , Musk had not even discussed , much less confirmed , key deal terms , including price , with any potential funding source , \u201d the SEC wrote in its complaint .\nAm considering taking Tesla private at $ 420 . Funding secured . \u2014 Elon Musk ( @ elonmusk ) August 7 , 2018\nAnyway , they settled , and then on February 19th , Musk tweeted a prediction for the number of Model 3s the company would make that wasn \u2019 t the same as Tesla \u2019 s official guidance . One of the provisions of the settlement was that Musk have his tweets about Tesla pre-approved by an in-house lawyer . And when the agency inquired whether this in-house lawyer had approved the February 19th tweets , the answer was that Musk had not had any of his tweets about Tesla pre-approved . After several weeks of jockeying , the two parties came to an agreement : Musk must have a company lawyer pre-approve tweets about Tesla \u2019 s financial health , sales , or delivery numbers .\nDo the Meltdown May tweets violate that ? The Wall Street Journal contacted Musk to ask if he was joking or if anyone had vetted his tweet before posting it . \u201c No , \u201d Musk replied in an email .\n\u201c If it was not vetted , he \u2019 s at risk of being hauled into court again by the SEC . \u201d\n\u201c If it was not vetted , he \u2019 s at risk of being hauled into court again by the SEC , \u201d says Diamond . \u201c The process was meant to catch these kinds of tweets before they went out . If he did it spontaneously , I think he \u2019 s gon na have an issue . \u201d\nJay Dubow , a partner at Pepper Hamilton who focuses on white collar litigation , thinks the SEC is in a tough position . On the one hand , Musk is openly flouting their settlement if he didn \u2019 t get his tweets approved . On the other hand , if the SEC goes so far as to force Musk to dissociate himself from Tesla , that potentially hurts the shareholders who bought into the stock because they believe in him . \u201c They \u2019 re going to have to react and do something , \u201d Dubow says . \u201c Because this was a clear violation of the order and I don \u2019 t know how they \u2019 re going to let that go . \u201d\nShill also views it as a challenge to the agency . \u201c It would be prudent for the SEC to request confirmation that the settlement agreement was complied with , \u201d Shill told me . \u201c Right now he \u2019 s arguably delivering to Tesla shareholders what they want : a really unrestrained , unfiltered CEO . When you buy Tesla , that \u2019 s arguably what you \u2019 re buying \u2014 but that \u2019 s not what the SEC settlement says . \u201d\n\u201c Right now he \u2019 s arguably delivering to Tesla shareholders what they want : a really unrestrained , unfiltered CEO . \u201d\nIf it is a violation of the settlement agreement , Tesla is also implicated because the company was meant to control him , Angotti says . Tesla \u2019 s board of directors may be held responsible for Musk \u2019 s actions \u2014 a trend in corporate governance is making sure the board is accountable for compliance at an organization , she tells me . \u201c If they can \u2019 t control the CEO , they \u2019 re not ensuring a very good culture of compliance at that company , \u201d Angotti says . \u201c They can say it all day but if they don \u2019 t enforce it , it doesn \u2019 t mean anything . \u201d\nTrying to hold Musk accountable may be awkward for the board , though . Tesla has dropped its directors and officers liability insurance , it said in an April 28th regulatory filing . This policy keeps companies , board members , and executives from having to pay their own fees for defense , settlement or judgement when they face lawsuits . Instead , Musk will \u201c personally provide coverage substantially equivalent to such a policy for a one-year period . \u201d\nOne more thing : while I was working on this story , the Environmental Protection Agency got back to us , because I guess everyone loves Meltdown May . So earlier this week , Musk said on Tesla \u2019 s earnings call that the Tesla Model S Long Range should be the first electric vehicle to sport a 400-mile range .
