The report said that allowing middle-class tax rates to rise and failing to pay for a short-term \u201c patch \u201d of the Alternative Minimum Tax could cut the growth of consumer spending by 1.7 percentage points in 2013 .\n\u201c The president believes Democrats and Republicans should come together to renew middle-class tax cuts so families and businesses have more certainty at this critical time for our economy , \u201d the White House said in a statement .\nThe CEA estimated that consumers could spend nearly $ 200 billion less next year just because of higher taxes , about four times the amount that shoppers spent during the \u201c Black Friday \u201d weekend in 2011 . The administration timed the release of the report for \u201c Cyber Monday , \u201d the biggest online shopping day of the year , when retailers offer heavy discounts for shoppers on the Web , particularly on electronics .\nThe administration \u2019 s release of the report seemed a calculated effort to build support for President Obama \u2019 s position in negotiations with Congress to avert the so-called \u201c fiscal cliff , \u201d a mix of tax increases and automatic spending cuts due to take effect in January . Mr. Obama is urging lawmakers first to approve an extension of tax cuts for the middle class and to address tax rates for wealthier families later .
