    "content": "The U.S. stock market has had an extraordinary week , with the broad S & P 500 index rising nearly 12 percent since Monday . Investors seem to believe that the actions of the Federal Reserve in particular \u2014 which announced a new $ 2.3 trillion effort to support local governments and small- to mid-sized businesses \u2014 will substantially limit the economic damage caused by shelter-in-place orders and other physical-distancing efforts to combat the virus , and set the economy up for a quick rebound once the crisis is over .\nAre they right ? It 's impossible to know . That very uncertainty is a major reason why the Fed 's program , along with other government interventions to maintain payrolls and otherwise freeze the economy in place are a good idea . But the ultimate economic cost will be determined by the virus itself .\nConsider the following thought experiment . Suppose , for the sake of argument , that we knew that a safe and reliable cure for the novel coronavirus would be coming to market in six weeks , and that the drug was going to be distributed in massive quantities all over the country and indeed the world .\nIn that case , investors , business-owners and workers would all know with reasonable precision what they needed to do to weather the storm . All along the chain of economic activity , payments \u2014 rent to landlords , interest on loans , salaries to employees , bills to utilities \u2014 would need to be deferred for six weeks , after which the economy could simply open up again for business as usual . The government would still have a key role to play in cushioning the blow , particularly for employees at the end of the economic chain , and in coordinating economy-wide collective action , but the problem would mostly be a technical one .\nThat is not the world we live in . In fact , while there are a number of promising treatments being investigated , we have no real assurance that they will pan out , nor do we know how long they will take to get to market if they do . Similarly , the timeline for an effective vaccine is unknown . And in the meantime , we do n't know how much the economy will be able to open up without triggering new outbreaks , and how the shape of the economy will fundamentally need to change to adapt to the new semi-normal that follows the current pause .\nThat massive uncertainty is a huge economic drag \u2014 and is a far more important one than the pause itself . No business can plan financially for a completely unknown economic environment . Nor can any investor . The rational thing to do in such circumstances is simply to hoard cash \u2014 which is precisely how you get a depression .\nThe Fed 's interventions are aimed at preventing that from happening . Some of what the Fed is doing is familiar ; massive injections of liquidity lower the attractiveness of holding cash , luring money back into risky assets . But the massive lending to small businesses and local governments is very much not normal , but a necessary response to a very abnormal situation where the government deliberately shuts down the economy for a period of time . The objective is to discourage those entities from tightening their belts \u2014 not to shutter operations or lay off employees \u2014 and help them simply wait out the current pause .\nThey 're not just waiting out the current pause , though ; they 're waiting out the period of uncertainty . In a month or two , everyone will have a much better idea of what the economy is going to look like for an extended period until a cure and/or a vaccine comes available . We 'll know which businesses just are n't going to be viable , and which are going to be able to adapt . And that applies not only to businesses but to entire industries , from restaurants to commercial aviation .\nThat 's the tricky part . The federal government is basically paying everyone not to do too much planning during this period of extreme uncertainty , but to keep existing arrangements frozen in place as much as possible . That 's the right call right now ; if everyone tried to protect themselves in a situation of such high uncertainty , the collective cost would be shattering . Eventually , though , that planning has to happen \u2014 and that will necessitate real economic dislocations , potentially profound ones .\nMoreover , we actually want those transitions to happen . We do n't want the government 's role to be propping up businesses and industries that are not viable in a post-COVID-19 world .
