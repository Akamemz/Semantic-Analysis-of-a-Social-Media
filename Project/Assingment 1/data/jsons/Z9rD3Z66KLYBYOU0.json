    "content": "When it comes to taking opioids , the United States has the dubious honour of leading the world .\nFor every one million Americans , almost 50,000 doses of opioids are taken every day . That 's four times the rate in the UK .\nThere are often good reasons for taking opioids . Cancer patients use them for pain relief , as do patients recovering from surgery ( codeine and morphine are opioids , for example ) .\nBut take too many and you have a problem . And America certainly has a problem .\nIn two years , the town of Kermit in West Virginia received almost nine million opioid pills , according to a congressional committee .\nNationally , opioids killed more than 33,000 people in 2015 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nThat figure includes deaths from heroin , an illegal opioid . But almost half involved a prescription opioid - that is , a painkiller available from a pharmacy with a note from a doctor .\nSo why does America - more than any country in the world - have an opioid problem ?\nThere is more than one cause . But these are some of the most important .\nUnlike most European countries , the US does not have universal healthcare paid for by taxes .\nInstead , Americans must get their own insurance - usually via an employer or the government .\n`` Most insurance , especially for poor people , wo n't pay for anything but a pill , '' says Professor Judith Feinberg from the West Virginia University School of Medicine .\n`` Say you have a patient that 's 45 years old . They have lower back pain , you examine them , they have a muscle spasm .\n`` Really the best thing is physical therapy , but no one will pay for that . So doctors get very ready to pull out the prescription pad .\n`` Even if the insurance covers physical therapy , you probably need prior authorisation ( from the insurer ) - which is a lot of time and paperwork . ''\nThe CDC says opioid prescriptions have fallen by 18 % from their peak in 2010 . But the total is still three times higher than in 1999 .\nThe US and New Zealand are the only countries that allow prescription drugs to be advertised on television .\nAccording to the research firm Kantar , spending on advertising by pharmaceutical companies in the US reached $ 6.4 billion in 2016 - a rise of 64 % since 2012 .\nNone of the 10 most-advertised brands in 2016 was an opioid . But mass-marketing of drugs has an effect , says Professor Feinberg .\n`` As a clinician , people will come and say ' I saw this on TV - can you give me this drug ' .\n`` Sometimes they were so confused , they were already on the drug - they were using the brand name , where I used the generic name . ''\nIn 2015 , the American Medical Association called for a ban on adverts for prescription drugs . It did n't happen .\nThree months later , the extent of America 's opioid culture was seen at half-time of the Superbowl - the country 's most expensive advertising slot .\nA 60-second ad was devoted to opioid-induced constipation . The advert - paid for by AstraZeneca - advised sufferers to visit their doctor and `` ask about prescription treatment options '' .\nIn the US , it is common for drug companies to court doctors , in an effort to promote their products .\n`` When you 're a doctor in the US , these detailing people ( salespeople ) come in from the industry , '' says Professor Keith Humphreys from Stanford University .\n`` They are invariably smooth , friendly , attractive , sharply dressed , adorable , they 're giving out gifts to everybody . They host dinners , they sponsor conferences , they sponsor junkets .\nFor the past four years , the US government has published the amounts paid by drug and device companies to doctors and teaching hospitals .\nThe total in 2016 was more than $ 8bn . More than 630,000 physicians had payment records .\nFor example , Purdue Pharma - which makes OxyContin , a popular opioid painkiller - made almost 80,000 transactions in 2016 , worth more than $ 7m in total .\nIn 2016 , a study looked at the link between doctors , the free meals they received from drug companies , and the medication they prescribed .\nThe study found receiving free meals was `` associated with an increased rate of prescribing the promoted brand-name medication '' .\nPharmaceutical companies say their reps are merely sharing information with doctors . But Professor Humphreys says there is a `` corrupting '' influence .\n`` We need a pharma industry , it 's not that it 's wrong , '' he says . `` But you ca n't let the fox guard the hen house .\n`` I would create completely clear blue water between the people that manufacture drugs and all the training and operation of the healthcare system . ''\nPharmaceutical companies also spend money on health care workers and organisations in other countries .\nIn the UK in 2016 , companies gave \u00a3116m ( $ 153m ) to health workers and organisations for non-research and development in 2016 .\nBut , although the UK figure is 7 % higher than in 2015 , it is less than 2 % of the amount paid in the US .\nDr Richard Frank is professor of health economics at Harvard Business School , and served in the Health Department from 2009 to 2016 , during President Obama 's administration .\nHe thinks medical training in the US has not been good enough .\n`` Physicians have received almost no training in pain management , '' he says .\n`` Until recently they have been under some pretty important misconceptions about how addictive various products are . ''\nHe adds : `` A couple of years ago I testified before congress when I was in government . One of the representatives , before going into congress , was a thoracic surgeon .\n`` He noted that he had gotten almost no training in pain management - and what he had learned came entirely from the nursing staff he worked with . ''\nDr Frank says medical training is n't the only reason for America 's opioid problem . `` There 's plenty of blame to go round , '' he says .\n`` Doctors did n't learn anything about addiction at medical school , '' she says .\n`` That is now changing , but everyone who 's a doctor already , did n't learn anything . I learned about opioid drugs in the part of pharmacology where we learned about anaesthesia .\n`` Probably the whole topic of anaesthesia-like drugs was two hours . People do n't have much knowledge about opioids . There was no curriculum that includes addiction . ''\nIn 1980 , Dr Hershel Jick wrote a short letter to the New England Journal of Medicine .\nIt said that `` despite widespread use of narcotic drugs in hospitals , the development of addiction is rare in medical patients with no history of addiction '' .\nThe claim has been debunked , and the letter now carries an online warning note . But Dr Jick 's letter had a big impact .\nThis year , Canadian researchers said the letter had been cited 600 times - usually to claim opioids were n't addictive .\nIn the late 1990s the Veterans Health Administration - which runs healthcare for military veterans - pushed for pain to be recognised as the `` fifth vital sign '' .\nThis gave pain equal status with blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , and temperature .\nThen in 2001 , the Joint Commission - which certifies almost 21,000 US health organisations and programmes - established standards for pain assessment and treatment .\nIn 2016 , the JC released a statement that claimed that `` everyone is looking for someone to blame '' for the opioid problem . It insisted that its 2001 standards did not `` require the use of drugs to manage a patient 's pain '' .\nBut Professor Feinberg says the VHA and JC 's moves meant doctors were under pressure to prescribe strong painkillers - such as opioids - when they may not have been necessary .\n`` By the time you reach middle age , it 's a rare person who does n't ache somewhere , '' she says .\nShe adds that - in a country where patients rate their doctors , and low ratings can affect doctors ' earnings - the score can be influenced by whether patients receive opioids .\nSome Americans , says Professor Keith Humphreys from Stanford University , believe that life is `` fixable '' .\n`` I 'm 51 , '' he says . `` If I go to an American doctor and say 'Hey - I ran the marathon I used to run when I was 30 , now I 'm all sore , fix me ' , my doctor will probably try to fix me .\n`` If you do that in France the doctor would say 'It 's life , have a glass of wine - what do you want from me ?
