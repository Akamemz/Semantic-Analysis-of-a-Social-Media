Whenever I enter the building , what with all the lasers and retina scanners and pressure-sensitive floors , the music from Get Smart plays in my head . If you don \u2019 t know what Get Smart is/was then you probably aren \u2019 t a middle-aged dude who watched too much TV after school ( \u201c In other words , \u2018 Your base \u2019 \u201d \u2014 The Couch ) .\nAnyway , it was good to see so many folks from the old days as well as the young \u2019 ns populating the place .

The writer with the second most , gets a set of steak knives . . . where are you going , Ms. Timpf ? \u201d\nSpeaking of Cooke and French , they should do a podcast together called \u201c French Cooke. \u201d Also , speaking of those guys , they \u2019 ve done most of the heavy lifting on this notion that the Never Trump conservatives have \u201c surrendered \u201d to Trump . But I would like to throw in my two or three cents , as I get grief from the Left and the Right everyday about this stuff . From the Left , I \u2019 m told that if I don \u2019 t crap out my spleen in panic every 20 minutes begging the Electoral College to \u201c stop Trump \u201d ( by asking the House of Representatives to elect Trump ) , it means I have surrendered entirely and that I was never really \u201c never Trump \u201d in the first place .\nThis is nonsense .

I can go on TV and say that Trump has been brilliant at x and y but I \u2019 m still concerned about z , and all I \u2019 ll hear is the whistle of incoming ALL CAPS arrows : GET OVER IT ! HE WON ! GO AWAY NEVER TRUMPERS ! HOW DO I TURN OFF CAPLOCK ! ! ! 111 ! Etc .\nThe thing is : Never Trump is over . Never Trump was about the GOP primary and the general election , not the presidency . The Left wants to claim it must be a permanent movement , denying the legitimacy of Trump \u2019 s election forever , or we were never serious . Well , that \u2019 s not what we \u2014 or at least I \u2014 signed up for .\nBut you know what is alive and well ? Always Trump . These are the folks who think Trump must be defended and celebrated no matter what he does or says . In fairness , some of these people are still auditioning for jobs in the administration and know they must follow the rhetorical principle of \u201c not one step backward. \u201d But others are just normal Americans who love Trump and think that I \u2019 m somehow duty-bound to say I love him too , no matter what he does . Well , I didn \u2019 t sign up for that either .\nWhenever I say this , someone shrieks at me about my \u201c arrogance \u201d or \u201c hubris \u201d \u2014 for reasons I truly can not fathom . But I \u2019 ll say it again : I \u2019 m going to call \u2019 em like I see \u2019 em and wait and see if I was wrong about Trump . So far , I \u2019 ve said that most of his cabinet picks have been a pleasant and welcome surprise . But he \u2019 s also done plenty of things that make me feel like I had him pegged all along . We only have one president at a time \u2014 and the guy isn \u2019 t even president yet . I \u2019 ll give him a chance . But I won \u2019 t lie for him either .\nSo , the other week a friend of mine \u2014 another columnist type \u2014 pointed something out to me . There are already plenty of opportunities to say \u201c I told you so \u201d about Trump , the problem is people don \u2019 t care . I \u2019 ve been writing for over a year about how conservatism is getting corrupted by populism and nationalism , but when everybody is a populist nationalist who do I get to say \u201c I told you so \u201d to ?\nAs Charlie Sykes notes today , all of the \u201c it \u2019 s a binary choice ! \u201d talk during the election forced Republicans not just to forgive Trump \u2019 s personal shortcomings and ideological deviations , but to embrace them . The hope was that after November 8 , the same logic that forced people to embrace the lesser of two evils would also force them to recognize that the lesser of two evils is not great . That hasn \u2019 t happened . Instead , we get Mike Pence throwing shade at the free market and the supposed defenders of conservative orthodoxy defending industrial policy .\nAnd now it \u2019 s Russia . Support for Putin among Republicans has grown by more than threefold since 2014 . I wonder why ? Do you think 37 percent of Republicans have studied the geopolitical situation closely and decided that Putin really isn \u2019 t such a bad sort ? Is Russia Today , the Kremlin-funded cable-TV channel , really that persuasive ?\nUsing 2012 Romney to beat up 2016 Obama is fine , but it \u2019 s not a killer argument to do that while implicitly agreeing with 2012 Obama .\nFrankly , I resent the fact that I even feel the need to explain how Putin is a bad guy , doing bad things , so I \u2019 m just going to skip that part and assert it . What \u2019 s particularly galling , though , is to listen to the Always Trump pundits spin themselves into a Gordian knot trying to defend Trump \u2019 s bromantic putinphilia . Here \u2019 s a typical defense I \u2019 ve heard from many Always Trump pundits ( that I \u2019 ll keep nameless , as I may see them at Fox \u2019 s Christmas party soon ) .\n\u201c First of all , wasn \u2019 t it President Obama who mocked Mitt Romney for calling Russia our No . 1 geopolitical foe ? \u201d\nThis is a fair , clean shot . Obama did beclown himself with his sick burn of Romney . And so did his defenders . But they can at least argue that events changed and so did their opinions . In other words , Obama & Co. are not necessarily hypocrites when they denounce Russia now , they \u2019 re merely implicitly conceding they were na\u00efve partisan asses when they thought Russia was the bees knees for so long .\nBut then , often in the same breath , the Always Trumper pivots , saying there \u2019 s no evidence Russia did anything wrong and there \u2019 s nothing amiss whatsoever with Trump \u2019 s fondness for Putin .\nWhich is it ? Were Obama & Co. wrong for mocking Romney or was Romney wrong for calling out Russia ?\nTrump and Romney fundamentally disagree about Russia . Using 2012 Romney to beat up 2016 Obama is fine , but it \u2019 s not a killer argument to do that while implicitly agreeing with 2012 Obama .\nSince it \u2019 s so close to Festivus , I will continue to air personal grievances . There has been a riot of whataboutism these days .\nI suppose I should back up and explain what \u201c whataboutism \u201d is .\nIn layman \u2019 s terms , whataboutism is the practice of deflecting a criticism of you or your side by pointing to the flaws of the critic and his or her side .\nApparently , American Cold Warriors coined the term to describe the favorite propaganda techniques of the Soviet Union . As The Economist magazine put it in 2008 , \u201c Any criticism of the Soviet Union ( Afghanistan , martial law in Poland , imprisonment of dissidents , censorship ) was met with a \u2018 What about . . . \u2019 ( apartheid South Africa , jailed trade-unionists , the Contras in Nicaragua , and so forth ) . \u201d\nWe saw a poignant resurgence in this classical form of whataboutism in the wake of the long overdue demise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro . \u201c You think Cuba is bad on human rights , what about America , where [ fill-in-the-blank with left-wing clich\u00e9s about how terrible America is ] . \u201d\nBut while the term \u201c whataboutism \u201d is of a relatively recent vintage , the practice itself is ancient and formally goes by the technical term \u201c tu quoque , \u201d meaning in Latin , \u201c you also. \u201d It \u2019 s one of the more famous logical fallacies ( a derivative of the appeal to hypocrisy ) , and it works like this : Your doctor tells you that you need to lose some weight or you \u2019 ll have heart attack . You respond , \u201c Oh yeah , doc , you \u2019 re not exactly a runway model either . \u201d\nNow it may be true that your doctor is just as fat as you . But that has no bearing on the legitimacy of the diagnosis . If I say you \u2019 re a slob , you might respond , \u201c You have no right to judge \u201d given my own messy habits . Whatever you may think of the right to judge per se ( personally , I think it keeps much of civilization afloat ) , that doesn \u2019 t change the underlying facts . My penchant for gluttony doesn \u2019 t make me wrong when I say you \u2019 re a glutton , even if it might make me a hypocrite . As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy puts it , \u201c The value of advice is not wholly dependent on the integrity of the advisor . \u201d\nSo , you can see how whataboutism is closely related to the vacuous and ubiquitous catchphrase \u201c you have no right to judge. \u201d But , regardless , as a way to change the subject , distract the audience , and generally muddy-up important distinctions and facts , whataboutism is invaluable . It \u2019 s a way of making a moral-equivalence argument while sounding like you \u2019 re making high-minded moral distinctions .\nAs a way to change the subject , distract the audience , and generally muddy-up important distinctions and facts , whataboutism is invaluable .\nAnd I should say , Trump does it all the time . When Joe Scarborough pointed out to him that Putin murders dissidents and journalists , Trump responded , \u201c Well , I think our country does a lot of killing too , Joe. \u201d Last summer , when the New York Times asked Trump what he thought of the brutal crackdown in Turkey that led to over 50,000 people thrown in jail , he responded . \u201c I think right now when it comes to civil liberties , our country has a lot of problems . . . \u201d\nThat said , Barack Obama may still be the world champion . His insistence that Americans have no right to get on their \u201c high horse \u201d about ISIS \u2019 s atrocities because of the misdeeds of Christians a thousand years ago remains the ne plus ultra of whataboutist asininity .\nNow , I don \u2019 t really mind whataboutist arguments across ideological lines . That is actually what a lot of intellectual fights should be about : holding the other side \u2014 and your own \u2014 to expressed principles when partisan winds change . There \u2019 s nothing wrong with holding Obama to the standards he leveled against Bush when it comes to things like the national debt or the toppling of Moammar Qaddafi . That \u2019 s the good kind of whataboutism .\nFor example , Charlie Cooke noted last week that liberals have been flirting with illiberalism for years and they didn \u2019 t care because they were winning . Liberals shot back that Charlie was a \u201c Whataboutist ! \u201d trying to deflect from Trump \u2019 s singular , democracy-destroying , concentrated , and sui generis evil .\nSorry , I don \u2019 t buy that . Charlie is critical of Trump and Obama . His point is that progressives don \u2019 t mind illiberalism when illiberalism advances their aims . ( If only I \u2019 d written a book or two that touched on this . ) Similarly , I criticized Barack Obama \u2019 s hostility to the free market and fondness for picking winners and losers . I don \u2019 t see why I should suddenly embrace those policies when/if Trump does it .\nWe are in a moment of peak whataboutism on the right . As a columnist , I get it . I even partake in it from time to time . For instance , I have more than once pointed out that the very same Democrats who hied to their fainting couches over Donald Trump \u2019 s denigration of the democratic system are now hell-bent on denigrating it even more . But I was critical when Trump did it too , so my consistency is secure .\nAnd this brings me to my grievance . What drives me crazy is when conservatives tell me I must use Obama or Hillary Clinton as the metric by which I judge Donald Trump . If I note that Trump said something stupid ( no really , it happens sometimes ) , the retort comes back , \u201c Well , he didn \u2019 t refer to 57 states ! \u201d or \u201c At least Trump didn \u2019 t pronounce it \u2018 corpse \u2019 man ! \u201d\nWell , okay . . . ? I criticized Obama about those things , too . What \u2019 s your point ?\nI mildly criticized Trump \u2019 s Taiwan call on its messaging and planning , but agreed with it in principle . The immediate response was : \u201c What about what Obama did in Cuba ! ? \u201d Sure as shinola , someone will respond to the above stuff about Putin , by saying , \u201c What about Hillary \u2019 s \u2018 reset \u2019 ! ? \u201d or , \u201c Don \u2019 t you remember when Obama said he \u2019 d be more flexible after the election ? Did you criticize that ! ? ! \u201d\nDuring the election , the case against Hillary was the case for Trump for a lot of people and for wholly legitimate reasons . But the election is over . On the post-election \u2588\u2588\u2588 cruise , I was on a panel with a respected conservative who said that we should measure every Trump policy against the yardstick of \u201c What would Hillary Clinton have done ? \u201d I \u2019 m grateful Hillary lost , of course , but that \u2019 s crazy . It \u2019 s also an invitation for my greatest pre-election worries to come true . \u201c At least he \u2019 s better than Hillary \u201d was a perfectly valid standard for conservatives in the voting booth . It is a suicidal standard for the conservative movement during a Trump presidency .\nSteve Hayes has been named the editor-in-chief of the Weekly Standard . Some may quibble that a guy recently on the terror watchlist probably shouldn \u2019 t get that job , but not me . I am too eager for the annual Summer Reading issue to be replaced with the annual Beer & Brats edition . The Fall Reading issue will obviously be all about the Packers and the glory of tailgating . \u201c Less Iraqi Kurds , More Cheese Curds ! \u201d \u201c Ken Starr ? Meh ! Bart Starr , Man. \u201d Of course , I \u2019 m kidding : Steve and Richard Starr ( the editor ) will do a fantastic job . But we should also congratulate Bill Kristol on more than two decades of success in building an influential and important new magazine at a time when a lot of old magazines went the way of the Dodo .\nI take particular joy from the announcement because a ) Steve is a friend , and b ) I \u2019 ve spent the last two years hearing from gleeful trolls ( and others ) that people like Steve and me were committing career suicide by not becoming cheerleaders for Trump . So , it \u2019 s nice to see the trend lines go the other way .\nOn that note , I \u2019 d also like to announce that I \u2019 ve renewed my contract with Fox News and I \u201c earned \u201d the title of Best Conservative Columnist over at Rightwing News . In a particularly brutal blow to some alt-righters , Ben Shapiro came in second ( I await the Downfall video ) . Anyway , I \u2019 ve been a contender many times , and I generally think such lists are problematic . In any random week , there are dozens columnists ( including several of my colleagues ) who do a better job than I do . But given the year I \u2019 ve had , and the fact it will annoy all the right people , I \u2019 ll take it with gratitude .\nCanine Update : I \u2019 ve been travelling a bunch , so I haven \u2019 t spent too much time with the beasts . I \u2019 m embarrassed to say that there \u2019 s growing evidence I \u2019 m being played by the canines . When I \u2019 m home , Zo\u00eb always tries to wake me up around 5:00 a.m. , as if her bladder could be used as a paint gun . This sets off Pippa who starts crying and whining , which gets Zo\u00eb even more worked up . \u201c We got ta go ! \u201d they shout . But , when I \u2019 m out of town , my wife usually wakes the docile and patient hounds around 6:45 and doesn \u2019 t take them out until after 7:30 .\nEarlier this week , I got a call from the Fair Jessica asking me if I could come home from the office because the dingo got out ( as in leapt out of the car window as she was pulling into the driveway ) and would not come back in .\nUsually we can bribe Zo\u00eb with a car ride or meat products . But no . She put her nose under her tail like a sled dog in the snow , and refused to budge . Unless you try to catch her . And then she springs up and runs away from you . ( Despite the impression of almost ninja-like lithe nimbleness I give off , I can not catch a dog that catches squirrels if she doesn \u2019 t want to be caught . ) So , I drove home to deal with a \u201c family emergency. \u201d I pulled up to the front yard and acted all excited to see her . She rolled on her back and let me rub her tummy . Then we just walked into the house . Apparently , she just missed her daddy .\nMy first column of the week was on the terrible-all-around Russia-hacking situation .\nIf you haven \u2019 t listened to the Russ Roberts interview with Thomas Leonard , author of Illiberal Reformers : Race , Eugenics , and American Economics in the Progressive Era , you really should . It \u2019 s fantastic ( if you \u2019 re into this stuff ) . I had a very wide range of responses to the discussion . I wrote hundreds of words in reaction to it , and then decided better of it because it sounded too much like special pleading or griping from me because so much of this was covered in Liberal Fascism . Still , Roberts , who is much , much , better read than I am was \u2014 to my real surprise \u2014 shocked to learn that Woodrow Wilson was a bad guy . If anything , Leonard goes very soft on Wilson ( yes , he was a racist , but he was awful in other ways too ) .\nRoberts was also shocked about Richard Ely , and in a way that surprised me even more . Roberts is of a libertarian bent and he knows where the bodies are buried in that world . And yet , he was caught off guard by how despicable ( and yet typical ) Ely was . Get that man some Murray Rothbard ( or Arnold Kling ! ) . Anyway , it \u2019 s kind of asinine to be all , \u201c You didn \u2019 t know that ! ? \u201d to a guy who is much better educated and smarter than me . But it was a shock all the same .\nIt is unlikely I will be filing this \u201c news \u201d letter next week as the full-on this-plane-is-out-of-coffee panic is setting in in my effort to finish my book . I will be in an undisclosed location writing furiously or making simulacrums of Devil \u2019 s Tower with mashed potatoes .\nLonely child stuck on a train on Christmas gets a surprise ( directed by Wes Anderson )\nNick Offerman drinks whiskey in front of a roaring holiday fire for 45 minutes\nBut at least it \u2019 s not as creepy as this AI \u2019 s attempt to write a Christmas song",

Obama did beclown himself with his sick burn of Romney. And so did his defenders. But they can at least argue that events changed and so did their opinions. In other words, Obama & Co. are not necessarily hypocrites when they denounce Russia now, they\u2019re merely implicitly conceding they were na\u00efve partisan asses when they thought Russia was the bees knees for so long.\n\nBut then, often in the same breath, the Always Trumper pivots, saying there\u2019s no evidence Russia did anything wrong and there\u2019s nothing amiss whatsoever with Trump\u2019s fondness for Putin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaitaminute.\n\nWhich is it? Were Obama & Co. wrong for mocking Romney or was Romney wrong for calling out Russia?\n\nTrump and Romney fundamentally disagree about Russia. Using 2012 Romney to beat up 2016 Obama is fine, but it\u2019s not a killer argument to do that while implicitly agreeing with 2012 Obama.\n\n#share#\n\nThe Perils of Whataboutism\n\nSince it\u2019s so close to Festivus, I will continue to air personal grievances. There has been a riot of whataboutism these days.\n\nI suppose I should back up and explain what \u201cwhataboutism\u201d is.\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, whataboutism is the practice of deflecting a criticism of you or your side by pointing to the flaws of the critic and his or her side.\n\nApparently, American Cold Warriors coined the term to describe the favorite propaganda techniques of the Soviet Union. As The Economist magazine put it in 2008, \u201cAny criticism of the Soviet Union (Afghanistan, martial law in Poland, imprisonment of dissidents, censorship) was met with a \u2018What about . . . \u2019 (apartheid South Africa, jailed trade-unionists, the Contras in Nicaragua, and so forth).\u201d\n\nWe saw a poignant resurgence in this classical form of whataboutism in the wake of the long overdue demise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. \u201cYou think Cuba is bad on human rights, what about America, where [fill-in-the-blank with left-wing clich\u00e9s about how terrible America is].\u201d\n\nBut while the term \u201cwhataboutism\u201d is of a relatively recent vintage, the practice itself is ancient and formally goes by the technical term \u201ctu quoque,\u201d meaning in Latin, \u201cyou also.\u201d It\u2019s one of the more famous logical fallacies (a derivative of the appeal to hypocrisy), and it works like this: Your doctor tells you that you need to lose some weight or you\u2019ll have heart attack. You respond, \u201cOh yeah, doc, you\u2019re not exactly a runway model either.\u201d\n\nNow it may be true that your doctor is just as fat as you. But that has no bearing on the legitimacy of the diagnosis. If I say you\u2019re a slob, you might respond, \u201cYou have no right to judge\u201d given my own messy habits. Whatever you may think of the right to judge per se (personally, I think it keeps much of civilization afloat), that doesn\u2019t change the underlying facts. My penchant for gluttony doesn\u2019t make me wrong when I say you\u2019re a glutton, even if it might make me a hypocrite. As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy puts it, \u201cThe value of advice is not wholly dependent on the integrity of the advisor.\u201d\n\nSo, you can see how whataboutism is closely related to the vacuous and ubiquitous catchphrase \u201cyou have no right to judge.\u201d But, regardless, as a way to change the subject, distract the audience, and generally muddy-up important distinctions and facts, whataboutism is invaluable. It\u2019s a way of making a moral-equivalence argument while sounding like you\u2019re making high-minded moral distinctions.\n\nAs a way to change the subject, distract the audience, and generally muddy-up important distinctions and facts, whataboutism is invaluable.\n\nAnd I should say, Trump does it all the time. When Joe Scarborough pointed out to him that Putin murders dissidents and journalists, Trump responded, \u201cWell, I think our country does a lot of killing too, Joe.\u201d Last summer, when the New York Times asked Trump what he thought of the brutal crackdown in Turkey that led to over 50,000 people thrown in jail, he responded. \u201cI think right now when it comes to civil liberties, our country has a lot of problems . . . \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, Barack Obama may still be the world champion. His insistence that Americans have no right to get on their \u201chigh horse\u201d about ISIS\u2019s atrocities because of the misdeeds of Christians a thousand years ago remains the ne plus ultra of whataboutist asininity.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t really mind whataboutist arguments across ideological lines. That is actually what a lot of intellectual fights should be about: holding the other side \u2014 and your own \u2014 to expressed principles when partisan winds change. There\u2019s nothing wrong with holding Obama to the standards he leveled against Bush when it comes to things like the national debt or the toppling of Moammar Qaddafi. That\u2019s the good kind of whataboutism.\n\nFor example, Charlie Cooke noted last week that liberals have been flirting with illiberalism for years and they didn\u2019t care because they were winning. Liberals shot back that Charlie was a \u201cWhataboutist!\u201d trying to deflect from Trump\u2019s singular, democracy-destroying, concentrated, and sui generis evil.\n\nSorry, I don\u2019t buy that. Charlie is critical of Trump and Obama. His point is that progressives don\u2019t mind illiberalism when illiberalism advances their aims. (If only I\u2019d written a book or two that touched on this.) Similarly, I criticized Barack Obama\u2019s hostility to the free market and fondness for picking winners and losers. I don\u2019t see why I should suddenly embrace those policies when/if Trump does it.\n\nWe are in a moment of peak whataboutism on the right. As a columnist, I get it. I even partake in it from time to time. For instance, I have more than once pointed out that the very same Democrats who hied to their fainting couches over Donald Trump\u2019s denigration of the democratic system are now hell-bent on denigrating it even more. But I was critical when Trump did it too, so my consistency is secure.\n\nAnd this brings me to my grievance. What drives me crazy is when conservatives tell me I must use Obama or Hillary Clinton as the metric by which I judge Donald Trump. If I note that Trump said something stupid (no really, it happens sometimes), the retort comes back, \u201cWell, he didn\u2019t refer to 57 states!\u201d or \u201cAt least Trump didn\u2019t pronounce it \u2018corpse\u2019 man!\u201d\n\nWell, okay . . . ? I criticized Obama about those things, too. What\u2019s your point?\n\nI mildly criticized Trump\u2019s Taiwan call on its messaging and planning, but agreed with it in principle. The immediate response was: \u201cWhat about what Obama did in Cuba!?\u201d Sure as shinola, someone will respond to the above stuff about Putin, by saying, \u201cWhat about Hillary\u2019s \u2018reset\u2019!?\u201d or, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember when Obama said he\u2019d be more flexible after the election? Did you criticize that!?!\u201d\n\nAnd my answer is: \u201cUh, yeah.\u201d\n\nDuring the election, the case against Hillary was the case for Trump for a lot of people and for wholly legitimate reasons. But the election is over. On the post-election National Review cruise, I was on a panel with a respected conservative who said that we should measure every Trump policy against the yardstick of \u201cWhat would Hillary Clinton have done?\u201d I\u2019m grateful Hillary lost, of course, but that\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s also an invitation for my greatest pre-election worries to come true. \u201cAt least he\u2019s better than Hillary\u201d was a perfectly valid standard for conservatives in the voting booth. It is a suicidal standard for the conservative movement during a Trump presidency.\n\nGet Free Exclusive NR Content\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nSome very exciting news:\n\nSteve Hayes has been named the editor-in-chief of the Weekly Standard. Some may quibble that a guy recently on the terror watchlist probably shouldn\u2019t get that job, but not me. I am too eager for the annual Summer Reading issue to be replaced with the annual Beer & Brats edition. The Fall Reading issue will obviously be all about the Packers and the glory of tailgating. \u201cLess Iraqi Kurds, More Cheese Curds!\u201d \u201cKen Starr? Meh! Bart Starr, Man.\u201d Of course, I\u2019m kidding: Steve and Richard Starr (the editor) will do a fantastic job. But we should also congratulate Bill Kristol on more than two decades of success in building an influential and important new magazine at a time when a lot of old magazines went the way of the Dodo.\n\n\u2018Less Iraqi Kurds, More Cheese Curds!\u2019\n\nI take particular joy from the announcement because a) Steve is a friend, and b) I\u2019ve spent the last two years hearing from gleeful trolls (and others) that people like Steve and me were committing career suicide by not becoming cheerleaders for Trump. So, it\u2019s nice to see the trend lines go the other way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that note, I\u2019d also like to announce that I\u2019ve renewed my contract with Fox News and I \u201cearned\u201d the title of Best Conservative Columnist over at Rightwing News. In a particularly brutal blow to some alt-righters, Ben Shapiro came in second (I await the Downfall video). Anyway, I\u2019ve been a contender many times, and I generally think such lists are problematic. In any random week, there are dozens columnists (including several of my colleagues) who do a better job than I do. But given the year I\u2019ve had, and the fact it will annoy all the right people, I\u2019ll take it with gratitude.\n\nCanine Update: I\u2019ve been travelling a bunch, so I haven\u2019t spent too much time with the beasts. I\u2019m embarrassed to say that there\u2019s growing evidence I\u2019m being played by the canines. When I\u2019m home, Zo\u00eb always tries to wake me up around 5:00 a.m., as if her bladder could be used as a paint gun. This sets off Pippa who starts crying and whining, which gets Zo\u00eb even more worked up. \u201cWe gotta go!\u201d they shout. But, when I\u2019m out of town, my wife usually wakes the docile and patient hounds around 6:45 and doesn\u2019t take them out until after 7:30.\n\nEarlier this week, I got a call from the Fair Jessica asking me if I could come home from the office because the dingo got out (as in leapt out of the car window as she was pulling into the driveway) and would not come back in.\n\nUsually we can bribe Zo\u00eb with a car ride or meat products. But no. She put her nose under her tail like a sled dog in the snow, and refused to budge. Unless you try to catch her. And then she springs up and runs away from you. (Despite the impression of almost ninja-like lithe nimbleness I give off, I cannot catch a dog that catches squirrels if she doesn\u2019t want to be caught.) So, I drove home to deal with a \u201cfamily emergency.\u201d I pulled up to the front yard and acted all excited to see her. She rolled on her back and let me rub her tummy. Then we just walked into the house. Apparently, she just missed her daddy.\n\nMy first column of the week was on the terrible-all-around Russia-hacking situation.\n\nOne, perhaps two, cheers for Ayn Rand.\n\nWhat to make of the plutocrats in Trump\u2019s midst.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t listened to the Russ Roberts interview with Thomas Leonard, author of Illiberal Reformers: Race, Eugenics, and American Economics in the Progressive Era, you really should. It\u2019s fantastic (if you\u2019re into this stuff). I had a very wide range of responses to the discussion. I wrote hundreds of words in reaction to it, and then decided better of it because it sounded too much like special pleading or griping from me because so much of this was covered in Liberal Fascism. Still, Roberts, who is much, much, better read than I am was \u2014 to my real surprise \u2014 shocked to learn that Woodrow Wilson was a bad guy. If anything, Leonard goes very soft on Wilson (yes, he was a racist, but he was awful in other ways too).\n\nRoberts was also shocked about Richard Ely, and in a way that surprised me even more. Roberts is of a libertarian bent and he knows where the bodies are buried in that world. And yet, he was caught off guard by how despicable (and yet typical) Ely was. Get that man some Murray Rothbard (or Arnold Kling!). Anyway, it\u2019s kind of asinine to be all, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that!?\u201d to a guy who is much better educated and smarter than me. But it was a shock all the same.\n\nIt is unlikely I will be filing this \u201cnews\u201dletter next week as the full-on this-plane-is-out-of-coffee panic is setting in in my effort to finish my book. I will be in an undisclosed location writing furiously or making simulacrums of Devil\u2019s Tower with mashed potatoes.\n\nAnd now, the weird stuff, Christmas-themed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebby\u2019s Friday Links\n\nSanta Claus grants final wish to dying child\n\nHow A Charlie Brown Christmas almost wasn\u2019t\n\nA history of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\n\nLonely child stuck on a train on Christmas gets a surprise (directed by Wes Anderson)\n\nHow to appease the household gods this holiday season\n\nThe Night Before Christmas read in 27 celebrity impressions\n\nHarvesting Christmas Trees by helicopter\n\nNick Offerman drinks whiskey in front of a roaring holiday fire for 45 minutes\n\nArizona\u2019s Tumbleweed Christmas Tree\n\nA very Rube Goldberg Christmas\n\nA (real) Jimi Hendrix Christmas medley\n\nA (fake, but cool) Led Zeppelin Christmas medley\n\nA (real, but awful) Pink Floyd Christmas song\n\nShane Black and Christmas\n\nA Wax Royal Family, in ugly Christmas sweaters\n\nAwkward family Christmas photos\n\nDominos (unsuccessfully) trains reindeer to deliver Pizza in Japan\n\nCrashed Enterprise is a gingerbread masterpiece\n\nCreepy Victorian Christmas cards\n\nWhy kids are unreasonably terrified of Santa Claus\n\nBut they are all-too-reasonably terrified of Krampus\n\nAmerica\u2019s most common Christmas-related injuries\n\nHorrifying snowmen\n\nA Christmas nightmare: 100 Christmas songs played simultaneously\n\nBut at least it\u2019s not as creepy as this AI\u2019s attempt to write a Christmas song\n\nMillennials ruin Christmas\n\nVenezuela\u2019s socialist government is stealing Christmas toys",
