    "content": "How The Relationship Between Trump And His Spy Chiefs Soured\nEven when he 's praising his spy chiefs , President Trump ca n't resist taking a swipe .\nThe instinct was on full display this past weekend , as he announced the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .\n`` Thank you , as well , to the great intelligence professionals who helped make this very successful journey possible , '' he said in an address from the White House on Sunday .\nHis intelligence officials are `` spectacular , '' `` great patriots , '' the president went on .\nBut then , this : `` And it 's really a deserving name , intelligence . I have dealt with some people that are n't very intelligent , having to do with intel . ''\nEven while proclaiming an undisputed intelligence and military success , Trump took a moment to needle and to complain about `` poor leadership '' and time wasted by U.S. intelligence in the past .\nTrump 's hostility to the intelligence community has been relentless . He talks frequently of the `` deep state '' and `` witch hunts '' that are out to get him .\nAnd that was all before a whistleblower complaint revealed concerns about a White House phone call with Ukraine , which has sparked the impeachment inquiry now underway . That whistleblower is reported to be a current employee of the CIA .\n`` It did not surprise me that ultimately an intelligence officer was the person who was going to blow the whistle on what the president did , '' says Leon Panetta , who was director of the CIA from 2009 to 2011 under President Barack Obama .\nThe current impeachment drama highlights the tension between Trump and the U.S. intelligence community . But the relationship has been tense since even before Trump took office . Over the course of his presidency , a number of notable events have strained that relationship further . Now , former intelligence chiefs warn that the president 's suspicion of his spy agencies could pose a danger to U.S. national security .\nThis story of mistrust could have started a dozen different places .\nHere 's one : Sept. 26 , 2016 , during the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton .\n`` I do n't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC , '' then-candidate Donald Trump said , referring to the Democratic National Committee .\n`` I mean , it could be Russia , but it could also be China . It could also be lots of other people . It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds , OK ? '' he said .\nBut by then , candidate Trump was already receiving classified intelligence briefings . And intelligence officials were already privately telling reporters , including me , that it was the Kremlin that hacked the servers of the DNC .\nIn November 2016 , Trump was elected . And by the following January \u2014 two weeks before the inauguration and after weeks of his taking aim at U.S. intelligence \u2014 the president-elect sat down for a top-secret briefing at Trump Tower in New York City .\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper , along with the heads of the CIA , the FBI and the National Security Agency , had traveled to New York for the unenviable task of informing Trump that they were about to publish a report that said Russian leader Vladimir Putin personally ordered an influence campaign to try to help him win .\n`` He had great difficulty , as did his team , accepting the assertion that the Russians interfered , '' Clapper said in a recent interview with NPR .\nWhile he 'd been apprehensive beforehand , Clapper says the Trump Tower meeting was cordial .\n`` But I do think the end result was reflected in the attempt to draft a press statement while we were still there , in which they wanted to quote us as saying that the Russian interference had no impact on the outcome of the election , which we could not , did not say , we were n't chartered to assess that , '' Clapper says .\nA few days after the Trump Tower meeting \u2014 but still before he had taken the oath of office as president \u2014 Trump tweeted a comment comparing U.S. intelligence to Nazis , when Clapper still led all 17 U.S. spy agencies .\n`` I was taken aback , '' Clapper recalls . `` I was very disturbed about it , so much so that I put a call to then President-elect Trump . Amazingly enough , he took the call . And I tried to appeal to his higher instincts , I guess , by telling him that he was inheriting a treasure in the form of the national intelligence community . ''\nI asked Clapper to revisit this history because it shows how poisoned the well between Trump and the intelligence community was even before Donald Trump was sworn in as president . Because after that , it got worse .\nClapper recalls that he was heartened when he heard that the first place Trump was going to visit after the inauguration was the CIA .\n`` And I thought , well , naive me . I thought , well , perhaps my message got through to him , '' Clapper says . `` Not so . ''\nOn Jan. 21 , 2017 , Trump 's first full day in office \u2014 after weeks of mocking intelligence officials \u2014 the president 's motorcade rolled out to CIA headquarters . He told staffers there he was now with them `` a thousand percent . ''\n`` Maybe sometimes you have n't gotten the backing that you 've wanted , and you 're going to get so much backing , '' Trump told the crowd . `` Maybe you 're going to say please do n't give us so much backing . ''\nSo far , so good . But at some point \u2014 standing in what the CIA considers sacred space , before a wall of stars representing officers who 've died in the line of duty \u2014 he started saying things that were provably untrue . For instance , falsely inflating the size of the crowd at his inauguration .\nThe digression about the crowd size went on for a while . Ask a CIA official to name a low point in relations with this White House , and this is one of two many will point to .\nHere 's the other : July 16 , 2018 , Trump 's summit with Putin in Helsinki .\nDuring a news briefing , all the bad blood between Trump and his spy chiefs was distilled to a single question , from Jonathan Lemire , a reporter with The Associated Press .\n`` Just now , President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016 . Every U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did . My first question for you , sir , is who do you believe ? '' Lemire asked .\n`` My people came to me , [ then Director of National Intelligence ] Dan Coats came to me and some others , '' Trump said . `` They said they think it 's Russia . I have President Putin , he just said it 's not Russia . I will say this . I do n't see any reason why it would be . ''\nThis , says Panetta , is `` one of the most tragic moments in the history of the relationship between a United States president and the intelligence community . ''\nPanetta said his specific beef was the message Trump 's words sent to the rest of the world .\n`` That we were dealing with a president who has no sense of the importance of intelligence and the important role our intelligence people play in protecting the security of our country , '' Panetta says .\nOne final event : Jan. 29 , 2019 , Room 216 of the Senate Hart Office Building .\nThe current director of the CIA , Gina Haspel , was testifying about Iran .\nOverall , it was typical dry congressional testimony . But what was significant was that Haspel , and other officials , were stating quietly , but firmly , that at that point Iran was in compliance with the nuclear deal .\nAnd not only on Iran , but also on Russia and North Korea , the testimony by Trump 's spy chiefs was jarringly at odds with Trump 's own rhetoric . So much so that the next day , Trump hit back on Twitter , calling `` the Intelligence people ... passive and na\u00efve '' and adding : `` Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school ! ''\nI 've thought back to that moment \u2014 the disrespect toward Haspel and her colleagues on full display \u2014 as the impeachment inquiry has blown up .\n`` When I heard , by the news reports , that this whistleblower is apparently a CIA employee , I just thought , my God , this is all [ Haspel ] needs now , '' John Rizzo , who worked as a CIA lawyer for 34 years , recalls .\nAsked whether he saw irony in the fact that \u2014 given Trump 's relationship with intelligence leaders \u2014 it 's now a CIA whistleblower who appears to be bringing the country to the brink of impeachment , Rizzo says , `` ironic is one way to put it . ''\n`` Honestly , I almost wish that the whistleblower had been from somewhere else in the government , not from the CIA , because , as I say , this brings the whole relationship between President Trump and the intelligence community full circle . And possibly irretrievable . ''\n`` This is the apotheosis of what could possibly go wrong to even further fracture the relationship , '' Rizzo says .\nComplicating things further : The inspector general of the intelligence community , Michael Atkinson , has judged the whistleblower complaint both urgent and credible . But in a letter dated Aug. 26 , he also writes that the whistleblower has `` arguable political bias ... in favor of a rival candidate . ''\nThat prompts an obvious question : Is there a danger that the president will see that as confirmation of a deep state that is out to get him ?\nJames Clapper believes that danger exists \u2014 and he says it could lead to national security risks .\n`` One risk is deeper skepticism about accepting anything the intelligence committee says , which is profoundly dangerous to the country , '' Clapper says . `` I 've thought about a situation where we had something of the magnitude of a 9/11 attack , God forbid , where he would be highly dependent on what the intelligence community can tell him . And whether he accepts that or is skeptical about it \u2014 I think that would pose real risk . ''\nOn Monday , I circled back to Clapper , who has served both Republican and Democratic presidents going back to John F. Kennedy , for his response to the news of Baghdadi 's death \u2014 and to President Trump 's praise for the intelligence officers who helped make it happen .\n`` If the Intelligence Community generates intelligence that the President likes , he praises them , '' Clapper wrote in response . `` If it generates intelligence he does n't like , he shoots the messengers .
