One such bipartisan bill to approve the pipeline was introduced Thursday . Reid has not yet telegraphed what he 'll allow , with a vote potentially just days away .\n`` Originally , it was supposed to be a sense of the Senate . Now they said they want it an up or down on a piece of legislation . They ca n't decide what it is , '' Reid told reporters . `` I 'm open to anything that will move energy efficiency . ''\nThat 's a reference to a bipartisan energy efficiency bill in the Senate sponsored by New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Ohio Republican Sen . Rob Portman , which will be debated and is expected to come up for a vote next week .\nThat 's the debate where some lawmakers want to squeeze in Keystone .\n`` In that debate , we ought to have a binding vote on the Keystone pipeline that would force that issue of the American people , '' South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune told reporters . `` We actually ought to have a vote that matters . ''\nAfter the Obama administration once again punted on a Keystone decision last month , Reid is facing calls for congressional action from his left and right flanks .\nAmong the at-risk 2014 Democrats is Louisiana Sen.

''\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney issued this warning to lawmakers : `` What we 've seen in the past when Congress has passed legislation it has actually slowed the process down .
