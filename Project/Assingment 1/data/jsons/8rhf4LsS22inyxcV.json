In three of the states that matter most in November , the surveys point to a race much closer than the national polls , which have Clinton pegged to a significant , mid-single-digit advantage over Trump , suggest .\nThe race is so close that it 's within the margin of error in each of the three states . Trump leads by three points in Florida \u2014 the closest state in the 2012 election \u2014 42 percent to 39 percent . In Ohio , the race is tied , 41 percent to 41 percent . And in Pennsylvania \u2014 which has n't voted for a Republican presidential nominee since 1988 \u2014 Trump leads , 43 percent to 41 percent .\nClinton 's campaign responded to the surveys by cautioning that while the swing states were always expected to be close , the urgent stakes of a possible Trump election remain high .\n`` We know the battlegrounds are going to be close til the end . That 's why we need to keep working so hard , '' Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon tweeted Wednesday morning . `` Trump is a serious danger , folks . ''\nTrump , meanwhile , thanked his supporters for the strong showing , tweeting a celebratory series of images featuring Fox News graphics showing the Quinnipiac results . `` Thank you ! '' Trump tweeted , adding `` # ImWithYou , '' an implicit shot at the Clinton campaign 's initial slogan , `` I 'm With Her . ''\nIn another blow to Clinton , a McClatchy-Marist poll of registered voters nationwide released on Wednesday showed Clinton 's lead over Trump slip to three points , 42 percent to 39 percent , after leading by six points in a Fox News poll conducted in late June .\nBut other polls give Clinton an advantage in all three states . Including the new Quinnipiac surveys , \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Battleground State polling average \u2014 which include the five most-recent polls in each state \u2014 gives Clinton a 3.2-point lead in Florida , a 2.8-point edge in Ohio and a larger , 4.6-point advantage in Pennsylvania .\nBy Wednesday afternoon , a quartet of battleground polls painted a hazy picture of the race in those three states , as well as in Colorado and Wisconsin . The latest NBC News/Marist/Wall Street Journal polls showed Clinton up by three points against Trump in Iowa ( 42 percent to 39 percent ) , tied in Ohio ( 41 percent to 41 percent ) and up by nine points in Pennsylvania ( 45 percent to 36 percent ) , in contrast to her two-point deficit in the Quinnipiac poll .\nMonmouth University 's survey of likely Colorado voters found Clinton with a significant 13-point advantage , while Trump cut into Clinton 's Wisconsin advantage by five points compared to last month , trailing 45 percent to 41 percent compared to last month , when Clinton led 46 percent to 37 percent .\nWhile the Quinnipiac results are eye-popping , they don \u2019 t represent any significant movement \u2014 except in Florida . In three rounds of polling over the past two months , the race has moved from a four-point Trump lead in Ohio in the first survey , then tied in the next two polls . In Pennsylvania , Clinton led by one point in the first two polls and now trails by two .\nBut in Florida , the race has bounced around . Clinton led by one point in the first poll two months ago , but she opened up an eight-point lead in June \u2014 a lead that has been erased and more in the new Quinnipiac survey .\nThe polls from the Connecticut-based school are likely to be met with some skepticism . When Quinnipiac released their first round of polls in the same three states two months ago , they prompted a round of sniping from Democrats and an F-bomb on Twitter from Nate Silver , the FiveThirtyEight founder who has built a career using poll results to make political predictions .\nBut subsequent polls later confirmed the May Quinnipiac surveys : Trump pulled virtually even with Clinton nationally after knocking out his rivals for the GOP nomination .\nIt \u2019 s possible the results of the FBI investigation into Clinton \u2019 s private email server dating back to her service as secretary of state \u2014 FBI Director James Comey called Clinton and her staff \u201c extremely careless , \u201d even as he said the government shouldn \u2019 t press charges because there wasn \u2019 t evidence of criminal intent \u2014 are driving Clinton \u2019 s poll numbers down leading into the conventions , typically a critical time for campaigns .\nIn the poll release , the school suggested the investigation could have played a role , pointing to other lingering questions about Clinton \u2019 s honesty and trustworthiness . \u201c While there is no definite link between Clinton \u2019 s drop in Florida and the U.S. Justice Department decision not to prosecute her for her handling of emails , \u201d Quinnipiac pollster Peter Brown said , \u201c she has lost ground to Trump on questions which measure moral standards and honesty . \u201d\nBut the Quinnipiac polls are imperfect measures of a post-email investigation race . That \u2019 s because , like many of the school \u2019 s other polls , they were conducted over an unusually lengthy , 12-day time period : June 30 through July 11 .\nThe national polls conducted since Comey \u2019 s statement are mixed : Clinton posted a 3-point lead in this week \u2019 s NBC News/SurveyMonkey online tracking poll , down from a 5-point lead the week prior . Morning Consult , another online tracking poll , gave Clinton identical 1-point leads in the days before and after Comey \u2019 s statement .\nOverall , Clinton leads by 4.3 points in the latest national HuffPost Pollster average , and she has a 3.7-point advantage in the RealClearPolitics average .\nThe polling in other battleground states since the announcement are also cloudy . Monmouth University surveys conducted after the Comey statement gave Clinton a 4-point lead in Nevada \u2014 but showed Trump ahead by two points in Iowa .\nIn the Quinnipiac polls , there are warning signs for both candidates in all three states . First , despite near-universal name-ID , neither candidate can break out of the low 40s on the ballot test . That points to two very unpopular candidates .\nBut , in a reversal from earlier surveys , it \u2019 s a more acute problem for Clinton . Clinton \u2019 s unfavorable ratings ( 59 percent in Florida , 60 percent in Ohio , 65 percent in Pennsylvania ) are higher than Trump \u2019 s ( 54 percent in Florida , 59 percent in Ohio , 57 percent in Pennsylvania ) in all three battleground states . And majorities in all three states \u2014 which together account for 67 electoral votes , or nearly a quarter of the 270 necessary to win the presidency \u2014 have a \u201c very unfavorable \u201d view of Clinton .\nAnother measure of voters \u2019 ambivalence about Clinton in the Quinnipiac poll : a second ballot-test question , this time adding two third-party candidates to the mix . When voters are asked to consider the general election again , this time given the option of choosing Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein , Trump \u2019 s advantage over Clinton grows in each state . Trump leads on the four-way ballot by five points in Florida , one point in Ohio and six points in Pennsylvania .\nThere are some eyebrow-raising results from the polls , however . On the two-way ballot test in Florida , Clinton trails Trump despite the Republican winning just 21 percent of non-white voters in the increasingly diverse state .\nIn Ohio , Clinton wins 90 percent of Democrats , but Trump only captures 77 percent of Republicans , putting him at a significant disadvantage . In Pennsylvania , where Democrats outnumber Republicans by close to 10 percentage points , both candidates are at 82 percent among their own partisans , with Trump only three points ahead among self-identified independents .\nFormer presidential candidate Herman Cain on Wednesday said he was not surprised by Trump 's upswing .\n`` And that 's because Donald Trump 's substance is finally starting to cut through some of the media clutter and Hillary Clinton 's shallowness is also starting to emerge .

'' `` This is the fact that the middle class of this country is in trouble .
