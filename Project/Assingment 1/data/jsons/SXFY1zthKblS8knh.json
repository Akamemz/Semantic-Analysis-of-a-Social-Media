No indictment by Special Counsel Robert Mueller . Mr. Trump \u2019 s declaration of a national emergency for a border wall remained in tact . As the President lunched at the Capitol with Republican senators , the House of Representatives stumbled to override his veto of a measure to terminate the national emergency .\nCONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS RATTLED BY TRUMP 'S PIVOT TO OBAMACARE FIGHT AFTER MUELLER SUMMARY\nLater on Tuesday , senators would cast ballots on a procedural vote to start debate on the Green New Deal , drafted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , engineered the roll call to shine a spotlight on Ocasio-Cortez \u2019 s climate change blueprint . McConnell wanted to bait Senate Democrats -- vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination -- into taking a stand on Ocasio-Cortez \u2019 s controversial gambit .\nAnd then the President offered this nugget to reporters as he ducked into the Senate GOP lunch :\n\u201c The Republican party will soon be known as the part of health care , \u201d boasted Mr. Trump .\nYou \u2019 ll excuse the dry cleaning bills of Republican senators who rushed their neckties to the drycleaners after nearly choking on their Senate bean soup in the luncheon .\nThis came just hours after the Justice Department announced it would attempt to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) in court .\n\u201c The human costs of this decision will be profound , \u201d suggested Sen. Joe Manchin , D-W.Va. , a moderate Democrat who represents a state President Trump won by 42 points , carrying all 55 counties . \u201c Twenty million Americans will be left without the health insurance they rely on . The 133 million Americans and 800,000 West Virginians with a pre-existing condition will be at risk of losing their access to health insurance . \u201d\nObamaCare has never been popular . Republicans bristle about the health care law . But Republicans have been particularly maladroit when it comes to ditching the ACA .

Multiple efforts to pass another health care measure swerved violently into the political ditch .\n\u201c The President has offered no plan . None , \u201d said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md . \u201c He talks about it . He doesn \u2019 t do anything about it \u2013 which is true of so much of the legislation he has talked about . \u201d\n\u201c They simply can not help themselves , \u201d said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries , D-N.Y. , about the GOP \u2019 s latest charge to unwind ObamaCare . \u201c Republicans have shown their true colors . \u201d\nThe very existence and staying power of ObamaCare perturbs Republicans . There \u2019 s a reason why the President tore again into the late Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , a few weeks ago on Twitter . Mr. Trump never forgave McCain for the vote he took nearly two years ago to scuttle the GOP \u2019 s repeal and replace effort . McCain \u2019 s decision stung President Trump , handing him one of the biggest defeats of his term .\n\u201c Remember , in ( President ) Trump \u2019 s mind , ending ObamaCare is about exacting revenge on McCain , \u201d said one source who asked they not be identified .\nOn Wednesday , the President bragged that \u201c if the Supreme Court rules that ObamaCare is out , we will have a plan that is better than ObamaCare . \u201d\nBut how does this happen ? Congressional Republicans could never coalesce around their own plan to take the place of the ACA . All Republicans could agree upon was repeal . The GOP House finally muscled through a replacement health care package after a lengthy fight . But it died in the Senate . Does the President implement a new plan by executive order ? Declare a national emergency , bypassing Congress yet again ?\n\u201c It \u2019 s ridiculous . Ridiculous , \u201d chafed Manchin . \u201c Why this administration would go down that path and throw it out completely when they couldn \u2019 t do it legislatively is unconscionable . \u201d\n\u201c I am vehemently opposed to the administration seeking to invalidate the entire ACA , \u201d said Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , who faces a competitive 2020 re-election in a battleground state . \u201c The answer is for the administration to work with Congress and present a plan to replace and fix the law , not through the courts and seek to invalidate it all together . \u201d\nPerhaps President Trump is simply seizing the customary Republican posture when it comes to health care . Mr. Trump has long pushed to repeal ObamaCare . And now he doesn \u2019 t have ( yet ) a bill to replace it .\nThat \u2019 s how things have gone for Republicans on health care for a while . It also explains the private reluctance of many GOPers to drift down the perilous health care path again .\nCongressional Republicans have taken dozens of votes over the past decade to repeal ObamaCare . But they \u2019 ve never closed the deal with a package to succeed the health care law .\nThe GOP initially struggled with \u201c replace \u201d in the House in the spring of 2017 . This was the first time Republicans had played with live ammo . In other words , there were consequences to repealing ObamaCare . House GOPers had to have something ready to fill the gap . Furthermore , Republicans had a bill which could actually become law . The Republican brass yanked the first measure to repeal and replace ObamaCare off the floor after it melted down .
