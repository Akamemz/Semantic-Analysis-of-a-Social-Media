    "content": "Recall , if you can , how terrifying the world was in 2000 .\nAfter the enthusiasm around Barack Obama \u2019 s election to the presidency in 2008\u2014and with the 15-year gap between Y2K and now\u2014it \u2019 s easy to forget just how hopeless things felt at the turn of the millennium . The frenzied anticipation for Y2K\u2014distinctly manic in its tone\u2014ended up being pretty anticlimactic ; 2000 wasn \u2019 t the future , it just sounded like it . The political landscape was marked by bitterness and scandal on both sides of the aisle ; the year before , in Colorado , the Columbine massacre ushered in what is now a depressingly familiar phenomenon : the American mass shooting . It was an era of bad pop music and brick-like cellphones , distinctive for its glitzy , superficial marketing of the future and slow destruction of that same future with gas-guzzling SUVs .\nIt was an especially awful year for liberals ; for those of us who were either developing a political consciousness or had one already , 2000 marks the beginning of two terms of a lot of despair . The 2000 election required massive , mind-contorting suspension of disbelief to be happy with\u2014a hypocritical , partisan Supreme Court decision , behind-the-scenes political maneuvering , and a shocking display of nepotism and corruption that haunts us to this day . And if that wasn \u2019 t enough\u2014it would have been enough on its own\u2014less than a year later , terrorists attacked New York City and Washington , D.C . The history of the modern era is pre-9/11 and post-9/11 ; it \u2019 s been 14 years since that attack , but if we have moved on , in some ways , we will never quite recover .\nIt was a dark , terrifying world . Which is why it felt , perhaps , like comedy was all we had left to hold on to .\nWhen Jon Stewart took over Comedy Central \u2019 s late-night news-and-politics show from Craig Kilborn in 1999 , he was a relative unknown taking over a show that hadn \u2019 t gained too much traction . The tenor of political humor was sarcastic , cynical , and entrenched , led by personalities like Howard Stern , Rush Limbaugh , and Bill O \u2019 Reilly , directed at either the Clinton administration \u2019 s scandals and secrets or the hypocritical bluster of the Republican Congress .\nStewart was different . His humor was underscored by earnestness ; his \u201c moment of zen \u201d \u2014which started in Kilborn \u2019 s era\u2014seemed to ask the viewer not to forget their troubles with humor , but instead to examine them more closely . And in an era that felt like rapidly unfolding chaos , \u201c The Daily Show With Jon Stewart \u201d became not just a weeknight check-in but a rallying point for like-minded liberals\u2014a refuge , really . As the rest of the world went into incomprehensible patriotic overdrive\u2014every 24-hour network adopted a news ticker , every politician started wearing a flag pin , and the armed forces started preparing for war against someone\u2014 \u201c The Daily Show \u201d appealed to the viewer \u2019 s sanity , to their humanity , to their sense of reason .\nThe show was unabashedly liberal\u2014specifically because , as longtime writer and correspondent Stephen Colbert said to the White House Correspondents \u2019 Association , \u201c Reality has a well-known liberal bias. \u201d And unlike the shtick of most other late-night comedians , Stewart \u2019 s thing is that he was , quite simply , a well-intentioned good guy .\nThere were missteps and mistakes , of course . But Stewart has the distinction of being one of the most trusted people in America\u2014earning it episode by episode over the past 16 years . It \u2019 s not easy to have an audience support you wholeheartedly ; it \u2019 s not easy to do that as a comedian that deals largely in politics on a network known mostly for stand-up specials and fringe sketch shows . Stewart did it , and continues to do it ; he \u2019 s extended that brand to Colbert , Larry Wilmore , Steve Carell , John Oliver , Rob Corddry , and more .\nIf the voice of the people is the voice of God\u2014if comedy is the second , far more critical draft of history , following the news\u2014then Jon Stewart is one of the most influential political figures of our era , despite having never run for public office , written a word of policy , or strategically donated millions and millions to a special-interest group . But his show , and his perspective , and his steadfast commitment to liberal-minded sanity got a lot of us through eight years with a crappy president and eight election cycles in a country that is increasingly polarized on the most basic civil rights , on the most essential responsibilities of government . Stewart was the liberal organizer and rallying point before Obama \u2019 s presidency was a twinkle in David Axelrod \u2019 s eye ; as difficult as it has been to advance a progressive agenda over the last 16 years , it would likely have been impossible without Stewart \u2019 s ability to connect to millions of viewers and remind them that they weren \u2019 t alone in hoping for something better\u2014better from government , better from media , better from each other .\nI realize I \u2019 ve made it sound like Stewart is an evangelical preacher , or a crusading politician , or a peerless investigative journalist , instead of what he essentially is : a comedian with a late-night talk show . But perhaps that is the last and most crucial thing to remember about Stewart \u2019 s time with \u201c The Daily Show , \u201d which has touched on three different presidents \u2019 tenures over five different terms and run well over 2,000 episodes , from 1999 to tonight .
