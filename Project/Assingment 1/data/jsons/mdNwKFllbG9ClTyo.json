    "content": "The unemployment rate ticked up to 8.3 percent in July , reflecting a stagnant economic picture as hiring improved but not by enough to make a dent in the sea of unemployed Americans .\nThe Labor Department report , in a glimmer of positive news after three straight months of dismal jobs numbers , showed that hiring reached its best level since February , with 163,000 jobs added .\nBut the number brings the economy back to treading-water status . The economy added an average of 151,000 jobs a month this year , roughly the same as last year 's pace . That 's not enough to satisfy the 12.8 million Americans who are unemployed . It would take 250,000 new jobs a month to rapidly bring the unemployment rate down .\nWith the rate rising from 8.2 percent to 8.3 percent , Republicans amped up their criticism of President Obama 's stewardship Friday .\n`` Today 's increase in the unemployment rate is a hammer blow to struggling middle-class families , '' Mitt Romney said in a statement .\nSpeaking later in North Las Vegas , he called the sustained high unemployment an `` extraordinary record of failure . ''\n`` That 's the longest period of time , 42 months ... we 've had unemployment above 8 percent in American history , '' Romney said .\nBoth sides are to using the report to double down on their respective tax plans . House Speaker John Boehner said `` any new job creation is welcome news , '' but that unemployment above 8 percent makes it `` insane to raise taxes on small businesses . ''\nRepublicans want to extend the Bush-era tax rates for all Americans ; Obama and congressional Democrats largely want to extend them for those making less than $ 250,000 , letting rates rise for top earners .\nObama , speaking just minutes after Romney , said Friday that raising taxes on the middle class is `` the last thing that we should be doing . ''\nHe noted that the jobs report means the economy has created 4.5 million new jobs in the last 29 months , and 1.1 million this year .\n`` But let 's acknowledge we 've still got too many folks out there who are looking for work , '' Obama said .\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the fact that July marked the 29th straight month of private sector job growth .\n`` Last month , 163,000 jobs were created despite Republicans ' refusal to work with President Obama and Democrats to create jobs , grow our economy , and ensure the economic security of our middle class , '' she said . `` With too many Americans still out of work , the message remains clear : we must do more .
