    "content": "Enjoy the communal sigh of relief while it lasts , America . Sure , the endlessly-discussed `` fiscal cliff '' has been averted thanks to a flawed , 13th-hour deal -- but the high-stakes partisan wrangling is just beginning . We 'll get to the road ahead in a moment , but first , a word or two about the compromise itself . Let 's stipulate right out of the gate that it stinks . It was jammed through in late night votes at the last possible minute , it scratches the Left 's `` fairness '' itch to no constructive end , and the CBO calcluates its tax hike to spending cut ratio is roughly 41 to 1 . * Pathetic . Nevertheless , Phil Klein captures things pretty well with his appraisal of the deal as `` objectively bad , but relatively good . '' He runs through the handful of reasons why it is n't an unvarnished disaster :\nAt the start of 2013 , income taxes were scheduled to go up on nearly every American , but if this deal becomes law , roughly 99 percent of taxpayers would be protected from those tax hikes . For over a decade , Democrats opposed the Bush tax cuts and prevented them from becoming permanent . Now , they have voted overwhelmingly to preserve about 84 percent of the dreaded cuts , which for years they demagogued as only benefitting the very rich . Lawmakers also agreed on permanent changes that minimized the tax increases on estates and capital gains . In addition , the deal permanently prevented the Alternative Minimum Tax ( originally passed in 1969 to capture a small number of rich households who were avoiding taxes ) from hitting tens and millions of Americans . From a more technical standpoint , this also means that the deal locks in a Congressional Budget Office revenue baseline that will be as low as possible . So , if future Republicans propose real tax reform , we won \u2019 t end up with estimates saying that their proposals would cost trillions of dollars , because such proposals will no longer be judged against an unrealistic baseline that assumes all of the Bush tax cuts would otherwise expire and open the floodgates to new revenue . A less publicized but still significant positive from the deal is that it formally repeals the CLASS Act , a long-term care entitlement that is part of Obama \u2019 s national health care law . There \u2019 s a lot to hate in this deal , no doubt . But any honest assessment of it must grapple with the reality of Obama as president , Harry Reid as Senate Majority Leader and $ 4.5 trillion in automatic tax hikes hitting in the new year . With this in mind , I \u2019 d rate the deal as objectively bad , but relatively good .\nI 'd again emphasize that the Bush tax rates on 99 percent of Americans are now permanent . House Republican leadership fractured on the question of final passage , with Paul Ryan , Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Boehner himself voting aye ( Speakers rarely cast votes ) , and Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy voting no . The GOP 's rank and file opposed the bill by nearly a 2-to-1 margin , with a handful of Democrats joining the `` no '' crowd . Thus , most tallies in favor of sending the bill to the president 's desk came from Democrats ; Boehner shelved the House 's `` majority of the majority '' rule of thumb to allow an up-or-down verdict on the bill . Will this fuel an internecine revolt against him , or are most members willing to forgive their cornered leader 's power play -- particularly after the pre-Christmas `` plan B '' fiasco ? We 'll know soon enough . The new Congress is sworn in today , and the Speaker election is expected around noon . Rumors of Boehner 's demise may have been premature . We 'll see . Meanwhile , the president has returned to Hawaii to resume his vacation ... at an additional cost of $ 3 million to John Q . Taxpayer .\nWhich brings us to what lies ahead . Obama delivered a useless , petulant , counter-productive speech on New Year 's Eve , which incensed House Republicans and threatened to derail the ongoing McConnell/Biden negotiations . ( Sidebar : It 's noteworthy that once Harry Reid left the room , a deal finally got done ) . Obama 's remarks were n't merely about gloating , base-pandering , and demagoguery -- which are all staples of the president 's rhetorical repertoire , of course . No , they seemed primarily designed to lay the groundwork for the next round of cliff-esque drama , due in February or March . For all his gloating about Republicans being forced to permit Democrats to enact some tax rate increases , he quickly cautioned that forthcoming deliberations over debt reduction would also require `` revenue '' increases on `` the rich '' and `` large corporations . '' This was Obama 's unsubtle way of warning Republicans that he 'll be demanding even more tax increases this winter when the debt ceiling debate sets this city aflame . Also keep in mind that the new cliff compromise kicks the controversial sequestration cuts down the road for two more months . The automatic sweeping cuts that were to be the legally-mandated consequence of a `` Super Committee '' failure to settle on a spending cut package have been postponed . That failure is at hand , but the cuts are not . Surprise . So the central spending reduction gimmick from the last debt ceiling deal has thus far resulted in zero cuts , and has been shoved off yet again ... as another debt ceiling brawl is looming because we 've already blown through those additional trillions .\nThis , I think , provides a real opening for Republicans to finally regain their political footing . Obama and his Congressional allies exploited the GOP 's unpopularity and internal chaos to force tax rate increases on `` the rich .
