This past week , glitches have frustrated millions of consumers unable to complete their applications .\nEnrollment functions of the healthcare.gov site were unavailable during off-peak hours this past weekend The site was be taken down at 1 a.m. EDT each night for a few hours .\nThe enrollment function was back online at little before 8 a.m. EDT Saturday , but was working slowly because of heavy traffic .\n`` Please stay on this page , '' said a notice . `` We 're working to make the experience better , and we do n't want you to lose your place in line . We 'll send you to the login page as soon as we can . ''\nThere was no indication of how long the wait would be .\nIn an interview with the Associated Press Friday , President Obama 's advice to frustrated citizens : `` They definitely should n't give up . Typically , what happens is when people are shopping for insurance , they visit a site or make phone calls or look at brochures five , six , seven times before they make a final decision . And they 're not going to have to pay premiums until December -- the insurance does n't start until January . So they 'll have plenty of time .\nAnd my message to them would be , each day the wait times are reduced . Each day , more and more people are signing up , and the product will save you money . People will save hundreds of dollars -- in some cases , thousands of dollars -- as a consequence of being able to get health insurance that is priced for them and gives them the choices that they need . ''\nCredit card companies , banks and other online service providers regularly take down websites for repairs . That may also become a feature of the new insurance program .\nAn effort by congressional Republicans to defund or delay the health care law led to an impasse with Democrats over passing a budget bill , and that sparked a partial government shutdown Tuesday . Republicans quickly pointed to the website problems as another reason that the law they call `` Obamacare '' should be pulled back .\n`` Americans have seen once again that Obamacare is not ready for prime time , '' Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia , the No . 2 House Republican , said in a statement Friday . `` A dysfunctional website is the least of that law 's problems . ''\nThe administration put the best face on the situation , noting the unexpectedly strong interest from millions of consumers .\n`` Americans are excited to look at their options for health coverage , with record demand in the first days of the marketplaces , '' said the release announcing the planned fixes .\nThe statement was headlined : `` Health Insurance Marketplace Open for Business - Week One Success . ''\nThe state-level markets were designed to be the gateway to health insurance for people who do n't have access to coverage on the job . Middle-class consumers will be able to buy government-subsidized private plans , while the poor and near-poor will be steered to Medicaid in states agreeing to expand the program .\nFederal and state websites experienced problems this week . Some states , including Maryland , have also announced they are scheduling repairs .\nThe federal site , which serves 36 states , drew millions of users , an indication of strong consumer interest . Yet many people were unable to get on the site . They encountered a screen that told them to wait , and they did , sometimes for hours . Refreshing the screen only sent them to the back of the line .\nQuite a few got hung up trying to create security questions to protect their accounts . The drop-down menus providing the questions would not populate . As a result , consumers could not advance through the application process and learn if they were eligible for a tax credit to help pay premiums , much less pick a plan .\nSome who did make it through were timed out because they took too long comparing plans .\nAt the end of the first day at most a handful of people had managed to successfully enroll through the federal site .\nHowever , by Friday , enrollments seemed to be picking up \u2014 though not yet at desired levels . The administration is not releasing numbers .\n`` We are pleased that enrollment for health care coverage through the new marketplaces is picking up , '' the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association said in a statement . `` We expect enrollment to continue to increase . ''\nThe so-called Blues are major players in the individual insurance market , but some smaller insurers have yet to see any new customers .\nBy Monday , `` there will be significant improvements in the online consumer experience , '' HHS said .\nThe upgrades include extra capacity for more users to get into the system , more technicians working round-the-clock to fix problems , and new pathways to get to the application faster . No details were given . Call centers are also getting more staff and HHS said wait times are now down to less than a minute .\nThe administration previously announced it is adding equipment to handle the high volume of users . Now it looks like software fixes are also needed .\nConsumers have until Dec. 15 to enroll for coverage that starts Jan. 1 .\nBecause of the glitches , in Florida organizations were trying to build on momentum for the health insurance program even though there was little they could do .\nMost of the counselors hired through federal grants to help sign people up for health insurance quickly went to Plan B when the website failed Tuesday morning . Several community health centers around the state , fearing the worst , printed paper applications in advance , even translating them into other languages . Other groups took down consumers ' contact information , promising to schedule appointments when the website begins to work better .\nThere was an odd mix of excitement that the Affordable Care Act was garnering so much attention and frustration that it was n't accessible .\nJohn Foley , an attorney and certified counselor for Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County , said he 's tried unsuccessfully to log into the system almost non-stop since 5 a.m. Tuesday .
