    "content": "A small group of left-leaning congresspeople appear to be more willing than ever to drift away from the political center , though one of them should n't come as much of a surprise . According to multiple reports , Sen. Bernie Sanders ' new job plan would guarantee employment for every American who is willing and able to work . It might sound like a big promise to make , but he suggests the government would be smart to back it . And he 's not the only one saying so .\nSanders ' team has underscored that the plan is in its earliest stages , and that certain logistics have n't yet been worked out . For instance , they have n't finalized a proposal for funding , and they also have n't quite worked out how to discipline workers who violate employment rules . But , all in all , the plan represents an eagerness to explore greater government intervention in the economy and job market .\nAccording to The Washington Post , Sanders ' plan would divide the United States into 12 regional districts . Within those areas , governments at the state and local level , plus American Indian tribes , would submit project proposals to the district offices . Those offices would be tasked with reviewing these proposals and sending the ones they approve to the Department of Labor .\nThe idea , according to the Post , is that coordinators for approved projects would then hire Americans to do the work . Under the proposal draft , they would not hire any worker for less than $ 15 an hour , and the jobs would include basic employment benefits , like medical leave and retirement options , the Post reports .\nThe program would also team up with job training centers , working to train those willing to work who do not yet have the skills to do so . Many job training centers already exist in the United States , so it appears that much of the plan 's success would require connecting those training centers with the new employment opportunities .\nIn the current political moment , a universal employment plan may be a moot point . With a Republican-held Congress and White House , a socialized jobs bill stands little to no chance of moving forward , even if it were lucky enough to make it to debate . However , the midterm elections are fast approaching , and the contest is expected to be fierce .\nWhile Democrats face a massive gap that they would have to close in order to win a majority in the Senate alone , proposals like Sanders ' could give more voraciously left candidates a viable topic to campaign on . Sanders , himself , is up for reelection , and has been extremely vocal about his views on social media in recent months , especially when it comes to health care and social security . ( Sanders , it 's worth remembering , is an Independent , though he does caucus with the Democrats . )\nSanders is also not the only elected official to advocate for a government-backed jobs proposal , either . Earlier in April , Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted that , instead of tax cuts , the Republicans might have tried investing in an employment plan .
