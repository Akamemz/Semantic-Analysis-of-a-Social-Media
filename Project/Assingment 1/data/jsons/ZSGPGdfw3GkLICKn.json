    "content": "Congress is back \u2014 meaning Senate Republicans are going to have to start answering pointed questions about where they stand on impeachment .\nWhile it \u2019 s pretty unlikely enough Republican senators will actually vote to convict President Donald Trump if articles of impeachment are brought against him , members who represent swing states , such as Susan Collins , might feel pressure to defect due to pushback from their constituents . Others , like Mitt Romney , have vocalized opposition to the president in the past and are among the most likely to do so again .\nAs Vanity Fair \u2019 s Gabriel Sherman writes , it \u2019 s possible that a definitive statement from a lawmaker like Romney could be the \u201c pressure point \u201d to embolden other Republicans to confront Trump on impeachment .\nThus far , the Senate Republican response to a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been mixed . According to a Washington Post analysis , roughly 15 Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns or pushed for more information about Trump \u2019 s call asking Zelensky for help investigating Hunter Biden , the son of his 2020 rival Joe Biden . Several Republicans have also spoken out in response to Trump pressuring the Chinese government to investigate Hunter Biden , comments the president made publicly to the press .\nThe other 38 Republicans , meanwhile , have sought to undercut the whistleblower \u2019 s credibility and thrown their backing behind the president . No Republican senators have gone so far as to express support for the impeachment inquiry .\nIn order for the Senate to convict the president of charges , 20 Senate Republicans would have to join with the 47-member Democratic caucus in order to reach the 67-person supermajority threshold that \u2019 s needed . Still , any breaks within the Republican conference don \u2019 t look great for Trump and help give Democrats further ammunition to use against him in the 2020 election . Trump himself is counting on Republican senators \u2019 support , reportedly calling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at frequent intervals to stress the need for GOP unity .\nFor now , the Republicans facing the most pressure \u2014 particularly those up for reelection in 2020 \u2014 are broadly saying they need more \u201c facts \u201d before they can take a conclusive stance on Trump \u2019 s calls for foreign help . Their responses offer a way to dodge questions about his behavior while maintaining some semblance of accountability .\nWith new information coming out seemingly every day and with Congress in session once more , here are a slew of lawmakers we \u2019 re watching and what they \u2019 ve said on the subject so far :\nRomney , an on-again , off-again , critic of the president , has offered some of the strongest rebukes of Trump \u2019 s comments about China and Ukraine :\n\u201c When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China \u2019 s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process , it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated . \u201d\nBy all appearances , the President \u2019 s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling . \u2014 Mitt Romney ( @ MittRomney ) October 4 , 2019\nHe \u2019 s declined to comment more directly on the impeachment inquiry , however :\n\u201c I haven \u2019 t spoken with any other Republican senator about the impeachment process , either in person or by email or text . I haven \u2019 t discussed that with anybody. \u201d ( The Salt Lake Tribune )\nCollins is among the most vulnerable Republicans this cycle and will need to win over a hefty number of independents to hang onto her seat . She \u2019 s criticized Trump \u2019 s comments about China :\n\u201c I thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent . It \u2019 s completely inappropriate. \u201d ( Bangor Daily News )\nBut she \u2019 s declined to take a stand explicitly on the impeachment inquiry , citing her role as a potential juror :\n\u201c If there are articles of impeachment I would be a juror just as I was in the trial for President Clinton , and as a juror I think it \u2019 s inappropriate for me to reach conclusions about evidence or to comment on the proceedings in the House. \u201d ( Bloomberg )\nSasse , a one-time Trump critic who \u2019 s since earned the president \u2019 s endorsement ahead of a reelection fight in 2020 , has slammed the president \u2019 s comments about China :\n\u201c Hold up : Americans don \u2019 t look to Chinese commies for the truth . If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing , that \u2019 s a matter for American courts , not communist tyrants running torture camps. \u201d ( Omaha World-Herald )\nWhen it comes to the impeachment inquiry , Sasse is focused on rounding up more information :\n\u201c I \u2019 m glad the President agreed with the requests a number of us have been making that the administration release this unredacted transcript . The President should also provide all additional relevant materials to the Committee . At a time when foreign powers work every day to exploit our divisions , it \u2019 s important for public trust that Americans know what did and did not happen here . We need shared facts . As the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence fulfills its oversight responsibilities , this first release is the right choice for the country. \u201d ( Sasse press statement )\nErnst , a senator who \u2019 s fighting to keep her seat in a swing state , dodged questions about Trump \u2019 s Ukraine call during the recess :\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know that we have that information in front of us. \u201d ( Associated Press )\nShe \u2019 s argued , however , that the whistleblower should be shielded from potential retaliation :\nMurkowski , a Republican who \u2019 s broken with Trump in the past on Kavanaugh and the Affordable Care Act , has pushed for more information about the allegations raised against Trump :\n\u201c What I find equally troubling is that even before there has been any considered review , that people have decided . There is either \u2018 absolutely , you must get rid of him tomorrow \u2019 viewpoint or \u2018 he must stay in and no questions asked. \u2019 \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m also trying to think to myself , if this set of facts were to be in front of me and the president was President Hillary Clinton as opposed to President Donald Trump , would I be viewing this in a different way ? Because if I do , that \u2019 s wrong . I shouldn \u2019 t view whether what is right and what is wrong based on the political affiliation of the individual that we are considering. \u201d ( The Hill )\nA Murkowski spokesperson has previously said that the senator will work on informing herself while the House conducts its impeachment inquiry :\n\u201c In terms of the formal impeachment inquiry \u2014that lies in the House of Representatives . Right now the Senate doesn \u2019 t have a part in this until the House reviews and they act . Until the point the Senate has a role in this , Senator Murkowski will wait to see the process play out in the House . Separately , she \u2019 s doing all she can to make sure she \u2019 s informed on the current allegations and will review the full transcript from the phone call in question when it \u2019 s released. \u201d ( KTUU News )\nWhile McSally was pretty critical of an impeachment inquiry when it was first announced , calling it a \u201c distraction , \u201d she \u2019 s since shifted her tone quite a bit . Facing a tough election in 2020 , she recently refrained from taking a decisive position on the inquiry :\n\u201c This a serious matter , like I \u2019 ve said , and I think we \u2019 ve seen some partisan dynamics going on . And I think as Americans , none of us should be throwing around the \u2018 I-word \u2019 as if it \u2019 s a joke . \u201c I think people want us to take a serious look at this and not have it be just partisan bickering going on. \u201d ( Talking Points Memo ) \u201c I am going to , when information is presented to me that \u2019 s been investigated by people who are not being partisan , we will share and be in our role going forward. \u201d ( Arizona Republic )\nGardner , a vulnerable senator who \u2019 s up for reelection in 2020 , evaded questions over the recess about Trump \u2019 s requests for foreign government interference :\n\u201c It \u2019 s an answer that you get from a very serious investigation. \u201d ( Associated Press )\nMeanwhile , Gardner has criticized the impeachment inquiry as a partisan effort :\n\u201c I joined my Senate colleagues in unanimously supporting the release of the whistleblower report , and I support the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2019 s on-going bipartisan review to gather all of the facts . Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s impeachment inquiry to appease the far-left isn \u2019 t something the majority of Americans support and will sharply divide the country. \u201d ( CPR News )\nAlexander , a lawmaker who \u2019 s retiring from his seat , has called Trump \u2019 s conduct \u201c inappropriate \u201d but notes that he sees impeachment as a \u201c mistake \u201d :\n\u201c It \u2019 s inappropriate for the president to be talking with foreign governments about investigating his political opponents , but impeachment would be a mistake .
