Retired Gen.

To right this imbalance , the Pentagon wants to expand its training programs on historically black college and university campuses . Other paths to improving the pipeline of future military leaders lie in social media campaigns targeted at minority communities .\nAs a first-generation college student in Texas , George Bolton was hooked on an Army career through the stories of the Buffalo soldiers , the black cavalry units formed in 1866 to serve on the western frontier , becoming icons of African American military service .\nToday , Lieutenant Colonel Bolton runs the Reserve Officers \u2019 Training Corps ( ROTC ) program at the historically black Alabama A & M University outside Huntsville . He often invokes these stories to inspire his students to take on the combat jobs that can in future vault them to the highest echelons of military leadership .\nThe more leaders of color willing to serve , he says , the better the military becomes . \u201c When you have people that can bring diversity to the policymakers , then you have a better product for the nation . And that \u2019 s how you become part of the solution , \u201d he says .\nJudging by the current makeup of the United States military , that solution is still lacking . While African Americans make up nearly 1 in 5 of the enlisted ranks , they comprise only 9 % of officers . Across all minorities , the distribution is similarly lopsided : More than half of all enlisted women , and 43 % of enlisted men , are Hispanic or a racial minority . Yet virtually all U.S. combat brigade commanders \u2013 a stepping stone to becoming a general \u2013 are white .\nThe Pentagon is working to change this by using social media campaigns and recruiting potential officers in cities with large minority populations . In January , President Donald Trump announced an initiative to expand ROTC programs on the nation \u2019 s 102 historically black colleges and universities ( HBCU ) campuses , roughly one quarter of which have them . Among all colleges and universities , more than 1,700 currently host ROTC programs .
