    "content": "On Tuesday morning , Donald Trump , whose unsurprising character defects still never fail to surprise , tweeted a Russian-sourced conspiracy theory claiming that the 75-year-old peace activist who remains hospitalized after his head was smashed open by Buffalo , New York , law enforcement officers was in fact a tech-savvy \u201c ANTIFA provocateur \u201d who \u201c fell harder than was pushed. \u201d The president also linked to a report from a conservative cable news outlet , One America News Network , for support . That report claimed , with no supporting evidence , that the man \u201c was attempting to capture the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers . \u201d\nThe problem for Trump\u2014but actually the problem for all the rest of us\u2014is that we all saw the video . We all saw a peaceful 75-year-old approach the Buffalo police officers , who then push him to the pavement and walk past his bleeding body . In fact , the existence and wide circulation of that video are what forced the Buffalo Police Department , which originally claimed that a person \u201c was injured when he tripped & fell \u201d during a \u201c skirmish involving protestors , \u201d to suspend the two officers . The existence of the video , for all intents and purposes , closed the case , at least in the court of most sentient public opinion .\nBut closed cases are actually Donald Trump \u2019 s specialty . And the more compelling the evidence of a closed case is , the more apt he is to relitigate it . It \u2019 s no accident that some of Donald Trump \u2019 s most incendiary claims require his true believers to accept that their own eyes can not be believed . Whether it \u2019 s photographic evidence of his lackluster inaugural crowds or hand-altered meteorological maps , almost every Trumpian fictionalized tour de force starts with a false claim\u2014also known as a lie\u2014that is readily disproven or even obviously wrong to the naked eye , and then subverts it . The more overtly false , the better .\nBut casual lies alone are for amateurs ; the real authoritarian move is to construct an entire false reality\u2014an unreality\u2014around those lies .\nIndeed , Trump himself has made the Orwellian claim that , among the many entities he insists lie constantly\u2014the media , the FBI , the intelligence community , the entire House of Representatives now that it \u2019 s Democrat-led , the nameless and faceless \u201c deep state \u201d conspirators\u2014the lyingest liars out there are our own eyes and ears . In July 2018 , Trump , while addressing a Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in Kansas City , told those assembled that they shouldn \u2019 t trust their eyes and ears at all and should instead get their facts from Trump alone . \u201c Just remember , what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what \u2019 s happening , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Just stick with us , don \u2019 t believe the crap you see from these people , the fake news. \u201d In some ways it \u2019 s an old play , presaged by George Orwell in 1984 when he warned that \u201c the Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears . It was their final , most essential command. \u201d It \u2019 s a double whammy that demonizes and delegitimizes the media as a whole while also\u2014as Tyler Cowen has argued\u2014wringing loyalty from all those who must then repeat the lie and cover for it . Every repetition of a lie deepens their loyalty .\nBut casual lies alone are for amateurs ; the real authoritarian move is to construct an entire false reality\u2014an unreality\u2014around those lies . That \u2019 s what we \u2019 re now seeing from Trump and his loyalists . On Wednesday morning , White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany made just this move on Fox & Friends . Speaking about the peaceful protester pushed to the ground in Buffalo , host Brian Kilmeade asked , \u201c Does the president think that this guy is part of antifa ? \u201d McEnany replied that \u201c the president was raising questions based on a report that he saw , questions that need to be asked , and [ in ] every case we can \u2019 t jump on one side without looking at all of the facts at play. \u201d Trump \u2019 s press secretary added , \u201c This individual has some very questionable tweets , some profanity-laden tweets about police officers , \u201d going on to suggest darkly , if baselessly , that \u201c there are a lot of questions in that case . \u201d\nBy later on Wednesday morning , Miami Beach Commissioner Ricky Arriola was doubling down . He tweeted : \u201c What part of having a guy who is trying to steal police frequency so he can sabotage them is offensive to you ? He flopped better than Michael Jordan trying to get a charge foul . Seriously\u2014be objective . This guy is no angel. \u201d Even gravity itself , it seems , is a deep-state actor now . Asked on television to explain how precisely none of what Arriola described was apparent in the video footage we all laid eyes on , Arriola acknowledged that , \u201c apparently , he was pushed by the police . \u2026 That was caught on video , so that \u2019 s clear , but what \u2019 s not clear is the motivation that the gentleman had in even confronting the police , and so I called into question , \u2018 What \u2019 s the real story ? \u2019 \u201d\nSee what he did there ? Arriola claimed that people who saw what they saw were part of a \u201c rush to judgment \u201d and that \u201c everything that is being videotaped nowadays makes it to social media , and right now , there \u2019 s a rush to judgment of the police , and I think that is very dangerous. \u201d The act of recontextualizing that which happens clearly in plain sight is dressed up as subtlety and nuance\u2014or , in McEnany \u2019 s parlance , as \u201c asking questions. \u201d But what \u2019 s actually happening is an effort to persuade the public that they didn \u2019 t see what they themselves have seen\u2014or at least that they didn \u2019 t understand what they saw , or thought they saw . And most Senate Republicans , caught between amplifying Trump \u2019 s lie or calling it out , opted for door No . 3 , pretending they were too busy to have seen Trump \u2019 s reprehensible tweet , or at least too busy to care . That may not be loyalty per se , but it is certainly complicity .\nTrump has already spent years telling Americans to distrust their media , their intelligence community , their law enforcement , their judges , their health professionals , and at least some of their legislators , mayors , and governors . And he \u2019 s long told Americans to distrust their own eyes\u2014going right back to his first day as president and his outlandish claims about inaugural crowd size . But now he \u2019 s building whole new unrealities , ones in which seeing isn \u2019 t believing\u2014ever . We don \u2019 t even need to await the era of easily created deepfakes , in which altered images foster fakes that look as real as reality . Donald Trump builds deepfakes in the mind ; and , for some audiences , they prove just as durable .\nWhen authoritarians construct their own unreality , they try to stop actual reality from intruding . Trump \u2019 s now trying that , too . Recall that the Trump campaign has been suing news organizations for publishing op-eds the campaign finds too critical of Trump\u2014despite the statements targeted in those op-eds actually being true\u2014for a while now . On Wednesday afternoon , the Trump campaign went further . It sent a cease-and-desist letter to CNN demanding that the network retract and apologize for a poll that CNN aired , showing Trump trailing Joe Biden badly in the polls . Never mind that CNN \u2019 s poll was quite similar to polling from other leading media platforms and universities . Never mind that the Trump campaign failed to identify what made CNN \u2019 s purportedly defective . Never mind any of that . As Trump increasingly concocts his own unreality , he seeks to banish the unwanted intrusion of actual reality . He also sends the message that none of us can trust ourselves to make judgments ; his word is reality , instead .\nIt \u2019 s like the slow act of pushing out the fenced perimeter around the White House : Trump is increasingly holding reality at a distance , and trying to move it further and further away . Reality isn \u2019 t looking good for Trump\u2014that \u2019 s what CNN \u2019 s real poll showed\u2014and , more importantly , the reality of Trump \u2019 s presidency isn \u2019 t looking good for most Americans . That \u2019 s why Trump \u2019 s latest authoritarian turn is to build , lie by insane lie , a different America , and to demand that his supporters see only that America .
