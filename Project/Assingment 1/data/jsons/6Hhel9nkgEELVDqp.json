Bush .\nThe Obama camp released a new television advertisement and issued a memo on Monday criticizing Mr. Romney \u2019 s bumpy overseas trip this summer as well as his response to the assaults on the U.S. diplomatic post in Libya \u2014 highlighting how a national security adviser to GOP Sen. John McCain \u2019 s 2008 presidential campaign called Mr. Romney \u2019 s stance on Libya the \u201c the worst possible reaction . \u201d\nMr. Romney is set to give a broad-scale attack on Mr. Obama \u2019 s handling of foreign policy and national security issues in a speech this morning here at the Virginia Military Institute .\nIn the memo , two former top Obama national security advisers \u2014 Michele Flournoy and Colin Kahl \u2014 say the former Massachusetts governor \u2019 s \u201c latest effort to reboot and re-set the Romney foreign policy \u201d can not hide the fact that he pushes positions \u201c outside of the mainstream and often to the right of even George W. Bush . \u201d\nThat , they say , is not surprising because Mr. Romney has surrounded himself with the same ex-Bush advisers who embraced what they called the \u201c with-us-or-against-us approach \u201d that led to \u201c some of the worst foreign policy failures in American history , including the Iraq War . \u201d\nThe Obama camp also challenged Mr. Romney \u201c to move beyond swagger and slogans \u201d and spell out how exactly his foreign policy approach would differ from the current occupant of the White House .\n\u201c Governor Romney still can \u2019 t say what he \u2019 d do differently on Iran other than taking us to war , \u201d the memo says . \u201c He continues to criticize the president \u2019 s time line in Afghanistan even while saying he \u2019 d pursue it as president . His position on Libya has no credibility since he \u2019 s been both for and against our Libya policy . And he offers no way forward on Syria other than suggesting that the United States should get more deeply involved in the conflict without defining a strategy . \u201d\nAccording to excerpts of the speech that he will deliver at the VMI , Mr. Romney will touch on some of those topics , while arguing that the United States must have a more robust present in world affairs . He also will warn that the attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts last month are part of a broader struggle that is playing out across the Middle East and represent an effort by Islamic extremist to \u201c wage perpetual war on the West . \u201d\n\u201c Hope is not a strategy , \u201d Mr. Romney will say . \u201c We can not support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds , when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut , when we have no trade agenda to speak of , and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership , but of passivity . \u201d\nThe Obama camp , though , argued in the memo Monday that their boss has been \u201c one of the strongest national security records of any president in generations . \u201d\n\u201c He has decimated al Qaeda \u2019 s leadership , taken out Osama bin Laden , ended the war in Iraq , provided unparalleled support to Israel , produced unprecedented pressure on Iran , strengthened our alliances , and restored our standing in the world , \u201d they said .\nBut the Romney campaign pushed back ahead of the speech , arguing that Mr. Obama has weakened America \u2019 s standing abroad in the past four years .\n\u201c In every region of the world \u2014 and particularly in the Middle East \u2014 American influence has been weakened by President Obama \u2019 s failed foreign policy , \u201d said Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg . \u201c American security and the cause of freedom can not afford four more years like the last four years , and Mitt Romney will restore the bipartisan tradition of American leadership abroad that President Obama has not lived up to .
