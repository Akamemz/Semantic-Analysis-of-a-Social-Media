    "content": "TAMPA , FL - Governor Mitt Romney accepted his party 's nomination for the presidency of the United States of America tonight , telling RNC delegates that voters face a clear choice in November . His remarks focused on his broad executive experience in both the private and public sectors , and the future he envisions for America . The basic message : Here 's who I am . Here 's where I come from and what I 've done . Here are my values . Here 's the current state of the union . And here are my solutions . Please join me . Like Paul Ryan last night , Romney drew contrasts with his opponent , but his criticisms generally seemed less barbed . His was a tone of disappointment , not anger :\nBut for too many Americans , these good days are harder to come by . How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America ? Many of you felt that way on Election Day four years ago . Hope and Change had a powerful appeal . But tonight I 'd ask a simple question : If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama , shouldn \u2019 t you feel that way now that he \u2019 s President Obama ? You know there \u2019 s something wrong with the kind of job he \u2019 s done as president when the best feeling you had , was the day you voted for him .\nThough he leads in most polls on voters ' top three issues -- the economy , jobs and the debt -- the same surveys also show the GOP nominee suffering from a modest-to-large `` gender gap '' and a likeability deficit . Romney deliberately and aggressively took direct aim at both vulnerabilities this evening . He described the strong women who have surrounded him throughout his life and public career :\nMy mom and dad were true partners , a life lesson that shaped me by everyday example . When my mom ran for the Senate , my dad was there for her every step of the way . I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice , \u201c Why should women have any less say than men , about the great decisions facing our nation ? \u201d I wish she could have been here at the convention and heard leaders like Governor Mary Fallin , Governor Nikki Haley , Governor Susana Martinez , Senator Kelly Ayotte and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . As Governor of Massachusetts , I chose a woman Lt . Governor , a woman chief of staff , half of my cabinet and senior officials were women , and in business , I mentored and supported great women leaders who went on to run great companies .\nHe went heavily biographical , seizing his chance to finally tell his story , unfiltered by attack ads and rich-guy stereotypes . Some passages were beautiful :\nMy mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all \u2013 the gift of unconditional love . They cared deeply about who we would BE , and much less about what we would DO . Unconditional love is a gift that Ann and I have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren . All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers . If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family \u2013 and God \u2019 s love -- this world would be a far more gentle and better place . Mom and Dad were married 64 years . And if you wondered what their secret was , you could have asked the local florist \u2013 because every day Dad gave Mom a rose , which he put on her bedside table . That 's how she found out what happened on the day my father died \u2013 she went looking for him because that morning , there was no rose ... I grew up in Detroit in love with cars and wanted to be a car guy , like my dad . But by the time I was out of school , I realized that I had to go out on my own , that if I stayed around Michigan in the same business , I \u2019 d never really know if I was getting a break because of my dad . I wanted to go someplace new and prove myself . Those weren \u2019 t the easiest of days \u2013 too many long hours and weekends working , five young sons who seemed to have this need to re-enact a different world war every night . But if you ask Ann and I what we \u2019 d give , to break up just one more fight between the boys , or wake up in the morning and discover a pile of kids asleep in our room . Well , every mom and dad knows the answer to that . Those days were toughest on Ann , of course . She was heroic . Five boys , with our families a long way away . I had to travel a lot for my job then and I \u2019 d call and try to offer support . But every mom knows that does n't help get the homework done or the kids out the door to school .
