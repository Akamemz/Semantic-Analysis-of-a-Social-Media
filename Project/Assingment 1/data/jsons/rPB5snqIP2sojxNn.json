    "content": "Do Democrats Want What Bernie Wants , Or Just What Bernie Has ?\nFor some weeks now , as Bernie Sanders has extended his remarkable and improbable run as a presidential candidate , people have been asking : `` What does Bernie want ? ''\nThat question is a distant echo of `` What does Jesse want ? '' a relic of the 1988 runner-up candidacy of Jesse Jackson , another `` outsider '' challenger with a dedicated hardcore following . But more about Jackson in a moment .\nThis week , the question took a different form . After a rowdy convention in Nevada prompted death threats against that state party chair , the question suddenly became : `` Are the Democrats coming apart ? ''\nUniting for the fall has always been an issue for both parties . But this year , it was supposed to be the Republicans , with their 17 candidates and their frustrated # NeverTrump rearguard action , who broke up over their differences .\nNow , it 's working out quite differently . So we hear again that old nostrum : `` Democrats want to fall in love , Republicans want to fall in line . '' A remarkable number of Republicans have accepted , if not embraced , Donald Trump as their nominee . But a large contingent of Democrats continue to feel the Bern , or at least remain very much out of love with Hillary Clinton .\nWhich brings us to this past weekend , which proved that sometimes what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas .\nThe `` Nevada fracas '' has created a media meme and a conversational focus for the conflict roiling the Democratic Party .

( Although Clinton won the initial round of caucuses back in February , Sanders had the upper hand in an intermediate round at the county level on April 2 . )\nOne camp wanted an open process ; the other wanted respect for the rules . A voice vote was gaveled to a conclusion despite an uncertain outcome , which is bound to cause trouble .
