( Well , that and Steve Castor \u2019 s unconventional taste in briefcases . ) It \u2019 s the sort of national attitude that you might suspect would inspire political apathy . If you think all politicians are crooked do-nothings , you might care less what they do .\nBut a half-century of research \u2014 and an even longer slide into pessimism among the American electorate \u2014 suggests that any cynicism following the impeachment hearing isn \u2019 t likely to make voters stay home in 2020 . That was the old theory , born in the post-Watergate days when trust in politics was as low and heavy as a funk bassline , said Jack Citrin , professor of political science at the University of California , Berkeley . But it never bore out . Instead , Citrin and other experts say cynicism actually seems to be a political motivator , increasing both activism and voter turnout . But while we often broadly think of those as Good Things for Democracy , they don \u2019 t necessarily portend a shiny , hopeful political future .\nAmericans are definitely cynical about politics . The American National Election Studies survey , which has tracked American opinion since 1958 , includes a \u201c trust index \u201d combining the results of four questions about voters perceptions of government and politicians into a single score .\nThe average trust score in 2016 was 17 , the lowest ever recorded . Although these questions are about trust , they serve as a proxy for understanding cynicism because political scientists think of those two things as opposites .

Scrub away the black eyeliner and you \u2019 ll find a country that once got an average score of 61 , back in 1966 . Same survey . Same questions .

Since then , things have been on a downward slide , with two clear exceptions .\nOne came during the early Reagan years , ending about the time the Iran-Contra Affair became public . The other happened over the course of the latter Clinton years , peaking after 9/11 , then rapidly falling again . Today , trust in the government is so low that one expert I spoke to \u2014 a Berkeley political scientist named Laura Stoker \u2014 said she had a hard time imagining how it could actually fall further . \u201c We \u2019 re pretty much at the floor , \u201d she said . \u201c It \u2019 s pretty darn low . \u201d\nAnd , yet , voter participation has not followed a similar trend . \u201c I \u2019 d say cynics generally aren \u2019 t apathetic , \u201d said Sanne Rijkhoff , a professor of political science at Texas A & M , Corpus Cristi . \u201c If you really don \u2019 t like something , that implies a certain level of passion about it. \u201d Despite our historically low levels of political trust , Americans join in political movements and activism at staggeringly high rates . Back in 2008 , Pew found that 63 percent of Americans had joined in some kind of political or civic activism . A similar survey by the same organization in 2012 found that 72 percent of us were out there , doing something to shape a political system we mostly hate . And Logan Dancey , a professor of government at Wesleyan University , even found evidence that the more cynical people are , the more likely they are to take a political scandal seriously , see wrongdoing , and want politicians to be held accountable .\nSo does that mean cynicism serves the public good ? Or , alternately , if you \u2019 re the Democrats , does that mean you want the public more cynical after the impeachment hearings because they might be more likely to want impeachment to happen ?\nErrrr , not exactly , Citrin said . Some cynicism is good , he said . Think of it as skepticism , in that case .

Voters may get more active as they get cynical , but their politicians become less active , which just contributes to a cycle that drives even more cynicism , Stoker said .\nUnsurprisingly cynicism is also associated with decreased support for large-scale government programs , such as healthcare reform , public education , or climate change adaptation .
