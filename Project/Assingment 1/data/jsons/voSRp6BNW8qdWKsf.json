The State is a shade of fire-engine-red. \u201d \u201c Whoa ! \u201d \u201c Does she have a chance at all you think ? \u201d WORKING TITLEs : RUNOFF : A Democrat \u2019 s Last Stand Act I : Mary Landrieu \u2019 s Toughest Race Mary Landrieu , on stage : \u201c We have the race that we want . And , Bill Cassidy , you can not run , you can not hide anymore . This race is starting tonight. \u201d Jonathan Martin : MARY LANDRIEU IS THE 3 TERM DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA \u2014 WHO IS RUNNING AGAINST GOP CONGRESSMAN BILL CASSIDY . LOUISIANA HAS AN OPEN PRIMARY SYSTEM , AND NEITHER CANDIDATE MANAGED TO GET 50 % OF THE VOTE IN NOVEMBER . SO THE RACE HAS COME DOWN TO A RUNOFF ELECTION HELD ON DECEMBER 6 , AND LOUISIANA VOTERS ARE ENJOYING AN EXTRA-LONG CAMPAIGN SEASON . TEN YEARS AGO THE STATE WAS CONSIDERED BLUE . BUT THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE THERE HAS SHIFTED - AND IT NOW MIRRORS THE REST OF THE DEEP SOUTH AS A REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD . THE QUESTION IS : CAN A CANDIDATE LIKE MARY LANDRIEU SURVIVE IN THAT CLIMATE ? THIS RUNOFF MAY BE * THE * RACE OF HER CAREER . Mary Landrieu , on stage ( fading out ) : \u201c This race is about the future of Louisiana ... [ fade out ] \u201d Amy Jeffries , WRKF Reporter : \u201c This is inside on WRKF , I am Amy Jeffries . We have gone immediately from a primary campaign to a runoff campaign . Jeremy Alford , publisher of LA Politics Dot Com . How are you holding up ? Jeremy Alford : \u201c I am tired . I was ready for the primary to come and go . Now we got ta get through the post game . Amy Jeffries , WRKF Reporter : \u201c No rest for the weary , neither for voters suffering through more ads . Based on what happened on Tuesday , it looks neck-to-neck . But the prevailing wisdom here is that it \u2019 s advantage Cassidy in the runoff . Why , why is that ? \u201d Jeremy Alford at WRKF : \u201c This is the crest of a conservative wave that has been building for quite some time in Louisiana , and you really got ta wonder when Democrats will be able to resurface , when that pendulum is going to swing . I asked a consultant about it not long ago ... [ fades out ] . \u201d Jeremy Alford : \u201c I think we are all eager to see what happens with Mary Landrieu . Not only is she part of this political dynasty that lives in the imagination of the state . She is also the last statewide elected democratic official. \u201d Dean Baquet , Executive Editor of The New York Times : \u201c You could not exaggerate how big of a deal the Landrieu family is in New Orleans . Mary Landrieu \u2019 s father Moon Landrieu was elected mayor while I was a high school student in New Orleans . And her brother Mitch Landrieu is now the mayor of New Orleans . Landrieu transformed city government in New Orleans . He was one of the first people to appoint a black executive assistant , the equivalent of black cabinet members . He gave high ranking jobs to blacks , and he gave large contracts to blacks . That was the start of the dynasty . And if you look at the fact that his son is the white mayor of a predominantly black city , I think that shows just how powerfully the name carries even today. \u201d PBS Profile of Mary Landrieu : \u201c She looks like somebody \u2019 s kid sister or a page delivering a message to a state representative . But in this case 25-year-old Mary Landrieu is the state representative. \u201d Jeremy Alford : \u201c Mary Landrieu \u2019 s elected journey started in 1979 . It first lead her through the state house , as treasurer , and eventually to Congress . She has had a very long time to build her brand . Jeremy Alford : \u201c But Katrina was the point where Landrieu stood on her own . she delivered disaster recovery dollars . And I think for folks in that community , folks in New Orleans , she became part of that larger legacy. \u201d Voter Interview NOLA C : \u201c We know what Mary Landrieu can do . She has proven herself . She has been there for us . She has been there with us . She walks hand in hand with us . She cried with us . \u2018 Cause , you know , we done been through some serious times in New Orleans. \u201d Mary Landrieu , press availability after voting : \u201c I have now worked with three presidents , four majority leaders and six governors . I have worked with presidents that are Republicans and Democrats. \u201d Voter Interview NOLA A : \u201c I think of her as being a very moderate Democrat . She isn \u2019 t as progressive as I \u2019 d like her to be . On issues of the environment . So find it very baffling that there is so much opposition to her , given that she has been so friendly to the oil industry. \u201d Act II : Bill Cassidy , and Louisiana \u2019 s Changing Politics NAT//Crowd shouting : \u201c Bill , Bill , Bill ... Bill Cassidy , on election night : \u201c Woah ! \u201d MOS 1 : \u201c I decided to vote for Dr. Cassidy , because he is a Republican . I felt like Cassidy was in Congress . He was a representative . Move him over for a term or two in the Senate . Maybe we will get some change. \u201d MOS 2 : \u201c Hard work . Character . You know , all those kind of things . Traditional values. \u201d MOS 3 : \u201c Although I am an independent , I find his fiscal policies in line with mine . I am not too crazy about his social policies , but I am willing to work with him. \u201d Pearson Cross : \u201c As a Congressman Bill Cassidy hasn \u2019 t been around that long . His record has not been as conservative as it might be. \u201d TK : Cassidy Campaigning , soundbite : TK Pearson Cross : \u201c People have said about his past that he gave money to Senator Landrieu \u2019 s campaign in the past , which of course he did . That he authored his own version of the affordable care act , which could be argued . But in this election climate he has run as a solidly conservative Southern state Republican and made it very clear that he plans to govern that way if elected. \u201d TK : Cassidy campaigning , soundbite : TK Jeremy Alford : \u201c The Republicans did a very good job of crafting a race that is a referendum on Barack Obama . That left Bill Cassidy to tie Mary Landrieu to Barack Obama through things like the Affordable Care Act. \u201d Bill Cassidy , during media-availability prior to voting : \u201c I think we will have more than enough time to ask Senator Landrieu why she supports President Obama 97 percent of the time , would vote for Obamacare again tomorrow , even though it is raising rates most recently by 20 percent on top of many other 20 percents prior to that. \u201d Pearson Cross , teaching class : \u201c Does she have a chance , you think ? Anybody think she have a chance ? \u201d Pearson Cross : \u201c Louisiana politics has changed a great deal . If you go back 10 years , and you look around the state you would see a state with a democratic controlled house , a democratic controlled senate , most statewide elected officials were Democrats . Pearson Cross : \u201c I am sure that \u2019 s what they are thinking up there , \u2018 How can we change this ? \u2018 . \u201d Pearson Cross : \u201c If you move up to the election of Barack Obama and beyond , you see a state that is very quickly moving away from the Democratic party and towards the Republican party . Pearson Cross : \u201c One of the biggest issues has been the migration of French Arcadian Catholic voters to the Republican party . Gradually Catholics started to listen to the abortion message , and that issue started to become a preeminent issue . And as it did , they started to move then they started to move to the Republican party , making Louisiana much more like the rest of the South. \u201d Pearson Cross : \u201c So now you are starting to see a Democratic Party in Louisiana that is majority black and is starting to be majority black and is starting to be very , very less conservative than the Republican party , which is now almost entirely white and is very , very conservative . Jason Williams : \u201c At a time when we have her as our only statewide elected Democrat , it \u2019 s very important that we can keep her in place so that she can help us . I know that a lot of the Republicans are very conservative , and they believe that we need less government involvement . But you also need to make sure that you have jobs and opportunity . You want to have a safe place to live , which means creating real opportunities for the people that live in areas that may be impoverished . Which means delivering on economic development opportunities that are going to provide real jobs . And Mary has done that . I think it \u2019 s frustrating that someone who has delivered so much is even in a race right now. \u201d Act III : Landrieu \u2019 s Hail Mary Jeremy Alford : \u201c Some of the biggest revenue generating measures coming down from the federal government have Mary Landrieu \u2019 s fingerprints all over it , from federal recovery money for Hurricane Katrina and Rita to offshore energy royalty sharing programs that we share with other oil producing states . Mary Landrieu , at Pellegrin Energy event : \u201c It is my great joy to represent this industry , to represent the people of this state , and to fight for them in a place where they are not very well understood. \u201d Jonathan Martin : IN MID NOVEMBER , JUST WEEKS BEFORE THE RUNOFF , DEMOCRATS TRIED A HAIL MARY PASS TO SAVE THEIR FELLOW SENATOR , BY PUSHING A VOTE ON THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE , EVEN THOUGH IT \u2019 S NEVER BEEN VERY POPULAR WITH THE PARTY . THE GOAL WAS TO EMPOWER SENATOR LANDRIEU , BECAUSE THE PIPELINE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PASSION OF HERS , AND IT \u2019 S OBVIOUSLY WILDLY POPULAR IN THE OIL AND GAS ECONOMY OF LOUISIANA . MY COLLEAGUES REPORTED ABOUT HOW SHE HELD MEETING AFTER MEETING . SOMETIMES EVEN ON THE VERGE OF TEARS , HOPING TO GARNER ENOUGH SUPPORT . THE SENATE VOTE WAS HELD ON NOVEMBER 18 . Elizabeth Warren : \u201c ... the sixty vote threshold having not been achieved , the bill is not passed. \u201d IT WAS A MAJOR SETBACK . BUT , SENATOR LANDRIEU REMAINS DEFIANT . Mary Landrieu , post Keystone press conference : \u201c My experience is still available . My chairmanship of this committee until the end of this Congress is still very valuable to the people of Louisiana .
