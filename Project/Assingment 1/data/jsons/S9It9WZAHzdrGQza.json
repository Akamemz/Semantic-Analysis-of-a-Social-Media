    "content": "Sanders Has Been Losing In States Where Income Inequality Is Worse\nUpdate : This post was updated on April 20 at 7:58 a.m. to reflect the results of the New York primary .\nHere 's some irony : Bernie Sanders is winning the states where income inequality is lowest . Where it 's highest ? Those states are all Hillary Clinton , and her win in highly unequal New York only made the trend more pronounced .\nIt 's a counterintuitive trend because Bernie Sanders ' whole campaign is built on inequality . The phrase `` millionaire and billionaire class '' ( or some variation on it ) seems to feature in every single one of his speeches .\nBut it 's true . Here is a chart of all 50 states showing their distance from the median of the Gini index , a widely used statistic that measures inequality on a scale from 0 ( total inequality ) to 1 ( total equality ) . The states are lined up from left to right , from the most equal ( Alaska , at 0.4146 , or 0.455 from the median ) to the most unequal ( New York , at 0.5048 , or 0.447 from the median ) .\n( Scroll to the bottom of this post for a full table of states , their Gini coefficients , and who won those primaries and caucuses . )\nThe pattern is striking : Clinton clearly wins in the most unequal states . And even in the one fairly equal state she won \u2014 Iowa ( that lonely , farthest-left green bar ) \u2014 she barely won , and even then only among `` state delegate equivalents , '' not voters .\n( A note on the data : The margins of error here are small ; while the difference from one state to the next one may not be significant , the difference between one state and one a handful of places away generally is significant . In addition , the broader trends are also meaningful . According to the University of Iowa 's Sarah Bruch , a sociology professor who studies inequality , one common yardstick for an `` important '' difference is 0.024 \u2014 and the distance between No . 1 and No . 50 is more than 0.09 . She also points to the Census Bureau , which often divides Gini into quintiles .

And the most equal Southern state , West Virginia , comes in as the 28th most equal .\nSorry about that . But there are a few things we can say .\nOne is that this does n't necessarily mean that Clinton is beating Sanders at appealing to voters on the basis of inequality . Put another way , it 's not that all of the Democrats of New York ( the most unequal state yet that Clinton has won ) looked around and thought , `` Huh . Inequality is high here , so I should vote for Clinton . ''\nBruch says she doubts inequality itself plays a big direct role .\n`` I think that there are lots of reasons not to expect any relationship between levels or trends in inequality and political behavior or preferences , '' she said , adding that she thinks primary turnout is far more about party organization and campaign mobilization .\nIt 's true that inequality can affect people 's politics on a grander scale \u2014 one paper from the Dallas Fed finds a relationship between national-level inequality and polarization over time , for example . But that complicates matters in this case ; even if ( and that 's an if ) inequality meant more polarization on a state level , it might suggest that the more liberal Sanders , not Clinton , would do better in more unequal places .\nReally , it might be that there are lots of trends going on alongside these inequality numbers . Race may play into what 's going on here . The South is both heavily unequal and heavily black . And American blacks in general are more economically disadvantaged than whites nationwide , as research from the Brookings Institution has found , due in part to what they call `` deep-rooted , systemic problems . '' And it is also true that many black voters have been for a variety of reasons loyal to the Clintons over the years .\nSanders also appeals explicitly to rural voters in particular with his gun control stances , which may have helped fuel his performance in states with larger rural populations \u2014 think those large Western states like Wyoming , Alaska and Idaho .\nAnd several more-rural states are also among the most equal , while big cities tend to be more economically unequal than the rest of the country \u2014 consider all the CEOs and bankers that live in New York City , for example .
