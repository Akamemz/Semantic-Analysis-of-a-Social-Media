    "content": "Conservatives are up in arms over the New York Times \u2019 s latest hire : a tech writer named Sarah Jeong whom they allege to be racist against white people .\nJeong , who currently works at the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Media site The Verge , was hired by the Times editorial board to work on technology issues . On Thursday , shortly after the hire was announced , conservative publications dug up old tweets of hers containing statements like \u201c white men are bullshit \u201d and \u201c oh man it \u2019 s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men . \u201d\nThe campaign to use these tweets to get her fired seems to have failed . The Times issued a statement saying that Jeong had meant these tweets satirically \u2014 a parody of the hate she has received online as an Asian woman \u2014 and that they were standing by her .\nBut to some conservatives , like National Review \u2019 s David French and New York magazine \u2019 s Andrew Sullivan , Jeong \u2019 s tweets are bigger than her : They reveal a rot in the progressive movement , that \u201c social justice warriors \u201d have become totally okay with racism so long as it \u2019 s directed at white people .\nBoth French and Sullivan singled out a tweet I had sent defending Jeong \u2014 \u201c a lot of people on the internet today confusing the expressive way anti-racists and minorities talk about \u2018 white people \u2019 with actual race-based hatred , for some unfathomable reason \u201d \u2014 as an exemplar of the problem . Sullivan explains :\nI don \u2019 t think the New York Times should fire her \u2014 in part because they largely share her views on race , gender , and oppression . Their entire hiring and editorial process is based on them . In their mind , Jeong was merely caught defending herself . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 writer Zack Beauchamp put it : \u201c A lot of people on the internet today [ are ] confusing the expressive way antiracists and minorities talk about \u2018 white people \u2019 with actual race-based hatred , for some unfathomable reason. \u201d I have to say that word \u201c expressive \u201d made me chuckle out loud . ( But would Beauchamp , I wonder , feel the same way if anti-racists talked about Jews in the same manner Jeong talks about whites ? Aren \u2019 t Jews included in the category of whites ? )\nI have a lot of respect for Andrew \u2014 he gave me my first job in journalism , and I \u2019 ve been over to his DC condo more times than I can count \u2014 but I think he has a serious blind spot when it comes to race , and the analogy to Jews here helps reveal it . Both his piece and French \u2019 s misunderstand what racism is and how the so-called \u201c social justice left \u201d approaches the world \u2014 and the anti-Jeong vitriol you \u2019 ve seen from the right speaks more to its failings on race than it does anything about Jeong .\nThe basic thrust of both Sullivan and French \u2019 s argument is that if you subbed in any group other than \u201c white people \u201d for what Jeong wrote , then it would be obviously offensive . \u201c # cancelblackpeople probably wouldn \u2019 t fly at the New York Times , would it ? \u201d Sullivan asks , rhetorically .\nThe only reason lefties aren \u2019 t offended by this obvious race-based hatred , the argument goes , is that they see the world entirely through the lens of power . Since whites as a class have it , minorities by definition can not harbor racist attitudes toward them .\n\u201c It is simply false to excuse anti-white racism on the grounds that people of color lack power , \u201d French writes . \u201c But this argument confuses the gravity of an offense with the existence of the offense . A powerless person \u2019 s hate may not harm the powerful , but it is still hate . \u201d\nThe problem here , though , is assuming that Jeong \u2019 s words were meant literally : that when Jeong wrote \u201c # cancelwhitepeople , \u201d for example , she was literally calling for white genocide . Or when she said \u201c white men are bullshit , \u201d she meant each and every white man is the human equivalent of bull feces . This is expressly Sullivan \u2019 s position : He calls her language \u201c eliminationist , \u201d a term most commonly used to describe Nazi rhetoric referring to Jews during the Holocaust .\nTo anyone who \u2019 s even passingly familiar with the way the social justice left talks , this is just clearly untrue . \u201c White people \u201d is a shorthand in these communities , one that \u2019 s used to capture the way that many whites still act in clueless and/or racist ways . It \u2019 s typically used satirically and hyperbolically to emphasize how white people continue to benefit ( even unknowingly ) from their skin color , or to point out the ways in which a power structure that favors white people continues to exist .\nI get that white people who aren \u2019 t familiar might find this discomforting . Sullivan thinks it \u2019 s unacceptable on an \u201c an open-forum website like Twitter. \u201d But the reality is that Twitter is where these conversations between people of color are taking place , and ( given the 280-character limit ) it \u2019 s a lot easier to use the kind of \u201c white people \u201d shorthand rather than adding endless qualifications ( \u201c a certain kind of white person , definitely Not All White People , \u201d is pretty lengthy ) .\nThe sentence \u201c white people run America \u201d may use most of the same words as \u201c Jews run America , \u201d but the former is mostly true while the latter is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory\nWhat makes these quasi-satirical generalizations about \u201c white people \u201d different from actual racism is , yes , the underlying power structure in American society . There is no sense of threat associated with Jeong making a joke about how white people have dog-like opinions . But when white people have said the same about minorities , it has historically been a pretext for violence or justification for exclusionary politics .\nThis is why Sullivan \u2019 s use of \u201c eliminationist \u201d to describe Jeong \u2019 s words is , to my mind , particularly ill-chosen . Eliminationist language , in the way it \u2019 s used by scholars of genocide and racial oppression , is used as justification for concrete actions \u2014 the Holocaust is the textbook example , and the Rwandan genocide is another clear one . But the very idea that Sarah Jeong \u2019 s tweets reveal her desire to set up concentration camps for whites is laughable .\nThis is , incidentally , why you hear a lot of people on the social left say there \u2019 s no such thing as \u201c reverse racism. \u201d We interpret language through social context . Because of the way racial power structures are set up , the same set of words mean very different things when you swap out \u201c white people \u201d for \u201c black people , \u201d \u201c Asians , \u201d \u201c Jews , \u201d etc . The phrase might be racist in one context , in the sense of conveying actual racial animus , but not in another .\nThis meaning of the phrase \u201c white people \u201d is obvious to people who have been listening to these social media conversations , or even from even a cursory search of Twitter for the term . I \u2019 ve copied a few examples below :\nI don \u2019 t see how Sarah \u2019 s tweets are much different than how a lot of influential younger POC have been talking on Twitter these last few years . It just seems like the standard here is that you can \u2019 t say it while working at the New York Times . \u2014 Matt Pearce ( @ mattdpearce ) August 2 , 2018\nWhite people finding out that we talk about white people as a means to vent about and survive the whiteness we 're forced to experience is , to put it one way , never boring . \u2014 Studio Glibly ( @ NoTotally ) August 3 , 2018\nThe other thing I 'd note is that if you 're a white person who 'd never heard POC talk about white people before the advent of social media , it probably means that no POC , even your friends , have truly trusted you . \u2014 Studio Glibly ( @ NoTotally ) August 3 , 2018\nWhite people : comes to America , claims it , kicks out the natives forcibly which thousands of were killed in this process\nWhite people : lets make immigrants illegal \u2014 M ( @ mazymarvel ) August 3 , 2018\nWhite people will shame you and then copy you and take credit . Wake up \u2014 Resistance ( @ Sean_PA ) August 3 , 2018\nJeong \u2019 s tweets , in context , clearly fit this type of rhetoric . When she writes \u201c dumbass fucking white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants , \u201d she is not , as Sullivan accuses her of doing , \u201c equat [ ing whites ] with animals. \u201d Rather , she is commenting on the ubiquity of ( often uniformed ) white opinion on social media \u2014 a way of pointing out how nonwhite voices often don \u2019 t appear or get drowned out in social media discourse .\nAgain , this is obvious to people who are steeped in the kind of online communities Jeong spends time in . But what happened , as my colleague Aja Romano notes , is that a few alt-right websites pulled out Jeong \u2019 s tweets in a deliberate attempt to hurt her career and reputation . What \u2019 s actually happening here is a racist movement , the alt-right , trying to damage a left-wing woman of color \u2014 and mainstream conservatives are furthering their narrative .\nI don \u2019 t necessarily blame Sullivan and French for not hanging out on Social Justice Twitter , where their views would be ... unwelcome , to say the least . What I do blame them for is joining an alt-right pile-on without trying to understand where their left-wing intellectual opponents are coming from and what they \u2019 re talking about .\nIn his column , Sullivan challenges me , specifically , to explain how I would feel if Jeong were tweeting about Jews rather than whites . \u201c Would Beauchamp , I wonder , feel the same way if anti-racists talked about Jews in the same manner Jeong talks about whites ? Aren \u2019 t Jews included in the category of whites ? \u201d he asks .\nThe example , I assume , is chosen deliberately : Andrew knows I \u2019 m Jewish and sensitive to the real problem of anti-Semitism on the left . So this seems like it should be a hard example for me , as a Jeong defender . But it \u2019 s not at all . In fact , it makes the distinction between what Jeong is doing even stronger .\nFirst of all , not all Jews are white . Second , even for those Jews who are , our inclusion in the category of whiteness is historically contingent . For the modern alt-right \u2014 the people going after Jeong \u2014 Jews don \u2019 t actually count as white . Leading alt-right thinker Richard Spencer has said that in his ideal world , Jews would be expelled from the United States .\nJews are not marginalized in the exact same way that other minority groups are \u2014 on average , Jews are wealthier while black people are poorer \u2014 but there is deep-seated anti-Semitism in the United States and ( even more so ) in other Western countries . When you talk about \u201c Jews \u201d as a group , you aren \u2019 t just talking about a specific kind of white person ; you \u2019 re talking about a historically marginalized group , one that has experienced the consequences of actual eliminationist rhetoric firsthand .\nAnd this is what the conservative critiques of Jeong \u2014 even the good-faith ones , like Sullivan \u2019 s and French \u2019 s \u2014 miss entirely . When you talk about race and identity , the context in which you \u2019 re operating is absolutely inescapable . The sentence \u201c white people run America \u201d may use most of the same words as \u201c Jews run America , \u201d but the former is mostly true while the latter is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory .\nHistorical structures of oppression , along race and other identity lines , shape the way Americans see the world deeply and profoundly . Everything that \u2019 s said about minority groups is interpreted through the weight of these expectations . One study found that children start thinking in racist terms when they \u2019 re about 8 years old . It \u2019 s absurd to pretend , given centuries of racialized oppression , that the phrases \u201c white people \u201d and \u201c black people \u201d can be swapped in a sentence without profoundly changing the meaning .\nThis is indicative of a broader failing in the conservative movement .\nThe weight of history is typically minimized , with the success or failure of minority groups being seen in colorblind , individualized terms . If black people aren \u2019 t as wealthy as whites , it \u2019 s not the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and redlining ; it \u2019 s because they \u2019 re lazy , or addicted to welfare , or ( as Sullivan has posited ) simply genetically less likely to be intelligent . There has to be some explanation other than the fact that everything in our society is structured around a longstanding racial caste system , one that persists even after the laws have been made on-face colorblind .\nThis isn \u2019 t a mere matter of there being a power differential between whites and various minority groups , as French would have it . It \u2019 s about the reasons there \u2019 s a power differential , and how those reasons shape even the very meaning of the words we speak . A blindness to history , and the patterns set by people long dead , is a characteristic of conservative race thinking ( and a somewhat ironic one , given conservative reverence for tradition ) .\nI want to close on some more recent history : a similar debate that happened online in 2014 .\nThe issue then was gender . A number of feminist writers had a habit of writing about \u201c men \u201d on social media without qualification like \u201c most \u201d or \u201c the majority of. \u201d This was partly for simplicity \u2019 s sake , and partly to point out how widespread a lot of sexist practices are . This led to a lot of responses from men they didn \u2019 t know , saying something along the lines of \u201c not all men are sexist , and you \u2019 re the real sexist for saying they are. \u201d National Review , French \u2019 s publication , published an entire column making a basically similar argument .\nThe feminist writers responded that this was a distraction . It was obvious they weren \u2019 t talking about literally every man in context , and it was clear these men were butting in on conversations about gender to derail them with a pointlessly persnickety objection rather than dealing with the substantive conversation about sexism . So the feminist writers responded by turning the phrase \u201c not all men \u201d into a point of mockery , using it as an example of men sidetracking feminist arguments that made them uncomfortable .\nThe feminists won this argument ; today , feminists still complain about \u201c men , \u201d and \u201c not all men \u201d is mostly used as a punchline rather than a serious argument . But the conservative responses to Jeong boil down , essentially , to the same thing : They \u2019 re saying \u201c not all white people \u201d are bad and Jeong is a racist for implying that they are .\nMy guess is , a few years down the road , we \u2019 ll remember the Jeong episode in roughly the same way we remember the # NotAllMen controversy today .",

This led to a lot of responses from men they didn\u2019t know, saying something along the lines of \u201cnot all men are sexist, and you\u2019re the real sexist for saying they are.\u201d National Review, French\u2019s publication, published an entire column making a basically similar argument.\n\nThe feminist writers responded that this was a distraction. It was obvious they weren\u2019t talking about literally every man in context, and it was clear these men were butting in on conversations about gender to derail them with a pointlessly persnickety objection rather than dealing with the substantive conversation about sexism. So the feminist writers responded by turning the phrase \u201cnot all men\u201d into a point of mockery, using it as an example of men sidetracking feminist arguments that made them uncomfortable.\n\nThe feminists won this argument; today, feminists still complain about \u201cmen,\u201d and \u201cnot all men\u201d is mostly used as a punchline rather than a serious argument. But the conservative responses to Jeong boil down, essentially, to the same thing: They\u2019re saying \u201cnot all white people\u201d are bad and Jeong is a racist for implying that they are.\n\nMy guess is, a few years down the road, we\u2019ll remember the Jeong episode in roughly the same way we remember the #NotAllMen controversy today.",
