    "content": "In Europe and India , proponents of weak net neutrality rules appear to have bought into the misguided notion that higher charges are necessary to keep telecommunications companies in business and , further , that the companies have a right to impose them . The idea goes something like this : Internet companies like Google and Facebook are making lots of money because cable and phone companies have built networks that give people access to their services . Therefore , Internet-based businesses should help pay the costs of creating , maintaining and upgrading networks .\nThis is a disingenuous argument . Telecom companies make money by charging individuals and businesses monthly fees for access to the network . If that revenue was inadequate to cover the cost of running networks , telecom companies would raise prices or they would become insolvent . If anything , prices have fallen as it has become cheaper to provide service . Big telecom companies like Vodafone , which does business in Europe and India , are in fact quite profitable .\nThere is resistance to the proposals in Europe and India , some of it from official sources . The European Parliament , for example , voted last year for legislation similar to the F.C.C . rules . Neither the rules adopted by Parliament nor the Council \u2019 s proposal can take effect until the Parliament , the Council and the European Commission , the executive branch of the E.U. , work out a compromise .\nIn India , with the comment period underway , Internet activists have organized a campaign against the regulator \u2019 s proposal and appear to be having some impact . The minister of communications and information technology , Ravi Shankar Prasad , recently said on Twitter that the government would study the issue closely before adopting final rules , noting that the Internet belonged to all of \u201c humanity and not to a few . \u201d\nOne of the main reasons the Internet has been so successful is that people have generally been able to use it how they wish . The worst thing policy makers could do to the network would be to allow telecom companies to mess with that .",
