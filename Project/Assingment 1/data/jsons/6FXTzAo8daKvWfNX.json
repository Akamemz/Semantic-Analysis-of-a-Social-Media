Trump is our present-day Senator Joseph McCarthy , who uses lies and innuendos to scare Americans into submission . McCarthy 's notorious lawyer , Roy Cohn , who himself was a pathological liar , was Trump 's lawyer and mentor .\nMcCarthy knew no bounds to his lying , and eventually claimed that the US Army was soft on communists .

In the confusion of the time , Wuhan authorities organized a major New Year 's event on January 18 that spread the virus .

The actual answer is almost surely that they were still in the fog of war against the new virus .\nIn fact , neither the biology nor chronology support the laboratory-release story . Biologists note that the Wuhan lab did not even have the Covid-19 virus under study .
