    "content": "The revelation Hillary Rodham Clinton used an off-the-books email account during her time as secretary of state reverberated across Washington on Tuesday , further eroding the Obama administration \u2019 s claims of transparency , giving new momentum to House Republicans investigating the Benghazi affair and raising fresh questions about Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s credibility heading into 2016 .\nWhile Mrs. Clinton now has turned over roughly 55,000 pages of emails \u2014 including about 300 messages related to the deadly September 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi given to House Republicans \u2014 it \u2019 s unclear whether more emails remain hidden and , if so , how many .\nRep. Trey Gowdy , South Carolina Republican and head of the House Select Committee on Benghazi , said the private account has helped Mrs. Clinton avoid answering questions about the terrorist attack that claimed four American lives , as well as the administration \u2019 s actions in the aftermath of that attack .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been asking [ the State Department ] for months and months and months for certain emails , and we just now find out that those emails were never going to be produced because they don \u2019 t have custody of them , \u201d Mr. Gowdy said . \u201c Right now we are in a position of having to go to her or her attorneys to ask for work that was done on behalf of the American people .

She wants to control access to her information , and the people who manage access to it are her employees \u201d at the State Department , \u201d Mr. Wonderlich said .\nThe New York Times first reported Monday night that Mrs. Clinton , the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , did not use a government email address during her four years running the State Department .\nInstead , she conducted all official correspondence through a private account , leading to possible violations of federal record-retention requirements , creating possible security risks and fueling speculation that the former first lady has something to hide .\nMrs. Clinton \u2019 s spokesman , Nick Merrill , said the former secretary complied with the \u201c letter and spirit \u201d of the law and had \u201c every expectation \u201d that all of her emails related to State business would be retained by the department .\nOn the political front , the potentially damaging news comes just as Mrs. Clinton gears up for her expected 2016 presidential campaign .
