    "content": "( CNN ) - The National Rifle Association 's annual meeting will surely be in the spotlight this weekend , as it comes just weeks after the Senate voted down a controversial gun control measure\u2013a major blow to the months-long push for tougher firearm laws in the wake of the Newtown elementary school massacre .\nAs thousands meet in Houston for the NRA gathering , anti-gun control advocates are poised to celebrate their victory over the legislation 's recent defeat in Congress , while those fighting for tougher gun laws could target the event as a way to shed light on their cause .\nRetired astronaut Mark Kelly\u2013gun control advocate and husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords\u2013addressed the group in advance of the conference Wednesday . He penned an opinion piece for the Houston Chronicle , welcoming NRA members to the city but cautioning them against their group 's leadership .\n`` The NRA used to be a great organization , and you can still get practical value out of it as a member \u2013 everything from insurance to gun safety courses , '' he wrote . `` But those services are small potatoes compared to where the NRA 's leadership makes the really big money . The NRA leadership 's top priority is to make sure the corporations that make guns and ammunition continue to turn huge profits . Their top priority is n't you , the NRA member . ''\nHe pointed to the NRA 's big fundraising months in the past year\u2013both of which came after the shootings in Aurora , Colorado and Newtown , Connecticut . He singled out Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and gun manufacturers , saying they `` exploit people 's fears '' in return for a more profitable gun industry .\nLaPierre also wrote an op-ed for the Chronicle last week , thanking NRA members for their commitment to the organization .\n`` If you 're an NRA member , you deserve to be proud , '' he wrote , adding the group 's followers were `` doing the thankless and heroic work of standing up for freedom .

A ban on assault weapons also went down in defeat .\nOpponents of the legislation argued it would infringe on Second Amendment rights , and the background check law would not have prevented a tragedy like the one in Newtown . The shooter , Adam Lanza , did n't get a background check for those weapons ; they were legally purchased and registered to his mother , Nancy Lanza , who was his first victim .\nJames Holmes and Jared Loughner , the shooters in Aurora and Tucson , respectively , also passed background checks when they purchased guns .\nRegardless , Erica Lafferty , daughter of slain Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung , still wants Washington to take action . She 's traveling to Houston to try to reach out to NRA members and share her viewpoint .\n`` I just want to make my mom human to them instead of just another name on a list of people who were murdered . She was a person . She was a great person . They need to know that , '' she said on CNN 's `` Starting Point . ''\nAsked if she was nervous about heading to a convention led by people who passionately disagree with her views on gun laws , Lafferty said `` No . ''\n`` I mean , they are people too , and I am trusting that they are going to be respectful as I am , '' she said .\nEarlier this week , Lafferty confronted Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire at a town hall , asking `` why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school is n't as important '' as inconveniencing gun sellers .\nAyotte was one of the 41 Republicans who voted against the background check measure .\nLafferty was sent to Ayotte 's event by the organization Mayors Against Illegal Guns , one of several gun control groups using this week 's Congressional recess to bring the gun control message to the states .\nThat group said Friday they would air an ad in the Houston market during the convention featuring a gun owner and NRA member whose sister was shot and killed by her husband , who should have been prohibited from buying guns but was able to purchase a firearm online without a background check .\nA Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday indicated 71 % of voters were either dissatisfied or angry that the Senate voted down the background check measure , which had wide public support heading into the vote . While 17 % want President Barack Obama to continue pursuing background check legislation , 30 % want him to move on to other issues . Fifty-one percent want him to do both .\nWhether or not Lafferty will get much access to NRA members is unclear . The convention certainly has a tightly-packed schedule with multiple events and seminars taking place across the three-day event .\nOn this year 's docket are classes on handgun retention , defensive shooting , competition shooting tips , firearm law , and wild game cooking .
