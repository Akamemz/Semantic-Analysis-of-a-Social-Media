But that \u2019 s just the tip of the iceberg of the threat they hold , warns technology analyst Jamie Bartlett .\nThe threat that tech monopolies pose to democracies is about more than the prices they charge : it \u2019 s the concentration of power , data and control over the public space \u2014 and their ability to wield this power over a growing number of economic activities , especially in the infrastructure and technologies of the future . The following companies operate as either monopolies or oligopolies in their respective fields : Google , Facebook , Uber , Airbnb , Amazon , Twitter , Instagram , Spotify . Integrated into everything , everywhere , their technology will blanket the world .\nPerhaps the final stage in the rise of monopolies is when their economic power morphs into what Marxists sometimes call \u201c cultural hegemony. \u201d That is , where domination can be achieved through controlling the ideas and assumptions available to the public .
