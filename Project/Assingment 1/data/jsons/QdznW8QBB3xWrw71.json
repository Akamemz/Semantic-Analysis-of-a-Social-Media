That 's 181 miles \u2014 or an hour 's drive plus a 40-minute flight \u2014 away from the government buildings where Pence will conduct his official visit on Tuesday .\nPence also happens to have family connections to the tiny Irish village , surrounded by windswept Atlantic coastline and bogland . His great-grandmother was from there , and a distant cousin still owns Morrissey 's Pub in town .\nPence defended the choice .
