The House also approved a measure asking Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the IRS case .\nRepublicans , who control the House , unanimously supported the measures ; six Democrats voted to hold Ms. Lerner in contempt and 26 voted to petition Mr. Holder for a special counsel .
