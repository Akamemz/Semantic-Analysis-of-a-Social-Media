    "content": "Dozens of government watchdogs are sounding the alarm that the Obama administration is stonewalling them , in what is being described as an unprecedented challenge to the agencies they 're supposed to oversee .\nForty-seven of the government 's 73 independent watchdogs known as inspectors general voiced their complaints in a letter to congressional leaders this week . They accused several major agencies -- the Justice Department , the Peace Corps and the chemical safety board -- of imposing `` serious limitations on access to records . ''\nThe inspectors general are now appealing to Congress to help them do their jobs uncovering waste , fraud , and mismanagement .\n`` Agency actions that limit , condition , or delay access thus have profoundly negative consequences for our work : they make us less effective , encourage other agencies to take similar actions in the future , and erode the morale of the dedicated professionals that make up our staffs , '' they wrote .\nThe letter to the chairmen and ranking members of relevant oversight committees in the House and Senate claimed agencies are withholding information by calling it `` privileged . ''\nIn the letter , they said this interpretation poses `` potentially serious challenges to the authority of every Inspector General and our ability to conduct our work thoroughly , independently , and in a timely manner . ''\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa , R-Calif. , calls that extremely troubling .\n`` If there is anyone who should have transparency , it should be the watchdogs inside the government working for the president , '' Issa told Fox News in an interview .\nThe letter offered specific examples of investigators having trouble getting what they need .\nIn the case of the Peace Corps , it withheld records of sexual assaults against its volunteers . A Peace Corps spokeswoman told Fox News , `` We are committed to working with the inspector general to ensure rigorous oversight while protecting the confidentiality and privacy of volunteers who are sexually assaulted . ''\nAt the Justice Department , the letter said officials withheld records for three reviews until they found the reviews were helpful to department leadership .\nJustice spokesman Brian Fallon said everything sought was provided and `` because the documents at issue included grand jury material , credit reports , and other information whose dissemination is restricted by law , it was necessary to identify exceptions to the laws to accommodate the inspector general 's request . ''\nThe watchdogs also claimed the EPA 's inspector general had problems getting documents from the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board for a separate investigation .\nIssa said that since most IG activities are not public until they are completed , `` some of the best examples of obstruction probably are the ones the IGs do n't want to say in a public format . ''\nThe letter notes a 1978 law ensures inspectors general have `` complete , unfiltered , and timely access to all information and materials ... without unreasonable administrative burdens . ''\nIssa called the letter unprecedented . `` I 've never seen a letter like this , and my folks have checked -- there has never been a letter even with a dozen IGs complaining . ''\nHe added , `` This is the majority of all inspectors general saying not just in the examples they gave , but government wide , they see a pattern that is making them unable to do their job . ''\nSen. Charles Grassley , R-Iowa , the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , has long voiced concerns about impediments faced by the IGs , and used the letter to hammer the administration on that point . `` This is an administration that pledged to be the most transparent in history . Yet , these nonpartisan , independent agency watchdogs say they are getting stonewalled , '' he said .\nIssa said he 's planning to hold hearings on this issue when Congress , which currently is on recess , returns in September .",
