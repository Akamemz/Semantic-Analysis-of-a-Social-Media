    "content": "A friend recently sent me a link to an inspiring video about an upbeat young black man who was born without arms . It showed him going to work -- unlike the record number of people living on government payments for `` disabilities '' that are far less serious , if not fictitious .\nHow is this young man getting to work ? He gets into his car and drives there -- using controls set up so that he can operate the car with his feet .\nWhat kind of work does he do , and how does he do it ? He is involved in the design of racing cars . He sits at his computer , looking at the screen , with the keyboard on the floor , where he uses his toes as others use their fingers .\nHis story recalls the story of Helen Keller , who went to an elite college and on to a career , despite being both deaf and blind . Her story was celebrated in books , in television documentaries and in an inspiring movie , `` The Miracle Worker . ''\nBut our culture has changed so much over the years that the young man with no arms is unlikely to get comparable publicity . Helen Keller 's achievement was seen as an inspiration for others , but this young man 's achievement is more like a threat to the prevailing ideology of our times .\nThe vision on which the all-encompassing and all-controlling welfare state was built is a vision of widespread helplessness , requiring ever more expanding big government . Our `` compassionate '' statists would probably have wanted to take this young man without arms , early on , and put him in some government institution .\nBut to celebrate him in the mainstream media today would undermine a whole ideological vision of the world -- and of the vast government bureaucracies built on that vision . It might even cause people to think twice about giving money to able-bodied men who are standing on street corners , begging .\nThe last thing the political left needs , or can even afford , are self-reliant individuals . If such people became the norm , that would destroy not only the agenda and the careers of those on the left , but even their flattering image of themselves as saviors of the less fortunate .\nVictimhood is where it 's at . If there are not enough real victims , then fictitious victims must be created -- as with the claim that there is `` a war on women . '' Why anyone would have an incentive or a motivation to create a war on women in the first place is just one of the questions that should be asked of those who promote this political slogan , obviously designed for the gullible .\nThe real war -- which is being waged in our schools , in the media and among the intelligentsia -- is the war on achievement . When President Obama told business owners , `` You did n't build that ! '' this was just one passing skirmish in the war on achievement .\nThe very word `` achievement '' has been replaced by the word `` privilege '' in many writings of our times . Individuals or groups that have achieved more than others are called `` privileged '' individuals or groups , who are to be resented rather than emulated .\nThe length to which this kind of thinking -- or lack of thinking -- can be carried was shown in a report on various ethnic groups in Toronto . It said that people of Japanese ancestry in that city were the most `` privileged '' group there , because they had the highest average income .\nWhat made this claim of `` privilege '' grotesque was a history of anti-Japanese discrimination in Canada , climaxed by people of Japanese ancestry being interned during World War II longer than Japanese Americans .\nIf the concept of achievement threatens the prevailing ideology , the reality of achievement despite having obstacles to overcome is a deadly threat . That is why the achievements of Asians in general -- and of people like the young black man with no arms -- make those on the left uneasy . And why the achievements of people who created their own businesses have to be undermined by the President of the United States .\nWhat would happen if Americans in general , or blacks in particular , started celebrating people like this armless young man , instead of trying to make heroes out of hoodlums ? Many of us would find that promising and inspiring . But it would be a political disaster for the left -- which is why it is not likely to happen .",
