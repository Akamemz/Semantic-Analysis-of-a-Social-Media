    "content": "When evangelical professor Bruce Waltke shared a standard biblical interpretation in favor of abortion in 1968 , his words were hardly controversial .\n\u201c God does not regard the fetus as a soul , no matter how far gestation has progressed , \u201d he wrote in a 1968 Christianity Today article . \u201c Clearly , then , in contrast to the mother , the fetus is not reckoned as a soul . \u201d\nMore than five decades later , a lot has changed . In that time , a concerted effort to place anti-abortion views at the core of the religious right has succeeded in rallying conservative Christians against reproductive rights .\nBut the success of the Christian anti-abortion movement has overshadowed another group of religious Americans : those who say that the right to abortion is part of their religion . This group includes Jews , Muslims , and even Christians who believe their faith allows\u2014and sometimes even requires\u2014abortion under certain circumstances . They say the right to abortion is a constitutional one , protected not only by the right to privacy , but by the freedom to exercise religion .\n\u201c There 's a lot of folks who are pro-choice or support reproductive dignity and freedom because of their faith and not in spite of it , \u201d said Rev . Katey Zeh , an ordained Baptist minister and CEO of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice .\nAs Roe v. Wade is threatened by increasingly restrictive state bills and a Supreme Court stacked against reproductive rights , pro-choice Jews , Muslims , and Christians may soon be forced to come to the legal defense of abortion in a way its never been argued before : as a religious right .\nThe clearest argument for abortion as a religious liberty belongs to the Jewish faith . Eighty-three percent of Jewish Americans say abortion should be legal , which makes them the most pro-abortion group of all affiliations , including the non-religious .\n\u201c This is n't something that 's a huge controversy in the Jewish community , \u201d said Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg , who has authored two books on sex and feminism within Judaism . \u201c It is universally understood that there are times when abortion is actually required , according to Jewish law. \u201d This is the case when a pregnant person \u2019 s life is in danger . In that circumstance , there is consensus among Jewish decisors ( rabbis who decide on matters in Jewish law ) that an abortion is not just allowed but is necessary .\n\u201c As long as the unborn remains a fetus , it does not have a status of personhood equal to its mother , and therefore may be sacrificed to save the life of the mother , \u201d wrote scholar and researcher Rabbi Yehuda Shurpin . In Judaism , the fetus is regarded as a part of the mother , \u201c like a hand or a foot , \u201d Rabbi Ruttenberg said .\nThese positions are largely based on Oholot 7:6 , which reads :\nA woman who was having trouble giving birth , they cut up the fetus inside her and take it out limb by limb , because her life comes before its life .\nIn this circumstance , if the government were to deny an abortion to a Jewish person , many Jewish authorities argue that the government would be preventing them from exercising the duties of their faith . \u201c If you make it impossible for them to have this procedure then you are saying that your law is more important than my life , your law is more important than my traditions and commandments to our people , \u201d Rabbi Ruttenberg said .\nWhile there is a near consensus on abortion in cases where a pregnancy endangers a person \u2019 s life , attitudes on abortion in other cases differ among Jewish authorities . Some believe abortion is permissible if having a child will cause a mother extreme suffering or distress , while others prefer to judge circumstances individually .\n\u201c There are a lot of even ultra-Orthodox decisors that say if this pregnancy is going to cause the woman pain , suffering of some kind\u2014and there 's understanding that sometimes suffering is material , sometimes suffering is mental\u2014that is something that our tradition says is a reason to have an abortion , \u201d Rabbi Ruttenberg said .\nIn the United States , Reform and Conservative Jewish groups have been strong supporters of the broad legalization of abortion since before Roe v. Wade . The founder of the Jane Collective , one of the first underground abortion access networks , was a Jewish woman named Heather Booth . While Orthodox organizations supporting the broad legalization of abortion are less common , they too have been involved in abortion politics . Notably , in 2016 , the ultra-Orthodox group Agudath Israel of America sent a letter to the governor stating their opposition to an Ohio bill that proposed restricting abortion at six weeks . The bill , they said , would violate their religious freedom .\nThough perhaps the strongest evidence for abortion as a religious right belongs to Judaism , it is not the only religion under which abortion is permitted .\nMany Muslims , for example , believe in the permissability of abortion under specific circumstances\u2014though opinions on abortion in Islam vary depending who you ask . \u201c Various forms of Muslim religious authority do n't always agree on the permissibility of abortion and under what circumstances it would be permissible , \u201d said Zahra Ayubi , an assistant professor of gender and Islamic bioethics at Dartmouth College .\nStill , there are some perspectives on abortion in Islam that are more mainstream than others , like the belief that abortion before the fifth month of pregnancy is permissable . This opinion is largely based on a Hadith that says the ensoulment of a fetus occurs 120 days after conception .\nSimilar to Judaism , many Muslims also believe in life-saving abortion . \u201c In a scenario in which there is fatal harm to the mother , I would say a majority of Muslim authority figures would agree abortion would be permissible , \u201d Ayubi said .\nWhile there are certainly anti-abortion Muslims , for Muslims who are pro-choice \u201c because of their faith and not in spite of it \u201d \u2014as Rev . Zeh put it\u2014banning life-saving abortion or abortion before 17 weeks , or 120 days , could be considered infringing on their religious freedoms . And a reality in which that happens isn \u2019 t far-fetched : in 2019 , six states passed six to eight week abortion bans that have been blocked from becoming law\u2014so far .\nAlso last year , Alabama , which has one of the highest Muslim populations in the country , passed a temporarily blocked abortion ban that prohibits abortion at all stages of a pregnancy and even in the case of rape or incest , making only one exception for the endangerment of the mother \u2019 s life . In response , local and national Jewish groups and figures largely condemned the ban .\nLike in Islam , many Buddhists and Hindus disagree on the permissability of abortion within their respective religions .
