    "content": "Last night 's Republican presidential debate was interesting for all the wrong reasons . We learned little . The candidates evaded the toughest questions . Moderators failed to challenge fact-free answers . And the dynamics did n't change .\nWhat happened was less a debate among contenders and more a showdown between the candidates and the moderators . Everyone attacked the moderators when they heard a question they didn \u2019 t like , and then made a show of their rebelliousness - this was great for anti-media conservatives , but a distraction for everyone else . The moderators had their moments , but they were mostly awful . Frivolous questions about Rubio \u2019 s absenteeism or Trump \u2019 s \u201c moral character \u201d or fantasy football gave the candidates just enough fodder to avoid answering the hard questions whenever they were asked . The result of all this was two and a half hours of political gas .\nIt \u2019 s hard to say whether Trump did well or poorly . His shtick almost defies analysis . I expected him to come out swinging , but he didn \u2019 t do that , despite being surrounded by low-energy losers .\nHe had a few moments , though . He reminded everyone of his plans to build a `` big , beautiful wall '' on the Southern border , but making sure to note that he 'll add a door right in the middle , so Mexicans can walk in \u201c legally. \u201d When John Harwood cited a few inconvenient facts about his tax plan , he ignored them and boasted that right-wing economist and CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow likes it - that settled the dispute . At some point Trump was asked about guns . `` I do carry occasionally , '' he said . `` Sometimes a lot . I like to be unpredictable , so people do n't know I 'm carrying . '' Also , he 'd feel `` safer '' if his employees ( all of them ) carried guns at work .\nBottom line : Trump held his ground . He was vulnerable tonight , particularly after slipping in the national polls this week , but he avoided any direct attacks . As a frontrunner , that \u2019 s all he needed to do .\nI \u2019 m tempted to say Carson failed tonight , but that \u2019 s not really true . Tonight was a win for Carson . He \u2019 s now a legitimate frontrunner , having overtaken Trump in the latest CBS/NYT poll . He \u2019 s also leading in Iowa by a wide margin . I assumed the other candidates would go after him , but they didn \u2019 t , with the exception of John Kasich 's brief jibe at Carson 's simplistic , tithing-inspired tax plan .\nBy and large , Carson 's rivals allowed him to continue his nice guy routine . He avoided specifics and he pivoted from question to platitude faster than anyone else on that stage . He uttered phrases like I \u201c hate the concept of regulations , because they \u2019 re in everything , \u201d but no one pointed out how stupid that is . I thought he \u2019 d have to defend his recent gaffes ( i.e . equating women who have abortions to slaveholders ) but they weren \u2019 t even mentioned . The most important thing for Carson : He escaped another debate without explaining any of his policies or admitting that he doesn \u2019 t understand half the questions \u2013 that 's a victory .\nJeb was the big loser tonight . He had the most at stake and he did nothing to help himself . His campaign is collapsing , his poll numbers are falling , and his donors are panicking . His only goal tonight was to plug the leak , to convince his financiers that he \u2019 s still a good investment . He failed to do that . In addition to fending off Trump , Jeb had to damage Rubio , who is quickly becoming the establishment guy . But he couldn \u2019 t do it , because he \u2019 s a terrible candidate and nothing he says or does works in this campaign . He almost succeeded at demonstrating his regular guyness when he referenced his fantasy football record ( he 's 7-0 ) , but even that felt unnatural and canned . More than anyone else , Jed needed a boost tonight . He needed to be seen as strong and presidential . None of that happened . He was low-energy , basically .\nTonight was an opportunity for Rubio . He \u2019 s rising in the polls and he needed to capitalize on his momentum . I thought he did that . There were no obviously bad moments for him . And he managed to avoid taking any direct hits , including from Jeb and the two frontrunners . Even his dumb answers were received well . When asked about his greatest weakness , he said he loves America too much . When asked why he never shows up for work at the Senate , he said it \u2019 s because America needs him . And the audience loved it . I suspect he \u2019 ll become the preferred establishment alternative to Bush , if he is n't already . Rubio 's young , polished and reasonable-sounding enough to be competitive in a general election . He ca n't beat Hillary , but he may be the best shot they have .\nI thought Fiorina \u2019 s political star was fading before the debate . Nothing tonight changed my opinion . After rising to third in the polls after the first two debates , Fiorina has dipped well below Rubio and Bush . Her strategy so far has been to repeat lies over and over again until they become true . She did that again tonight , particularly on her record as CEO of Hewlett-Packard , which is disastrous . She said something about reforming the tax code by reducing it to three pages , so that farmers could understand it - still not sure if that 's a good thing . She almost had one of her contrived moments when she attacked Hillary Clinton 's feminist credentials . `` It is the height of hypocrisy for Hillary Clinton to talk about being the first woman president , '' she said , `` When every single policy she espouses ... has been bad for women . '' She did n't name a single one of those policies , though , and no one asked .\nBottom line : Fiorina said nothing tonight she hasn \u2019 t said before . Her window has closed . She 'll be out of the race in a few months .\nThere \u2019 s not much to say about Rand Paul . He was a non-factor before the debate and he \u2019 ll be a non-factor after the debate . Paul \u2019 s only chance in this race was to excite the libertarian wing of the Republican Party . He hasn \u2019 t been able to do that , though I \u2019 m not sure why . He did reasonably well tonight , but no one will notice . Paul just doesn \u2019 t matter at this point . He was mostly an afterthought until the end of the debate , when he said something about liberty thriving when a government is so small that you can \u2019 t see it . I doubt that insight will resuscitate his campaign . But he 's got a big filibuster coming up , so that ought to keep him in the headlines for a little longer .\nTed Cruz is impossible to ignore . He \u2019 s creepy and awkward and deeply annoying , but he just won \u2019 t go away . As expected , he did well tonight . At the beginning of the debate , he confessed that his greatest weakness is his love of the constitution ( What else could it be ? ) . He also said something about driving people ( drunk people , I think ) home at the end of the night , which wasn \u2019 t weird at all . All told , tonight was a win for Cruz . He pandered to his religious base and performed his rehearsed speeches with characteristic flair . He even took a few jabs at the media , which conservatives absolutely love . I doubt he gets a boost in the polls , but he definitely didn \u2019 t hurt himself tonight . So long as he 's got the evangelical and Tea party demographics cornered , Cruz has staying power .\nThere isn \u2019 t much to say about Huckabee . If he wasn \u2019 t selling books or angling for a TV show , I imagine he would \u2019 ve dropped out of the race a long time ago . He said nothing new or interesting tonight . In fact , he barely spoke at all , and when he did it was brief and immediately forgettable . He was at the bottom of the polls before the debate , and that \u2019 s where he \u2019 ll be tomorrow .\nKasich continues to be one of the more interesting candidates in the race . His strategy has been to remain the sensible , moderate guy , the one who can appeal to centrists and moderates in a general election . He \u2019 s been more aggressive lately , however . I expected him to be in attack mode tonight , because he needs to do something to break through , but he was fairly cautious . Tonight he tried to distinguish himself as the only candidate who \u2019 s pragmatic enough to get things done in Washington . But this has been his approach from the very beginning . It hasn \u2019 t worked so far and I doubt it will now .\nChristie did well tonight , but it wasn \u2019 t enough . His tough guy routine hasn \u2019 t been as effective with Trump on the stage , so his strategy was to attack the moderators rather than his fellow candidates . Basically , every Christie statement was a variation of the phrase : \u201c We \u2019 re talking about X when we should be talking about Y ! \u201d That \u2019 s it . He also said we have to be honest with old people and just tell them the truth , which is that \u201c the government lied to you and stole your money \u201d and you \u2019 ll \u201c never see it again. \u201d I \u2019 m not sure what to make of that , so I \u2019 ll just leave it right there . Something tells me Christie will hang around for a while , but he 's got no chance to win this thing .",
