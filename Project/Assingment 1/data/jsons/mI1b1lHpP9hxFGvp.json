    "content_original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, is proposing changes to the estate tax.\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed nearly doubling the top estate-tax rate to 77% from 40%, continuing progressives\u2019 push for new and expansive ways to tax the wealthiest Americans and combat inequality.\n\nThe plan announced Thursday by Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who is considering a second run for the Democratic presidential nomination, would also lower the per-person exemption from the estate tax to $3.5 million from $11.4 million.\n\nThat top estate-tax rate of 77%\u2014matching the top rate in effect from 1941 through 1976\u2014would apply only to wealth above $1 billion. The tax would start at a 45% rate for wealth between $3.5 million and $10 million, and includes 50% and 55% brackets.\n\nAs Democrats gear up to challenge President Trump next year, they are looking to raise revenue for government programs, push back against inequality and offer politically popular proposals. Taxing billionaires could check all of those boxes. \u201cFrom a moral, economic, and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little,\u201d Mr. Sanders said Thursday. Last week, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) proposed an annual wealth tax. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), who has become one of the most closely watched progressives in Congress, has pushed the party\u2019s conversation to the left with her talk of a 70% top income-tax rate on income above $10 million. Presidential hopefuls are stepping out of the shadows, but their 2020 announcements are far from spontaneous. WSJ\u2019s Shelby Holliday explains. Congress has steadily narrowed the reach of the estate tax over the past few decades so that it is now paid by the estates of just 0.1% of those who die each year. This year, estates will file fewer than 2,000 taxable returns, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group run by a former Obama administration official. Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal would push that number to 0.2%, according to his office. The Tax Policy Center estimates that a $3.5 million exemption would mean that 0.5% of estates would pay. Mr. Sanders is also proposing to curb some estate-planning techniques that let wealthy individuals avoid or escape the estate tax. Most Republicans, including Mr. Trump, favor repealing the tax, but they haven\u2019t mustered enough votes to do so. The 2017 tax law doubled the per-person exemption, though that expansion is scheduled to expire after 2025. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Sanders proposed a 65% top tax estate-tax rate, an idea that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also adopted. The Tax Policy Center estimated that Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan then would increase federal revenue by $237 billion over a decade. Mr. Sanders\u2019s office said his plan would raise up to $2.2 trillion from billionaires. That estimate assumes no deductions for charitable bequests and the money would only come to the government when those people die, not necessarily over the next 10 years.
