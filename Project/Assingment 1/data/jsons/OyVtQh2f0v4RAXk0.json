Featuring 11 candidates\u2014including Carly Fiorina , who was bumped up from the \u201c kids table \u201d debate following a change in CNN 's eligibility criteria\u2014the discussion lasted for three hours , with topics including everything from immigration to vaccinations .\nFiorina wasted no time in justifying why she was allowed to participate on the main stage . She dominated the first third of the debate , and made her presence known immediately . Fiorina struck first on foreign policy , and proved that she was informed and qualified to deal with foreign leaders .\nShe also showed intense debating talent by managing to seamlessly meld Iran and pro-life issues in one coherent response :\nAnd finally , Fiorina closed out her dominating first-hour performance by taking the high road after being asked to respond to Donald Trump 's `` look at that face '' comment from last week . Rather than snark back at Trump 's own `` persona , '' Fiorina responded tactfully that `` women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said . ''\nIn what was likely the most viral moment of the night , Sen. Rand Paul ( KY ) called out Gov . Jeb Bush ( FL ) for his past marijuana use yet reluctance to embrace medical or recreational marijuana legalization . Bush admitted to smoking weed , and an argument over marijuana legalization ensued .\nSen. Marco Rubio also had a decent performance , sounding coherent and logical on immigration and immigration reform . Rubio highlighted the need for sensible immigration reform to fix the legal immigration system that `` no longer works , '' and stressed the need for a merit-based system .\nNew Jersey Gov . Chris Christie was in rare form last night , and was much livelier and focused than he was in the first debate . Christie defended Pres . Bush 's invasion of Afghanistan , citing his family 's personal experience on September 11 , 2001 and his work as a prosecutor .\nPerhaps the most head-scratching moment of the night came at the hands of Dr. Ben Carson and Donald Trump . When Carson , a neurosurgeon , was asked to basically tell Trump to stop saying that vaccines cause autism , ( they do n't ) he essentially waffled and refused to straight-up condemn Trump 's comments . Carson easily could have swept the floor with Trump on this , considering , you know , he 's a doctor , but he settled for a lame laugh line .\nAs Katie wrote , Bush and Gov . Scott Walker did n't have much in the category of memorable lines , but this tag-team exchange defending George W. Bush 's policies was a highlight :",
