That turned out to be an overly generous rounding of the underwhelming real figure : $ 5.7 million .\nYet those are n't even the most troublesome parts of the Florida senator 's most recent campaign finance report . Rubio may be slowly rising in the polls , but his third quarter filing revealed a campaign that 's also out-manned by many of its rivals in the early-voting states . His staff is largely concentrated in Washington , with just a small umbrella of on-the-ground , early-state operatives -- and he 's already at a disadvantage because he has n't invested the time in early-state visits that some of his opponents have .\nFor all the recent buzz surrounding his candidacy -- fueled by strong debate performances -- Rubio is n't raising enough money to keep pace with his rivals in the top tier and he 's running out of time to assemble a robust field organization .\n`` If Trump-mania subsides , you \u2019 ve got to have a mechanism and a structure , '' said Chip Felkel , a South Carolina Republican strategist who is n't affiliated with any campaign . `` I think you \u2019 re being risky if you don \u2019 t put a structure in place .
