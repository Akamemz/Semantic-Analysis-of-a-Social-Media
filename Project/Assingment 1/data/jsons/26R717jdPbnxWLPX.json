He wants the White House and the IRS to \u201cimmediately redouble\u201d efforts to shut down conservative political-action groups through tougher government oversight and enforcement.\n\nThe Tea Party opposes much of President Obama\u2019s agenda, and to Mr. Schumer, that\u2019s both a sin and a crime.\n\nIn a speech last week to the liberal Center for American Progress, the senior senator from New York said, \u201cThere are many things that can be done administratively by the IRS and other government agencies\u201d to silence groups that obstruct Democratic policies.\n\nWhen several dozen conservative organizations applied to the IRS for nonprofit status in the run-up to the 2012 elections, they had to struggle through bureaucratic roadblocks and obstacles while the applications of liberal groups sailed through without a hitch.

The administration says the revised regulations are needed to improve the way such organizations are regulated, but it\u2019s obvious the rules were changed to thwart the legitimate politicking of the Tea Party.\n\nLiberals just can\u2019t get over the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court that guaranteed the free speech of everyone.
