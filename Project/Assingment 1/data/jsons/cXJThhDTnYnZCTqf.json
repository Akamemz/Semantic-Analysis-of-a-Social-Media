I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.\u201d\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s remarks on Friday, Sal Petruzzi, a TBS spokesman, said there would be no further comment beyond the earlier apologies.\n\nThe show immediately faced a backlash from some advertisers.\n\nState Farm Insurance said it had suspended its commercials. \u201cWe constantly review programs to ensure alignment to our programming guidelines and brand values,\u201d spokesman Jim Camoriano said in a statement.\n\nAutotrader also suspended its sponsorship, calling Bee\u2019s comments \u201coffensive\u201d in a statement.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidential candidacy was thrown into crisis in 2016 after a tape emerged of him boasting about being able to grab women by their genitalia because of his star status. He had made those comments as he waited to film a segment for the TV program, \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d in 2005.\n\nTrump later apologized, calling it \u201clocker room banter.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Television host Samantha Bee poses at the 2017 Creative Arts Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 9, 2017.
