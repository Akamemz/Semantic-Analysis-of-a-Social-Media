    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : Today , in this holiday special , we spend the hour with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders , the independent , self-proclaimed socialist from Vermont who shocked the political establishment by nearly beating Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary . Since Donald Trump \u2019 s victory on November 8th , Sanders has emerged as one of the most powerful voices in Washington . He just published a best-selling book titled Our Revolution .\nI sat down with Bernie Sanders at the Free Library of Philadelphia on November 28th , a few weeks after the election . It was his most extensive broadcast interview since the election . But first we \u2019 ll turn to an excerpt of the speech he gave that night .\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS : People are , you know , interested in knowing , well , how did Trump win ? How did he win the Electoral College ? And I think one of the things that he did was tap into an anxiety and a level of pain that we don \u2019 t often see on CBS or NBC . And what he said , preposterously , I might add , is that he , of all people , was going to take on the establishment . He was going to take on the economic establishment . He was going to take on the political establishment . He was going to take on the media establishment . And people in a lot of desperation , people who are hurting , responded to that .\nNow , one of the problems I think we have as a nation , I think media\u2014and , by the way , at the back of the book , one of the important chapters\u2014if you get tired , skip to the back . If you don \u2019 t like taxation or immigration reform , go to the back , last chapter , which deals with\u2014it \u2019 s entitled \u201c Corporate Media , a Threat to Democracy. \u201d And it talks about the role of corporate media in our society and in politics , in particular . But what is going on in this country is that we live in a pretty siloized nation . That \u2019 s a kind of a inside-the-Beltway term ; I don \u2019 t know if it \u2019 s expanded to Pennsylvania . But what it means is we all live in our own worlds , basically . We associate with people who think the same as we do . I guess there was somebody who said , \u201c How could Trump have won ? Nobody I knew voted for Trump ! \u201d Well , you don \u2019 t know people in different walks of life than your own . And one of the things that a lot of middle-class people , upper-middle-class people don \u2019 t know is that , yes , we are better off economically today than we were eight years ago , when Bush left office\u2014there \u2019 s no debate on that\u2014but for 40 years in this country , under Democratic and Republican administrations , we have seen a shrinking of the American middle class , we have seen more and more income and wealth inequality , so that today the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent , and today we have 43 million people living in poverty , some in really dire straits .\nNow , one of the things that I did in the campaign\u2014what I wanted to do , and I did\u2014was to go into parts of the country where media very rarely goes , and I wanted to be talking to people , and I wanted to see if we can get some national exposure . And in a sense , I failed . We had media following me all over the place , what they call embedded media , from all the networks and major newspapers , but basically they did not write about what we were seeing in various parts of the country .\nAnd let me just talk a little bit about that . We talked\u2014and again , these are facts ; some of you know it , some of you don \u2019 t . But I want you to understand the pain and the hurt that millions of people are experiencing . You \u2019 re a single mom in Philadelphia . You \u2019 re making $ 30,000 , $ 40,000 a year . You have a baby . You need childcare in order to get to work . You know how much childcare costs ? You tell me . What does childcare cost in Pennsylvania , in Philadelphia ? $ 15,000 a year ? More ? Anyone know ? Fifteen ? All right . What do you do if you \u2019 re making $ 30,000 , $ 40,000 a year , and you \u2019 re paying $ 15,000 for childcare ? And that \u2019 s\u2014I can tell you , in Washington , D.C. , I had a young woman working for me . She had\u2014she was paying $ 32,000 a year for childcare in D.C. , where it \u2019 s more expensive there than the rest of the country .\nHealthcare , right ? We talk about the gains of the Affordable Care Act . And that \u2019 s true , it did make some progress . Today , 28 million people still have no health insurance , and many , many others have high deductibles and high copayments . They can not afford to go to the doctor when they get sick . You know that ? We lose thousands of people every single year . And I talk to doctors all over the country . People walk into their office profoundly sick , and the doctor said , \u201c Why didn \u2019 t you come in here a year ago , when you first developed your symptom ? \u201d And they say , \u201c Well , I didn \u2019 t have any insurance , \u201d or , \u201c I had a high deductible , and I couldn \u2019 t afford it. \u201d Some of those people do not make it , or they end up in the hospital at great expense and great suffering . One out of five Americans today who go to the doctor and get a prescription can not afford to fill that prescription . One out of five . You \u2019 ve got elderly people in Vermont and , I \u2019 m sure , in Pennsylvania who are cutting their prescription drug pills in half , because they can not afford to pay for the medicine that they need . What do you think you \u2019 re feeling when you go to the doctor because you \u2019 re sick , and you walk into the drug store , and the medicine is so expensive , you can not afford to fill it ?\nYou got in Pennsylvania and in Vermont and all over this country , added together , millions of seniors , disabled veterans , people with disabilities . They are trying to get by on $ 10,000 , $ 11,000 , $ 12,000 a year Social Security . You can do the arithmetic as well as I can . You \u2019 re 80 years of age . You are sick . Social Security is your sole source of income , as it is for many people . Try to get by on $ 12,000 a year .\nYou are an older worker\u2014and I think Trump really capitalized on this one . You are an older worker , 55 or 60 years of age . Half of the older workers in America , do you know how much money they have in the bank as they await retirement ? Anyone want to guess ? Zero ! Try to think of yourself at 60 years of age . You \u2019 re going to retire in five years . Everything being equal , you \u2019 re probably making less in real inflation-accounted-for dollars than you did 20 or 30 years ago . You \u2019 re going to retire in five years . You \u2019 ve got nothing in the bank . How are you feeling about the establishment and what the Democratic Party has done for you or the Republican Party has done for you ? You are scared to death .\nAnd maybe , in fact , you \u2019 re one of the many millions of workers who actually once had a factory job with a union behind you , and you were making good middle-class wages , you had good benefits , you had a pension . But one day your employer told you that they \u2019 re shutting down that plant , because they can hire people in China for a dollar or $ 2 an hour , and now you \u2019 re making 50 , 60 percent of what you made when you had that manufacturing job .\nYou can be a college graduate , somebody who saved and scrimped and went to college , left school $ 50,000 , $ 60,000 in debt , and now you \u2019 re making $ 14 an hour . Again , do the arithmetic . You \u2019 re stuck with that debt , year after year after year . You \u2019 ve got a debt , but you don \u2019 t have the income to pay it off . I remember distinctly talking to a guy in Nevada who said that he took out his student loan 25 years ago . He is more in debt today than he was when he took it out , and he \u2019 s scared to death , literally , that they \u2019 re going to garnish some of his Social Security in order to pay that student debt .\nI was in McDowell County in West Virginia , not a widely known area . It \u2019 s the southern part of West Virginia . But what makes McDowell County unique , what makes parts of Kentucky and that region unique , is they are part of a situation today where millions\u2014this is quite unbelievable , but this is the despair that Trump spoke to\u2014millions of white working-class people are dying today at ages younger than their parents . What modern history has been about , not only in our country , but all over the world , is that my generation lives longer than my parents \u2019 , my parents \u2019 generation lived longer than their parents \u2019 . That \u2019 s been the trend , because of improvements in public health , improvements in medicine\u2014cancer and so forth . We \u2019 re making some progress . And yet , unbelievably\u2014and this is really unbelievable\u2014millions of people today are living in such despair , for whatever reasons\u2014and maybe Amy and I will discuss this\u2014is that they are turning to opiates and heroin . They are turning to alcohol and getting all kinds of diseases associated with alcoholism . And they are turning to suicide\u2014women and men . These are people who , if they \u2019 re lucky enough to have a job , it \u2019 s 10 bucks an hour , 11 bucks an hour . They \u2019 re not going anywhere . Their kids are not going anywhere . That is the kind of pain that somebody like a Trump spoke to .\nI was in Pine Ridge in South Dakota , which is a Native American reservation . The life expectancy in Pine Ridge is equivalent to Guatemala , a poor Third World country . Unemployment is rampant . Poverty is rampant . You have\u2014suicide is rampant in Pine Ridge .\nI was in Baltimore , Maryland . And I don \u2019 t know how different it is here in Philadelphia . But in Baltimore , you have tens and tens of thousands of people addicted to heroin , astronomical numbers . People debate exactly what the number is . And there is no treatment available to them . We took a walk one night , which got the Secret Service a little bit nervous , because we were walking in an area that was incredibly desolate , only boarded-up buildings . And in nighttime\u2014we were in late afternoon . In the nighttime , it becomes a drug bazaar . Everybody knows it . That \u2019 s where people are selling and buying drugs . Tens of thousands of people in Baltimore\u2014and not uniquely Baltimore\u2014dealing with heroin , dealing with opiates , and no treatment available to them .\nCity after city\u2014and I suspect Philadelphia is not an exception\u2014in minority areas , African-American areas , Latino areas , youth unemployment , 20 , 30 , 40 percent . I was in New York City , took a walk with some people on the City Council there . They need $ 17 billion to rehabilitate public housing in New York City alone . So you \u2019 ve got people in public housing living in rat-infested , mold-infested housing in New York .\nWhat \u2019 s the point ? The point is there are a lot of people hurting in this country . And their pain doesn \u2019 t get on CBS or NBC . And some of them , mistakenly , thought that Trump was talking to them . He talked a whole lot of stuff . We will see what , in fact , he delivers . But the main point is , please do not forget that , as we speak today , there are a whole lot of people in this country who are hurting .\nWhat media does and what media loves is conflict and political gossip and polls and fundraising and all that stuff . What media loves is to focus on the candidates . What the American people , I believe , want is for us to focus on them , not the candidates , not anymore . And what this book does is just do that . It deals with what I think\u2014and some of you will agree , some of you may not agree\u2014with what I think are the major issues facing our country : the decline and disappearance of the American middle class , poverty , income and wealth inequality . But it doesn \u2019 t only lay out the problems ; it provides very specific solutions .\nQuestion : Why are we the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people ? Why are we the only major country not to have paid family and medical leave ? Why do we have a higher rate of childhood poverty than almost any major country on Earth ? Why are we not dealing more aggressively with climate change ? Why do we have more people in jail , disproportionately African-American , Latino , Native American , than any other country on Earth ? China , four times our size , we have far more people in jail than China does . We spend $ 80 billion a year locking people up . Does that make sense ? Is there a way out of that ? What do we do when we have 11 million people who are undocumented ? What does it mean to move toward comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship ? In a highly competitive global economy , we once used to have the best-educated workforce in the world , 30 years or so . Our people , in this country , graduated and went to college in a higher percentage than any other country on Earth . You know what ? That \u2019 s not the case anymore . And the gap between those countries who are graduating more people from college than we are is getting wider and wider and wider . What does this portend in terms of the future of our country ?\nSo , we lay the issues out on the table , discuss the problems and also provide some real concrete solutions . And that \u2019 s what I think we have to do as a nation . And in terms of media , there \u2019 s a chapter that says that maybe it \u2019 s time for media to start focusing on the real issues facing our country . It was embarrassing . I read this as I wrote the book . Turns out that if you looked at , I think it was , the Sunday morning shows , Bernie Sanders alone\u2014and I say this not to boast , but to tell you how pathetic the situation is\u2014two-thirds of the discussion or the mention of poverty took place when I was on those shows . So what does that say about a country when there \u2019 s almost no discussion of poverty , no discussion\u2014almost no discussion of climate change , very little discussion of income and wealth inequality , no discussion of the role of the corporate media ? And I \u2019 m glad that Amy is going to be up here in a minute , because what she has done is shown that it is possible , although very difficult , to go outside of the corporate media and develop your own network . But what does corporate media talk about , what do they not talk about , where do we go forward in media is a very , very important issue .\nAMY GOODMAN : Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders , speaking November 28th at the Free Library of Philadelphia . When we come back , we sit down for a public interview on the stage at the library . This is \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! Back in a minute .",
