    "content": "President Trump has rewritten the Washington playbook on trade politics , and many Republican Senate candidates are chasing after him , embracing get-tough approaches that would have been unthinkable for them just a few years ago .\nRep. Luke Messer of Indiana , a former free trade advocate who delivered a rousing floor speech in 2015 saying open markets create jobs and economic opportunities , is blunt about the transformation : \u201c The president has changed my opinion on these trade agreements , \u201d he said in a debate among Republicans running for the party \u2019 s Senate nomination .\nHis rivals \u2014 Rep. Todd Rokita and former state lawmaker Mike Braun \u2014 have staked out similar positions , backing Mr. Trump \u2019 s criticism of \u201c unfair \u201d trade deals as well as his decision last month to slap tariffs on Chinese imports .\nRepublican Rep. James B. Renacci said he is constantly weighing the pros and cons of trade as he calibrates his positions ahead of a Senate run in Ohio .\nDemocrats say Mr. Renacci is being wishy-washy after a long career of voting for free trade deals , including agreements with South Korea , Colombia and Panama in 2011 , and fast-track trade negotiating powers for President Obama in 2015 .\nIn Pennsylvania , Rep. Lou Barletta also backed free trade in 2011 and 2015 , but now as a Senate candidate , he touts his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and praises Mr. Trump \u2019 s stiffer stance .\nSEE ALSO : Trump insists there is no trade war with China\n\u201c The politics of trade have changed enormously since Trump became president , \u201d said Darrell West , vice president and director of governance studies and director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution . \u201c Most Republicans supported free trade , but now they have embraced his tough stance on China . \u201d\nMr. Trump had long been a critic of U.S. trade policy , and as president he has backed up his talk with action . He withdrew from the TPP , the trade deal Mr. Obama negotiated with the 2015 fast-track powers , and he demanded rewrites of free trade agreements with South Korea , Canada and Mexico .\nThe irony is that it was Republicans who provided the bulk of votes for each of those deals , with 90 percent supporting the Korean agreement in 2011 , among them then-Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana , and three-quarters backing fast-track powers in 2015 .\n\u201c I think this phenomenon illustrates the importance of leadership , especially from the president , on trade as well as the fact that Trump remains fairly popular within the party , \u201d said Colin Grabow , policy analyst at the Cato Institute \u2019 s Herbert A Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies .\n\u201c What \u2019 s most disappointing is that this protectionist approach will continue to yield self-inflicted wounds and lead to the kind of tit-for-tat exchange we are seeing now that makes Americans less free and ultimately harms workers and consumers , \u201d said Tim Phillips , president of Americans for Prosperity . \u201c Hurting consumers and making them pay more for everyday goods is never good politics . \u201d\nDavid McIntosh , president of the Club for Growth , said it marks a definite shift from the Bush years , when Republicans took for granted that trade deals were always good for the country .\n\u201c What I think is missing is leadership on why trade is important , how many jobs are created because of free trade , how much people benefit in their standard of living because of the cheaper goods they are able to get , \u201d Mr. McIntosh said .\nMr. McIntosh said tariffs have proved to be ineffective and predicted the same will happen once it becomes clear that the latest round do more harm than good .\n\u201c I worry about candidates who are trying to go off and beat their chests and try to be macho about how they are against trade , \u201d he said . \u201c I think we will get the right balance there , but you will see some casualties when you see these candidates swing too far in toward protectionism . \u201d\nMr. McIntosh said flight from free trade isn \u2019 t universal within the Republican Party and that a number of prominent candidates are sticking to their records .\nSupport for the North American Free Trade Agreement among Republican voters has dropped from 43 percent in 2008 to 34 percent now , according to a poll in August from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs .\nDemocrats , meanwhile , are becoming bullish on trade , with 71 percent of their voters backing NAFTA \u2014 up from just 41 percent in 2008 .\nFormer Rep. Robin Hayes of North Carolina lived through several Republican trade battles .\nOne was in 2001 , when the House was voting on whether to grant President George W. Bush fast-track trade promotion authority . Mr. Hayes worried that his state \u2019 s textile industry , already battered by NAFTA , would be further damaged .\nHe was reduced to tears as House Republican leaders pressured him to be the deciding vote in what turned out to be a 215-214 victory for Mr. Bush .\nFour years later , Mr. Hayes again had to be pressured to switch his vote and back the Central America Free Trade Agreement , which cleared the House by a 217-215 vote . Mr. Hayes then lost his seat in the 2008 election .\nMr. Hayes , a former textile mill owner whose home state bled textile jobs after the passage of NAFTA , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the votes were tough but he stood by them . He said he was able to win important concessions in exchange for his support .\n\u201c I have to live with myself in terms of this vote regardless of political implications or outcomes , \u201d he said . \u201c Was this the right vote ? It absolutely was based on the big picture . We have to have international markets . \u201d\nAsked what he makes of lawmakers who have supported open markets in the past only to adopt the Trump mantle on trade in recent months , Mr. Hayes likened them to Don Quixote in \u201c Man of La Mancha . \u201d\n\u201c If I was advising people running a campaign , I would say , \u2018 Think in depth about the position you take and you believe in it , \u2019 \u201d he said . \u201c Make sure it is something you can say six months , six years , from now , \u2018 I did the right thing . \u2019 \u201d\nWhile Mr. Hayes took heat for going from a no to a yes on trade for Mr. Bush , Republican candidates now are facing criticism for going the other way for Mr. Trump .\nIn the Indiana Republican primary Mr. Braun appears in a television commercial strolling around town with cardboard cutouts of his rivals , highlighting their votes to grant Mr. Obama trade authority .\nMr. Rokita , meanwhile , has accused Mr. Braun \u2019 s trucking company of benefiting from lopsided trade deals that have displaced American workers .\n\u201c Mike Braun is a bigger hypocrite than even Mexico Joe , \u201d said Nathan Brand , a Rokita spokesman .\nThe Braun and Messer campaigns did not respond to inquiries .\nDemocrats say all of the Republican candidates are opportunists on trade and that Sen.
