There\u2019s significant disagreement, however, over what it may mean for Trump\u2019s chances at winning another term in November.\n\nTo some observers, the president\u2019s inability to draw a sizable crowd in a state he won by 36 points in 2016 is a sign that enthusiasm among his base supporters has eroded.
