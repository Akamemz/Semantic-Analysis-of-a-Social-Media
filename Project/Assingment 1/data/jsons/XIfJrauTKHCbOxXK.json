Ted Cruz , R-Texas , and other conservatives who have consistently opposed no-strings-attached debt hikes will insist on a 60-vote supermajority to move the debt bill forward .

Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , a bipartisan centrist , and GOP moderates , Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , and Sen. Mark Kirk , R-Ill.

It may be easier for McConnell to whip votes with a blizzard on the way .\nCruz not enthused - \u201c Historically , the debt ceiling has proven the most effective leverage for reining in spending ; 28 times , Congress has attached meaningful conditions to debt ceiling increases . We should do so again to address the real problem. \u201d \u2014Sen .

We \u2019 ve seen that before , we see it again. \u201d That was how Speaker John Boehner explained his decision to withdraw from the debt-limit battlefield . The debt-ceiling bill passed on a 221-201 vote after conservative Republicans in the House failed to reach an agreement among themselves over what to demand in exchange for granting the president more borrowing authority . Boehner and other GOP leaders were among those joined Democrats and voted yes . The speaker announced before the vote that that was the strategy . \u201c We \u2019 ll let the Democrats put the votes up . We \u2019 ll put a minimum number of ( GOP ) votes up to get it passed , \u201d Boehner said . \u201c We 'll let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants. \u201d More .\nDaily Caller : \u201c Democrats claim three million people have enrolled in private health insurance through Obamacare .

Kelly Ayotte , R-N.H. , discusses ObamaCare in the 10 a.m .

Obama said the latest delay was meant to help employers operating in \u201c good faith \u201d so that no one is \u201c unnecessarily burdened \u201d or punished . \u201c This was [ an ] example of , administratively , us making sure that we 're smoothing out this transition , \u201d Obama said . Without going into detail , the president suggested the administration would continue to be flexible on the law .\nCGI gets ObamaCare Web site blame\u2026 and new contracts - NYT : \u201c After denigrating the work of CGI and replacing it as the largest contractor on the federal health care website , the Obama administration is negotiating with the company to extend its work on the project for a few months . And the new prime contractor , Accenture , is trying to recruit and hire CGI employees to work under its supervision . \u201d\nSen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , will file a class-action lawsuit against the National Security Agency over domestic spying today . In a Web video encouraging Americans to join the suit , Paul says \u201c Our founders never intended for Americans to trust their government , our entire Constitution was predicated on the notion that government was a necessary evil to be restrained and minimized as much as possible. \u201d Paul will be joined by lead attorney Ken Cuccinelli , the former Virginia attorney general to announce the lawsuit this afternoon . \u2013Watch Fox : Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge has the latest on the suit .\nZut alors ! Virginian Charles Hurt was not impressed by the twin presidential visit to Thomas Jefferson \u2019 s Monticello . \u201c It is easy to imagine Jefferson \u2019 s soul , which lurks around every doorway , in every boxwood bush at Monticello , weeping at President Obama \u2019 s words . But more likely , he chuckled \u2013 if mournfully . This always is how tyranny hatches , and nobody warned us of it more starkly than Jefferson . Touring alongside Mr. Obama was French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande , who looks more like a dirty little man in a short trench coat than a president . Oh my , how far we have fallen since Gen.

With all precincts reporting , Republican Kevin Faulconer beat Alvarez , 54.5 percent to 45.5 percent to replace disgraced former Democratic Mayor Bob Filner , who was forced out of office over sexual misconduct . The result is a boon to Southern California Republican House candidates hoping the midterm climate will help the GOP reclaim some of their lost ground in the formerly Republican-friendly region . Fox News reports .\nFilner got shady cash from Mexican tycoon - Foreign Policy : \u201c In a first of its kind case , federal prosecutors say a Mexican businessman funneled more than $ 500,000 into U.S. political races through Super PACs and various shell companies\u2026 Local newspaper UT San Diego traced the contributions and identified the candidates as former [ Democratic ] San Diego Mayor Bob Filner , [ Republican ] District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis , [ Democratic ] mayoral candidate Nathan Fletcher and a U.S. congressman believed to be Juan Vargas ( D-CA ) . \u201d\nWashington Examiner : \u201c In a move certain to stoke further speculation that he is seriously weighing a bid for the presidency , Ohio Gov .

Clyburn recounts receiving an explosive 2 a.m. phone call from the former president . US News has the eye-opening excerpt . Bottom line : One has to wonder how many more interesting , still unrevealed stories of Clinton power moves are yet to come \u2013 even before there is officially a candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201d \u2013 Bret Baier\nBubba pitches for Ross - Former President Bill Clinton is lending a hand today to Arkansas Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mike Ross . In an email to Ross supporters , Politico reports , Clinton writes : \u201c When I was running for governor of Arkansas in 1982 , a talented and energetic young man named Mike Ross was a big help to me and my campaign . Mike drove me all over the state and I became close friends with him . I even had a hunch that someday he might run for governor himself\u2026 \u201d Clinton adds : \u201c Take it from someone who knows a thing or two about being governor of Arkansas : Mike Ross will be a great one. \u201d This is the Big He \u2019 s first foray into a gubernatorial contest since stumping for longtime fundraiser Terry McAuliffe \u2019 s successful campaign in Virginia last year . The race to replace term-limited Gov . Mike Beebe , D-Ark. , is shaping up as a narrow contest between Ross , a former House member , and Republican frontrunner Asa Hutchison , a former congressman and head of the DEA .\nSunshine State News : \u201c Gov . Rick Scott [ R-Fla. ] brought in a campaign haul four times larger than former Gov . Charlie Crist [ now a Democrat ] did in the month of January , according to campaign finance reports . Scott \u2019 s \u2018 Let \u2019 s Get to Work \u2019 political committee raked in $ 3.4 million for the month of January . When coupled with $ 743,000 in contributions to his campaign account , the governor brought in $ 4.1 million in the first month of 2014 . Charlie Crist\u2026 brought in $ 637,000 through his \u2018 Charlie Crist for Florida \u2019 political committee and $ 375,000 from his own campaign , totaling $ 1,012,000 -- only a quarter of what Scott raised . So far , Gov . Scott severely outpaces Crist in the fundraising game \u2013 he \u2019 s raised $ 32,263,000 so far while Crist , who announced he \u2019 d be running for governor in November , has raised a total of $ 5,048,000 . \u201d\nRepublican businessman Bruce Rauner is the clear frontrunner in Illinois \u2019 GOP primary leading his challengers by 20 points in a Chicago Tribune/WGN poll .\n\u201c During a lengthy discussion with Philadelphia Weekly on Monday , U.S. Rep. Allyson Schwartz [ D-Pa. ] revealed that not only is she in favor of medical marijuana at the state level , but she \u2019 d be open to decriminalizing simple possession of the plant , as well , if she were governor . \u201d\nThe GOP needs to pick up six seats to wrest control of the Senate from Democrats . Which six seats currently held by the blue team could go red ? Based on Fox News First reader emails and tweets the consensus is : Arkansas , Montana , Louisiana , South Dakota , North Carolina and Alaska . But reader Scott Donaldson of Keller , Texas reminds us that Democrats would be hugely helped by potential GOP losses in either of the two races \u2013 Georgia and Kentucky \u2013 where nasty Republican primary fights give Democrats a chance to offset expected losses elsewhere . \u201c I think the general consensus is pretty much right on , \u201d but notes that \u201c with all the Hollywood money pouring into Kentucky , I think [ Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ] could lose . \u201d\nThe Madison Project , a conservative group led by former Rep. Jim Ryun \u2019 s , R-Kans. , announced its support Rep. Paul Broun , R-Ga. \u201c It is not an exaggeration to say that Congressman Paul Broun ( R-GA ) has sustained the most conservative voting record over the longest period of time of any sitting Republican in Congress , \u201d states the Madison Project press release announcing the endorsement . \u201c Even the fiercest conservative fighters tend to succumb to the establishment meat grinder after a few years . Paul Broun has been inviolable. \u201d Broun faces colleagues Reps. Phil Gingrey , R-Ga. , and Jack Kingston R-Ga. , former secretary of state Karen Handel , and businessman David Perdue in a May 20 primary .\nWith four months left until South Carolina \u2019 s GOP Senate primary , Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , is spending big to burnish his conservative credentials . The Palmetto State senator just launched a six-figure radio and television ad campaign . The ad praises Graham for opposing ObamaCare \u201c from day one , \u201d leading the \u201c fight on Benghazi , \u201d and for being \u201c a conservative leader who gets things done. \u201d Five Republicans are in the running to replace the two-term incumbent .\nA new poll conducted by the Republican Firm Harper Polling for the conservative American Action Forum finds Republican Ed Gillespie narrowing Sen. Mark Warner \u2019 s , D-Va. , lead . According to the survey , Warner now leads the former Republican National Committee chairman 44 percent to 38 percent . Earlier polling showed Warner leading Gillespie by over 20 points . Politico reports .\n\u201c President Barack Obama will host a fundraiser for House Democrats at the home of former NBA star Alonzo Mourning . That 's according to an invitation to the event obtained by The Associated Press . The event in Miami on March 20 will benefit the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers will also attend . \u201d\nPresident Obama \u2019 s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to Norway , George Tsunis , is a big-time political patron of the president \u2019 s but not much of an expert on the Scandinavian nation . T. Michael Davis of the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce is pleading for the Senate to reject Tsunis , who operates a 10-motel chain in the Northeastern U.S. On Davis \u2019 list of complaints : \u201c Well , he acknowledged he has never even been to Norway\u2026 He repeatedly referred to its prime minister as a \u2018 president , \u2019 apparently unaware Norway is a parliamentary democracy . He attacked Norway \u2019 s governing center-right coalition by disparaging the nation \u2019 s third-largest political party \u2013 a key player that holds no less than seven minister posts \u2013 mistakenly characterizing it as a group of \u2018 fringe elements \u2019 that \u2018 spew their hatred. \u2019 \u2026 Norwegians of all political stripes were deeply insulted , causing one member of Parliament to demand an apology from President Obama . \u2026The headline of a Norwegian daily smoldered : \u2018 Future US envoy displays total ignorance of Norway , \u2019 characterizing Tsunis as \u2018 faltering \u2019 and \u2018 incoherent \u2019 and committing \u2018 a jaw-dropping diplomatic blunder before he even begins. \u2019 \u201d Of course , this shouldn \u2019 t be much of a surprise . Noah Bryson Mamet , also an Obama political contributor , admitted he \u2019 d never been to Argentina , the country he \u2019 s been nominated to serve as U.S. ambassador .\n[ New at Fox News Opinion - John Stossel considers Privileged People : \u201c For the first time in history , six of the richest counties in the U.S. surround D.C . When a small group of people gets to dispense $ 3.6 trillion and set rules that can help or kill your idea , you want to suck up to them . \u201d ]\nBetter than tote bags and coffee mugs - Slate offers a cool map to show what President Obama \u2019 s top donors have given to be rewarded with diplomatic postings . It takes more than $ 1 million to get a prime spot like Britain or Thailand that brings the connections and prestige to get even richer , but you can slide into the sunny Dominican Republic for a cool half-million dollars .\n\u201c You talk about the bailout of insurers : There \u2019 s an overwhelming majority of Americans who will say \u2018 no \u2019 \u2026 and I would have liked to see the Democrats defend the bailout and risk the debt ceiling . But , there weren \u2019 t enough Republicans in the House who would do that , and thus , [ House Speaker John Boehner ] had no cards , and thus , he had to fold . It was the right thing to do , given his circumstances. \u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201c Special Report with Bret Baier . \u201d\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News .

Mark Warner\u2019s, D-Va., lead. According to the survey, Warner now leads the former Republican National Committee chairman 44 percent to 38 percent. Earlier polling showed Warner leading Gillespie by over 20 points. Politico reports.\n\nMOURNING THEIR HOUSE CHANCES\n\n\u201cPresident Barack Obama will host a fundraiser for House Democrats at the home of former NBA star Alonzo Mourning. That's according to an invitation to the event obtained by The Associated Press. The event in Miami on March 20 will benefit the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers will also attend.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHAT\u2019S NOR-WAY TO WIN CONFIRMATION\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to Norway, George Tsunis, is a big-time political patron of the president\u2019s but not much of an expert on the Scandinavian nation. T. Michael Davis of the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce is pleading for the Senate to reject Tsunis, who operates a 10-motel chain in the Northeastern U.S. On Davis\u2019 list of complaints: \u201cWell, he acknowledged he has never even been to Norway\u2026 He repeatedly referred to its prime minister as a \u2018president,\u2019 apparently unaware Norway is a parliamentary democracy. He attacked Norway\u2019s governing center-right coalition by disparaging the nation\u2019s third-largest political party \u2013 a key player that holds no less than seven minister posts \u2013 mistakenly characterizing it as a group of \u2018fringe elements\u2019 that \u2018spew their hatred.\u2019\u2026 Norwegians of all political stripes were deeply insulted, causing one member of Parliament to demand an apology from President Obama. \u2026The headline of a Norwegian daily smoldered: \u2018Future US envoy displays total ignorance of Norway,\u2019 characterizing Tsunis as \u2018faltering\u2019 and \u2018incoherent\u2019 and committing \u2018a jaw-dropping diplomatic blunder before he even begins.\u2019\u201d Of course, this shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise. Noah Bryson Mamet, also an Obama political contributor, admitted he\u2019d never been to Argentina, the country he\u2019s been nominated to serve as U.S. ambassador.\n\n\n\n[New at Fox News Opinion - John Stossel considers Privileged People: \u201cFor the first time in history, six of the richest counties in the U.S. surround D.C. When a small group of people gets to dispense $3.6 trillion and set rules that can help or kill your idea, you want to suck up to them.\u201d]\n\nBetter than tote bags and coffee mugs - Slate offers a cool map to show what President Obama\u2019s top donors have given to be rewarded with diplomatic postings. It takes more than $1 million to get a prime spot like Britain or Thailand that brings the connections and prestige to get even richer, but you can slide into the sunny Dominican Republic for a cool half-million dollars.\n\n\n\nRUN FOR IT!\n\nThis can\u2019t be good. Florida and Louisiana readers please take note: University of Tennessee Study Finds Crocodiles Climb Trees \u201c[Researchers] observed crocodile species on three continents \u2013 Australia, Africa and North America... Some species were observed climbing as far as [13 feet] high in a tree and [16 feet] down a branch.\u201d And they can trick us too! \u201cResearch\u2026 found another surprising crocodile characteristic \u2013 the use of lures such as sticks to hunt prey.\u201d What\u2019s next? Driving cars? Firearms?\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cYou talk about the bailout of insurers: There\u2019s an overwhelming majority of Americans who will say \u2018no\u2019 \u2026 and I would have liked to see the Democrats defend the bailout and risk the debt ceiling. But, there weren\u2019t enough Republicans in the House who would do that, and thus, [House Speaker John Boehner] had no cards, and thus, he had to fold. It was the right thing to do, given his circumstances.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
