    "content": "The anti-bullying campaign was supposed to be one of those causes that everyone , regardless of ideology or political party , was able to get behind . As Emily Bazelon discovered in her seminal book on bullying in schools , Sticks and Stones : Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy , even in schools where it seems fairly obvious that authorities were being negligent toward victims of bullying , the schools insisted that they were opposed to bullying . No one is for bullying , right ?\nWell , that \u2019 s what we \u2019 d like to believe . But it seems that , as with many things , bullying is becoming a partisan issue . Anti-bullying efforts seem liberal in tone and emphasis , which means that they will inevitably attract negative attention from the knee-jerk \u201c anything to piss off the liberals \u201d crowd . But let \u2019 s be honest : Part of the reason conservatives frequently support bullying\u2014or at least resist efforts to end it\u2014is because bullying works . Bullies are good at exerting exactly the kind of social control that the right , especially the Christian right , wants to exert . So here \u2019 s a list of incidences where conservatives just straight-up supported bullying in the face of efforts to curb it .\n1 ) Louisiana teacher encourages students to bully Buddhist student . The ACLU is suing the Sabine Parish School Board because of one teacher \u2019 s inexplicable alleged campaign to harass and abuse one of her students for his Buddhist beliefs . It isn \u2019 t just that the teacher thought a public school classroom was an ideal place to promote her interpretation of Christianity , though that would be reason enough to sue . The teacher reportedly agreed with a classmate who called the Buddhist student \u201c stupid \u201d for not believing in God and encouraged the students to laugh at him . She also reportedly called Buddhism stupid , and gave students tests where the \u201c right \u201d answer was to affirm Christian dogma .\nWhen Scott Lane , the student \u2019 s stepfather , went to the superintendent to complain , she defended the teacher by saying that this is the \u201c Bible Belt . '' Apparently , to the administration being in the Bible Belt means not only is the First Amendment suspended , but singling kids out and taunting them because they \u2019 re different is acceptable behavior .\n2 ) Routinely denouncing attempts to prevent anti-gay bullying in schools . If anyone hoped that Christian conservatives who disapprove of gay rights could find it in their hearts to , at bare minimum , allow LGBT-identified kids to get an education without being harangued under the guise of religion , sorry to dash your hopes . Christian right organization Focus on the Family is happy to help fight back against bullies , unless , of course , the target is gay . Then all of a sudden , Focus on the Family sees the bully as the victim , and attempts to stop him from gay-bashing are nothing but an attempt to \u201c censor or marginalize students and parents with differing viewpoints . \u201d\nWhile it would be nice if blatant bigotry was marginalized more in this way , that \u2019 s not at all what \u2019 s going on . Kids are still allowed to believe all sorts of vile stuff about their classmates . What anti-bullying measures do is offer LGBT kids some protection from having homophobes harass them . Despite this , conservative media routinely denies that there \u2019 s any difference between a student expressing a general opinion and specifically targeting individual students for abuse .\n3 ) Demanding that schools make a humiliating spectacle out of transgender kids . One simple way to reduce bullying of transgender kids in school is to let them live as the gender they identify with and not make a big fuss out of it that draws the attention of bullies . When California passed a law giving transgender students exactly this right , Christian conservatives went nuts .\nFamily Research Council spokesman Peter Sprigg and Fox News host Martha MacCallum were so opposed to this basic bit of anti-bullying legislation that they ended up spewing a shocking number of lies about being transgender , including falsely claiming that kids switch their genders willy-nilly and that transgender students are not targeted for bullying . In the real world , bullying of transgender students is a serious problem , and giving them the privacy and dignity that cisgender students get can go a long way toward preventing bullying from getting out of hand .\n4 ) Fighting so that women can \u2019 t even go into abortion clinics without being bullied all the way into the door . The abortion buffer zone dispute that went in front of the Supreme Court is not , as proponents say , about free speech . No one is denying the right of anti-choicers to protest clinics or make themselves available to patients who want to speak to them . In fact , no one is saying they can \u2019 t inflict themselves on patients by yelling at them or waving signs at them . The only question is whether or not patients are entitled to 7 whole seconds of walking where they are free of being directly bullied by anti-choicers who want to get in their face to yell invective .\nRight now , giving clinics a 35-foot buffer zone allows anti-choice protesters to speak freely while also giving patients a right to ignore them if they want , at least for 7 seconds . But for Christian conservatives , the right to free speech is not enough . They want the right to bully and shame women , and they don \u2019 t think women should be able to decline to be targets of their abuse .\n5 ) Denying the link between bullying and suicide . Most victims of bullying don \u2019 t suffer severe mental health effects from it , but being bullied does correlate with a higher risk of suicide . Nonetheless , Kelly McBride of the Poynter Institute wrote a piece broadly denying the link between suicide and bullying and pretending that anti-bullying advocates were trumping up the claim in order to terrorize innocent kids accused of bullying . She wasn \u2019 t wrong to say some journalists and prosecutors get overzealous in their attacks on perceived bullies , but her attempts to minimize the problem went way too far in the other direction . Unsurprisingly , right-wing media went nuts , with Rush Limbaugh using McBride \u2019 s piece to insinuate that anti-bullying campaigns are full of crap .\n6 ) Arguing that bullying can \u2019 t be considered a real problem unless it \u2019 s on the rise . Anti-bullying activism did not arise because of a perception that bullying was on the rise . It was a combination of heightened attention to the struggles of LGBT youth and the fact that cyberbullying was leaving a trail of evidence that made the problem harder to ignore than in the past . Despite this , a common swipe conservatives take to discredit anti-bullying campaigns is to say that since bullying isn \u2019 t on the rise , it shouldn \u2019 t be considered a real problem .\nFrom the Daily Caller to McBride \u2019 s piece to pundits on Fox News , conservatives dismiss anti-bullying efforts by saying bullying is not on the rise . But problems don \u2019 t need to be on the rise in order to count as problems . For instance , smoking rates were already declining when the anti-smoking campaigns went into high gear , but no one thought that meant smoking wasn \u2019 t a real problem .\n7 ) Plain , unvarnished praise of bullying as a rite of passage . The escalating hostility toward anti-bullying campaigns reached a new peak when Fox News host Anna Kooiman sneered at anti-bullying campaigns generally . \u201c But people are asking , is this going too far because it includes teasing , social exclusion , intimidation , and those are things that are almost a rite of passage sometimes for kids . \u201d\nNeedless to say , there is zero evidence that being excluded and intimidated has positive psychological effects for kids . Bullied children suffer many possible negative effects , including higher rates of depression , declining grades in school and even health problems . ( You \u2019 ll be hard-pressed to find that a bullied child grows into an adult who was grateful for the experience . ) Even being a bully is correlated with long-term negative effects , such as alcohol abuse , fighting and other high-risk behavior .\nIt was inevitable that , as anti-bullying efforts rose , conservatives would start finding angles to complain and criticize and demagogue . After all , the automatic hostility to anything perceived as \u201c liberal \u201d has grown so out of control that even Michelle Obama \u2019 s non-offensive campaign to improve people \u2019 s eating habits has become a sore spot for conservatives . But this tendency to side with the bullies and against their victims may speak to something deeper in right-wing ideology , such as a desire for conformity and a willingness to use force and shame to impose it . Because of this , it \u2019 s likely that anti-anti-bullying messages will probably rise and continue to shade into outright support for bullies .",
