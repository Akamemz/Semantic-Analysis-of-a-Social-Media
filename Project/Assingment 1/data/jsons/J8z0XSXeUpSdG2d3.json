The law allows a long list of people , including law enforcement officers , current or former household members , and people related by blood , marriage , or adoption , to seek a temporary `` extreme risk protection order '' ( ERPO ) against someone they believe `` poses a significant risk of causing personal risk to self or others in the near future .
