Well it may not have been that hard-hitting , but Susan Rice certainly did make a serious effort to dig a deep grave for herself .\nIn the interview , Lesley Stahl made an effort to press U.S . Ambassador to the UN , Susan Rice , on NSA tactics . After many have been wondering about Edward Snowden \u2019 s future , Lesley asked Rice about how affective the NSA is and what their plans are for the future .\n\u201c But when you have so many phone records being held , emails , heads of state \u2019 s phone conversations being listened in to , has it been worth our allies being upset ? Has it been worth all the tech companies being upset ? Has it been worth Americans feeling that their privacy has been invaded \u201d ?\nAnd the only thing that Susan Rice could say in response was that ,\n\u201c \u2026it 's been worth what we 've done to protect the United States . And the fact that we have not had a successful attack on our homeland since 9/11 should not be diminished . But that does not mean that everything we 're doing as of the present ought to be done the same way in the future . \u201d\nPrivacy issues were not addressed properly ! But Ms. Rice did have a chance to address issues within the NSA . Rice stated , \u201c There have been cases where they have inadvertently made false representations . \u201d\nSusan was also asked about whether or not she has regrets about interviews following the Benghazi attacks . To that she said ,\n\u201c I don \u2019 t have time to think about the false controversy , \u201d Rice said . \u201c In the midst of all of swirl about things like talking points , the administration has been working very , very hard across the globe to review our security of our embassies and our facilities . That \u2019 s what we ought to be focused on . \u201d\nWell it \u2019 s about time ! But yet , we still don \u2019 t have any answers about what we can expect in the future and how our privacy will continue to be invaded by the government .",
