Or has this become an overblown saga?\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nDid Clinton break any State Department rules?\n\nAs of now, there's no evidence that Clinton violated any State Department rules. But there's a chance she did.\n\nThere's no outright ban at the State Department on using a personal email address to conduct official government business.\n\nBut a 2005 State Department policy on \"sensitive but unclassified information\" explains that employees should conduct \"normal day-to-day operations\" through the State Department's official email system to protect the security of the emails' contents.\n\nClinton has now handed over 55,000 emails stemming from her duties as the U.S.'s chief diplomat, but there is no evidence yet that Clinton disclosed that type of sensitive information in those emails.

Email is much more widely used today, especially by high-ranking officials, than it was when Rice became secretary of state ten years ago.\n\nIs there a double standard here?\n\nThat's definitely the point Democrats are trying to make.\n\nBut while Powell may have used his personal email address to conduct State Department business, he also used a State Department account, which Clinton did not.\n\nBeyond that, though, Clinton also used an email account that fed through its own server -- unlike a personal email account that goes through a service like Gmail or Yahoo, for example -- according to an Associated Press report.\n\nAnd that's what's most eyebrow-raising.\n\nHousing her email exchanges on her own server gave Clinton a lot more control over the fate of that correspondence. Clinton could have permanently deleted emails, for example.\n\nThere's no evidence that she did, but Republicans are up in arms over the revelations as they continue their investigation into the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi -- which happened under Clinton's watch. The House select committee leading that investigation on Wednesday subpoenaed Clinton's emails related to the attack.\n\nSo with her own server, did she also got to handpick which emails went to the State Department for public release, right?\n\nThat's right, she and her aides made those calls.\n\nBut when Clinton was in office, emails on federal accounts weren't automatically archived either and Clinton and her aides would have done some handpicking as well.\n\nShe just submitted those emails? She didn't have to do that immediately?\n\nNope.

But her decision to use a personal email account stored on her own private server raises questions, at best, especially when you're (likely) running for president. Anything else?\n\nThere's also a tinge of hypocrisy in the air.\n\nDuring Clinton's personal-email-using, private-server-having tenure, U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration was criticized and ultimately pushed out of his post in part for using a personal email address \"for official government business, including Sensitive But Unclassified information .\"\n\nAgain, there's no evidence Clinton included \"sensitive but unclassified information\" in her emails, but a State Department investigation skewed the ambassador in question for using his personal email at all in his official capacity.
