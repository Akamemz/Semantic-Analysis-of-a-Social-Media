Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was removed from his post at the National Security Council , along with his twin brother , also an Army officer who worked at the NSC .

The dismissals were entirely within his power , they pointed out . White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Thursday that Mr. Trump was glad impeachment was now over and \u201c maybe people should pay for that. \u201d The president himself claimed that Colonel Vindman was \u201c insubordinate \u201d and had received a poor report from his superior at the NSC .\nColonel Vindman \u2019 s lawyers disputed those allegations .

Col. \u2019 Vindman , \u201d as if the Purple Heart recipient \u2019 s rank were arbitrary or he were an imposter .\nFor instance , the public manner in which Colonel Vindman lost his post bothers Joe Baringer , a former Army staff sergeant who deployed early in the Afghanistan War that began in 2001 and took part in the U.S. invasion of Iraq two years later .\n\u201c You can understand the need to reassign someone if you \u2019 re claiming you \u2019 ve lost confidence in their ability to fully support the mission .
