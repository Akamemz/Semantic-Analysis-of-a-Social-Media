The food stamp program was cut about 1 percent ; the House had pushed for five times that much .\nThose incentives scattered throughout the bill -- a boost for crop insurance popular in the Midwest and higher subsidies for Southern rice and peanut farmers , for example -- helped the bill pass easily in the House last week , 251-166 .

Leaders in both parties also have hoped to bolster rural candidates in this year 's midterm elections .\nThe final savings in the food stamp program , $ 800 million a year , would come from cracking down on some states that seek to boost individual food stamp benefits by giving people small amounts of federal heating assistance that they do n't need . That heating assistance , which is sometimes as low as $ 1 per person , triggers higher benefits and some critics see it as circumventing the law . The compromise bill would require states to give individual recipients at least $ 20 in heating assistance before a higher food stamp benefit could kick in .\nSome Democrats still objected to the cuts , even though those cuts are much lower than what the House had sought .
