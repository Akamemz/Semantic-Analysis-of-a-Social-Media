Ever since Meghan Markle , Duchess of Sussex , and Prince Harry announced they were stepping back from their \u201c roles \u201d as senior royals , there \u2019 s been a debate in British media about whether the coverage of Markle has been racist .

That included \u201c the racial undertones of comment pieces \u201d and \u201c the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. \u201d Three years later , Markle talked about the difficulty of dealing with tabloid coverage more broadly , saying it had been \u201c hard , \u201d and that adopting \u201c this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip \u201d was difficult .\nFor example , the press has talked about her \u201c exotic DNA \u201d ; described her as \u201c ( almost ) straight outta Compton \u201d ; attacked her for the very things that Kate Middleton , Prince William \u2019 s white wife , has been praised for ; and compared the couple \u2019 s son to a chimpanzee . But in TV studios around the country , commentators seem to have peculiarly missed all of this . The coverage of Markle has been welcoming and warm , they say .
