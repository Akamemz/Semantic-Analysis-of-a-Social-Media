    "content": "It \u2019 s become oddly fashionable to bash the White House Correspondents \u2019 Association dinner , the giddy juxtaposition of journalists , Hollywood celebrities and strategically-minded operatives that arrives in the nation \u2019 s capital each spring , just like the circus . Critics claim the annual event has become commercialized , off-message and unbecoming . Indeed , 3,000 \u201c correspondents \u201d vie for attention on Saturday as the network cameras roll for hours on end ; C-SPAN , in fact , starts its august coverage in mid-afternoon .\nWhy should Barbra Streisand , Steven Spielberg and Jon Bon Jovi attend the big event ? Well , why shouldn \u2019 t they ? It is humbling . They too will drift along the jammed , glittering hallways of the host hotel this year just like everyone else , negotiating security checkpoints , lofty escalators and the gawk-alistas .\nBut then , behold the frisson of power . National Rifle Association president David Keene and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus will also be there ; both are guests of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , along with National Security Agency deputy director Chris Inglis and National pitcher Gio Gonzalez .\nImagine . Miss Streisand and Mr. Keane at the very same party .\nIt is a cultural moment of considerable magnitude , and one that is unique to this event , which is no mere gaudy exercise . Since its small beginning in 1920 , the Correspondents Dinner has been a showcase for luminaries from all sectors of the political spectrum . And for a few hours , anyway , they put aside their squabbles , dine on savory fare and toast the glories of bipartisanship . Every president who has ever addressed the crowded ballroom acknowledges that just for the night , ferocious differences are forgotten , and all \u2019 s well .\nThe event still has a good-humored dynamic going for it .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to stand up here and deliver one of those worn-out , sentimental homilies about the press and the presidency . Neither of us would believe it , \u201d Ronald Reagan told the crowd during his last appearance at the dinner in 1986 . \u201c What I hope my epitaph will be with the White House correspondents , what every president \u2019 s epitaph should be with the press is this : He gave as good as he got . And that I think will make for a healthy press and a healthy presidency . \u201d\nBut wait , there \u2019 s more . The dinner is also a viable fundraiser for journalism scholarships , it \u2019 s good for the local economy and for the most part , it does not inspire , say , catfights in the ladies room , stage diving or food throwing .\nAnd about that C-SPAN coverage . It starts at 3 p.m. , just when thousands of guests are eyeing their formal wear and making ready to head downtown to make a 6 p.m. cocktail hour . It is no easy task . The crush of limousines , TV trucks and law enforcement vehicles that surround the hotel is a veritable obstacle course , particularly for women teetering along Connecticut Avenue in heels fit for the boudoir .\nThe public affairs network , meanwhile , will be airing historical footage of previous dinners in their lead-up to the main events , which include a much ballyhooed red carpet walk , which fires up around 6 p.m. , and the actual dinner , which begins at 7:30 . Fox News , CNN and MSNBC will also offer red carpet-y coverage , plus the evening \u2019 s speeches , beginning around 9 p.m .\nThe E ! Network \u2014 attuned to red carpets and fashion police of every persuasion \u2014 will cover celebrity arrivals for the first time this year .\n\u201c Hollywood is taking on D.C. , \u201d notes Mariah Haas , an online correspondent for the network . \u201c Marc Malkin and Alicia Quarles will be manning the carpet and interviewing some of the biggest stars attending , next to President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama , of course . \u201d\nMs. Haas notes that \u201c celebs expected \u201d include Kevin Spacey , Nicole Kidman , Scarlett Johansson , Kerry Washington , Sofia Vergara and the evening \u2019 s comedic entertainer Conan O \u2019 Brien .\nOf small historic significance : Mr. O \u2019 Brien hosted the event in another century , appearing as a 30-something upstart at the 1995 dinner during the Clinton administration .\n\u201c Congressmen , please refrain from switching parties during dinner , \u201d he told the crowd .\nMr. Spacey has reason to be among the polticos .
