    "content": "Earlier today , the Atlantic \u2019 s McKay Coppins published a lengthy profile on Mitt Romney , apparently part of Romney \u2019 s effort to set himself up as the noble Republican foil to an out-of-control president . These sorts of pieces , which are more about narrative setting than anything else , typically don \u2019 t contain a lot of new information , but this had one notable exception . About midway through , the usually guarded senator revealed that , just like fellow lone-voice-of reason-haver James Comey , he was the owner of a secret Twitter account .\nAt one point , as Coppins asked him about the # IMPEACHMITTROMNEY hashtag Trump tweeted into being earlier this month , Romney said this :\n\u201c That \u2019 s kind of what he does , \u201d Romney said with a shrug , and then got up to retrieve an iPad from his desk . He explained that he uses a secret Twitter account\u2014 \u201c What do they call me , a lurker ? \u201d \u2014to keep tabs on the political conversation . \u201c I won \u2019 t give you the name of it , \u201d he said , but \u201c I \u2019 m following 668 people. \u201d Swiping at his tablet , he recited some of the accounts he follows , including journalists , late-night comedians ( \u201c What \u2019 s his name , the big redhead from Boston ? \u201d ) , and athletes . Trump was not among them . \u201c He tweets so much , \u201d Romney said , comparing the president to one of his nieces who overshares on Instagram . \u201c I love her , but it \u2019 s like , Ah , it \u2019 s too much . \u201d\nIn other words , a wealth of information that would be highly useful to anyone hoping to track down the senator \u2019 s supposedly secret Twitter hideout\u2014 or more specifically , to me . The chances seemed high that Romney , a known family man , would want to keep close tabs on his offspring . And as luck would have it , Romney has plenty of offspring .\nNot all of his five sons have public Twitter accounts , and some of them , like the dreaded Tagg , have too many followers to possibly dig through . Romney \u2019 s oldest grandchild , Allie Romney Critchlow , however , has just 481 followers , making digging through them an annoying-but-not-impossible feat . As I scrolled , while focusing on the ones that appeared to make an effort to conceal their real identities , one in particular caught my eye .\nReader , meet Twitter user @ qaws9876 , otherwise known as Pierre Delecto .\nThis account joined the site in July of 2011 , just one month after Romney announced his run for president . The majority of people it follows are either political reporters , politicians , political operatives , or pundits . Though it also follows noted big redhead from Boston Conan O \u2019 Brien . Pierre Delecto appears to be a fan of the late-night hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon , too , as well as current and former NFL players Tom Brady and Brett Favre , respectively .\nPierre Delecto currently follows 702 accounts , which is a few more than the 668 Romney admitted to Coppins , but it \u2019 s certainly possible to follow 30 additional accounts over the course of a few weeks , especially for a user that appears to have recently upped its Twitter activity .\nThe Pierre Delecto account \u2019 s very first follow was eldest Romney scion Tagg , joined shortly thereafter by Glen Johnson , a former politics editor for Boston.com who was firmly on the Romney beat around the time the account was originally created . Next was Mark DeMoss , who the Salt Lake Tribune described in 2012 as \u201c an unpaid adviser to Mitt Romney \u2019 s presidential campaign for the past five years , \u201d and Eric Fehrnstrom , who still has \u201c Former @ MittRomney adviser \u201d in his Twitter bio .\nIn general , the account follows everyone you might expect someone like Mitt Romney to follow . There \u2019 s the late Charles Krauthammer , the late John McCain , Larry Kudlow , Rupert Murdoch , Bill Kristol , Matt Schapp , and\u2014who else but\u2014Peggy Noonan . It also follows all the people you would expect someone who is exactly Mitt Romney to follow . There are all of the available Romney children , a number of former Romney advisers and aides ( like , a lot ) , and quite a few reporters who \u2019 ve directly covered Romney or his various campaigns ( like Ashley Parker , Matt Viser , Phillip Rucker , Steven Peoples , and Coppins himself , all of whom were on the Romney beat in 2012 , among others ) .\nGet the Slatest in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up .

You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time .\nThen , there are the accounts it \u2019 s hard to imagine anyone but Mitt Romney following . There \u2019 s this seemingly random person who managed to snag the @ SenRomney Twitter handle , the pro-Romney parody account @ AltPresRomney , and various fan-run accounts like @ NY4Mitt and @ MittRomney_2016 . There \u2019 s also the apparently official ( based on the fact that the first person to follow it was Romney \u2019 s former digital director ) though never-utilized ( it only ever sent one tweet ) account @ Mitt_NH . Our Pierre Delecto was the 23rd person to follow this account , almost directly after it was followed by the official @ TeamRomney account and right before a number of reporters jumped on board , which would seem to indicate at least some sort of heads-up . There \u2019 s also Jon Moe , a photographer from Utah who \u2019 s taken family photographs of the extended Romney clan . He \u2019 s also tweeted this :\nSurfers for the romster pic.twitter.com/VcOhDcRi \u2014 jon ( @ jonmoephoto ) April 21 , 2012\nPierre Delecto \u2019 s eight followers mostly seem to be of the sort any random account on Twitter might accumulate if it festers around the site long enough . The one notable exception here is its most recent follower , @ Darlin1Patience . Because @ Darlin1Patience \u2019 s account is private , there \u2019 s no easy way to see everyone it currently follows . A little digging into some Mitt-adjacent accounts , however , reveals that @ Darlin1Patience does follow a few lesser-known members of the Romney family , like Craig Romney , who only has a little over 3,300 followers , and eldest Romney grandchild Allie Romney , with her just under 500 followers . It \u2019 s certainly notable then , that @ Darlin1Patience , who only follows 194 people at the time of publication , also follows Pierre Delecto .\nThen we have the tweets . Pierre has only ever tweeted 10 times total , and all of them have been replies to other tweets\u2014certainly the sort of behavior one might expect to see from a self-described \u201c lurker. \u201d The account \u2019 s first tweet , coming a whole four years after its initial registration , was a show of frustration at Fox News for not yet having a New Hampshire presidential poll up .\nThe next tweet didn \u2019 t come until May of this year , when Pierre was moved to point out to a Bloomberg reporter that he had forgotten to include Romney in a list of senators sticking up for Richard Burr .\nNext was a tweet to Romney Senate colleague Dick Durbin , whom Pierre casually addressed as \u201c Dick , \u201d followed by a series of tweets defending Mitt Romney \u2019 s honor .\nMore recently , there was a tweet expressing unhappiness at Trump \u2019 s decision to withdraw troops from Syria ( which Romney has publicly condemned ) while also insisting on the Senate \u2019 s powerlessness ( as Romney a move as there ever was ) .\nAnd on Saturday , Pierre Delecto offered a bashful joke in response to an Erick Erickson tweet full of Romney praise .\nOf the 257 tweets the account has liked over the last eight years , 30 of them came from the official @ SenatorRomney account , 28 came from the official @ MittRomney account , seven were tweets quoting either the @ SenatoryRomney or @ MittRomney accounts , and three included a direct mention of one or the other . Even more were about Romney generally without mentioning an official Twitter handle .\nHere are just a few of those Romney-centric tweets beloved by Pierre :\nAs Republicans turn on people like Mitt Romney & US intelligence agents , I 'd like to remind everyone that the crook they 're stupidly protecting is banned from operating a charity in all of NY because he and his swindling kids stole from a children 's cancer charity . \u2014 Josh Moon ( @ Josh_Moon ) October 6 , 2019\nThe people of Utah were so disgusted by Romney 's criticisms of Trump they elected him to the Senate in 2018 by a 62 % -30 % margin https : //t.co/I1GsdqYv8D \u2014 Christian Schneider ( @ Schneider_CM ) October 5 , 2019\nWho is having the better Saturday ? pic.twitter.com/qFZ4svo6Bt \u2014 Matt Viser ( @ mviser ) October 5 , 2019\nTurns out Romney was always opposed to Confederate flag in SC .

'' was a misguided , futile notion but after this Tweet from the President , I 'm reassessing ... https : //t.co/MFs3MpT6kj \u2014 Jeff Greenfield ( @ greenfield64 ) October 7 , 2019\nPerhaps more revealing among the account \u2019 s liked tweets , though , is this :\nYou were cheating on your second wife with the woman who is now your third wife even while impeaching Clinton for cheating on his wife .

The handle @ qaws9876 doesn \u2019 t hold any obvious significance to Romney , although considering the four letters are all directly adjacent to one another on a standard keyboard , and the numbers are simply run backward , it seems entirely possible that it was an attempt at random placeholder text . The name Pierre Delecto , however , is harder to explain . \u201c Pierre \u201d certainly does seem like a name a Mitt Romney-type looking for an alias might choose , though the \u201c Delecto \u201d is less clear .\nWe \u2019 ve reached out to Romney for comment , and will update if and when we hear back . In the meantime , if you know anything about our new friend Pierre Delecto\u2014or any other secret social media accounts members of congress might be holding onto\u2014please do let us know .\nUpdate , 7:24 p.m. : Shortly after this post went up , Pierre Delecto made the account private , then public for a few minutes , then private once more . We \u2019 ve replaced the the embedded tweets with screenshots accordingly .",
