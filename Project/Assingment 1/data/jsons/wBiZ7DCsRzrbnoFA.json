Kirsten Gillibrand ( D\u2013NY ) \u2014a long shot candidate for the Democratic nomination\u2014is suggesting that every voter be given $ 600 to donate to federal election campaigns . Affectionately named `` Democracy Dollars , '' she says the taxpayer-funded venture will clean up elections and `` attack the corrupting influence of money at its core . ''\nAll eligible voters would qualify for the lump sum , which would then be doled out in $ 200 payments for each individual 's House , Senate , and presidential candidate of choice .\n`` If you want to accomplish anything that the American people want us to accomplish \u2014 whether it 's healthcare as a right , better public schools , better economy \u2014 you have to take on the greed and corruption that determine everything in Washington , '' she told NBC News .\nGillibrand says she 'll finance her plan by eliminating a tax loophole for CEOs\u2014which , between the various nominees , is starting to sound like a cure-all for society 's ills . Those making more than $ 1 million or 25 times the median salary of their employees\u2014whichever is less\u2014would finance Democracy Dollars with $ 60 billion in additional taxes over 10 years , according to Gillibrand 's plan .\nThe Democratic senator references Seattle as her inspiration , whose Democracy Voucher program allots $ 100 to every eligible voter to donate in each municipal election . Yet the results of the program 's pilot attempt in 2017 were that everything stayed pretty much the same : Only 3.3 percent of recipients participated , and the winning slate was dominated by incumbents and those backed by the establishment .\n`` When you say that we are going to allow public funds to go to candidates , voters are going to give the vouchers to people they are familiar with , they know , that they are comfortable with , and those are going to tend to be incumbents , '' Ethan Blevins , an attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 following the election . That 's a far cry from Seattle 's mission statement to elevate `` more candidates , including women , young people and people of color , to run viable campaigns against big money candidates . ''\n`` By leveling the playing field of who 's powering federal campaigns , my plan amplifies the voices of Americans who have n't been heard for too long \u2014 young people , women , and people of color , '' Gillibrand 's plan reads .\nOnly candidates who refuse to accept individual contributions over $ 200 would be allowed to cash in on Democracy Dollars . The current limit is $ 2,800 , which candidates could still opt to accept if they forego the publicly funded vouchers . While it seems unlikely that most candidates would relinquish that opportunity , Gillibrand tells NBC that she expects they 'll do that , `` because the potential of how much you could raise in this system is exponentially higher . ''\nThat would n't stop those same candidates from seeking big money support , though : Adherents to Democracy Dollars could still solicit help from super PACs , which Gillibrand 's plan does not address . Although super PACs are barred from donating directly to a particular individual or party , they often spend enormous wads of cash to indirectly fund a candidate , often via advertising blitzes . They are under no spending limit when doing so .\nBut perhaps the more pressing issue here is a First Amendment one , as a small group of taxpayers would be forced to fund candidates , some of whom they would inevitably object to .
