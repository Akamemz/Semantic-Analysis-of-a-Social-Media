    "content": "In a stunning turn , Senate Republicans \u2014 in the dead of night , on their last hope of passing any kind of Obamacare repeal bill \u2014 came up short .\nThe result is , for now , a crushing blow to seven years of promises to uproot the health care law .\nThree Republican senators \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine , John McCain of Arizona , and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 voted to block the Senate \u2019 s so-called \u201c skinny \u201d repeal bill . It was the bare minimum : The bill failed on a procedural vote , 49 to 51 .\nAll three senators had their reasons , and they had each hinted for weeks that they would be reluctant to back the Senate \u2019 s various Obamacare repeal proposals . By the wee hours of Friday morning , three different Senate plans \u2014 a robust repeal-and-replace bill , a cleaner repeal bill , and finally so-called skinny repeal \u2014 had failed over three days of debate .\nCollins and Murkowski voted down all three . They had said for two months that they wouldn \u2019 t support a plan that resulted in millions fewer Americans having health coverage . The three health care bills that Republicans tried to pass would have led to between 16 million and 32 million fewer Americans having health insurance , when compared to Obamacare .\nMcCain , though , was the surprise . Diagnosed with brain cancer and the subject of much speculation after a rousing Senate speech calling for a return to an open and bipartisan process in the Senate , the Arizona Republican joined the other Republican dissenters at the climax of the Senate health care fight \u2014 and helped kill the bill .\nThe stunning defeat in the Senate leaves the GOP \u2019 s hopes for Obamacare repeal hanging by a thread . Republicans have been here before in the past seven months , and their attempts have always come back from the dead . But in the course of a week , Senate leadership came up with three different plans to try to achieve the goal of repealing Obamacare , and they fell short every time .\nIn the past three days , enough Republicans refused to vote to roll back Obamacare \u2019 s expanded health insurance coverage . Then , at the last moment , one more senator decided that the rushed and secretive process \u2014 a process decried even by Republicans who still voted to support it \u2014 was unacceptable .\nRepublicans refused to vote to roll back Obamacare \u2019 s coverage gains\nCollins and Murkowski have made clear for weeks that simply undoing what Obamacare had accomplished \u2014 coverage gains , expanded Medicaid , protections for people with preexisting conditions \u2014 was unacceptable .\n\u201c I want greater access and lower costs . So far , I 'm not seeing that happen , \u201d Murkowski told me in mid-June .\nHer state , though it struggles with the highest health care costs in the country , has expanded Medicaid to cover its poorest residents and has seen tens of thousands of people sign up for private coverage . Every plan Republicans put forward was projected to result in millions fewer people having insurance and out-of-pocket costs rising .\n`` I can not support a bill that is going to result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance , \u201d she said last month .\nThe math on each of the Senate GOP plans was clear . Repeal and replace : 22 million more uninsured . Repeal only : 32 million . \u201c Skinny \u201d repeal : 16 million .\nThe striking coverage losses led other Republican senators to oppose every plan but skinny repeal . Sen. Dean Heller ( R-NV ) also voted against repeal and replace and clean repeal after holding a press conference last month with his state \u2019 s Republican governor , saying that the gains made after Nevada expanded Medicaid shouldn \u2019 t be reversed .\n\u201c We can \u2019 t let fall behind the progress we \u2019 ve made in Nevada , \u201d Heller said .\nLikewise , on the repeal-only legislation , Sen. Shelley Moore Capito ( R-WV ) said she couldn \u2019 t support it .\n\u201c I did not come to Washington to hurt people , \u201d she said .\nSenate leaders had also set their sights even bigger than Obamacare : Their most ambitious proposal would have not only repealed and replaced much of the health care law but also fundamentally overhauled Medicaid .\nThe spending cuts \u2014 $ 772 billion over 10 years , versus current law \u2014 and a projected 15 million fewer enrollees also gave a critical mass of senators pause . On top of the raw numbers , Senate leaders were pushing to overhaul a 50-year-old program that covers more than 70 million Americans without holding a single hearing .\n\u201c To do that without holding a single hearing on what the implications would be for some of our most vulnerable citizens , for our rural hospitals , and our nursing homes , is not an approach that I can endorse , \u201d she said in recent days .\nMcCain decried the absurd Senate process , and then he ended it\nHe wasn \u2019 t even supposed to be here . This month , he had emergency surgery for a blood clot and then discovered he had brain cancer . He was thought to be out for weeks .\nHis unexpectedly swift return to the Senate was supposed to be a boon for Senate Republican leaders , and it was \u2014 until early Friday morning .\nA few signs had suggested this possibility . On Tuesday , even as he voted to open the health care debate on the Senate floor , McCain hinted at what was to come . He gave a floor speech after that vote to open debate , calling for a return to regular order and a spirit of bipartisanship .\n\u201c We try to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration , then springing it on skeptical members , trying to convince them that it 's better than nothing , \u201d he said in that floor speech . \u201c That it 's better than nothing ? Asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition . \u201d\n\u201c I do n't think that 's going to work in the end , \u201d he continued , \u201c and it probably should n't . \u201d\nThe speech , at the time , was widely condemned \u2014 McCain had just voted to advance a bill whose process he decried . The original Senate repeal-and-replace bill had been negotiated and drafted entirely in secret for the previous two months . No public hearings , no expert testimony . Even as a number of Republican senators expressed discomfort , none of them stopped it .\nThat included McCain \u2014 until Thursday night , after the most audacious ploy yet from Senate leadership .\nRepublican leaders , realizing that they didn \u2019 t have the votes for repeal and replace or repeal only , cooked up so-called \u201c skinny \u201d repeal \u2014 eliminating just Obamacare \u2019 s individual mandate and a few other provisions . The bill was unveiled to the public late Thursday night , just hours before the first vote on it .\nSenate leaders , meanwhile , were making a puzzling promise : This bill wasn \u2019 t actually intended to become law .
