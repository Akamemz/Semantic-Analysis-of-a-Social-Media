    "content": "Since his presidential campaign announcement Monday , the White House press corps has been fascinated with Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) .\nOn Wednesday , that Cruz attention turned to the senator 's position on Common Core education standards . A reporter asked White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest , `` Senator Ted Cruz -- I know you \u2019 ve been fielding a lot of questions about him . He recently said that he wants to repeal Common Core , every word of Common Core . Am I mistaken ? I didn \u2019 t think Common Core was a federal law ? ... I mean , Common Core -- is that correct , Common Core is not something that can be repealed ? ''\nEarnest declined to address the substance of the reporters question , instead promising , `` We can look into that for you . ''\nSo is Common Core a federal law that can be repealed ? The answer is yes .\nWhile it is true that Congress never passed any law that made Common Core the official national education standards for all 50 states , President Obama has been creating brand new federal laws without Congress long before his 2014 executive amnesty program .\nSpecifically , in August of 2011 , Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced that he was going to use President Bush 's 2001 No Child Left Behind waiver process to make states an offer they could n't refuse : Either they must all adopt Obama 's Common Core education standards , or many of their schools would be deemed as `` failing '' under the NCLB law and would be subject to an avalanche of federal regulation and paperwork .\n`` It is one thing for an administration to grant waivers to states to respond to unrealistic conditions on the ground or to allow experimentation and innovation , '' Brookings Institution Director for Education Policy Russ Whitehurst wrote at the time , `` It is quite another thing to grant state waivers conditional on compliance with a particular reform agenda that is dramatically different from existing law . ''\nThat `` particular reform agenda '' was Common Core and many states adopted the Common Core standards in large part because of the pressure Obama applied through NCLB .\nSo , if a President Cruz were to repeal `` every word '' of the NCLB law , he would functionally be repealing the existing federal Common Core regime by giving states back the freedom to choose their own education standards .",
