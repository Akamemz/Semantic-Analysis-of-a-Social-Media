    "content": "Why Paid Family Leave Has Become A Major Campaign Issue\nLance Mercier knows his job gets harder when a co-worker goes out on leave . But he recently also learned that raising a newborn involves , as he puts it , an `` insurmountable '' amount of work .\nThe 39-year-old bank manager from Silver Spring , Md. , is currently on leave from work taking care of his newborn son with his wife , Luz .\n`` As a manager who has had a lot of people go out on leave of absence , it absolutely sucks when they go out on leave , '' he said . `` This puts everything back into perspective for me . ''\nIn fact , he will likely end up taking more time off from work than his wife will . Lance 's job provides full pay for three months . Luz , meanwhile , gets eight weeks off at 60 percent pay . She can take extra eight weeks of unpaid leave if she wants .\nLance has a new appreciation for family leave , and he 's not the only one . For the first time , paid leave has a prominent place in a presidential election . In this week 's Democratic presidential debate , for example , Hillary Clinton took a swipe at California Republican Carly Fiorina 's opposition to paid family leave .\n`` California has had a paid-leave program for a number of years , '' Clinton said , adding , `` and it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have . We can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small business . ''\nNPR has tackled the question of why the U.S. stands virtually alone in not mandating paid family leave , but here 's another perplexing one \u2014 why now ? New parents have needed leave for , well , for as long as there have been working parents . And it 's true that workers did get unpaid leave in the 1990s . But what happened in the last few years to nudge paid family leave onto the national political stage ?\nHere is a list of factors that brought the policy into the spotlight :\nNo , paid leave is n't purely a women 's issue , but it is true that with more moms working ( not to mention the rise of single parenting , usually by moms ) , families need someone to mind the kids . Two-thirds of children live in homes where all parents work , as the White House reported last year , up from 40 percent in 1970 .\nWomen are also one-third more likely to take leave from work than men are , according to the Labor Department , and the gap is greater for women taking time off to care for family members . Indeed , moms are far more often the caregivers to sick children than dads are .\nMoreover , it 's an issue that spans all sorts of divides \u2014 race , education and class , for example . The conversation surrounding women and work may have been loud among the white-collar set ( think Sheryl Sandberg and Anne-Marie Slaughter ) , but the women with the least access to paid leave of any kind are , in fact , the least-educated and lowest-paid women .\nFinally , women are increasingly better-educated than men \u2014 we just learned recently that for the first time , more American women have bachelor 's degrees than men .

Moms are working (and earning) more\n\nNo, paid leave isn't purely a women's issue, but it is true that with more moms working (not to mention the rise of single parenting, usually by moms), families need someone to mind the kids.

As women's economic potential catches up to men's, it makes sense that they'd also push for a policy that allows them to hold onto that power.\n\n2. Women vote\n\nNot only do women use paid leave; they also turn out to vote in greater numbers than men \u2014 a gap that has only widened over the years, according to data compiled by Rutgers University.\n\nIt's only a 4-percentage-point gap, but it has grown considerably, and in presidential elections, small shifts in voter participation can make a huge difference.\n\nOnce again, paid leave isn't purely a women's issue (see No. 3 below for proof), but it is still something women take more advantage of than men, thanks to both access and cultural values.

The president talked about it. A lot\n\nThink back to 2008, when paid leave just wasn't a big issue on the presidential campaign trail.
