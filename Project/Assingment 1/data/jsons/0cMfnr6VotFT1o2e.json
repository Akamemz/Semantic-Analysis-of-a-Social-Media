    "content": "Donald Trump has called on China to capitulate to U.S. demands on trade . The problem is nobody knows exactly what Trump actually wants \u2014 including the Chinese .\nOne week , he condemns threats to American national security interests and the next , agrees to lift a ban on doing business with Chinese telecom giant ZTE . He rails about the U.S. trade deficit with China , then dismisses Beijing \u2019 s offer \u2014 negotiated by his own officials \u2014 to boost its purchases of U.S. goods by billions of dollars .\nBeyond the feints and jabs , he \u2019 s raised so many different issues that it \u2019 s hard to know what his priorities might really be .\nThe strategy is straight out of \u201c The Art of the Deal \u201d : \u201c I aim very high , and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I \u2019 m after. \u201d But some doubt that approach translates to negotiating with a global superpower . By all accounts , it has left the Chinese increasingly mystified about what Trump really wants at a pivotal moment when the world \u2019 s two largest economies are teetering on the edge of sustained trade warfare .\n\u201c They \u2019 re absolutely confused , \u201d Derek Scissors , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , said of the Chinese .\nWithout clear demands , he argued , Beijing is unlikely to offer much . \u201c The concession has to get them something . And they don \u2019 t know what they \u2019 re going to get because the U.S. doesn \u2019 t have a strategy . \u201d\nChinese officials , for their part , are increasingly blunt about their frustration .\n\u201c We appeal our American interlocutors to be credible and consistent , \u201d Li Kexin , minister at the Chinese embassy in Washington , said in a speech Tuesday at the Institute for China-America Studies . \u201c When you agree , you mean it . \u201d\nAnd on Friday , Gao Feng , spokesman for China \u2019 s Ministry of Commerce , criticized the U.S. as \u201c capricious . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s aggressive approach is a reversal from more than a decade of U.S. policy toward China , which involved negotiating on a suite of business issues every year to make incremental progress . Any gains were secured largely by convincing Beijing that a more open economy was ultimately in its best interests \u2014 a tactic that worked very slowly and only to a point .\nThe president \u2019 s willingness to antagonize China more directly has largely been embraced by the U.S. companies and workers desperate for quicker and more substantial results . But veterans of international negotiations are skeptical that negotiations will succeed unless they \u2019 re more clearly focused .\n\u201c Yes , they have a plan . No , I don \u2019 t think it will work , \u201d said Bill Reinsch , a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . \u201c The plan is always push harder , demand everything and offer nothing . \u201d\nThe underlying structure of China \u2019 s economy is the cause of many of U.S. companies \u2019 most intractable complaints , something that won \u2019 t change in a matter of weeks or even months .\nBeijing makes U.S. companies jump through more hoops than domestic companies . It conducts cyber espionage and steals U.S. trade secrets and intellectual property , like patents . And the Chinese government subsidizes its companies on a grand scale , guaranteeing that they can sell goods below a market-set price .\nAll of these policies have been identified by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative as the impetus for new tariffs set to be imposed on $ 50 billion in Chinese goods . But across the ideological spectrum , China watchers are worried the president \u2019 s laser-like focus on the trade deficit may lead him to lose focus on seeking structural changes to the Chinese nonmarket system .\n\u201c This is a multiyear process that involves a lot of pain , \u201d Scissors said . \u201c If you don \u2019 t want to face the pain and take the time , then don \u2019 t do it . \u201d\nChinese officials have similarly cautioned that this negotiation may take years .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s talk about it , no matter on trade deficit or structural issues , \u201d Li said .\nAdding to the confusion , senior administration officials have said they don \u2019 t know exactly what Trump will decide to say or do on trade at any given moment . That uncertainty has led advisers to compete for his attention in a bid to sway him , which leads to varied tactics and mixed messaging .\nOfficials like National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow have indicated the goal is to knock down barriers to U.S. exports , such as tariffs . But under the rules of the World Trade Organization , China is bound to give the United States the same tariff treatment as every other WTO member , making negotiations on the reduction of duties difficult .\nMeanwhile , the new U.S. tariffs , aimed at extracting concessions from the Chinese , were designed largely as a response to intellectual property theft , with a nod to China \u2019 s policy of propping up companies in particular sectors .\nChina responded to the announcement of those tariffs by scheduling duties on U.S. goods that mirror the size and timing of the administration \u2019 s action . On Tuesday , Trump responded by threatening to slap tariffs on as much as $ 450 billion in Chinese goods . The administration is also planning next week to place new investment restrictions on the Asian nation .\nOn Friday , Gao Feng , spokesman for China \u2019 s Ministry of Commerce , criticized the U.S. as \u201c capricious. \u201d | Andy Wong/AP Photo\n\u201c Increasingly , I \u2019 ve been asked by fairly high-level folks [ in China ] to just explain what is going on , \u201d said Taiya Smith , who worked under former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to develop formalized trade talks between Washington and Beijing , then called the Strategic Economic Dialogue .\nIn a press call on Tuesday , White House trade adviser Peter Navarro criticized Beijing \u2019 s offers thus far . \u201c If they thought that they could buy us off with a few extra products sold and allow them to continue to steal our intellectual property and crown jewels , that was a miscalculation , \u201d he said . \u201c We hope going forward , there is no more miscalculation . \u201d\nSo what concessions might be enough ? The clearest document outlining U.S. demands looked more like asks in negotiations on a comprehensive free trade agreement than a targeted deal aimed at heading off punitive tariffs .\nThe administration in May said it wanted China to commit to reducing the trade deficit by $ 200 billion by 2020 . It also asked China to stop subsidizing high-tech sectors like robotics and alternative energy vehicles identified in its China \u2019 s strategic economic plan , cut tariffs on \u201c all products in non-critical sectors \u201d to levels at or below U.S. duties and assure that it would not challenge U.S. actions taken in intellectual property disputes .\nRobert Lighthizer , Trump \u2019 s chief negotiator , said at the time that it wasn \u2019 t his goal to \u201c change the Chinese system , \u201d despite his long list of criticisms of that system .\n\u201c If they want to do it , that \u2019 s fine , but I have to be in a position where the United States can deal with it , where the United States isn \u2019 t a victim of it , \u201d he said .\nA source familiar with the negotiations said Lighthizer and Navarro both seem to be of the view that China is not going to change , and so they \u2019 re taking action to protect the U.S. market . It \u2019 s possible , the source added , that a lot of the new trade restrictions will simply remain in place .\nTrump himself has railed repeatedly against the massive trade deficit between the U.S. and China , which stood at $ 566 billion in 2017 . He \u2019 s also nodded to China \u2019 s practice of forcing companies to hand over valuable technology and data .\n\u201c We are not in a trade war with China , that war was lost many years ago by the foolish , or incompetent , people who represented the U.S. , \u201d Trump tweeted in April . \u201c Now we have a Trade Deficit of $ 500 Billion a year , with Intellectual Property Theft of another $ 300 Billion . We can not let this continue ! \u201d\nBut he muddied the waters last month by offering to strike a deal to save embattled Chinese telecom giant ZTE , which policy experts argue could \u2019 ve been used as an example to Chinese companies that break the law .\nThe Commerce Department in April imposed a seven-year ban on American companies doing business with ZTE , alleging the company had conducted illegal sales to North Korea and Iran . The ban threatened to shutter the company .\nBut then Trump tweeted that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping were working on a way to get ZTE \u201c back into business , fast , \u201d adding , \u201c Too many jobs in China lost . \u201d\nSen. Mark Warner ( D-Va. ) criticized the move as inconsistent with Trump \u2019 s effort to get tough on China . \u201c While we simply can not let China \u2019 s unfair trade practices go unchecked , this President \u2019 s erratic approach to resolving this issue gives me pause , \u201d he said in a statement .\nThe Senate has since moved to block Commerce \u2019 s deal with ZTE .\nBeyond uncertainty about the administration \u2019 s goals , U.S. business groups also aren \u2019 t pleased with the approach taken by the administration \u2014 imposing a lot of new tariffs \u2014 in a bid to spur change .\n\u201c One way we \u2019 ve been putting it lately is : right question , wrong answer , \u201d said Josh Kallmer , senior vice president of global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve actually been really supportive of the administration for undertaking the investigation and raising this to a level of seriousness that past administrations have not , \u201d added Kallmer , a former career official at the USTR with experience in negotiating with China .\nBut \u201c the path they \u2019 ve gone on , we \u2019 ve found it to be pretty counterproductive and bordering on irresponsible , \u201d he added , saying tariffs are merely going to hurt American standards of living by raising prices .\nHe argued instead that the U.S. should be focused specifically on intellectual property theft , and it should recruit the help of U.S. allies like Canada , Europe and Japan , rather than further antagonizing those countries .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no question that the attorneys and key policy officials at USTR are seeing the big picture , \u201d Kallmer said . \u201c But then when it gets to be time for political-level officials to make a judgment about what to do , I think they are being selective and incomplete .
