    "content": "For the past several weeks , Kushner has led a \u201c shadow task force \u201d on the coronavirus , separate from Vice President Mike Pence \u2019 s official committee , according to The Washington Post . Kushner \u2019 s team , composed of federal officials allied with Kushner and outside corporate executives , has met in the headquarters of the Department of Health and Human Services . A senior official at that agency called Oscar to ask for its help on March 13 , the day of Trump \u2019 s press conference , the Oscar spokesperson said .\nKushner \u2019 s group has focused on expanding and publicizing coronavirus testing , especially at drive-through locations . Oscar \u2019 s website would have asked users if they were experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 , the illness caused by the virus , and surveyed them about other risk factors , including their age and preexisting conditions . It also would have listed a limited number of testing locations nationwide , including some of the drive-through sites that Trump promised . It was designed to look like a government-developed product , provided freely by the Department of Health and Human Services to the American public . Oscar posted the source code for the site to Github , where \u2588\u2588\u2588 reviewed it .\nThe site resembled a version of a tool Oscar had already built for its customers in response to the crisis , but it was \u201c adjusted to meet the specifications and requirements set by the federal government , \u201d Jackie Kahn , the Oscar spokesperson , said in an emailed statement . That Oscar had already been working on a coronavirus-testing website when HHS called to ask for help was a coincidence that had nothing to do with Kushner , Kahn suggested . She declined to say whether Oscar had discussed that site with Joshua Kushner or any board members or investors before Trump \u2019 s March 13 press conference .\nOscar donated its work freely and never expected to be paid for the project , Kahn said . The company is \u201c not , nor has ever been , \u201d a contractor or subcontractor for the government , she said , which would make it harder for the government to pay Oscar for its work . The work was \u201c all at the direction of HHS , \u201d she said . \u201c The website never saw the light of day , \u201d she added in an interview today .\nThat may not matter from an ethics perspective . The ad hoc nature of Kushner \u2019 s task force has already collided with federal laws . Oscar \u2019 s involvement deepens Kushner \u2019 s ethics and conflict-of-interest problems .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not typical . It \u2019 s usually not allowed , \u201d Jessica Tillipman , an assistant dean at the George Washington University School of Law and an expert on anti-corruption law , told me .\nOscar \u2019 s relationship with the Trump administration could breach federal law in two ways , Tillipman and other experts told me .
