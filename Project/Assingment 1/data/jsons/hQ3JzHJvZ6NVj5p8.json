He suggested that fears he and three other Obama appointees would dramatically change the balance in the D.C. Circuit were overwrought.\n\nPaul Watford\n\nWatford is an Obama appointee on the 9th Circuit and has been repeatedly mentioned as a potential Obama Supreme Court nominee. He was confirmed in 2012, by a 61-34 vote.\n\nWatford, who\u2019s in his late 40s, spent a decade as a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. Regarded as a moderate appointee, he was also a clerk to influential 9th Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. His list of judicial rulings is still fairly short, which can be an advantage in confirmation battles. Watford is African-American.\n\nPatricia Ann Millett\n\nMillett, 52, sits on the D.C.
