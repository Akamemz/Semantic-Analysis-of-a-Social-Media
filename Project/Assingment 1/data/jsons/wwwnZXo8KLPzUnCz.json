    "content": "( CNN ) Michael Cohen 's quest for redemption drew Americans into the mob-like world of Donald Trump . The President 's former personal lawyer has painted a cruel and unseemly picture , shocking even with the nation 's senses dulled by years of Trump-induced controversy .\nIn a theatrical day of congressional testimony Wednesday that will become an iconic moment of Trump 's presidency , Cohen -- who is about to go to prison -- turned on his ex-client with the world watching .\nHe made a case that after spending a decade inside Trump 's world , he knew the President better than anyone -- seeking to provide context for the flurry of investigations and claims of crimes and wrongdoing surrounding the President .\nHe sketched a stunning portrait of Trump 's organization and conduct in what turned into an extraordinary and unprecedented daylong indictment of the character of a sitting President .\nIt was either the betrayal of a proven liar who is making up tales to save himself or the courageous act of an unlikely hero rising above his dirty past to provide a national service , depending on which side of the committee room lawmakers sat on .\nAccording to Cohen , Trump 's empire was awash in activity that needed a fixer . Cohen told the House Oversight Committee that he now bitterly regrets he blindly took that role , which will ultimately deprive him of his freedom .\n`` My loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything , '' Cohen said , in an apparent message to a former patron who was likely watching on the other side of the planet , during his visit to Hanoi , Vietnam .\nTrump , for his part , answered a single question about Cohen after his summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un , by slamming Democrats for holding a hearing and calling his former fixer a liar .\n`` He lied a lot , '' Trump said . `` He lied about so many different things . ''\nIn Trump 's world , the boss knew everything that went on , according to Cohen . Henchmen like Cohen came to know by osmosis what the big man wanted . His currency was threats . And bad tabloid news stories were bought up -- even if they were n't true -- to stop them from sullying Trump 's personal image .\nThere was one law of the Trump jungle that everyone came to understand , including Cohen , in his years as the right hand of the titan of Trump Tower .\n`` Everybody 's job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump , '' he said .\nWednesday 's hearing , which played out amid fiercely partisan scenes , contained revelations that hinted at future and deeper legal exposure for the President . Most notably , Cohen produced a personal check for $ 35,000 that Trump signed while in office that appears to show that the President reimbursed him for hush payments he made to women who claimed affairs with the then-GOP nominee .\nCohen has already admitted paying off the women in an infringement of campaign finance law . If it is proved that Trump -- who has denied having affairs with the women -- knew he was breaking the law , the President could be in serious trouble , even after he leaves office .\nCohen , a former confidant turned accuser , also revealed that prosecutors in New York were probing Trump 's organization for alleged illegality in a previously unpublicized case , underscoring the potential that the biggest threat to the President may come not from special counsel Robert Mueller but from the hard-charging US Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York .\n`` I think it 's ominous news for the President , '' said former southern district prosecutor Elie Honig on CNN .\nCohen also claimed that he had overheard a call in which Trump 's longtime political adviser Roger Stone told the then-GOP nominee in 2016 that WikiLeaks was due to dump a new trove of emails that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton .\nAnd he said Trump knew in advance about a 2016 meeting between a Russian lawyer and his campaign team designed to deliver `` dirt '' on Clinton .\nSince Trump previously told Mueller in sworn written answers that neither of those statements were true , he could be in legal and political jeopardy if Cohen or prosecutors can provide corroboration of Cohen 's claims .\nCohen 's appearance offered a window into parts of the Russia investigation that the buttoned-down special counsel investigation has yet to provide . But the testimony also cast doubt on some reports that had suggested vulnerability for Trump .\nFor instance , Cohen testified that he had never been to the Czech Republic , potentially knocking down one of the accusations in the Steele dossier , a document of raw intelligence leads that purported to show that Trump was compromised by Russia .\nHe also said he did not believe a rumored videotape of Trump striking his wife , Melania , in an elevator existed . And he said that in any case , the President would never do such a thing .\nCohen may have tarnished his own credibility when he insisted he never wanted a job in the Trump White House . Multiple reports by CNN and other media suggest that he was not telling the truth .\n`` I see a guy who worked for 10 years is here trashing the guy he worked for 10 years , did n't get a job in the White House , and now you 're behaving just like everyone else who 's got fired or did n't get the job they wanted , '' Rep. Jim Jordan , an Ohio Republican who 's a key Trump ally , told Cohen .\nIt was not immediately clear if Cohen 's day in the spotlight would bolster the arguments of Democrats who already favor impeachment , since he did not have smoking gun evidence of collusion between Trump aides and Russia .\n`` House Democrats and Michael Cohen put on a circus that was full of lies and uncorroborated allegations , '' said Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel .\nJUST WATCHED Cohen : Lying to first lady is one of my biggest regrets Replay More Videos ...
