    "content": "On Friday morning , Donald Trump will meet with Vladimir Putin in Hamburg . This should scare the bejesus out of everyone everywhere , including Russia . This will not end well . At best , it will end inconclusively , and nothing awful will happen . Nothing awful would be a happy ending .\nThe person whose job will be to ensure nothing awful happens is Rex Tillerson , the secretary of state . He is expected to be the only other American official in the room . According to Axios \u2019 s Jonathan Swan , there will be six people present : the presidents ; Tillerson ; Tillerson \u2019 s counterpart , Sergey Lavrov ; and two translators . This , it should be noted , is a terrible idea that will make an already-terrifying meeting more terrifying . Lavrov is a superb diplomat who has faithfully executed Putin \u2019 s foreign policy since taking over the Foreign Ministry in 2004 . Tillerson and , in fact , the whole U.S. diplomatic corps , have been sidelined by Trump , who seems to trust only men in uniform , which is unsurprising and beyond stupid . Bottom line : the Russian team is united , sophisticated , clear-eyed . The Americans are fractured and unpredictable\u2014not in the clever way Trump \u2019 s minions like to think but in a way that \u2019 s born of ignorance and mood swings .\nWhat is the best-case scenario ? In a parallel universe , one in which the American president had a rudimentary grasp of Russian history and statecraft and an appreciation for diplomacy , this would be a short meeting\u2014five minutes tops . The president would state that he was fully aware of Russian meddling in the 2016 election , that he supported unequivocally all investigations into that meddling ( including accusations that his campaign had colluded with the Russians ) , and that it would never happen again . He would explain that , if U.S. intelligence got a whiff of any future meddling , it would use its own extensive cyber capabilities to expose the hidden bank accounts and investments of senior Kremlin officials , starting with the Russian president . ( James Stavridis suggested , in a Foreign Policy column in October , that then-President Obama consider doing as much . ) And he would make it clear that this would be the first step toward denying the Kremlin the status , legitimacy , and recognition it craves so deeply , that this would be the beginning of the end of pretending that Russia is a great power and not a kleptocracy that bleeds people , builds nothing , and stokes chaos abroad . Then , because this imaginary president would understand that it was important to give Putin something good to yap about , that he not alienate the Russian president , he would spend 10 seconds saying something about joint U.S.-Russian efforts to destroy ISIS , blah blah blah . Then , he would go .\nLater , at a press briefing , the American president would expand on his comments to the Russian president : not only would the United States regard an attack on its election system as a threat to our democracy , but it would also consider any Russian interference in the elections of any of our NATO allies an attack on the entire democratic enterprise . If the G.R.U. , or Russian military intelligence , were to hack into , say , elections this fall in Norway or Germany , the United States would\u2014obviously\u2014invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement and work with our allies to ensure a swift and proportional response .
