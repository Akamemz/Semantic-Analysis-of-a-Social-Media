Within weeks , Africa \u2019 s youngest leader shocked the long-turbulent Horn of Africa region by fully accepting a peace deal ending a 20-year border war with neighboring Eritrea that saw some 80,000 people killed .\nThe visibly moved Eritrean president , Isaias Afwerki , soon visited Addis Ababa and diplomatic , communications and transport links were restored .
