    "content": "Jimmy Kimmel doesn \u2019 t want to be talking about health care so much , but here he is , smack dab in the middle of a debate he very obviously hates .\nOn September 20 , during his monologue , Kimmel took a breath in the middle of trying to explain the ramshackle Graham-Cassidy health care bill currently up for consideration in the Senate , and looked out at his audience . \u201c Listen : Health care is complicated , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s boring . I don \u2019 t want to talk about it . The details are confusing \u2014 and that \u2019 s what these guys are relying on . They \u2019 re counting on you to be so overwhelmed with all the information [ that ] you just trust them to take care of it . Well , they \u2019 re not taking care of you . They \u2019 re taking care of the people who give them money . \u201d\nOn September 21 , Kimmel went a step further , Listing yet again the many , many medical associations that have come out against the Graham-Cassidy bill , Kimmel threw up his hands and said , `` We have n't seen this many people come out to speak against a bill since Cosby . \u201d\nStrong words , but not anything that people who have been watching Kimmel lately can be surprised by , after months of the late-night host slamming each and every frantic Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare . After Kimmel \u2019 s newborn son required open-heart surgery in April , the host realized that if Obamacare were repealed , lifetime caps on health care spending could return , and his family \u2014 and so many others \u2014 could get screwed by having to spend thousands of dollars out of pocket to ensure their loved ones are cared for . At the time , Kimmel gave an impassioned , tearful monologue about making sure his son received the care he needed and about just how important it was that his family had reasonable health insurance .\nThat monologue became an instant sensation , getting the attention of not just his viewers and angry people on the internet but also the very Republican senators he was calling out for holding people \u2019 s lives in the balance . Sen. Bill Cassidy even appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live afterward to define \u201c the Jimmy Kimmel test \u201d for future health care legislation , which would mandate that the bill ensure that \u201c no family should be denied medical care , emergency or otherwise , because they ca n't afford it . \u201d\nNow , however , Cassidy is trying to push through an extreme new health care bill that would turn over incredible responsibility to the states and , essentially , blow up the health insurance system as we know it \u2014 and Kimmel , who before this has never made biting political commentary his comedic bread and butter , doesn \u2019 t want to let him get away with it . This week alone , he gave three searing monologues about the Graham-Cassidy bill , refusing to blink in the face of Republicans telling him to sit down , shut up , and let \u201c the experts \u201d handle it .\n\u201c I never thought I \u2019 d get involved in something like this , \u201d Kimmel said on September 19 , dumbfounded . \u201c This is not my area of expertise . My area of expertise is eating pizza , and that \u2019 s about it . But we can \u2019 t keep letting them do this to our children , our senior citizens , our veterans , or to any of us . \u201d\nThis blatant hypocrisy has him pissed , sure , but even more than that , he seems just plain fed up with the whole ordeal . All three of his monologues this week make clear that he would love to drop the sincere pleas and keep making people laugh . But as he sees it , the overall cruelty of these health care proposals \u2014 which affect him personally \u2014 gives him no choice but to return to the same dry subject over and over again .\nBefore his son \u2019 s surgery , Jimmy Kimmel preferred to dabble in politics rather than diving in face first\nPrior to President Trump taking office , Jimmy Kimmel Live would take on politics from time to time , though never in earnest monologues like the one that put Kimmel at the forefront of the health care discussion . Instead , the show tended to approach politicians with the same instinct it applied to uninformed people wandering down Hollywood Boulevard : wryly pointing out how stupid they could be . For a long while , in fact , Kimmel was best known as the late-night host who would spotlight a ridiculous viral video \u2014 like 2013 \u2019 s \u201c Worst Twerk Fail EVER - Girl Catches Fire \u2014 only to reveal himself as the puppet master behind it .\nSince Jimmy Kimmel Live debuted in 2003 , the vast majority of the show has been devoted to snarking on pop culture , putting on live concerts , and making ABC happy with constant analysis of the Bachelor franchise . Kimmel pulls pranks and highlights other people \u2019 s pranks when they manage to impress him . He puts people on the spot with sporadic games , which can be fun and loose or veer into something a little crueler ( e.g. , \u201c Foreigner Or Not ? \u201d ) .\nBut over the past several months , even some of his more overtly silly regular segments have found sharper political teeth . \u201c How Many Americans Know Where North Korea Is ? \u201d forced people on the street to face the fact that they had strong opinions about a country they know almost nothing about . His signature \u201c Celebrities Read Mean Tweets \u201d segment recently got a cheeky remix into something a little more pointed , when he read \u201c Mean Comments From Trump Supporters \u201d after he got flak for a particularly critical monologue he did after the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville , Virginia .\nLike most late-night hosts this year , Kimmel has found himself unable to turn away from politics \u2014 or , more accurately , the bizarre reality that is President Donald Trump . And when his son was born earlier this year and almost immediately required three open-heart surgeries , Kimmel was unable to ignore the issue that had presented itself in such a horrific way on his doorstep .\nSo he didn \u2019 t \u2014 and he launched himself into the conversation with unprecedented candor that took almost everyone , perhaps especially himself , by surprise .\nThis honest , vulnerable Kimmel wasn \u2019 t like any iteration of himself he \u2019 d shown viewers before . Kimmel \u2014 who first came up in comedy through co-hosting The Man Show with Adam Carolla \u2014 usually delivers punchlines with a bemused-seeming laugh that masks their acidic sarcasm .
