That is turning Midwestern states more Republican , \u201d GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told reporters at the Monitor Breakfast on Thursday . At the same time , \u201c suburban voters \u2013 in particular suburban women \u2013 have been moving left . That \u2019 s turning states with big suburban populations \u2013 states like Texas , states like Georgia , states like Arizona \u2013 much more purple . \u201d\nLately , a rash of congressional Republicans opting not to run for reelection \u2013 a phenomenon some are calling the \u201c Texodus \u201d \u2013 has fueled Democrats \u2019 excitement . And to understand why Texas politics is shifting , many say , you shouldn \u2019 t just look at the state \u2019 s growing Hispanic population . You should look at where those GOP retirements are happening : around the booming , increasingly liberal cities .\nBut next year could , as the saying goes , be the year .\nAs Texas moves slowly but inevitably into majority-minority status , it \u2019 s become something of a biennial tradition to ask if the next election will finally mark the end of decades of Republican dominance in the state .\nIn the run-up to the 2008 election , when Brandy Derrick was first becoming politically aware , she joined millions of Texans in voting to reject Democratic nominee Barack Obama . Former GOP Sen. John McCain carried Tarrant County , where she lives , by double digits .\nHe won Texas by a similar margin , but Tarrant , which includes the city of Fort Worth and its suburbs , was the only urban county he won . Three other major metropolitan counties \u2013 Bexar ( San Antonio ) , Dallas , and Harris ( Houston ) \u2013 flipped that year to join Travis County ( Austin ) in voting Democratic , and they haven \u2019 t flipped back since .\nLast year , Tarrant County joined them , voting for a statewide Democrat \u2013 U.S. Senate candidate Beto O \u2019 Rourke \u2013 for the first time since 1990 . Ms. Derrick , owner of Legal Ease Bookkeeping in Fort Worth , was not surprised .\n\u201c I think Texas as a whole is moving that way , \u201d she says .\nDemocrats certainly hope so \u2013 but then , they \u2019 ve been hoping so for a while . With Texas slowly but inevitably moving into majority-minority status , it \u2019 s become something of a biennial tradition in the Lone Star State to ask if the next election will finally mark the end of decades of Republican dominance .\nEvery dawn has been false . Last year , Sen. Ted Cruz beat Mr. O \u2019 Rourke despite becoming the first top-of-the-ticket Republican to lose in all of the major Texas metro areas since Barry Goldwater in 1964 . But next year could , as the saying goes , be the year . While no Democrat won statewide in 2018 , in terms of turnout and down-ballot races the party had its best election in decades .\nLoren Elliott/Reuters Beto O'Rourke speaks with members of the media following a rally at Texas Southern University in Houston , during his campaign for U.S. Senate , October 9 , 2018 . The former congressman , who lost that race to Sen. Ted Cruz , is now running for the Democratic presidential nomination .\nLately , a rash of congressional Republicans opting not to run for reelection \u2013 a phenomenon some are calling the \u201c Texodus \u201d \u2013 has only fueled Democrats \u2019 excitement . And to understand why Texas politics is shifting , many say , you shouldn \u2019 t just look at the state \u2019 s growing Hispanic population .

That is turning Midwestern states more Republican , \u201d Senator Cruz told reporters at the Monitor Breakfast on Thursday . At the same time , \u201c suburban voters \u2013 in particular suburban women \u2013 have been moving left . That \u2019 s turning states with big suburban populations \u2013 states like Texas , states like Georgia , states like Arizona \u2013 much more purple . \u201d\nAs measured by job creation and population growth , the \u201c Texas Triangle \u201d bounded by Dallas-Fort Worth , Houston , and San Antonio-Austin is the strongest economic region in the United States . While Houston is the hub of the U.S. energy industry , big tech companies are settling in Austin ( Google and Apple ) and Dallas ( Uber ) .\nAnd with a large , young , and college-educated workforce flocking to live and work in the region , these Texas cities and suburbs have been both gaining political power and becoming more solidly liberal . Research by Ren\u00e9e Cross and Richard Murray at the University of Houston has found that voters in the 27 counties around big metro areas grew from 52 % of the total electorate in 1968 to 69 % in 2018 . Meanwhile , voters in the more rural counties \u2013 outside the Democratic strongholds in south Texas \u2013 decreased from 38 % to 8 % in that time .\nMr. O \u2019 Rourke in particular was effective in ginning up support and \u2013 crucially , for a low-turnout demographic \u2013 votes from young Texans . He carried the state \u2019 s five major urban counties by a combined 790,000 votes last year , six times more than Mr. Obama in 2012 . Registering and turning out more voters in those cities and suburbs is at the core of Texas Democrats \u2019 plan , released this week , to flip \u201c the biggest battleground state in the country . \u201d\nMichael Bonfigli/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas speaks to reporters at the Monitor Breakfast at the St. Regis Hotel on Sept. 12 , 2019 , in Washington , D.C. `` I believe the president will win Texas '' in 2020 , Senator Cruz predicted . But `` I think it will be closer than last time . ''\nThe \u201c Texodus \u201d suggests that Republicans in the state may have the same concerns . Four of the five congressmen who will be stepping down next year represent suburban districts that have become increasingly competitive ; the fifth , Rep. Will Hurd , represents a vast border district that is the most competitive in the state .\n\u201c The people [ Texas ] is attracting , the job opportunities , are magnets for younger voters , voters who are perhaps more liberal , \u201d says Ann Bowman , a political scientist at Texas A & M University . \u201c The Beto effect was mobilizing younger voters , \u201d she adds . \u201c Are we going to see that in 2020 ? The general trend is for younger voters to turn out less . \u201d\nWhat could boost Democratic turnout is the Republican ticket being led by one of the most unpopular presidents in recent memory . Just 45 % of registered voters in Texas approve of President Trump , while 50 % don \u2019 t , according to a poll this week from Quinnipiac University . He trailed most of his Democratic challengers head-to-head in the state in a recent University of Texas at Tyler survey .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s often harsh and divisive rhetoric \u201c trumps anything he \u2019 s doing with the economy for many suburban women , \u201d says Nancy Bocskor , director of the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at Texas Woman \u2019 s University in Denton .\n\u201c Suburban women are going to turn out and vote , \u201d she adds . \u201c That \u2019 s a bigger wild card here than the growing number of Hispanic voters . \u201d\nDecades of political dominance in Texas could also now be making life more difficult for Republicans .\nAs in states around the country , a lack of competitive general elections has led to competitive primaries , with Republicans drifting further and further to the right since former President George W. Bush built his presidential campaign on \u201c compassionate conservatism \u201d and his ability to work with Democrats while governor of Texas . This in turn has alienated moderate voters , including in suburbs that used to be conservative strongholds .\n\u201c If all you \u2019 re doing as a political party is communicating with your primary voters , that \u2019 s a great way to perhaps win the next election , but what it is not is a way to grow your party , \u201d says Harold Cook , a longtime Democratic strategist in Texas .\nMary Clare Jalonick/AP/File GOP Rep.

Mr. Hurd has announced he will not seek reelection in 2020 .\nRepublicans in the state legislature responded to that head-on in the legislative session earlier this year , avoiding the polarizing cultural issues like the failed \u201c bathroom bill \u201d that had marked the 2017 session in favor of pocketbook issues like property tax and public education reform . Whether those efforts generated enough goodwill to help Republicans 13 months from now remains to be seen .\n\u201c I think a lot of these legislators made very smart moves to help shore up that Republican brand , \u201d says Professor Bocskor . \u201c They were spot on in targeting what suburban women are concerned about . \u201d\nYet right now , \u201c the biggest issues are health care and immigration and gun control , \u201d says Brandon Rottinghaus , a political scientist at the University of Houston . \u201c Those are all issues that break badly for Republicans in terms of support from suburban women . \u201d\nThirteen years after they traded Northern California for North Texas , Melissa and Mike Patruso are beginning to feel more at home \u2013 politically , at least \u2013 in Watauga , a suburb north of Fort Worth .\n\u201c How well Beto did in the election last year \u2013 that was surprising , \u201d says Mrs. Patruso , \u201c and good . \u201d\nSo could 2020 be the year ? Will Texas turn blue ?\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think so just yet , \u201d she says . \u201c We \u2019 re not there yet . \u201d\nMost experts agree that Democrats \u2019 18-year streak of not winning a statewide race in Texas will probably continue into 2022 . Mr. Trump will likely turn out voters who support him as much as he will voters who reject him , and fear of Republicans losing Texas \u2013 and its huge cache of 38 electoral votes \u2013 could also motivate conservative voters .\nDemocrats further down the ballot will face a new hurdle next year , with straight-ticket balloting eliminated by the state legislature after the 2018 election .
