    "content": "The circumstances facing President Obama as he delivered his State of the Union address Tuesday night could not have seemed less promising : a presidency with only two years left to get anything done in a Congress that is now totally in the control of a party that has routinely ignored his pleas for cooperation . So he chose wisely to send a simple , dramatic message about economic fairness , about the fact that the well-off \u2014 the top earners , the big banks , Silicon Valley \u2014 have done just great , while the middle and working classes remain dead in the water . His remedy : skim from the rich and redistribute to those below , while deploying other weapons to raise wages and increase jobs .\nHe did not frame the debate over inequality as starkly as many economists have , preferring instead to talk about the virtues of \u201c middle-class economics. \u201d But he came close . \u201c It \u2019 s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years , and for decades to come , \u201d he said . \u201c Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well ? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort ? \u201d\nMr. Obama knows his prospects of getting Congress to agree are less than zero ; Republicans dismissed his ideas before he even voiced them . That does not make them irrelevant . Mr. Obama was speaking not just to the present but to the future , to the 2016 presidential elections and even beyond . By simply raising the plight of the middle class ( and , looming behind it , the larger issue of economic inequality ) , he has firmly inserted issues of economic fairness into the political debate . Hillary Rodham Clinton or whomever the Democrats nominate can not ignore them now . Even Republicans , disinclined to raise taxes on top-tier earners , may find attractive the idea of doing something for those in the middle .\nFurther , while the rhetoric was combative , even defiant in parts , the president \u2019 s proposal is hardly radical . It would raise the capital gains tax to 28 percent \u2014 which is where it was in the Reagan era . It would impose ordinary income tax rates on dividends and end a provision in the tax code that shields hundreds of billions of dollars in appreciated wealth passed on to heirs . These changes , plus a new fee on big banks , would finance a set of tax breaks for middle-income families , including credits for two-earner couples , increased child care and college tuition credits , as well as other programs , including two years of tuition-free community college for some students . And the whole thing is designed to be revenue-neutral , the tax increases paying for the new programs to avoid the endless wrangling over deficits that have exhausted both political parties as well as the American public .",
