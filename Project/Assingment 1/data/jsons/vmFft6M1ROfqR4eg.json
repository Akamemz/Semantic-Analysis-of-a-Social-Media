But Kelly took a swing right at him on her show Thursday evening , blasting the billionaire for his comments about Gonzalo Curiel , the federal judge presiding over the civil fraud lawsuits against Trump University , whom Trump has claimed is biased because of his Mexican heritage .\n\u201c This is out of line , \u201d Kelly said , raising her voice . The Fox News host had planned to spend the segment talking about House Speaker Paul Ryan endorsing the candidate , but scrapped it when news broke a few hours before her broadcast that Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Curiel , a U.S. District Judge , had an \u201c absolute conflict \u201d presiding over a pair of cases in which plaintiffs accuse Trump University of duping them into paying thousands of dollars to learn Trump \u2019 s tricks of the real-estate trade . ( According to one former employee of the now-defunct for-profit school , whose testimony was revealed on Tuesday , \u201c Trump University was a fraudulent scheme \u201d that \u201c preyed upon the elderly and uneducated. \u201d ) The conflict , according to Trump , derives from the fact that Curiel is \u201c of Mexican heritage \u201d and a member of a Latino lawyers \u2019 association . Curiel grew up in Indiana .\nTrump told the Journal that his plan to close off the U.S. border with Mexico and his stated stance against illegal immigration makes the fact that Curiel \u2019 s parents are Mexican immigrants relevant . \u201c I \u2019 m building a wall .
