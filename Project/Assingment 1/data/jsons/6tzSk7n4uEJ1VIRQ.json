John Thune , South Dakota Republican .\nPart of the problem was that Democrats had no clear proposal to rally around .\nInstead , they \u2019 re counting on bipartisan negotiations being led by Sens . Susan Collins , a Republican , and Joe Manchin III , a Democrat , to produce a new \u201c grand bargain \u201d deal that could cut through the fractious nature of the immigration debate .\nThose talks have yet to conclude , but negotiators were looking at a deal that would include legal status for illegal immigrant \u201c Dreamers \u201d with piles of cash for border security .\nSuch grand bargains have been a staple of past immigration debates , but none of them have ever become law .
