    "content": "( CNN ) President Barack Obama and his first secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , entered the White House in 2009 with visions of a `` Russian reset . '' But Obama will leave office next month in the midst of a shadowy Cold War-era fever dream , as Washington and Moscow are , once again , beset by accusations of diplomatic chicanery and outright espionage .\nIn dropping a new round of targeted sanctions on Russian diplomats and assets in the US , Obama on Thursday struck back at what the intelligence community has portrayed as an unprecedented -- and successful -- attempt by the Kremlin to meddle in the American democratic process . But even as President Vladimir Putin trolls the White House , saying he will turn the other cheek and sit tight awaiting what figures to be a more friendly administration on the horizon , questions outpace answers .\nFormer US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton handed a `` reset '' button to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during a meeting on March 6 , 2009 in Geneva .\nSo what comes next and who holds the advantage ? Here 's what we know , what the players are saying -- and how the chess match is unfolding .\nAfter weeks of ramped-up accusations about Russian hacking and promises of retaliation , the White House announced plans to expel 35 Russian diplomats -- giving them and their families 72 hours to leave the country -- and shuttering a pair of Russian compounds in New York and Maryland used by officials , in theory , for recreational purposes .\nThis 1940 aerial photo shows the Raskob Estate at Pioneer Point seen on the Eastern Shore in Maryland .
