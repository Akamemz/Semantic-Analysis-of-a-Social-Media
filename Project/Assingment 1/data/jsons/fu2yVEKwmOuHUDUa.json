    "content": "There are moments , infrequent but poignant , in which I find myself yearning for the good old days of the Jeb Bush presidential campaign . What a time that was \u2013 the uncomfortable-in-his-own-skin awkwardness ; the sad , pleading earnestness ; the inescapable aura of crushing sadness and defeat ; the Apple Watch . It was magical . And to counteract all that soul-withering desperation , there was the Jeb Bush promise , the much-mocked and self-evidently overoptimistic guarantee that under President Jeb the United States economy would grow at an annual rate of no less than 4 percent .\nThat promise was wildly out of step with historical averages \u2013 going back to 1968 , only one president , Bill Clinton , averaged 4 percent growth over a four-year term . And Jeb based his guarantee off his experience as governor of Florida , when he averaged 4.4 percent statewide growth on the strength of a perilously large housing bubble that catastrophically popped shortly after he left office ( somehow that detail never made it into the campaign literature ) . Regardless , \u201c four-percent growth \u201d was the mantra of Jeb the incurable optimist .\nWell , as it turns out , ol \u2019 Jeb was nothing but a piker . Four percent ? That \u2019 s a loser \u2019 s goal . Because here comes Ted Cruz , the last man standing between Donald Trump and the Republican nomination , promising America that under his watch the economy will zip along at \u201c a minimum of five-percent GDP growth. \u201d Five percent ! As you might guess , that \u2019 s an even rarer accomplishment than Jeb \u2019 s guaranteed 4 percent . Harry Truman enjoyed 6.5 percent average growth in the post-war economic boom ; the Kennedy-Johnson administration of the early \u2019 60s cleared 5 percent average growth ; and since then no president has broken the 5 percent barrier for a single term . Cruz is promising not just to break that trend but to deliver sustained growth at or above 5 percent .\nHow \u2019 s he going to get there ? Well , Ted Cruz has a plan . Per CNN : \u201c Cruz says it 's about going back to Reagan-style economics : cut taxes , scale back regulation on business and repeal Obamacare. \u201d Ted Cruz \u2019 s tax plan is unique in that it represents the most radical and aggressive upward redistribution of wealth of any of the plans offered by 2016 Republicans . His big idea is to completely restructure the tax code in such a way that the wealthiest Americans will reap massive windfalls . \u201c The overwhelming majority of the plan 's cost ( 79.6 percent ) goes to helping the richest fifth of taxpayers , \u201d Dylan Matthews noted at Vox : \u201c 43.7 percent goes to the top 1 percent alone. \u201d And as Bryce Covert writes at ThinkProgress , the assumption at play here \u2013 that colossal tax cuts for the wealthiest will trigger massive economic growth \u2013 is not backed up by research . What Cruz \u2019 s tax cuts will do , however , is explode the national debt by more than $ 10 trillion in the first decade , according to the Tax Policy Center .\nBut Cruz has an influential ally in his corner : Art Laffer , the high priest of trickle-down economics , who helped craft Cruz \u2019 s plan . \u201c Cruz 's tax plan is better than Reagan 's , \u201d Laffer told CNN . \u201c I think you 'll get growth rates higher than Reagan's. \u201d A good rule of thumb is that whenever you see Art Laffer extolling the amazing economic impact of a tax-cut package , assume the opposite will happen .\nLaffer \u2019 s time as a Cruz tax advisor was preceded by a high-profile stint as tax advisor to Kansas Gov . Sam Brownback , who came into power by promising to turn the state into a laboratory of trickle-down economic theory . With Laffer \u2019 s help , Brownback passed a tax package that knocked out taxes on small businesses and deeply cut rates across the board . Appearing with Brownback to hype the tax scheme , Laffer confidently predicted it would succeed beyond everyone \u2019 s wildest dreams . \u201c This will lead to enormous prosperity , \u201d Laffer told a group of Kansans in 2012 . \u201c You are moving into the pro-growth world , and believe me it will work . \u201d\nIt did not work . The cuts predictably sent the state into a budget crisis as it scrambled to cover a series of massive deficits . To pay for these tax cuts , which overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy , Kansas imposed deep cuts to social programs and passed new consumption taxes that disproportionately affect the poor . And what did Kansans get for all this pain ? Not much :\nIn 2015 , job growth in Kansas was a mere 0.1 percent , even as the nation \u2019 s economy grew 1.9 percent . Brownback pledged to bring 100,000 new jobs to the state in his second term ; as of January , he has brought 700 . What \u2019 s more , personal income growth slowed dramatically since the tax cuts went into effect . Between 2010 and 2012 , Kansas saw income growth of 6.1 percent , good for 12th in the nation ; from 2013 to 2015 , that rate was 3.6 percent , good for 41st .\nAs for Laffer , he later clarified that when he said the tax cut plan would bring \u201c enormous prosperity , \u201d he didn \u2019 t mean it would happen immediately . \u201c You have to view this over ten years , \u201d he told a Kansas City Star columnist last October . \u201c It will work in Kansas. \u201d That , unfortunately , directly contradicted what he wrote in a 2012 report stating that he \u201c advised Oklahoma , Kansas , and other states to cut their income tax rates if they want the most effective immediate and lasting boost to their states \u2019 economies . \u201d\nNow we \u2019 re supposed to trust Art Laffer when he says that Ted Cruz \u2019 s tax plan will bring wild economic growth that will outpace even Ronald Reagan \u2019 s economic record , which has become the stuff of mythic exaggeration among conservatives .
