    "content": "Soon after becoming House Speaker in 2011 , Republican John Boehner started running the traps on inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to a joint meeting of Congress .\nBut when Barry Jackson , then Boehner \u2019 s chief-of-staff , checked with President Barack Obama \u2019 s top advisers , Jackson said he was left waiting a month only to get no response . Ultimately the Netanyahu speech went ahead in May but soon after Jackson faced the opposite problem : the White House had promised South Korea \u2019 s leadership an appearance before Congress , he said , without checking first with the speaker .\nNone of these slights justify what seems like payback now : Boehner \u2019 s decision to invite Netanyahu again , only this time without advising Obama or Democrats in Congress .\nBut the sequence of events does capture how much the normal courtesies between this White House and Congress have deteriorated \u2014 even in front of guests from another country .\n\u201c There appear to be no rules anymore . If you can do it , do it , \u201d said Patrick Griffin , who recalls nothing quite like this even in the tempestuous times Griffin served as White House liaison between President Bill Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) . Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) , herself a former speaker who oversaw similar joint meetings for foreign guests , said the management of the invitation was \u201c inappropriate \u201d and Boehner risks squandering his power in a fit of \u201c hubris . \u201d\nBut privately , Democrats admit too that this White House \u2014 as seen in the South Korea episode \u2014 is no innocent . And Jackson , who has served at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue , said he is baffled that the administration should talk now about \u201c protocol \u201d after being so quick to exert its executive power to run over Congress .\n\u201c This is not the first time where they got cross-wise thinking the House was not an equal branch , \u201d Jackson said . \u201c When I heard about this , I shook my head . \u201d\nFor sure , the American political family has always fought but the tradition used to be \u2014 not in front of company .\nIn the past 140 years , there have been 114 such joint meetings of Congress to hear speeches from guests , events that are typically arranged to be celebratory or to exhort the nation toward some common cause .\nLech Walesa of Poland and South Africa \u2019 s Nelson Mandela were two famous speakers for example . Britain \u2019 s Winston Churchill came three times , including two wartime appearances where he bonded with Congress as \u201c a child \u201d himself of the House of Commons .\nChurchill \u2019 s 1941 appearance early in World War II was held in the Senate chamber not the House . Powerful lights were added and radio microphones . \u201c The United States , united as never before , have drawn the sword for freedom and cast away the scabbard , \u201d Churchill said to cheers .\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur \u2019 s famous farewell speech before Congress in April 1951 \u2014 days after being removed from his command by President Harry Truman \u2014 stands out for the divisions that surrounded it . But MacArthur was an American citizen , not a foreign head of state . Yes , the House Republican leader , Massachusetts Rep. Joe Martin , helped to drive the invitation as a way to attack Truman , but the joint meeting took the acquiescence of Speaker Sam Rayburn , a Texas Democrat .\nWhen this record is compared with current events , two changes most stand out .\nFirst that Boehner , who typically yields to presidents on matters of foreign policy , has reached such a level of frustration where he has taken this step . Second , the acrimony in Washington has become so infectious that the Israeli leadership feels free to capitalize on the situation and also cut Obama out of the loop .\nBoehner \u2019 s office said the idea of inviting Netanyahu originated with the speaker \u2014 not the Israeli side . But the announcement capped \u201c weeks \u201d of talks , often through Netanyahu \u2019 s close advisor , Ron Dermer , who became Israel \u2019 s ambassador to Washington in 2013 and enjoys close ties with Republicans .\n\u201c The well-established protocol is that the leader of a foreign country would be in touch with the leader of this country about a possible visit . That didn \u2019 t occur , \u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters . \u201c We did learn of this invitation shortly before it was announced . We were informed of the invitation by the Speaker \u2019 s office . So it was not the Israeli government that had contacted the administration . \u201d\nAll this is happening at a time when Obama is at a crucial stage in what have been tense negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program . Boehner is said to be immensely frustrated with what he sees as the White House \u2019 s failure to keep him more apprised of its thinking . And by inviting Netanyahu , he has turned over the microphone to a prominent critic of the administration \u2019 s foreign policy in the Mideast .\nTo try to soften the edges , Netanyahu \u2019 s visit \u2014 first announced by Boehner for February 11 \u2014 has been pushed back to March 3 . This moves it closer to the March 17 elections in Israel and at the beginning of a two-week period when free air time is allotted to the parties . It also allows the prime minister to say he is responding to what has been a long-standing invite from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the heavily Jewish , pro-Israel lobby which will be holding its annual meeting in Washington then as well .\nBut the closest parallel to the current situation may be the joint meeting that never happened in 1987 , when an invitation was proposed , then dropped for Mikhail Gorbachev , who oversaw the dissolution of the former Soviet Union .\nLike today , the White House was in delicate arms-control talks in which the foreign guest had a stake in the outcome . Gorbachev was due in Washington for a December 1987 summit with President Ronald Reagan . And fresh from election victories in 1986 , Democrats saw it as a chance to speed progress toward some resolution .\nSpeaker Jim Wright ( D-Tex . ) had led a delegation to Moscow in the spring of 1987 where he had been allowed to give a televised speech . And Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd ( D-W.Va. ) promoted the idea of Gorbachev \u2013 accompanied by Reagan himself \u2014 appearing before Congress .\nIndeed , some inside the Reagan administration were intrigued by the invite \u2014 if it would lead to an opportunity for Reagan to address the Russian people . But conservative House Republicans \u2014 including the future Vice President Dick Cheney \u2014 were distrustful of Wright and strongly objected . And by mutual agreement the proposal was dropped to avoid what Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R-Kans . ) warned could be an \u201c ugly scene \u201d in Congress .\nOf course , Netanyahu represents a strong American ally , not a former enemy like Gorbachev . But the bigger difference may be that leaders in Congress and the White House actually talked to one another back then vs. the silences today .\nReading all of Earnest \u2019 s public comments on the controversy this past week , it was more the lack of notice than consultation which rubbed raw . And as a general rule , the White House doesn \u2019 t want to be in a position of approving or vetoing the guests which Congress chooses .\nThomas Donilon , who was Obama \u2019 s national security advisor when Boehner first invited Netanyahu in 2011 , recalls Jackson \u2019 s call to him but said he meant no slight by not taking a position on the visit . \u201c The speaker \u2019 s office did notify us , \u201d Donilon said . \u201c I indicated it was their decision . I appreciated them checking with us but it was our view it was their decision \u2026 I don \u2019 t think we gave them a judgment one way or the other . \u201d\nIn the case of South Korea , Donilon said he had no recollection of the White House promising in advance that Lee Myung-bak \u2014 who was then the country \u2019 s president \u2014 would have a chance to speak to Congress . But Jackson \u2019 s account is largely confirmed by Senate Democrats , who found themselves in the same box amid the scramble to complete trade pacts for not just South Korea but also Panama and Colombia in the fall of 2011 .\nLee did get his chance , appearing before Congress in October 2011 .
