    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) On Thursday , President Donald Trump added to his list of dubious or inaccurate coronavirus-related medical claims , dangerously suggesting at a White House briefing that ingesting disinfectant could possibly be used to treat people who have the virus .\nTrump also suggested sunlight might be a treatment alternative and issued a false denial when asked why he has stopped promoting the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment , incorrectly saying , `` I have n't at all . '' He referred to how `` we started with a broken test '' without explaining that the faulty initial test was created during his presidency , this year .\nAnd Trump said that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden does not want to debate because of the coronavirus , though Biden has consistently expressed an eagerness to debate Trump even if it can not be in person .\nAfter Bill Bryan , the acting undersecretary of science and technology for the Department of Homeland Security , explained during the briefing that new experiments show the coronavirus does not fare well under sunlight or heat , the President suggested that Americans who have the virus could treat it by going out into the sunlight on a hot day .\n`` There 's been a rumor that -- you know , a very nice rumor -- that you go outside in the sun or you have heat and it does have an effect on other viruses , '' Trump said , before asking coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx `` to speak to the medical doctors to see if there 's any way that you can apply light and heat to cure , you know , if you could . ''\nTrump then asked Birx if she `` ever heard of the heat and the light '' having an impact on viruses . She responded , `` Not as a treatment , '' before Trump asked her again to look into it .\nLater , Trump again directed Birx to look into the potential for sunlight to be a cure .\n`` I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there 's any way that you can apply light and heat to cure , you know , if you could . And maybe you can , maybe you ca n't . ''\nAfter Bryan talked about experiments in which , he said , disinfectants like bleach and isopropyl alcohol quickly killed the virus , Trump mused about whether disinfectants could be used to treat the virus in humans -- asking whether there is `` a way we can do something like that , by injection inside or almost a cleaning . ''\nFacts First : As Birx told Trump directly , and as medical experts said after the briefing , sunlight is n't a potential treatment for coronavirus . Neither are disinfectants that are used to clean non-human surfaces ; Food and Drug Administration chief Dr. Stephen Hahn told CNN 's Anderson Cooper later Thursday , `` I certainly would n't recommend the internal ingestion of a disinfectant . ''\nThis bizarre exchange is the latest example of Trump grasping for a quick fix for the pandemic , after he previously suggested it might `` go away '' in warm weather and that anti-malaria pills could be a `` game-changer . ''\nThe Reckitt Benckiser Group , which produces Lysol , flatly said on its website that `` under no circumstance '' should disinfectant be administered into the human body . Washington state 's emergency management agency warned against eating Tide pods or injecting disinfectant , tweeting , `` do n't make a bad situation worse . ''\nImmediately after the briefing , two doctors told CNN 's Erin Burnett that Trump 's comments did not make medical sense and warned against taking his suggestions seriously .\n`` Very little of what the President said as it pertains to disinfection or phototherapy makes any sense , '' said Dr. Jonathan Reiner , a cardiologist at The George Washington University Hospital who advised the White House during President George W. Bush 's tenure . `` Look , everyone wants a quick fix . And the President clearly wants a quick fix ; we all do . But there are no quick fixes . We have to do this the right way ; we have to do this with science . ''\nDr. Megan Ranney , an emergency physician who works at Rhode Island Hospital/Brown University , also batted down the President 's suggestion and warned that trying it could cause sunburn , skin cancer or other dangerous consequences .\n`` Going out in the sun or exposing yourself to these high-intensity UV lamps is not going to protect you from Covid-19 , '' she said on CNN . `` I do n't want people to think that this is another miracle cure . ''\nTrump 's statement echoes myths and rumors that got so rampant on the internet and in social media that the World Health Organization posted a myth busters pages to debunk them .\n`` Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease , '' WHO says on its website . `` You can catch COVID-19 , no matter how sunny or hot the weather is . Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19 , '' it adds .\nAt Thursday 's briefing , Trump issued a false denial when asked why he has stopped his promotion of hydroxychloroquine , an anti-malaria drug that he embraces as a potential cure for coronavirus .\n`` I have n't at all , '' the President said , before asking the reporter , `` Why do you say I have ? ''\nFacts First : Trump has significantly tamped down his rhetoric about the drug in the past week , compared with his comments in March , according to a CNN analysis\nIn March and early April , the President name-dropped hydroxychloroquine almost daily , and he mentioned it dozens of times at White House briefings , according to the CNN tally . He incorrectly implied it was safe to treat Covid-19 , encouraged Americans to `` try it '' and said it might be the biggest breakthrough in modern medicine .\n`` What do you have to lose ? '' he asked during a briefing in April .\nBut he has n't mentioned the drug by name -- or touted its effectiveness -- in more than a week .\nTrump stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine around the time that a series of studies came back with negative results . New research from Brazil , France and veterans ' hospitals in the US indicate that the drug might not help patients with the coronavirus , and might even have deadly side effects .\nFor the second day in a row , the President also said he did n't see the study of US veterans ' hospitals , even though he was asked about it both days and it has been covered heavily in the mainstream media .\nAbout the research into the drug , Trump said , `` We had a lot of very good results and we had some results that perhaps are n't so good . '' It 's true that there were some studies earlier this year with promising results for Covid-19 . But public health experts said that much of that research was anecdotal , and the publisher of a study that Trump repeatedly cited now says there were serious flaws with the trial\nTrump claimed that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is `` a guy who does n't want to do debates because of Covid . ''\nFacts First : This is misleading . In late March , two weeks before Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary , Biden said he was focused on the pandemic crisis and did not think there should be another debate against Sanders , over whom he had an overwhelming delegate lead . But Biden has never said he does not want to debate Trump in particular , because of the virus or for any other reason . Rather , Biden has consistently expressed eagerness to debate Trump even if it is not in person -- saying at a fundraiser earlier on Thursday that `` I can hardly wait to debate Donald Trump . Are you kidding ? ''\nAccording to a pool report from Washington Post reporter Annie Linskey , Biden then added : `` Look , I 'm ready to debate him . Zoom or Skype or Slack or Hangouts or in person , anytime , anywhere he wants . ''\nBiden made a similar comment in an interview on March 31 , Bloomberg News reported : `` I 'm ready to debate President Trump on Zoom or Skype anytime he wants . ''\n`` I can hardly wait to get him on a debate stage , '' Biden said on ABC 's `` The View '' in February .\n`` Come on , Mr. President . I can hardly wait , '' he told CNN 's Anderson Cooper in early March .\nThis story has been updated with the notion of disinfectants as a treatment and with information from the World Health Organization refuting the idea of using sunlight .",
