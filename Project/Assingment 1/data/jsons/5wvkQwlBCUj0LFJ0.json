    "content": "When Joshua Bass , an engineer , sent his son to iSchool High , a Houston charter school , he was expecting a solid college preparation , including the chance to study some college courses before leaving high school . Instead , the Basses were shocked when their son came home from the taxpayer-funded school with apparently religiously motivated anti-science books .\nOne of these books blamed Darwin \u2019 s theory of evolution for the Holocaust :\n[ Hitler ] has written that the Aryan ( German ) race would be the leader in all human progress . To accomplish that goal , all \u201c lower races \u201d should either be enslaved or eliminated . Apparently the theory of evolution and its \u201c survival of the fittest \u201d philosophy had taken root in Hitler \u2019 s warped mind .\nFor Joshua , attacks on science in the classroom were unacceptable . Joshua began to research ResponsiveEd , the curriculum used at iSchool High . It emerged that ResponsiveEd was founded by Donald R. Howard , former owner of ACE ( Accelerated Christian Education ) . ACE is a fundamentalist curriculum that teaches young-Earth creationism as fact . Last year it hit headlines because one of its high school science books taught that the Loch Ness Monster was real , and that this was evidence against evolution .\nResponsiveEd is the latest in a long line of concerns raised over the religious affiliations of charter schools . Civil libertarians have raised concerns over Jewish schools converting to charter status . In 2010 , more than 20 percent of Texas charter schools reportedly had a religious affiliation . And ResponsiveEd aims to expand further .\nAfter Howard left ACE in the 1990s , he founded Eagle Project charter schools , which became Responsive Education Solutions , or ResponsiveEd , in 2007 . ACE \u2019 s selling point was that it integrated Bible lessons into every academic subject . ResponsiveEd planned to do the same , but without the explicitly religious basis . Howard told the Wall Street Journal in 1998 : \u201c Take the Ten Commandments \u00ad\u2013 you can rework those as a success principle by rewording them . We will call it truth , we will call it principles , we will call it values . We will not call it religion. \u201d But in Joshua Bass ' mind , at iSchool High , his son was taught religion in class .\nCharter schools receive public funding but operate privately . While promoting creationist science is deemed unconstitutional in public schools , ResponsiveEd charter schools appear able to challenge mainstream science in the classroom .\nResponsiveEd says it has 60 schools in Texas , with an extended charter to open 20 more by 2014 . It also has facilities in Arkansas , and plans to open in Indiana . Amazingly , it isn \u2019 t the only charter school curriculum based on Accelerated Christian Education \u2019 s format .\nParadigm Accelerated Curriculum ( PAC ) was founded by former ACE vice president Ronald E. Johnson . Where ACE is an \u201c individualized , accelerated \u201d curriculum based on the \u201c five laws of learning , \u201d PAC is an \u201c accelerated individualized \u201d curriculum based on the \u201c six principles of learning. \u201d Like ACE and ResponsiveEd , it questions the theory of evolution and presents the \u201c catastrophist theory \u201d of Noah \u2019 s Ark as a credible rival explanation . Like ResponsiveEd , PAC teaches that the theory of evolution influenced Hitler to create the Third Reich . It also relies on the traditional creationist argument of `` gaps \u201d in the fossil record :\nDarwinism claims that humans gradually and mysteriously evolved from non-living materials . Some critics humorously claim that evolution proposes a philosophy of \u201c from goo to you by way of the zoo. \u201d [ \u2026 ] Evolutionists insist that their theory must be right and that missing fossil evidence is merely the result of a flawed fossil record ; the catastrophists insist that evolutionists have not exercised the scientific method of discovery and therefore have little real scientific evidence to prove their theory .\nIn another chapter , the PAC science materials use examples in history where science has been wrong \u2013 geocentrism , phlogiston , an obsolete theory that attempted to explain burning processes , and ancient Egyptian superstitions ( such as using fly excreta to treat tumors ) \u2013 to undermine the authority of science in general :\nMany other historical blunders of science could be mentioned . What we need to keep in mind is that scientists are human beings .
