To put that into context , in the second biggest outbreak in history\u2014which took place in 1976 in Zaire\u2014only 11 medical personnel died . And that was the first recorded outbreak in history , when measures to prevent transmission of the virus were n't well established .\nFirst , we need to look at the total numbers affected . In 1976 , the death toll was 280 and there were 318 reported cases . In this 2014 outbreak , there have already been 729 deaths and the number of reported cases has reached 1,323 . As a point of comparison , that means this outbreak is four times larger than the 1976 flair up .\nIt 's also more geographically dispersed . Previous outbreaks typically occurred in one remote area . Today , Ebola has reached rural and urban areas in Guinea , Liberia , Sierra Leone , and Nigeria . So the numbers of people affected are unprecedented , and therefore the proportion of health-care workers impacted is sadly going to be larger .\nWe do . Since the disease is transmitted through direct exposure to bodily fluids\u2014from vomit to blood and sweat\u2014health-care workers are advised to wear face masks , goggles , gowns and gloves while caring for patients .\nThe trouble is , health workers in the developing-country context\u2014especially those working in some of the poorest countries on earth , where the disease emerged this time\u2014do n't always have access to this protective gear .\nIt 's important to note that they are also the ones who have died in this outbreak . Of the 60 deaths so far , none involved foreign workers ( though two Americans are currently battling the virus , and one is a doctor ) . Foreign aid agencies such as Doctors Without Borders\u2014which apply stringent precautions for all their health personnel\u2014have never lost members of their teams to Ebola .

In 1976, the death toll was 280 and there were 318 reported cases. In this 2014 outbreak, there have already been 729 deaths and the number of reported cases has reached 1,323.

Today, Ebola has reached rural and urban areas in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. So the numbers of people affected are unprecedented, and therefore the proportion of health-care workers impacted is sadly going to be larger.\n\nBut don't we know how to protect health workers?\n\nWe do. Since the disease is transmitted through direct exposure to bodily fluids\u2014from vomit to blood and sweat\u2014health-care workers are advised to wear face masks, goggles, gowns and gloves while caring for patients.\n\n\n\nThe trouble is, health workers in the developing-country context\u2014especially those working in some of the poorest countries on earth, where the disease emerged this time\u2014don't always have access to this protective gear.\n\nIt's important to note that they are also the ones who have died in this outbreak.
