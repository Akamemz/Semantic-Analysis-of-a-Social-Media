Delaware and Minnesota 's recently passed laws take effect this summer .\nIt is estimated about 120,000 legally married homosexual couples live in the United States .\nThere is division within the ranks of both sides about whether the high court will or even should issue a sea-change ruling on the constitutional `` equal protection '' question .\nSome activists and politicians -- even some justices -- think the elected branches may be in a better position to drive the same-sex marriage issue , not the courts .\n`` For those hoping the Supreme Court will say there is a broad right for same-sex couples to be married , they 're likely to be disappointed , '' said Thomas Goldstein , SCOTUSblog.com publisher and a Washington lawyer .\n`` In the end , probably the wording of the decision will give more momentum to those states that are recognizing those rights but it wo n't force them to do so . ''\nOne involves an appeal of the Defense of Marriage Act , which was approved by Congress in 1996 and defines marriage as that between a man and a women . It says in part that legally married same-sex couples can not enjoy the range of financial and other benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples .\nEdie Windsor , an 84-year-old New York woman , is the key plaintiff . She was forced to pay extra estate taxes when her longtime spouse , Thea Spyer , died .\nThe court has set itself up to `` punt '' on both Proposition 8 and defense of marriage , avoiding for now consideration of the constitutional questions .\nThis legal letdown could turn on `` standing , '' or the legal authority or eligibility to make the case .\nCalifornia 's governor has refused to defend Proposition 8 in court , leaving a coalition of private groups to step in before the courts .\nCan they establish a legitimate `` harm '' to satisfy court scrutiny ?\nThe justices could also `` DIG '' it -- or have the case `` dismissed as improvidently granted . '' Basically , the justices would be saying they should not have taken the appeal in the first place .\n`` If the issue is letting the states experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction , why is taking a case now the answer ? '' Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked at March oral arguments .\nSome of her conservative colleagues seemed to agree as well .\nWhether on standing or `` DIG '' grounds , the differences are important .\n`` 'Digging '' would likely mean lower court rulings striking down Proposition 8 would hold , allowing California gay and lesbian couples to marry if they choose . How quickly that would happen is unclear if further legal challenges are filed .\nBut a `` standing '' ruling would likely nullify everything , perhaps forcing both sides to start all over again in the lower courts , and limiting the reach of gay marriage to perhaps only a few California counties .\nAnother likely statewide referendum next year could preempt the legal battles and finally settle the matter , at least in that state .\nRecent polls show growing support for same-sex marriage in California , a trend reflected nationwide .\nSo , the court really has four options to rule on Proposition 8 and same-sex marriage supporters believe in each scenario , they would win .\nLawyers for the two couples at the center of the fight are cautiously optimistic , with the emphasis on `` cautiously . ''\n`` Trying to read too much into to those questions is a risky proposition , '' attorney David Boies told CNN . `` The court is exploring all four of these options . ''\nBut backers of Proposition 8 think the court will want to stay of the political fight , and allow the measure to stand , at least for now .\n`` A victory for us means to issue returns to the people , to the legislatures , and to the elected representatives -- where this debate belongs , '' said Charles Cooper , the lawyer who argued at the Supreme Court for Proposition 8 .\nThe federal law , DOMA , has its own sticky procedural questions .\nPresident Barack Obama now believes the federal law is unconstitutional , and has refused to defend it in court .\nTraditionally that role would fall to the solicitor general 's office . That executive refusal raised the question of whether any party could now rightfully step in and defend the law -- the idea being in any such fight you need opposing sides with a valid stake in the outcome .\nCongressional Republicans , operating officially as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives , took over the role normally filled by the Justice Department .\n`` Without the House 's participation , '' said attorney Paul Clement , representing House leaders , `` it is hard to see how there is any case or controversy here at all . Both Ms. Windsor and the executive [ branch ] agree that DOMA is unconstitutional and that Ms. Windsor was entitled to a [ tax ] refund . And the lower courts granted them all the relief they requested . Only the House 's intervention provides the adverseness that Article III [ federal court jurisdiction ] demands . ''\nThe court could dismiss that case on standing grounds , but most legal analysts see a more substantive ruling on the merits .\nConfusing enough ? Legal experts , government and private lawyers , and the blogosphere have been waging a war of words in recent months , expressing varying amounts of certainty of what the court will do when deciding those questions .\nBut inside the court , there are no hints . It is familiar refrain among its nine members over the Washington parlor game of guessing the outcomes : `` At the Supreme Court , those who know , do n't talk . And those who talk , do n't know .

The U.S. Supreme Court is taking up the issue of same-sex marriage in two momentous cases on Tuesday, March 26, and Wednesday, March 27. In the California one, the court will be asked to decide whether same-sex couples have a right to marry despite the passage of a state referendum against it. In the other, the parties will argue over the Defense of Marriage Act, which forbids the recognition of same-sex marriages nationwide and bars married gay and lesbian couples from receiving federal benefits.
