Beto O \u2019 Rourke joined the 2020 presidential race Thursday , aiming to parlay his turn as one of the Democratic stars of the 2018 midterm elections into a run at his party \u2019 s nomination .\nMr. O \u2019 Rourke is the 15th Democrat to enter the contest . He joins the race as an instant first-tier candidate , commanding an online donor network second in size only to the one Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders carried over from his 2016 presidential effort .\n\u201c I \u2019 m running to serve you as president of the United States of America , \u201d Mr. O \u2019 Rourke said in a video his campaign released Thursday morning .\nMr. O \u2019 Rourke made his first campaign stops Thursday in southeast Iowa , in towns along the Mississippi River that backed Democratic President Obama in 2012 and flipped to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump in 2016 . Much as he did in his 2018 run against Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz , Mr. O \u2019 Rourke presented himself as a Democrat looking to work with Republicans and to seek solutions he said would transcend partisan appeal .\nWho \u2019 s Running in the 2020 Election ? The 2020 Democratic presidential primary is the party \u2019 s biggest and most diverse in modern history . Meet the candidates .\n\u201c Let us not allow our differences to define us at this moment , \u201d Mr. O \u2019 Rourke told a crowd of about 150 people at the Beancounter coffee shop in Burlington . \u201c History calls for us to come together , to show ourselves , our fellow Americans , the generations that follow , what we are made of and what we can do . And the only way to get that done is to get it done together . \u201d\nThe 2020 presidential field is dominated by Democrats who have won statewide office as a senator or governor . He enters the race more than two months after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren became the first candidate to kick off a campaign Dec. 31 . Since then , Sens .

Former Vice President Joe Biden is widely expected to formalize his campaign in the coming weeks .\nWhile Mr. O \u2019 Rourke visited Iowa on Thursday , Mr. Biden and Stacey Abrams , both of whom are weighing presidential bids , met privately in Washington , D.C. Ms. Abrams , who was narrowly defeated in her race for Georgia governor last year , also met for breakfast Thursday with Ms. Gillibrand .

Mr. O \u2019 Rourke lost by less than 3 percentage points while raising $ 80 million , smashing Senate fundraising records .\nAlong the way Mr. O \u2019 Rourke , 46 years old , transformed himself from a relatively anonymous congressman with few legislative accomplishments under his belt into a Democratic folk hero . In the final days of the Senate campaign , celebrities such as basketball star LeBron James and singer Beyonc\u00e9 sported hats bearing Mr. O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s black-and-white campaign logo .\nMany Democrats say Mr. O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s appeal lies in his authenticity , pointing to his live-streaming broadcasts of mundane elements of his campaign , such as filling the campaign van with gasoline and driving across vast reaches of Texas , during his stops at all 254 of the state \u2019 s counties . The Senate campaign didn \u2019 t employ a pollster , though it relied on other data about Texas voters .\nMr. O \u2019 Rourke , who drew thousands of people to his events in Texas last year , aimed to meet with small audiences during his initial Iowa circuit , an aide said .
