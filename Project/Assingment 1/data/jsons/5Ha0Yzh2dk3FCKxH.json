    "content": "The country 's most prominent fact checkers fought a losing battle against the flood of fake news during the presidential campaign . Now , they say , they have one great hope for preventing an even greater wave of propaganda masquerading as news : Facebook .\nFact checkers say they need the social network in their corner as Donald Trump , a frequent purveyor of misinformation himself , prepares to inherit the White House \u2014 and , with it , the world 's biggest megaphone .\nFacebook has come under withering criticism for allowing the dissemination of egregiously fake stories during the campaign , with widely shared headlines falsely reporting that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump \u2019 s candidacy and that an FBI agent involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation was dead in a murder-suicide . CEO Mark Zuckerberg , after first scoffing that fake news helped swing the election to Trump , has pledged to \u201c take misinformation seriously , '' though he gave no timeline for action and warned about the dangers of his company becoming an arbiter of the truth .\nBut fact-check organizations \u2014 which diligently reported lies and exaggerations during the campaign , only to see their work overshadowed by false headlines \u2014 argue that only Facebook has the reach and influence to address the free flow of fake news . And they are pushing the company to make changes now , as the weeks tick down to Trump 's inauguration .\n`` Facebook has completely turbo-powered fake news sites , '' says Alexios Mantzarlis , director and editor of the Poynter Institute 's International Fact-Checking Network . `` But it 's also probably the first platform that could measure how these things spread , and how we could push back . ''\nShortly after Election Day , the `` Big Three '' in American fact checking \u2014 PolitiFact , a project of the Tampa Bay Times ; FactCheck.org , part of the University of Pennsylvania 's Annenberg Public Policy Center ; and the Washington Post 's Fact Checker \u2014 posted an letter to Zuckerberg calling on him to `` start an open conversation on the principles that could underpin a more accurate news ecosystem on its News Feed . ''\nNow fact checkers are getting down to specifics about how Facebook should tackle blatantly fraudulent news .\nFact checkers say they need the social network in their corner as Donald Trump , a frequent purveyor of misinformation himself , prepares to inherit the White House . | Getty\nTo start , the social network should start removing the most popular false stories from the `` News Feed '' that fills users ' home screens on the site , says Mantzarlis . He argues that kind of filtering would have far-reaching effects , because some of the most popular pure hoaxes are reposted and clicked on hundreds of thousands of times , sometimes circulating for years .\n`` Let 's not underestimate how important it is to act on the biggest fakes , '' Matzarlis says .\nTo identify those stories , Facebook could rely on the human curators who \u2014 despite headlines saying Facebook had gone to a completely automated system \u2014 still keep an eye on the company-produced `` Trending '' box on the site , he says . `` If something 's been demonstrated to be inaccurate '' by the trending team , `` then yank it out of News Feed , '' he says , adding such stories could still appear on people 's individual pages but be marked with `` a big red badge '' as fake .\nAnother option , says Eugene Kiely , director of FactCheck.org , is to pair fake stories with prominent fact checks , just as many websites today attach `` Related Stories '' to a particular headline .\n`` I 'm concerned about how you go about removing material from these social media sites , because I think it 's kind of a dangerous area to get into , '' says Kiely . `` But if there 's an article about [ first lady Michelle Obama 's mother ] Marian Robinson getting a pension for watching her grandchildren in the White House for eight years , there 'd be a related item item right underneath it saying , 'No , grandma 's not getting a pension . ' ''\nZuckerberg initially responded to criticism by saying it 's a `` pretty crazy idea '' that fake news on the social network had an impact on the election . But in a follow-up post on the topic , he outlined a series of projects the company has underway to deal with fake news , including building better technical systems to detect false stories and `` disrupting fake news economics '' by cutting off ad revenue .\n\u201c We take misinformation very seriously . We are aware of and have been working on addressing this problem for the past few years , '' a Facebook spokeswoman said when asked for comment . `` We know we have more work to do and we \u2019 re hoping we can continue to rely on our community to help us understand what is and is not fake news . \u201d\nThe fake news issue has shown no signs of dissipating since the election .

The gunman told police he `` wanted to see for himself '' if the restaurant was `` harboring child sex slaves '' \u2014 although he acknowledged in a jailhouse interview with The New York Times that \u201c the intel on this wasn \u2019 t 100 percent . \u201d\nAgainst that backdrop , the fact checkers are pressing Facebook to take concrete steps to identify and weed out hoaxes .\nView Clinton decries fake news 'epidemic ' Hillary Clinton talks about news on Thursday .\nThe social network could do a better job enlisting its millions of U.S. users to flag false stories , Mantzarlis said .
