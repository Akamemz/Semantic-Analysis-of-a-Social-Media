The report culled data from the New York Police Department and found that while African-American suspects had been arrested in 54 percent of murders , 55 percent of thefts and 49 percent of assaults , television stations including WCBS , WNBC , WABC and WNYW have featured coverage of crimes that are predominantly committed by black people .
