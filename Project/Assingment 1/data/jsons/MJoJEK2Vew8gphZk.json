    "content": "The big broom of history has been clearing out the rubble this month , furiously sweeping away at some of the most enduring racist symbols still in American stores and restaurants .\n\u25baThe Aunt Jemima pancake mix brand got brushed into the dustbin after 131 years when its owner , Quaker Oats , acknowledged it was based on a racial stereotype .\n\u25baSambo \u2019 s restaurant in Santa Barbara , California , the last store in a chain that started in 1957 , dropped its name after being pressured to account for the racist history behind it .\n\u25baUncle Ben \u2019 s rice , Mrs. Butterworth \u2019 s syrup and Cream of Wheat porridge also have used imagery that has connoted smiling Black servitude to white masters . Those stereotyped images are being changed or reviewed , according to the companies that own those brands \u2013 all part of a corporate reckoning that experts say has been a long time coming .\n\u201c Better late than never , but these images have caused a lot of damage for a long period of time , and that should not be forgotten , \u201d said Todd Boyd , professor of race and pop culture at the University of Southern California .\nThe housecleaning flows from the May 25 death of George Floyd , a Black man , under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis , a moment that sparked nationwide protests and splashed up a torrent of indignation over police brutality and racial inequality . The resulting waves since have washed over American businesses , where some ( mostly white ) customers have wondered what breakfast food has to do with any of this all of a sudden .\nChanging images : Eskimo Pie , Aunt Jemima , Uncle Ben 's and Cream of Wheat are changing . Are the Washington Redskins next ?\nThe images on the packaging of Uncle Ben \u2019 s , Aunt Jemima , Cream of Wheat and Mrs. Butterworth \u2019 s all are variations of the Black cook or \u201c mammy \u201d figure , a racial theme that reinforced the cruel power dynamic of the slave-trading antebellum South and the Jim Crow segregation that replaced it . That \u2019 s when Black servants worked for white owners and were forcibly kept in their segregated places , all while they were supposed to be happy about it , according to the white ruling class .\n\u201c When you open that box in the morning , you see this happy mammy face , \u201d said Rita Roberts , professor of history and Africana studies at Scripps College in Claremont , California . \u201c No matter if you put pearls on her , it \u2019 s still a happy Black woman content where she is . Even if I \u2019 m a really poor white person , it tells me how superior I am to that , and I can be comforted , that I can have this incredible innocence about not even taking any responsibility for why that Black woman \u2019 s face is on there and why I \u2019 m being served , because I can eat my breakfast and just have this constant reminder . \u201d\nRoberts likens it to the separate water fountains for Black and white people in the Jim Crow South , another \u201c constant reminder of white superiority . \u201d\nThese images also perpetuated harmful stereotypes about Black Americans that soon became slurs that are still in use today . A white boy calling a Black girl an \u201c Aunt Jemima \u201d never was a compliment . Nor was it on Twitter this week , when some white users tried to mock Georgia politician Stacey Abrams by saying that Abrams could replace the departed Jemima . Abrams , who is Black , is a former state lawmaker with multiple college degrees , including a law degree from Yale , and is widely considered a potential running mate for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden .\n\u201c Older generation of Southerners genuinely liked their black nannies , cooks \u2013 I remember ! \u201d a Twitter user identified as Peter Brimelow wrote June 17 . \u201c Replacing Aunt Jemima with Stacy ( sic ) Abrams won \u2019 t have quite the same effect . \u201d\nReinforced by such images , similar racial attitudes benefited corporate America and the white capitalist class at the expense of Black labor . Slavery , obviously , was highly profitable for plantations because the cost of labor was essentially zero after purchasing the slaves and providing their room and board .\nAfter slavery , the racial divide between white and nonwhite workers further benefited corporate America by keeping the cost of labor down . If poor white laborers could be convinced to identify more with white business owners than with fellow nonwhite workers , that reduced the risk that white and nonwhite labor will join together to demand better wages and working conditions .\n\u201c The notion of maintaining control of labor is absolutely essential for understanding the perpetuation of white supremacy , \u201d Roberts told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nRacism , in this sense , keeps poor white workers down as well as nonwhite workers , dividing them and distracting them from the power they could realize if they banded together , Roberts said . President Lyndon Johnson , who signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , recognized this dynamic in a famous quote .\n\u201c If you can convince the lowest white man he 's better than the best colored man , he wo n't notice you 're picking his pocket , \u201d he said . \u201c Hell , give him somebody to look down on , and he 'll empty his pockets for you .
