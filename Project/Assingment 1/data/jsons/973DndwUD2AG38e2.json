    "content": "When President Obama called for two years of free community college , he also argued that nearly everyone should attend \u2014 that education should extend not to the 12th grade but to the 14th . The goal , he said , is to make `` two years of college \u2026 as free and universal in America as high school is today . ''\nSome critics scolded Obama for emphasizing the importance of college over other paths . The plan `` bows to elites , '' wrote Megan McArdle : `` Education is a very good thing , but it is not the only good thing . An indiscriminate focus on pushing more people into the system is no cure for society 's ills . ''\nBut supporters and opponents of the plan both missed something big . Free community college would n't create an era of universal college enrollment because that era is already here . So many high school graduates go on to college already that it 's unclear how much free tuition would boost attendance rates .\nThe real question is whether free community college can get kids through the door and signed up for their first higher-ed class . The big unknown is whether it can help more students graduate .\nGoing to college in the United States is already a nearly universal experience . By the time the high school class of 2004 turned 26 , eight years after high school graduation , 86 percent had enrolled in college , according to an analysis of a nationally representative study from the William T.
