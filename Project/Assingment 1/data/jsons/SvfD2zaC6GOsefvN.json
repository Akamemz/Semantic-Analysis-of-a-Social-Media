But one of its most unprecedented \u2013 some would say shocking \u2013 aspects is the way the blustery billionaire keeps promising to do things that are likely beyond the limits of presidential authority set by the Constitution of the United States .\nHis supporters thrill to Mr. Trump \u2019 s promise of raw power , of course . Tearing up treaties , torturing terrorists , threatening Muslims \u2013 all are huge applause lines at Trump rallies . President Obama is already stretching the legal bounds of his office , many Republicans insist . Trump would be just going Democrats one better .\nBut others think Trump \u2019 s talk raises important questions about the extent to which he could threaten American law and democratic norms . The most likely change might not involve out-and-out authoritarianism as much as a coarsening of acceptable US political behavior . Trump proposals that seem startling now \u2013 such as killing terrorists \u2019 spouses \u2013 might be less so after years of a Trump administration .\n\u201c What would be activated would be a normalization of certain kind of things ... The law might not change but the attitude would , \u201d says Andrew Rudalevige , a professor of government at Bowdoin College in Brunswick , Maine , and author of \u201c The New Imperial Presidency . \u201d\nMany of Trump \u2019 s more outrageous proposals involve enemies , perceived and real .\nTake the media . ( Please , as Trump might paraphrase Henny Youngman . ) Trump , who has barred organizations such as The Washington Post and Politico from covering his campaign events after coverage he deemed unfair , has promised to loosen libel laws to make it easier to sue media companies . Never mind the First Amendment , or that Congress is the body of government that actually writes laws .\nThen there \u2019 s US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel , who is overseeing a pair of class action lawsuits charging the defunct Trump University with fraud . Trump \u2019 s personal and racial attacks on the US-born judge show a high degree of disregard for judicial independence , say critics , especially his insistence that somebody should \u201c look into \u201d Curiel \u2019 s background . If elected , how will Trump deal with losses in personal business or executive branch litigation ?\nTrump \u2019 s been particularly bombastic about what he \u2019 d do in terms of national security . He insists he \u2019 d target the wives and children of terrorists \u2013 a deliberate killing of civilian bystanders . Former CIA director Michael Hayden has said that if Trump orders such action the US military would likely refuse , setting off a dispute that could spiral into a constitutional crisis . Trump has also said numerous times that he would reinstitute waterboarding of terror suspects , or \u201c worse . \u201d\n\u201c That \u2019 s a really troubling thing . Waterboarding is torture , pretty clear . And if waterboarding is torture it violates criminal law , \u201d says Chris Edelson , an assistant professor of government at American University in Washington and author of \u201c Power Without Constraint : The Post 9/11 Presidency and National Security . \u201d\nAs for Trump \u2019 s proposed ban on Muslim immigrants entering the US , that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 pass constitutional muster .
