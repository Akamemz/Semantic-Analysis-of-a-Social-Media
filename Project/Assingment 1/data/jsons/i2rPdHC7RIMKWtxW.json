In fact, the SAFE Act was drafted so hastily that legislators failed to exclude law enforcement agents from the ban, thus making it illegal for police officers to carry semi-automatic firearms, too.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo declared the legislation the \u201ctoughest\u201d gun law in the nation, but that\u2019s nothing to be proud of. The SAFE Act is actually unconstitutional. The Supreme Court made it clear in 2008 in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects firearms in \u201ccommon use\u201d and that citizens have a right to own such firearms for self-defense.
