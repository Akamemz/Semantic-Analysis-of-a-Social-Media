LUCIE , Fla. \u2014 Mitt Romney on Monday will accuse the Obama administration of fundamentally misunderstanding the threat of radical Islam , using a major foreign-policy speech at the Virginia Military Institute to say President Obama is rejecting six decades of bipartisan consensus by not flexing more U.S. muscle on the world stage .\nAnd after delaying for nearly a month , the Republican presidential nominee will sharpen his attack about the way Mr. Obama handled the assault on American diplomatic posts in Egypt and Libya .\nAccording to excerpts , he will say the president \u2019 s first reaction was to blame an Internet video mocking Islam , and only belatedly to spot \u201c the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others . \u201d\n\u201c Hope is not a strategy , \u201d Mr. Romney will say . \u201c We can not support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds , when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut , when we have no trade agenda to speak of , and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership , but of passivity . \u201d\nMr. Romney will make the speech less than a week after resetting the race with a strong debate performance that has energized Republican voters and helped him capture the lead in polls in some of the key battleground states .\nBut Friday \u2019 s jobs report , which showed the unemployment rate dipped below 8 percent \u2014 to 7.8 percent , which is where it was when Mr. Obama took office in January 2009 \u2014 erased one of the Republican \u2019 s favorite talking points .\nThe economy has dominated the presidential race , but Iran \u2019 s nuclear program and the Sept. 11 attacks on the American Embassy in Cairo and the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya , have thrust foreign affairs into the headlines .\nMr. Obama and his advisers initially said the attacks were sparked by a video mocking the Prophet Muhammad , but have since acknowledged that the attack in Benghazi was orchestrated by terrorist elements linked to al Qaeda .\nMr. Romney will argue that Mr. Obama \u2019 s response to the attacks is emblematic of his overall approach to foreign affairs , which Mr. Romney said he will change by throwing around more American weight .\nHe said he will use foreign aid to pressure Egypt to protect democracy , will try to build the Syrian opposition and will try to restart negotiations toward a two-state solution for the Israelis and Palestinians .\n\u201c I believe that if America does not lead , others will \u2014 others who do not share our interests and our values \u2014 and the world will grow darker , for our friends and for us , \u201d he will say . \u201c America \u2019 s security and the cause of freedom can not afford four more years like the last four years . \u201d\nThe Obama campaign said Mr. Romney hasn \u2019 t shown that he is up to the task of handling foreign policy .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going to be lectured by someone who has been an unmitigated disaster on foreign policy every time he \u2019 s dipped his toe in the foreign policy waters , \u201d Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One on Sunday .\nShe recounted Mr. Romney \u2019 s summer trip to Europe and Israel , where he had to make amends for saying London didn \u2019 t seem fully prepared for what turned out to be a successful Olympics .\n\u201c The only person who has offended Europe more is probably Chevy Chase , \u201d Ms. Psaki said , referring to the actor \u2019 s comedic movie \u201c National Lampoon \u2019 s European Vacation . \u201d\nShe said Mr. Romney would not have gone after Osama bin Laden as steadfastly as Mr. Obama did , and that it \u2019 s not clear what Mr. Romney would do differently pertaining to Iran .\nThat question about specific differences has dogged Mr. Romney throughout the campaign as Democrats and even some Republicans have questioned how his tougher talk translates into specific policies .\nThe Republican \u2019 s advisers , though , said he starts from a completely different philosophy that begins with the belief that the fight against terrorism can \u2019 t be conducted surgically .\n\u201c While drones and drone attacks are worthwhile and it \u2019 s good to kill bad guys , you fundamentally misunderstand this struggle if you think that \u2019 s the answer to it , \u201d said Richard S.
