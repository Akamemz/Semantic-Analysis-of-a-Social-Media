    "title": "OPINION: What King Said About Northern Liberalism",
    "date": "2019-01-20",
    "authors": "Jeanne Theoharis",
    "content": "\u201c There is a pressing need for a liberalism in the North which is truly liberal , \u201d the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told an interracial audience in New York City in 1960 . He called for a liberalism that \u201c rises up with righteous indignation when a Negro is lynched in Mississippi , but will be equally incensed when a Negro is denied the right to live in his neighborhood . \u201d\nOn this Martin Luther King Jr. Day , it \u2019 s tempting to focus on the glaring human rights abuses , racist fear-mongering and malfeasance happening at the federal level . But taking seriously Dr. King \u2019 s critique of Northern liberalism means also calling out liberal public officials and residents who profess commitments to equality yet maintain a corrupt criminal justice system and a segregated school system . It means calling out Northern newspapers , along with Southern ones , to atone for their skewed civil rights coverage . And it means reckoning with the dangers of \u201c polite \u201d racism , as Dr. King warned , which still rings true today .\nDr. King visited New York City throughout the 1960s and called attention to its racial problems . In Harlem in 1963 , he spoke to an audience of some 15,000 white people as City College \u2019 s commencement speaker . Fewer than 2 percent of the graduates that day were black , giving visual proof to his admonition that the \u201c de facto segregation of the North was as injurious as the legal segregation of the South . \u201d\nThe next year , in a TV interview after the Harlem uprising , Dr. King called for \u201c an honest , soul-searching analysis and evaluation of the environmental causes which have spawned the riots , \u201d which started after the police killed 15-year-old Jimmy Powell . Dr. King was nearly run out of town when he dared to suggest that New York would benefit from a Civilian Complaint Review Board to oversee the Police Department .",
