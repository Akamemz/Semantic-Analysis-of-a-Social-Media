At what point do political attacks get so reckless and unhinged that you can no longer heal the divide they create with politics ? It 's hard to know exactly , but the left is getting very close . Take , for example , this exchange on MSNBC , in which frequent guest Malcolm Nance accuses the president of the United States of sending secret messages to neo-Nazis :\n`` These people feel that they are the foot soldiers and executors of the disenfranchisement that the white race is feeling , and Donald Trump is giving them subliminal orders in their head , '' Nance said .\nSubliminal orders ? Whatever Trump 's faults , you can be certain he is n't doing that . Trump is the least subliminal politician in American history . He has no subtext . If he 's thinking it , he says it . The claim is ludicrous . But at MSNBC , it was n't even the weirdest thing recently said on air . That distinction goes to Frank Figliuzzi , a former FBI official turned talking head-conspiracy nut . He used numerology to explain the president 's coded messages :\n`` It 's the little things and the language and messaging that matters , '' Figliuzzi said . `` The president said that we will fly our flags at half-mast until Aug. 8 . That 's 8/8 . Now , I 'm not going to imply that he did this deliberately , but I am using it as an example of the ignorance of the adversary that 's being demonstrated by the White House . The numbers 8 , 8 are very significant in neo-Nazi and white supremacy movement . Why ? Because the letter H is the eighth letter of the alphabet , and to them , the numbers 8 , 8 together stand for 'Heil Hitler . ''\nGot that ? Eight is a racist number . That 's MSNBC 's position . In other words , things are getting dangerously crazy on the left . How crazy ? On Monday , former Jeb Bush spokeswoman Nicolle Wallace explained that Trump is planning a genocide of Hispanic Americans :\n`` President ( Barack ) Obama used the power of the presidency to try to pass comprehensive immigration reform with the Latino community , Latino leaders at the table , '' Wallace said . `` You now have a president ... talking about exterminating Latinos . ''\n`` Exterminating Latinos . '' Keep in mind Trump got a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote than Mitt Romney did . It turns out that not all Latinos believe in open borders . A lot of them agree with Trump . And yet , the left is now telling you \u2014 and demanding that you believe \u2014 that anyone who supports Trump is a white supremacist and must be destroyed . They 're telling you that for political reasons . It 's election season , and they want more power . But there are other reasons , too .\nEver wonder why rich people seem the most hysterical on the subject ? Ever notice that it 's the highest-paid people on TV who are the most determined to convince you white supremacy is America 's biggest problem ? Why is that ? Simple : Every minute you spend angry about race is a minute you 're not thinking about class \u2014 which , of course , is the real divide in this country .
