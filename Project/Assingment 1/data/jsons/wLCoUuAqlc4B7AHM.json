    "content": "As far back as last October , when the special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Paul Manafort and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 , Rick Gates , on charges of conspiracy to launder money and failure to disclose foreign bank accounts , it was clear that the two men were in serious trouble . Court documents accused Manafort and Gates of generating \u201c tens of millions of dollars in income \u201d in the past decade and a half while working for entities associated with Viktor Yanukovych , the pro-Russia former President of Ukraine , and laundering the money \u201c through scores of United States and foreign corporations , partnerships and bank accounts . \u201d\nEarlier this year , Gates , who is forty-six , reached a plea deal with Mueller \u2019 s team , in which he pleaded guilty to a number of charges and agreed to co\u00f6perate with the investigation against his former boss . On Monday , he began his testimony in a courtroom in Alexandria , Virginia , where Manafort \u2019 s first trial is taking place . ( There is a second trial scheduled in Washington , D.C . )\nThis was the fifth day of the trial . Given the bitter controversy surrounding the scope of Mueller \u2019 s investigation into Russia \u2019 s attempts to disrupt the 2016 Presidential election , Manafort \u2019 s trial has inevitably sparked a great deal of speculation about how it fits in , or doesn \u2019 t fit in , to the broader picture . Manafort served as Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign manager for three months in 2016 . During that time , Manafort , among other things , attended the now notorious Trump Tower meeting with a group of Russians who the Trump campaign believed had dirt on Hillary Clinton . Gates served as Trump \u2019 s deputy campaign manager under Manafort and also worked for Trump \u2019 s transition team , the group that worked to staff and prepare Trump \u2019 s incoming Administration in the weeks after Election Day . But so far , in Manafort \u2019 s trial , the focus has remained firmly on events that took place well in advance of Trump \u2019 s bid for the Presidency .\nOn Monday , before calling Gates to the witness stand , the prosecutors finished up extracting information from one of Manafort \u2019 s tax accountants , Cindy Laporta , from the firm Kositzka , Wicks & Company , who had already testified that , in 2015 , relying on instructions from Gates and Manafort , she falsified tax documents to save Manafort money and help him obtain bank loans . Then an expert on financial crimes at the Treasury Department , Paula Liss , explained to the jury that it is a crime to set up bank accounts overseas and not report them to the I.R.S . or other government agencies . Between 2011 and 2014 , Liss said , neither Manafort nor his wife reported having any such accounts . A short time later , Gates stepped into the witness box .\nThe reports from inside the courtroom all say that Gates avoided looking at Manafort , who was staring at him from the defense table with his arms folded . Instead , Gates kept his gaze fixed on the government \u2019 s lead prosecutor , Greg Andres , who made his bones prosecuting mobsters in the U.S. Attorney \u2019 s Office for the Eastern District of New York . After briefly guiding Gates through how he came to meet Manafort and work for him , Andres asked , \u201c Were you involved in any criminal activity with Mr. Manafort ? \u201d Gates replied , \u201c Yes. \u201d Andres then asked , \u201c Did you commit any crimes with Mr. Manafort ? \u201d Gates said , \u201c Yes . \u201d\nAndres pressed for details . Gates said that he conspired to falsify Manafort \u2019 s tax returns by lying to his accountants about his finances . He said that he had done that \u201c at Mr. Manafort \u2019 s request. \u201d He also said that he and Manafort had set up fifteen foreign bank accounts without disclosing them to the U.S. government , and that they failed to register Manafort as a foreign agent . \u201c When asked why he had lied , Gates said he had done so at Manafort \u2019 s request , \u201d the Washington Post \u2019 s excellent live blog reported . \u201c Separately , Gates explained that Manafort had directed him to report money wired from his foreign bank accounts as loans , rather than as income , to reduce Manafort \u2019 s taxable income . By reporting it as a loan , Gates explained , Manafort could defer the amount of taxes he owed . \u201d\nBefore the day ended , Gates began answering more detailed questions about the work he and Manafort did in Ukraine , starting in 2007 . He explained how the payments to Manafort \u2019 s firm were wired to shell companies in Cyprus , a Mediterranean island known for its lax banking laws and popularity with wealthy Russians . Once the money was there , Gates said , Manafort would move some of it to his U.S. accounts .\nGates \u2019 s testimony , which will continue on Tuesday , strengthened the impression that Manafort \u2019 s lawyers will need to present a strong defense to save him . ( That \u2019 s if Trump doesn \u2019 t issue him a Presidential pardon . ) They have already signalled their strategy : blame everything on Gates , and argue that he is now lying to save his own skin . During his cross-examination of Laporta , Kevin Downing , Manafort \u2019 s lead attorney , sought to emphasize how much the accountant relied on information provided by Gates rather than Manafort , and he made a bit of headway there . But the defense team \u2019 s best moment of the day came when Gates was on the stand answering questions from the prosecution .\nGates testified that , in addition to committing the crimes he copped to in his plea agreement , he embezzled money from Manafort \u2019 s consulting firm . \u201c I added money to expense reports and created expense reports , \u201d he said , estimating that the sums involved came to \u201c several hundred thousand \u201d dollars . Gates said that he also stole money from other people at Manafort \u2019 s firm , told lies to Mueller \u2019 s investigators initially , and lied in a civil case against Manafort . As part of his agreement with the government , he added , the prosecutors had agreed not to bring charges on these matters .\nIt is customary for co\u00f6perating witnesses , at the start of their testimony , to make a clean breast of things , so they can not get caught out on subsequent questioning by the defense . Still , Gates \u2019 s admissions will give Downing something to go on when he begins his cross-examination . Almost certainly , that will be the most dramatic bit of the trial . Whether it will affect the outcome remains to be seen .",
