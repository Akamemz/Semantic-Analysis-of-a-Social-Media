Providing supporters with safe ground is important to Trump \u2019 s future . Most politicians are willing to go pretty far out on rhetorical limbs to advance what they see as their political interest . What they don \u2019 t like is to be exposed as fools soon after doing so . The real importance of the \u2018 smoking gun \u2019 tape that ended Richard Nixon \u2019 s presidency was that it discredited his supporters for repeating what turned out to be lies , and convinced them that Nixon would go on doing that to them as long as they were willing to stick with him\u2026 \u201c Trump is repeatedly giving Republicans that same choice . So far , they 've been willing to go along . But each time he pushes them , it makes it a little more likely they \u2019 ll eventually make the same choice that Republicans made in August 1974. \u201d Jonathan Bernstein , Bloomberg\n\u201c Whether this is technically witness tampering , it \u2019 s undeniably appalling . Even on Fox News , Ken Starr called Trump \u2019 s attack on Yovanovitch during her testimony \u2018 extraordinarily poor judgment. \u2019 What it shows \u2014 as does all of the former ambassador \u2019 s testimony , along with lots of other evidence we have seen \u2014 is that Trump has been running a thugocracy , one in which the president talks and acts like a Mafioso and so do the people who have the greatest influence over him\u2026 \u201c There \u2019 s an irony here , which is that Yovanovitch \u2019 s story is tangential to the case for impeachment . Trump \u2019 s firing of her was disturbing , undermined U.S. interests and was despicable in many ways , but it wasn \u2019 t in and of itself impeachable . It doesn \u2019 t bear directly on the pressure campaign to strong-arm Ukraine into helping Trump \u2019 s reelection by launching a sham \u2018 investigation \u2019 of Joe and Hunter Biden. \u201d Paul Waldman , Washington Post\n\u201c Never before , in our experience or frankly in the history of US foreign policy , has a President publicly sought to intimidate a career public civil servant \u2026 Friday 's testimony by former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and President Donald Trump 's threatening tweets -- sent while she was testifying -- provide a devastating window into the administration 's preternaturally destructive campaign to politicize the Department of State , undermine US diplomacy , and smear the reputations of career State Department officers for upholding the oath they take to defend the Constitution and American national interests\u2026 \u201c Three career foreign service officers have now testified before Congress in public impeachment inquiry hearings -- in direct defiance of both the White House and the Department of State . They are alone and exposed . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has failed to discharge his duty to support , protect and defend the Department or these dedicated professionals. \u201d Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky , CNN\n\u201c Despite Republican efforts to throw up a smokescreen , despite their complaints that they are being muzzled even as they pose questions , it is clear that the president was putting his own political interests \u2014 looking for dirt on Hillary and the Bidens \u2014 above national security and using shady henchmen to do it\u2026 Reagan would be stunned to find Republican members of the House at war with the F.B.I . and the C.I.A . \u2014 all to bolster Trump \u2019 s tender ego. \u201d Maureen Dowd , New York Times\n\u201c President Trump and his defenders have been arguing , weakly , that his actions toward Ukraine , including demands for the investigation of his political opponents , were somehow consistent with U.S. national interests . There is no way to make that case about his treatment of Marie Yovanovitch , the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine . In compelling testimony during the House \u2019 s impeachment inquiry on Friday , she described how the president \u2019 s firing of her was orchestrated by corrupt Ukrainian actors whom the United States had been trying to neutralize \u2014 and how that reversal damaged U.S. diplomacy around the world. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c As Yovanovitch herself affirmed numerous times over the course of her testimony , US ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the president . But it can also be newsworthy if the president removes an ambassador because he \u2019 s been duped by a campaign of lies being pushed by corrupt foreign officials \u2014 which is what Yovanovitch \u2019 s defenders ( and Yovanovitch herself ) believe happened. \u201d Andrew Prokop and Alex Ward , Vox\nThe right dismisses Yovanovitch \u2019 s testimony as irrelevant to the issue at hand , and argues that Trump \u2019 s tweet was counterproductive but not intimidation .\nThe right dismisses Yovanovitch \u2019 s testimony as irrelevant to the issue at hand , and argues that Trump \u2019 s tweet was counterproductive but not intimidation .\n\u201c Yovanovitch was not the ambassador to Ukraine during the period when the Trump administration withheld military aid . She has no knowledge as to why the aid was held up . That \u2019 s the only issue of relevance to the impeachment proceedings . The proceedings aren \u2019 t about whether Yovanovitch should have been removed as ambassador . Schiff \u2019 s committee isn \u2019 t a human resources body or a personnel review board\u2026\n\u201c Democrats may say that Yovanovitch \u2019 s removal is relevant because it was the first step in making U.S. policy towards Ukraine subservient to Trump \u2019 s political interests . It set the stage , so to speak . But this argument collapses the moment one remembers that Yovanovitch was replaced by Bill Taylor ( officially , he \u2019 s the charg\u00e9 d \u2019 affaires , but he acts as ambassador ) . If there \u2019 s one thing on which Democrats and Republicans on Schiff \u2019 s committee agree , it \u2019 s that Taylor is an exemplary diplomat . \u201d\nSome are critical of firing Yovanovitch . \u201c Trump was given bad advice , and unfortunately , he listened . It \u2019 s not clear exactly why Trump chose to recall Yovanovitch , but it \u2019 s likely his decision was influenced by Giuliani and others in Ukraine who wanted Yovanovitch gone . Now let \u2019 s be clear : As president , Trump has every right to recall a foreign diplomat for any reason he sees fit . Yovanovitch , as she \u2019 s admitted , served at the pleasure of the president . But as of yet , no one has offered a good reason for why Yovanovitch should have been removed , defaulting instead to a political \u2018 because I said so. \u2019 Trump should not have listened to Giuliani , whose sole concern while meddling in Ukrainian affairs was self-advancement . \u201d\nOthers contend , \u201c For any readers persuaded by former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch \u2019 s congressional testimony today that she was the key to a free and independent Ukraine free of corruption , it \u2019 s worth noting [ that ] \u2026 the Obama administration helped [ Yovanovitch ] prepare to field questions at her Senate confirmation hearing in June of 2016 about Hunter Biden \u2019 s role on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma . The company was then under investigation in Ukraine\u2026\n\u201c [ But after her confirmation ] even though the Bidens have been unable to explain what exactly Hunter Biden was doing for his lucrative compensation and have pledged never to do such deals again , it seems that the vaunted anti-corruption champion Ms. Yovanovitch didn \u2019 t think it was worth pursuing . In her earlier House deposition she said it \u2018 wasn \u2019 t a front burner issue at the time . \u2019 \u201d\nRegarding Trump \u2019 s tweet , \u201c Trump is angry over the hearings and their lack of due process . The tweet was not intended as intimidation and obviously had no such effect . It was , instead , an impulsive attempt to influence public opinion \u2014 this being , first and foremost , a political controversy . The real problem is that the tweet \u2019 s effect , if any , was the opposite of what Trump intended : The public saw Yovanovitch , not the president , as the victim of an unfair attack\u2026\n\u201c [ Impeachment ] has always been a political stratagem . The Democrats \u2019 real objective is to render the president so battered and bruised that his reelection becomes inconceivable . Those who say Yovanovitch \u2019 s testimony did not \u2018 move the needle \u2019 on impeachment are entirely correct\u2026 But if you see this as I do , not as an impeachment gambit but as a 2020 campaign strategy , the Democrats had a pretty good day . \u201d\n\u201c Trump 's tacky tweets do n't constitute witness intimidation , not by any true legal standard and certainly not by any metric the public cares about . For starters , the entire nation has known for the better part of a year that Trump disdained Yovanovitch . He berated her publicly for months before pulling her from her post in Ukraine , and Trump going on an incoherent rant is obviously not a threat\u2026\n\u201c Democrats have an actual case to prove to the public on their hands , and instead of maintaining laser focus on the central question ( Did Trump abuse the powers of the presidency to extort a foreign government into harming his domestic political foe ? ) , they 're wasting a precious day of public testimony fulminating about a fake process crime . Republicans should care if the president committed an impeachable abuse of power . But with Democrats melting down over yet another one of Trump 's tacky tweets , can you blame them for being a bit cynical about this clown show ? \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
