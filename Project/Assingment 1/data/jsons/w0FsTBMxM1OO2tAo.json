And they were independents . And we \u2019 ve actually expanded the party . \u201d\nExit polling shows Mr. Trump has indeed helped build up the party this year , with nearly 10 million people casting ballots in the 15 primaries and caucuses so far , about 4 million more than voted in the same Republican races in 2008 .\nMr. Trump has won about a third of the votes , building a formidable and durable coalition that somehow spans moderates and evangelicals , draws heavily from self-identified independents , and tilts toward older and less-educated supporters .\nJust how successful he and his fellow candidates have been is captured in the numbers : 14 of the 15 Republican contests so far have set records for turnout .\nJust as striking is the drop-off for Democrats who , though setting a record Tuesday in Colorado \u2019 s caucuses , have seen turnout plummet in every other race . Accounting for all 15 races so far , Democratic turnout is down more than 30 percent compared with the heady days of 2008 , when Barack Obama battled Hillary Clinton in an epic clash .\nIn fact , the numbers this year are almost exactly reversed . Through the same races in 2008 , Democrats had accounted for 62 percent of all votes cast . But this year , powered by a surge of interest from Democrats , Republicans and independents alike , Republicans account for 59 percent of the votes cast .\nDemocrats insist much of the difference is attributable to the size of the Republican field , which went into Iowa with a dozen candidates , compared with three for Democrats . In Super Tuesday races , Republicans had five candidates and Democrats were down to two : Mrs. Clinton and Sen. Bernard Sanders .\n\u201c I understand there \u2019 s been a disparity across the country .
