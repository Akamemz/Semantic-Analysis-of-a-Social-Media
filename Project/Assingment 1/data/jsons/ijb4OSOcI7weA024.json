Kennedy \u2019 s appointment of brother Bobby as Attorney General . The legislation might be called LBJ \u2019 s revenge as Lyndon Johnson hated Bobby Kennedy and this was , in the way of the famously vengeful LBJ , a way of getting even with the Kennedys , although by 1967 RFK was comfortably ensconced in the U.S. Senate representing New York .\nBut well aside from a considerable body of opinion that the 1967 law doesn \u2019 t apply to the White House staff , there is simple ignorance of the fact that various presidents did in fact formally rely on family members to advise them on the problems of the day . The addition of Jared Kushner to the senior White House staff would not only be important \u2014 it has lots and lots of precedence .\nThe tradition of presidents relying on family members as presidential confidantes began with the beginning of the United States itself . Then-Vice President John Adams saw to it that President George Washington appointed Adams \u2019 s son , John Quincy Adams , as the American Minister to the Netherlands . John Quincy had long been a key confidante of his father , accompanying him on diplomatic missions when the senior Adams was the American envoy to France and the Netherlands . When John Adams was elected the nation \u2019 s second president he promptly appointed his son the U.S . Ambassador to Prussia , where he served until his father \u2019 s defeat by Thomas Jefferson in 1800 .\nPresident James Madison had no children of his own but , in an effort to help his troubled adopted son of wife Dolley , saw to it that John Payne Todd was appointed as a secretary to an official U.S. delegation in Europe .\nAndrew Jackson Donelson , the namesake nephew of President Andrew Jackson , was so well-thought of by Jackson as an advisor that Jackson appointed him as his private secretary in the White House , a post the influential Donelson held for all eight years of his presidency .\nTwo of Martin Van Buren \u2019 s sons , Martin Jr. and Smith , served their father in the White House when Van Buren was elected to succeed Jackson in 1836 . Martin Jr. served as private secretary to his presidential father , while his brother Smith was a special assistant .\nSarah Childress Polk , the wife of President James K. Polk , had no children . But it was she \u2014 the sitting First Lady \u2014 who helped write presidential speeches and was his confidante on policy .\nPresident Lincoln made sure to get son Robert appointed to the staff of General Ulysses Grant , a position that the younger Lincoln had at Appomattox and that propelled him on to a highly successful career of his own in both the law and politics , later serving as Secretary of War for Presidents Garfield and Arthur .\nEdith Bolling Galt plays a startling role in American history . The second wife of Woodrow Wilson , when her husband suffered a stroke midway through his second term it was wife Ellen \u2014 not Vice President Thomas Marshall \u2014 who made the decisions of what briefings the bedridden president would and would not get .
