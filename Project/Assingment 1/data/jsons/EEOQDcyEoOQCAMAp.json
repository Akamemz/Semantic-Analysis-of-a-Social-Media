But the nature of Obama \u2019 s command of the loyalty and affection of his supporters is far different than the nature of Trump \u2019 s command of his supporters . This difference is critical to the most important question of 2020 politics : Can Trump survive the pandemic and the astounding disruption it has caused in the economy and the routines of everyday life ?\nMost people who admire Obama , it \u2019 s clear , do so in absolute terms . To these people , his character and style represent virtues that approximate the ideal of how they might wish all presidents at all times should act . He \u2019 s progressive , even if not quite as much as some admirers want .

These virtues , by these lights , do not depend primarily on context\u2014on who his opponents are , or what external circumstances he is facing .\nMost people who admire Trump , in my conversations , do so in a relative way . Context is everything . Yes , they say , Trump is coarse and combative , often outrageous , with a wandering attention span . No , this does not represent their ideal of how a president should act . But these aren \u2019 t ideal times\u2014they are infused with double standards and cynicism\u2014and this makes Trump a great leader for these particular times .

No one really doubts that whether Trump believes his broadsides against Obama is secondary to his true objective of drawing lines and creating the kind of chaos in which he has previously thrived .\nThe rejoinder to all this is obvious : Who cares ? What relevance do Trump \u2019 s grievances and posturing and conspiracy theories have in the middle of a pandemic ? Surely there is only one question that matters : Is Trump doing a good job responding to the crisis ?\nBut that question immediately leads to the next : Good job , according to who ?\nTrump knows that the likelihood that a sufficient number of people will say he \u2019 s doing at least an acceptable job during the pandemic increases the more that certain types of people say he \u2019 s a terrible person doing a terrible job .\nDemocrats believe the pandemic and Trump \u2019 s belated and erratic response to it will be his undoing . There is polling to bolster this hope . A Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday showed Joe Biden leading Trump by 50 percent to 39 percent in a head-to-head matchup\u2014an 11-point national lead that , if it held , likely would put several battleground states out of reach for Trump .\nBut weighing against hope is experience .

At long last , have you left no sense of decency ? \u201d \u2014will derail Trump .
