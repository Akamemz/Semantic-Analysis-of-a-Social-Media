The action was mixed as bank stocks climbed , but tech-focused stay-at-home plays fell . Market analysts and economists are largely at odds when it comes to pinpointing a timeline for recovery . Here 's what four of them said Wednesday :\nDavid Lebovitz , global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management , said many questions remain about the reopening process , which is why he 's staying cautious : `` We have been surprised by the speed and the magnitude at which things have moved , but when you think about building a diversified portfolio , you have the 10-year Treasury yield at 70 basis points . Equities look attractive even if they 're trading at north of 20 times . So , we have been encouraging folks to stay long equities despite some of the risks that exist . I guess \u2026 where my caution really comes from is there 's a lot we do n't understand about reopening the economy . And there was a great article the other week where they were talking to restaurant and bar owners in New York City and basically saying , 'What kind of capacity do you need in order to break even ? ' and the number is somewhere around 75 % . So , I think one of the things that we need to focus on is just because business can reopen , does n't necessarily mean they will reopen . And furthermore , turning the economy back on is much more challenging than turning it off . You can basically stop this thing on a dime , but when it comes to starting back up , I think there are a lot of questions around what that 's going to look like , particularly given the more services-oriented nature of this downturn . Usually , it 's manufacturing that takes the majority of the pain . This time , it 's services , and we just do n't have a good playbook for that and I think that 's part of what 's informing some of the caution that we continue to have as we think about building portfolios . It really drives our focus on quality assets here at the current juncture . ''\nMike Mayo , managing director and head of U.S. large-cap bank research at Wells Fargo Securities , said the Fed would do well to let its policies from the previous recession work : `` We 've run over 200 earnings models . We 've run different scenarios : a V recovery , a U recovery , an L recovery , and it 's pretty tough , we think , for the government to conclude that large banks , well-capitalized banks , well-capitalized banks that earned their dividend twice over in the first quarter , in a quarter when they built reserves , we find it very tough for the Fed to conclude that banks should cut the dividends now . Remember , this is the Fed that 's done a phenomenal job over the last decade . You 've had a decade worth of Fed stress tests . Capital is double the level where it was during the global financial crisis . So , we say , 'Thank you , regulators . Now , let the process work . ' And by the way , the Fed has a right to do a look-back . They can look back in two quarters and say , 'Whoa , we did not expect another leg down , a big second wave , some sort of depression-like scenario . ' The Fed can always change their mind . But to do so at this point in time , it could sap confidence . By the way , the bond market , the $ 6 trillion investment-grade bond market , when it comes to banks , bank bond spreads are as safe as any other corporate . ''\nJason Furman , economic policy professor at Harvard University and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers , warned investors not to get too eager too soon : `` I think we 're going to have two phases from here . One is a partial bounce back , which will be very rapid . It 'll look like we 're on the upslope of a V. We 've already seen that . When you look at daily data , it bottomed out \u2026 around April 15 . You 've even seen growth in consumption spending , a decent amount of it , from April 15 to May 15 . Problem is that 's the low-hanging fruit of growth where you turn the lights back on , call some of the furloughed workers back . There 's a lot more people that are n't coming back to their jobs , businesses that are not going to be revived , and so once you get past that first phase , I think you 're in for a long and painful slog .
