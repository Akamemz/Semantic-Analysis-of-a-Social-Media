Hillary Clinton \u2019 s numbers here are lousy , like they are everywhere else ; there are a lot of issues to exploit against her , and they \u2019 re not doing it . \u201d\nDave Carney , a longtime New Hampshire GOP strategist who still sees a sliver of opportunity for Trump there , said the Republican nominee is more likely to get swamped by Clinton \u2019 s ground game , which will work to her advantage on Election Day , since New Hampshire has same-day voter registration .\nThe Trump campaign so far hasn \u2019 t prioritized New Hampshire : It didn \u2019 t invest in an ad buy until last week , when it dropped about $ 516,000 on a TV campaign , and he has spent much more time in bigger swing states . Clinton , meanwhile , has been on the New Hampshire airwaves for months , spending more than $ 1 million just on one station , WMUR-TV . More recently , top surrogates , like Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont , have campaigned in the state on her behalf .\nA New Hampshire operative close to the Trump campaign insisted that Trump has a path to closing the gap with Clinton now that he is up on the airwaves and that the campaign is kicking into higher gear on air and on the ground as summer ends , just as New Hampshire voters start to pay more attention .\n\u201c Obviously , TV makes a difference ; complete campaigns make a difference , \u201d the source said . \u201c Not having TV while the other side was advertising significantly in the state makes a huge difference . \u201d\nRepublican pessimism on New Hampshire seems to dovetail with the thinking in Trump Tower . \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported Sunday that Trump \u2019 s top pollster , Tony Fabrizio , has presented the candidate with four tiers of swing states that placed New Hampshire at the bottom , along with Michigan and Virginia \u2014 suggesting the campaign look to them for cost-effective opportunities in the fall , and only then if the campaign still believes it could win them .\nWith just four electoral votes , New Hampshire is the smallest swing-state prize . The prospective loss of Virginia , with its 13 electoral votes , is a bigger problem .\n\u201c Anything you \u2019 re going to spend on Trump is a waste at this point , \u201d said David Ramadan , a former Virginia House member and GOP activist . \u201c The overall vote is going to be determined by Northern Virginia and the Tidewater area . Those two areas are not going to go on the Trump side . \u201d\nPopulous Northern Virginia \u2019 s growth is driven by immigrants and college-educated voters \u2014 demographics with which Trump has generally struggled .\nHis weakness in the region is on display in the state \u2019 s most competitive House race , a suburban and exurban seat that covers Northern Virginia \u2019 s critical Loudoun , Fairfax and Prince William counties \u2014 all places Trump lost in Virginia \u2019 s primary . Incumbent GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock has shown no interest in campaigning with her party \u2019 s nominee against a backdrop in which Clinton has held consistent polling leads in the state and her running mate , Tim Kaine , is a former Virginia governor . The state \u2019 s current governor , Terry McAuliffe , is one of her most loyal political allies . Her state director in Virginia previously ran McAuliffe \u2019 s political arm .\n\u201c Organizationally , Clinton has put a lot of resources into Virginia ; she \u2019 s got her vice presidential candidate there ; Terry McAuliffe is completely committed to her ; her TV ads have been on for [ months ] . Trump has done none of that , \u201d said Tom Davis , a former congressman who represented Northern Virginia and was honorary chair of Trump foe John Kasich \u2019 s efforts in the state . \u201c If and when he does that , he has the opportunity to even up the score . \u201d\n\u201c In a year like this , never say never about anything , but I would say it looks like [ Virginia ] has tilted pretty strongly toward the Democratic camp , \u201d said Tucker Martin , a longtime Republican Virginia operative .\nThe Trump campaign is still treating Virginia as a battleground : Trump spent Tuesday morning in Virginia Beach and has visited frequently . And the campaign has invested nearly $ 2 million in a state ad campaign , concentrated in the Washington , D.C. , media market , which includes the Northern Virginia suburbs . John Whitbeck , the state GOP chairman , said he 's advised the Trump campaign to `` go all in '' on his state , which he views as winnable despite tough polling .\nThough other Republicans largely acknowledge Trump is trailing in the state , some still see a window for him . After a spate of August polls reported a double-digit lead for Clinton , two recent polls suggested the contest is within the margin of error .\n\u201c I get more and more people who were reticent about Trump , say a month or two months ago , telling me that they \u2019 re now going to vote for Trump , \u201d said Bob Marshall , a conservative Virginia House member . \u201c There \u2019 s a factor called intensity , which polls are notoriously inept at measuring . Based on my conversations \u2026 the intensity for Trump is significantly higher than the intensity for Clinton . \u201d\nOne longtime Republican strategist in Virginia said Trump \u2019 s path is uphill but clear : He has to limit his losses in Northern Virginia , which has seen an explosion in Democratic votes from government employees and suburban women , while driving turnout in the more conservative parts of the state .\n\u201c I think you win or lose this race in Loudoun County and Prince William County . Trump \u2019 s got to hold his losses down in Fairfax , and he needs to win Prince William and Loudoun County , \u201d said the strategist . \u201c If you \u2019 re getting your clock cleaned in Northern Virginia \u2014 and Northern Virginia is 35 , 40 percent of the statewide vote \u2014 you can \u2019 t lose Northern Virginia 70-30 . \u201d\nColorado , where Clinton and her super PAC Priorities USA have suspended most of their ad buys in a sign of their confidence , is a similar story to Virginia . There , vulnerable GOP Congressman Mike Coffman has gone so far as to explicitly criticize Trump \u2019 s message in his heavily Hispanic district . Trump himself hasn \u2019 t visited the state since July , and he \u2019 s spent only $ 950,000 on the air in the key Mountain West swing state .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t see a path to victory for Trump in Colorado , \u201d said Tyler Sandberg , who ran Coffman 's 2014 reelection campaign .\nJust as in Virginia , Republicans holding out hope for a Trump comeback pin it on pockets of Trump support that haven \u2019 t materialized in recent polls that give Clinton a double-digit advantage .\n\u201c You \u2019 re seeing it as a solid blue [ at the moment ] , \u201d said Laura Carno , a Republican strategist in Colorado . \u201c In any ordinary year , you could draw conclusions from that . But I don \u2019 t think this is an ordinary year . I can say , as of this moment , those numbers look encouraging for Hillary Clinton . But gosh , what could happen tomorrow and the next day ? \u201d\n\u201c I just don \u2019 t yet trust that this is going to behave like a regular cycle , \u201d she added .\nBut another Colorado veteran strategist failed to see any reason for hope . \u201c I don \u2019 t see Colorado as a swing state , presidentially , \u201d he said . The strategist noted that much of the state \u2019 s Republican talent is working to reelect Coffman , who has built his own ground operation , and many others have tethered themselves to high-stakes ballot initiatives rather than work on the presidential campaign .\n\u201c It \u2019 s too diverse ; Colorado and Virginia both are very similar in that way , \u201d he said . \u201c Republican women have fled Trump , and they \u2019 re not coming back . They might go with [ Libertarian candidate ] Gary Johnson . \u201d\nState party chairmen in Virginia and Colorado both warned against reading too much into polls that show Trump trailing their states .
