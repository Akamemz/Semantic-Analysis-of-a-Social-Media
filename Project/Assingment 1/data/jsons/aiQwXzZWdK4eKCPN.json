    "content": "At least 34 people have died and more than 1,600 have fallen ill in the vaping-related lung illness outbreak that \u2019 s swept across the country since March . And months into their investigation , disease detectives at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say they still don \u2019 t know exactly what \u2019 s causing the severe shortness of breath and chest pain that \u2019 s landed people in hospitals .\nOne class of vaping product , however , has consistently been implicated in the illnesses : unregulated and unlicensed cartridges that contain THC , the main psychoactive chemical in cannabis .\nAccording to the latest CDC data , 78 percent of the 849 patients who have provided information on their vaping habits reported using THC-containing products . Though the agency isn \u2019 t tracking whether people were using legal or black market sources to vape , the data we have from states suggests it \u2019 s overwhelmingly illicit , pre-filled THC vape cartridges making people sick .\nOn Tuesday , the CDC \u2019 s Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report published a study from Utah showing 92 percent of patients interviewed reported vaping THC \u2014 and mostly from pre-filled cartridges \u2014 before falling ill . The vape products , the CDC said , \u201c were acquired from informal sources such as friends or illicit in-person and online dealers. \u201d Dank Vapes , a popular black-market manufacturer , was the most commonly used brand . Research in Illinois and Wisconsin shows the same pattern . And in New York , the state Department of Health commissioner has said the vast majority of the 125 cases there have been linked to black market THC cartridges .\nAs this data has emerged , the outbreak is looking less like a story about general vaping risks and more about the harms of vaping certain THC products . It \u2019 s also a reminder that the way people use THC is shifting .\n\u201c What \u2019 s changed is that people used to vape dried herb and now you have more vaping of preprocessed manufactured oils , which involve different ingredients , \u201d said David Hammond , a public health researcher at the University of Waterloo in Ontario who studies the e-cigarette and THC vape markets in Canada and the US .\nYet health regulators haven \u2019 t kept up with this new reality , Hammond and other experts told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , even in states where marijuana is legal . That \u2019 s why experts increasingly view the outbreak as evidence in the case for decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level . States haven \u2019 t been able to protect the public from dangerous vape products , and so it may be time for agencies experienced in regulating consumer products , like food and drugs , to take over , they say .\nTo understand why , let \u2019 s take a closer look at the black market for THC vape products and its role in vaping-related lung disease .\nWhat are black market THC vape products and what do we know about them ?\nA quick tour of the basics of black market THC vape products : Vape devices , also known as e-cigarettes , are battery-powered gadgets that deliver nicotine or flavors through an aerosol . They do this by heating a solution of colorless solvents ( most commonly propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin ) and other additives . When people vape THC , the solution also contains THC oil . ( Note the difference here from smoking a joint or using a dried herb vaporizer . )\nThere are a variety of devices that aerosolize THC liquids . But the most common , according to the Wisconsin and Illinois data , are vape pens that take pre-filled cartridges , and tank-based devices , that can be filled with THC-containing liquid . The cartridges or liquids that go into the devices can be purchased from authorized stores in states like Colorado that have legalized marijuana products or from unauthorized , black market sources , such as dealers or online shops . ( In states that haven \u2019 t legalized marijuana , all sources are considered black market . But states with legal markets also have black markets \u2014 more on that later . )\nWe don \u2019 t have a lot of information about the black market for cannabis products . \u201c It is somewhat shocking how little we know , \u201d said Hammond . And that \u2019 s the nature of black markets : They are , by definition , murky and hard to track \u2014 and the one for pre-filled vape cartridges is also relatively new .\nHere \u2019 s what we do know : In 2016 , the overall market for cannabis in the US \u2014 from both licensed and unlicensed sources \u2014 was estimated at $ 50 billion . An analysis by RAND found the fastest growing segment of the state-legal cannabis market in Washington state ( one of the first to legalize recreational marijuana ) was \u201c extracts for inhalation \u201d , which includes vape pens and cartridges .\nThe International Cannabis Policy Study , which surveyed 30,000 people in September 2018 , uncovered a similar trend : While dried herb remains popular , more than 30 percent of users report vaping THC oil . Many others are using edibles and concentrates ( cannabis that \u2019 s been processed to increase its potency ) .\nNotably , the processed THC products are more potent than dried herb . Dried herb typically contains 10 to 20 percent THC . THC vape oils can contain much more . \u201c [ They ] typically have 70 to 90 percent THC , \u201d Hammond said , based on his past and forthcoming studies , \u201c and can contain as much as 99 percent THC . \u201d\nFederal health officials and investigators haven \u2019 t pinpointed a specific product or ingredient that \u2019 s at fault , and not all the patients in this outbreak reported using THC products . ( In every study , there \u2019 s a subset of people who say they only vaped nicotine , for example . )\nBut investigators do have some ideas about what could be happening with the cases involving THC . Since THC cartridges seem to be an issue , it \u2019 s possible some ingredient has been introduced into the US supply chain that \u2019 s sickening people . ( And considering no other country is experiencing a similar outbreak of this scale , and that millions of people have used nicotine e-cigarettes over many years without an apparent problem like this so far , the contaminant theory makes sense . )\nOne potential contaminant is vitamin E acetate . Of the 225 THC-containing products FDA has tested , as of October 11 , 47 percent contained the oily substance . The new Utah data found the chemical in 89 percent of the THC-containing cartridges tested there . New York state also found vitamin E acetate in many of the cartridges respiratory illness patients had used . Even though vitamin E acetate is safely used in nutritional supplements , it isn \u2019 t safe to inhale into the lungs .\nIt \u2019 s also possible that another , yet-to-be-identified ingredient is making people sick . \u201c [ Black market products can ] include other chemicals , \u201d such as pesticides , said Beau Kilmer , director , RAND Drug Policy Research Center . \u201c And as we \u2019 re seeing [ with the outbreak ] , some of those chemicals can be very harmful when vaporized . \u201d\nBecause marijuana is still illegal at the federal level , it \u2019 s up to states in places that have legalized to regulate their markets . And the outbreak is showing that this approach isn \u2019 t doing enough to keep consumers safe , Scott Gottlieb , the former head of FDA , argued in the Wall Street Journal recently :\nFederal agencies exert little oversight , and regulation is left to a patchwork of inadequate state agencies . The weak state bodies sanction the adoption of unsafe practices such as vaping concentrates , while allowing an illegal market in cannabis to flourish .\nIndeed , cannabis health regulations vary widely among the states , Leo Beletsky , professor of law and health sciences at Northwestern University , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , and they \u2019 re generally insufficient .\nSo in Washington , for example , the Liquor and Cannabis Board regulates the recreational cannabis marketplace , and products are tested for \u201c potency , moisture , foreign matter , microbiological , mycotoxins ( fungi ) , and residual solvents , \u201d according to a spokesperson there . Medical grade products are also tested for pesticides and heavy metals .\nIn California , products are third-party tested for the same kinds of contaminants Washington looks for , and the state Department of Health \u2019 s regulations for cannabis requires \u201c manufacturers to utilize good manufacturing practices in the production of cannabis products , \u201d a spokesperson there said , including listing all ingredients on the label .\nBut states typically don \u2019 t require manufacturers to submit safety data before marketing their products , nor do they conduct random spot checking of cannabis products to make sure that what manufacturers claim about their products is true .\n\u201c How confident [ are state regulators ] that some of the ingredients used in vape oils are safe ? I don \u2019 t know if anyone knows that . \u201d\nTheir list of tests also doesn \u2019 t include checking for chemicals , such as vitamin E acetate , that are emerging as a health threat . \u201c Until only recently with the outbreak of the vapor associated lung injury crisis , no one suspected additional safety tests should be considered , \u201d the Washington spokesperson said .\nOn top of that , there \u2019 s just a lot we don \u2019 t know about the health impact of vaping THC oil . \u201c How confident [ are state regulators ] that some of the ingredients used in vape oils are safe ? \u201d Hammond said . \u201c I don \u2019 t know if anyone knows that .
