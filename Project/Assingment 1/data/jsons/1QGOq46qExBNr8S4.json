    "content": "Others argue that \u201c Biden was almost the only one on the stage who talked like a normal person . There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep \u2018 punching \u2019 at it\u2026 I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\nRegarding Pelosi , \u201c [ her ] talents have always lain in the less glamorous , less public side of politics : she is good at whipping up votes in her caucus and she is good at disciplining dissenters . She is good at offering incentives and punishments to get Democratic members of Congress to do what she wants them to do\u2026 To rip up the speech on television was a bit of theatricality , sure \u2013 a ploy designed to get attention . It also worked . The day after Trump made a long speech full of misinformation that tried to make a case for his re-election , no one is talking about him . Instead we are talking about the speaker of the House . That , too , is a skill , one that Pelosi seems to be honing. \u201d Moira Donegan , The Guardian\nMinority view : \u201c There is a lot to admire in the paper 's presentation of the 1619 Project \u2014 searing photographs , illuminating quotations from archival material , samples of poetry and fiction giving powerful voice to the black experience , and gripping journalistic summaries of scholarly histories\u2026 The country 's treatment of the slaves and their descendants through the century following emancipation and , in some respects , on down to the present was and is appalling \u2014 and the story of how it happened , and keeps happening , is extremely important for understanding the United States\u2026 \u201c [ But ] throughout the issue of theNYTM , headlines make , with just slight variations , the same rhetorical move over and over again : \u2018 Here is something unpleasant , unjust , or even downright evil about life in the present-day United States . Bet you did n't realize that slavery is ultimately to blame. \u2019 Lack of universal access to health care ? High rates of sugar consumption ? Callous treatment of incarcerated prisoners ? White recording artists \u2018 stealing \u2019 black music ? Harsh labor practices ? That 's right \u2014 all of it , and far more , follows from slavery\u2026 no single narrative of the past is the indisputably right one \u2026 new interpretations that break sharply from a past consensus often go too far . That 's especially true when the new claims advance a radical political agenda. \u201d Damon Linker , The Week\n\u201c There is a James Baldwin quote that I have had tattooed on my consciousness : \u2018 I love America more than any other country in the world and , exactly for this reason , I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually. \u2019 That is the animating spirit of endeavors like the 1619 Project , which \u2014 if people bothered to read it \u2014 shows it is possible to depict our ugliness through beauty , to artfully weave a reader \u2019 s eyes and mind through a re-examination of the very soil beneath their feet so that they see it anew , and more clearly . It is a vision test for the soul , and it certainly helps us not only view America in greater relief , but those working to inhibit its growth and empowerment. \u201d Jamil Smith , Rolling Stone\n\u201c For conservatives , being a patriot means believing that America is an essentially good country ; its sins are aberrations rather than central to its history . There is no room for a nuanced patriotism that sees a nation with racism as a central part of its DNA , but also a nation that can be improved through constant struggle and work . It is the \u2018 America : Love It or Leave It \u2019 bumper sticker , expressed in more florid prose\u2026 The 1619 Project challenges not only the founders \u2019 innocence but that of white Americans who downplay racism \u2019 s vitality today\u2026 The furious reaction from the American right only proves how much their work [ is ] needed . \u201d Zack Beauchamp , Vox\n\u201c Conservative uproar over the New York Times \u2019 1619 Project is just the most recent clash in a decades-old battle over how we should understand American history\u2026 For most historians , it \u2019 s just not interesting to think of history as a place you go to feel good , or bad , about America . \u2018 America \u2019 is so big , and so complex . Patriotism might be a side effect , but it \u2019 s not the point of historical study . That \u2019 s why an alternative vision of patriotism , like the one that Nikole Hannah-Jones articulated in the 1619 Project \u2019 s opening essay\u2014 \u2018 Black Americans\u2026 have served , generation after generation , in an overlooked but vital role : It is we who have been the perfecters of this democracy \u2019 \u2014is so valuable\u2026 \u201c This is a complex and yet immediately legible argument , expressed as public history , buttressed in the package by other arguments that are in turn informed by years of academic historical work . It is the \u2018 realest \u2019 sort of history , the kind that enriches articles and exhibits and historic sites with new information about the daily lives and struggles of non-elite people and minority groups. \u201d Rebecca Onion , Slate\n\u201c The project was deeply researched and fact-checked with the assistance of a panel of historians . Elements of it were conducted in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution , a venerable pillar of American learning . It \u2019 s a serious work of popular history that starts America \u2019 s clock four centuries ago\u2026 What followed was 250 years of brutal slavery the United States , then a century of de facto apartheid rule . [ The lead reporter ] Hannah-Jones , 43 , stresses that she is part of only the first generation of black Americans born in a country where it was not legal to discriminate against them \u2026 Those who engage with history more seriously than politicians understand that recognition of a national darkness need not be an impediment to national pride. \u201d Ishaan Tharoor , Washington Post\nThe right is critical of the New York Times , accusing it of distorting history to fit a partisan narrative .\nThe right is critical of the New York Times , accusing it of distorting history to fit a partisan narrative .\n\u201c Slavery was this nation \u2019 s original sin . But it is also true that hundreds of thousands of people spilled their blood on the Union Army side as propitiation for that sin\u2026 The 1619 Project by the New York Times is as flawed as it would have you believe the country \u2019 s founding was . It seeks to divide , not heal . It seeks to give power and primacy to those who think the nation \u2019 s founding was premised on evil\u2026 Americans , particularly white Americans , need to learn more about slavery in the United States . But doing so on the premise that the United States itself is flawed and illegitimate is not the way to do it . Sadly , that \u2019 s what so much of the Times \u2019 coverage amounts to . \u201d\n\u201c By far the most central and important issue regarding race and racism in the United States is how to change the fact that black and to a lesser degree Hispanic Americans have consistently worse outcomes in a whole host of areas than do other Americans . In regard to the former , 1619 makes a compelling case that slavery played a big role in this , because it did . This is something few serious people would argue with . What is less clear is how reframing American history as a tale of evil is going to fix the problem . As if somehow non-black Americans will have their eyes opened to how important slavery was and suddenly have policy fixes to change outcomes . This seems extremely unlikely , especially given that such significant efforts have been made to reframe history over the past decades and these negative outcomes have not changed . \u201d\n\u201c In the reframing of the 1619 Project , African-American success stories disappear . There \u2019 s no mention of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympic Games . There \u2019 s no mention of Jackie Robinson\u2026 Harriet Tubman is never mentioned . Nor is Booker T. Washington nor is Bishop Richard Allen , who founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church ( AME ) , the first independent black denomination in the United States . Abolitionist Sojourner Truth , Shirley Chisom ( the first black woman elected to the U.S. Congress ) , Benjamin Oliver Davis Sr. ( the first African-American general for the U.S. Army ) , Ida Wells ( a journalist who documented lynchings and co-founded the NAACP ) , Duke Ellington , and Rosa Parks are never mentioned\u2026\n\u201c The 1619 Project argues , with considerable justification , that most of us [ have ] been seeing only one part of the portrait of the founding , formation , and growth of our country\u2026 and then \u2018 reframes \u2019 the portrait to leave out some of the most consequential and under-discussed African Americans in our history . \u201d\n\u201c Jefferson \u2019 s original final draft of the Declaration explicitly referred to black slaves not as property but asmen and castigated King George III for suppressing parliamentary efforts to prohibit or restrain \u2018 this execrable commerce \u2019 ( referring to slavery ) . Letters written to John Jay show Alexander Hamilton hoping the Revolutionary War could lead to the emancipation of blacks and appraising them equal to whites in their abilities . Additional examples are plentiful\u2026\n\u201c Much of the United States was ahead of the world in ending the horror of slavery . Shortly after the signing of the Declaration , northern states took the lead . By 1804 , New York , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Vermont , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania had passed laws that immediately or gradually abolished slavery\u2026 The 1619 Project is politically driven 2020 posturing dressed in the veneer of a historical \u2018 expos\u00e9. \u2019 By warping history , it hopes that dopamine hits of anger and injustice will prevent readers from engaging in objective analysis . Just in time to paint America as racist for the upcoming presidential election . \u201d\n\u201c We now know without a shadow of a doubt that the most influential news organization in the nation , and probably even the world , is operating on an algorithm that forces the multifarious complexity of events in the life of this diverse nation to conform to left-liberal race dogmas . Imagine what it \u2019 s like being a reporter or an editor at the Times , and disagreeing with this radical assessment of American history , and the approach the newspaper ought to take to reporting and analyzing the news . Would you have the courage to speak out ? Of course you wouldn \u2019 t\u2026\n\u201c If the black executive editor of theTimes won \u2019 t even challenge the extreme assertion that \u2018 racism is in everything , \u2019 and ought to dictate how the newspaper does its job , why should you take that risk ? \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
