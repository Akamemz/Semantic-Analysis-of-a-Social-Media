They join seven countries who are still part of the president \u2019 s previous travel ban : Iran , Libya , North Korea , Somalia , Syria , Venezuela and Yemen .\n\u201c It is fundamental to national security , and the height of common sense , that if a foreign nation wishes to receive the benefits of immigration and travel to the United States , it must satisfy basic security conditions outlined by America \u2019 s law-enforcement and intelligence professionals , \u201d said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham .\nOnly immigrant applications from Burma , Eritrea , Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria will be blocked , while other travelers are not affected . For Sudan and Tanzania , only applicants under the diversity visa program will be blocked , a Homeland Security official said .\nThat means businesses can still bring in temporary workers and family members can still visit relatives here .\nThe official said the lower level of ban reflects the countries \u2019 conditions .\n\u201c These six countries have a greater prospect of making improvements , \u201d the official said .\nThe additional ban will take effect Feb. 22 , so nobody traveling now will be affected , nor will those who already have visas . Anyone already in the U.S. is unaffected , too .\nBased on past trends , Homeland Security said perhaps 12,000 people would be affected by the expanded ban .\nImmigrant-rights groups complained that the expanded ban could harm vulnerable people .\n\u201c We are particularly concerned about Burmese refugees who may see America \u2019 s doors closed to them at a time of desperate need \u2014 including thousands of ethnic Chin , Karen , and Muslim Rohingya , who have fled severe persecution , \u201d said Krish O \u2019 Mara Vignarajah , president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service\nMr. Trump issued his first travel ban Jan. 27 , 2017 , on seven majority-Muslim countries , virtually banning all entry of citizens from those countries .\nThat derided as a \u201c Muslim ban , \u201d and was halted by federal judges .\nMr. Trump would make two subsequent revisions to narrow the ban and alter the countries covered , deleting some of the original nations and adding in two non-Muslim nations , North Korea and Venezuela .\nThe Supreme Court in 2018 ruled that version of the ban was legal on its face \u2014 though it left room for challenges on how the ban was carried out . Those challenges are still making their way through lower courts .\nHomeland Security officials defended the new additions to the list , saying they were added after an extensive review of every country \u2019 s vulnerabilities and willingness to share information with the U.S. so that their citizens looking to travel to the U.S. can be properly vetted .\n\u201c DHS and the Department of State have informed each of the six countries about their specific deficiencies , \u201d a Homeland Security official said , adding that countries can earn their way off the list by improving their cooperation .\nThat happened in April 2018 when Chad made enough improvements to be dropped from the travel ban , the official said .",
