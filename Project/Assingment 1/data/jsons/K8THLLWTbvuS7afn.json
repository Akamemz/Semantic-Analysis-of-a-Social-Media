    "content": "Jon Allsop , who writes the Columbia Journalism Review 's daily newsletter , argues that the conversation about when and how to relax COVID-19 lockdowns is a `` false debate '' that misleadingly pits `` lives '' against `` livelihoods . '' In reality , Allsop says , there is `` no choice to be made between public health and a healthy economy\u2014because public health is an essential prerequisite of a healthy economy . ''\nWhile that is true at some level , broad business closure and stay-at-home orders nevertheless entail tradeoffs that can not be wished away by such anodyne assurances . Those tradeoffs are a recurring theme of a recent roundtable in The New York Times Magazine that Allsop himself mentions . The title of the forum is telling : `` Restarting America Means People Will Die . So When Do We Do It ? '' The five panelists\u2014especially Princeton bioethicist Peter Singer\u2014repeatedly call attention to the moral implications of reducing COVID-19 transmission by shutting down large sectors of the economy .\nSinger forthrightly questions `` the assumption\u2026that we have to do everything to reduce the number of deaths . '' That assumption is manifestly wrong , as reflected in the decisions that government agencies make when they assess the cost-effectiveness of health and safety regulations\u2014decisions that routinely take into account not just the deaths that might be prevented but the resources expended to do so . Those assessments assign a large value to preventable deaths , but the value is not and can not be infinite .\n`` At some point , '' Singer says , `` we are willing to trade off loss of life against loss of quality of life . No government puts every dollar it spends into saving lives . And we ca n't really keep everything locked down until there wo n't be any more deaths . So I think that 's something that needs to come into this discussion . How do we assess the overall cost to everybody in terms of loss of quality of life [ and ] loss of well-being as well as the fact that lives are being lost ? ''\nSinger is equally frank in discussing the weight that should be assigned to COVID-19 deaths , whether they are prevented by current control measures or allowed by loosening those restrictions :\nThis is killing mostly older people . I think that 's really relevant . I think we want to take into account the number of life years lost\u2014not just the number of lives lost . The average age of death from COVID in Italy is 79\u00bd . So you do have to ask the question : How many years of life were lost ? Especially when you consider that many of the people who have died had underlying medical conditions . The economist Paul Frijters roughly estimates that Italians lost perhaps an average of three years of life . And that 's very different from a younger person losing 40 years of life or 60 years of life .\nSimilarly , the British epidemiologist Neil Ferguson has estimated that `` as much as half to two-thirds '' of the people who will die from COVID-19 in the U.K. would have died `` anyhow '' by the end of the year because deaths from the disease are concentrated among people who are old and/or have serious preexisting medical conditions .\nAnother participant in the New York Times forum\u2014Zeke Emanuel , vice provost for global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania\u2014reinforces Singer 's point . `` I am a big believer in using life-years saved , rather than just number of deaths avoided , as the goal , '' he says , noting that allocation of scarce medical resources such as ventilators and organs routinely takes that factor into account . Emanuel argues that COVID-19 restrictions could be loosened in June if appropriate testing , surveillance , and contact tracing is possible by then .\nSinger emphasizes that the economic cost of aggressive control measures is morally important and not simply a matter of elevating crass financial concerns above issues of life and death ( the way that New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , among many others , has misleadingly framed the issue ) :\nIf we 're thinking of a year to 18 months [ the projected amount of time required to develop and deploy a vaccine ] of this kind of lockdown , then we really do need to think about the consequences other than in terms of deaths from COVID-19 . I think the consequences are horrific , in terms of unemployment in particular , which has been shown to have a very serious effect on well-being , and particularly for poorer people . Are we really going to be able to continue an assistance package to all of those people for 18 months ? That 's a question each country will have to answer . Maybe some of the affluent countries can , but we have a lot of poor countries that just have no possibility of providing that kind of assistance for their poor people . That 's where we 'll get into saying , `` Yes , people will die if we open up , but the consequences of not opening up are so severe that maybe we 've got to do it anyway . '' If we keep it locked down , then more younger people are going to die because they 're basically not going to get enough to eat or other basics . So those tradeoffs will come out differently in different countries .\nThe economic cost , Singer notes , goes far beyond the immediate impact on people forcibly deprived of their livelihoods :\nWe need to think about this in the context of the well-being of the community as a whole\u2026.We are currently impoverishing the economy , which means we are reducing our capacity in the long term to provide exactly those things that people are talking about that we need\u2014better health care services , better social-security arrangements to make sure that people are n't in poverty . There are victims in the future , after the pandemic , who will bear these costs .
