    "content": "The Eighth Amendment to Ireland \u2019 s constitution is one of the most draconian abortion restrictions in the developed world . Irish voters just decided to repeal it .\nWhile votes are still being counted as of Saturday morning , two exit polls showed a huge margin \u2014 roughly 70-30 \u2014 in favor of repeal . Though exit polls are not always accurate , it is widely seen as implausible they could miss by enough for the amendment to stay in place . A leading anti-repeal group , Save the 8th , has conceded defeat , and Irish politicians are already discussing next steps for moving to a legal abortion regime .\nThe vote , held on Friday , is a historic victory for Irish feminists , who had been campaigning for the amendment \u2019 s repeal ever since it was passed in 1983 . Pro-repeal sentiment was especially strong among young and urban voters , suggesting that a new left-leaning and secular majority had supplanted the more conservative Catholic older generation .\nThe Catholic Church \u2019 s influence over Irish politics has been in decline for years now , owing in part to a series of sexual assault and child abuse scandals ; this referendum shows that a new secular Ireland is here to stay .\n\u201c The biggest change now versus 1983 is the collapse of the Roman Catholic cultural grip across broad swaths of the population , \u201d says Niamh Hardiman , a political scientist at University College Dublin .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that repeal does not mean abortion will automatically become legal . In order for that to happen , Ireland \u2019 s parliament will have to pass a law repealing the country \u2019 s statutory ban on abortion , which exists separately from the constitutional one , and set up a new system for regulated abortion .\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar , who campaigned for repeal , has already released a draft bill that would remove all restrictions on abortions for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and permit it afterward only under specific circumstances ( if the woman \u2019 s health were in danger , for example ) . These rules sound restrictive by US standards , but they are roughly in line with regulations across the European Union . The new rules would be substantially more liberal than current Irish law , which only permits abortion if failing to do so would cause the woman to die .\nIn the wake of the referendum \u2019 s victory , Varadkar \u2019 s bill is widely expected to pass \u2014 meaning that Irish women , and Ireland as a whole , are about to enter a brand new political era .\nAbortion has been illegal in Ireland since at least 1861 , when a ban was imposed by British authorities , and remained illegal after Ireland became independent in the early 20th century . But Ireland only took the extreme step of putting an abortion ban in the constitution in 1983 , a reaction to the gains of the feminist movement in both Ireland and the broader Anglophone world .\nIn 1973 , Ireland \u2019 s Supreme Court ruled that the country \u2019 s ban on contraception was unconstitutional and that it violated citizens \u2019 right to privacy . In the US , a similar court ruling on contraception ( Griswold v. Connecticut ) laid the groundwork for Roe v. Wade , which coincidentally also came down in 1973 . Irish Catholic conservatives , looking at both the American case and the wider successes of the Irish feminist movement on issues like equality in the workplace , got spooked .\n\u201c There was a fear that a court case taken to the Irish courts , or then the European courts , would liberalize abortion in the same way access to contraceptives had been [ liberalized ] , \u201d Mary McAuliffe , a professor of gender studies at University College Dublin , told me . \u201c And so a campaign began , called the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign , after the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1979 \u2014 when the Catholic right felt emboldened . \u201d\nIn 1983 , this idea was put to a national referendum , and what \u2019 s now the Eighth Amendment passed by a resounding 67 percent margin . The text of the amendment was very short and very clear : Fetuses have a right to life \u201c equal \u201d to that of the woman \u2019 s :\nThe State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and , with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother , guarantees in its laws to respect , and , as far as practicable , by its laws to defend and vindicate that right .\nThe result was that Ireland was locked into a draconian abortion prohibition , one that could not constitutionally allow exceptions for rape or even the health of the woman . The only conceivable exception under the text of the Eighth was if the pregnant woman \u2019 s very life were at clear and imminent risk .\nThis strict regulation had a number of unintended consequences . For one , Irish women began flying to Britain ( and , in smaller numbers , other European Union countries ) to get abortions . Between 1980 and 2016 , roughly 170,000 Irish women traveled abroad to get an abortion ( the total population of Ireland today is a little under 5 million ) .\nAt the same time , Irish society changed dramatically .

Doctors determined that miscarriage was unavoidable , and that the process of miscarriage could lead to a dangerous infection .
