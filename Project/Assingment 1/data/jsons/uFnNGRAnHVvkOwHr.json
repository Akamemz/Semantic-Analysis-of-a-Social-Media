    "content": "The Trump administration is stuck between a rock and a hard place as a deadline approaches for Texas and nine other states to file suit against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program .\nNeither the White House nor the Justice Department have said whether they \u2019 ll defend the Obama-era program that \u2019 s set to be challenged in court unless the administration rescinds it by Sept. 5 .\nThat puts the administration in difficult territory , particularly given President Trump \u2019 s vow to protect recipients of the program , known as Dreamers .\nUnder DACA , nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children were given a work permit and protected from deportation .\nAn extension of DACA and a similar program , Deferred Action for Parents of Americans ( DAPA ) , were blocked by United States District Judge Andrew Hanen in 2015 , in a case that ultimately ended in a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court that effectively ended both programs .\nThe DACA extension would have made the program available to a larger group of people , and DAPA would have provided similar benefits to an estimated 3.6 million undocumented immigrants with American-born children .\nThe suit centered on the ability of states to provide driver 's licenses to program beneficiaries , arguing it would be too burdensome for states .\nA separate case against the original DACA was thrown out in 2015 , when a 5th Circuit appeals court dismissed similar arguments by the state of Mississippi and a union of federal immigration agents as not `` sufficiently concrete . ''\nThe new lawsuit , led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton ( R ) , is expected to seek out Hanen 's court , which is widely seen as favorable to the challenge .\nTrump campaigned against DACA , but he has gone on record saying he would treat Dreamers with \u201c heart . \u201d\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson ( Jeff ) Beauregard SessionsLewandowski says he 's open to role defending Trump against impeachment Trump reignites court fight with Ninth Circuit pick Democrats press Nadler to hold Lewandowski in contempt MORE and White House adviser Stephen Miller are seen as internal opponents of extending benefits to any class of undocumented immigrants .\nWhile several officials , starting with Trump and White House chief of staff John Kelly , have voiced sympathy for Dreamers , the administration 's view of the program 's legal standing is suspect .\nIn a press conference on a separate immigration bill last week , Miller wouldn \u2019 t say whether the White House would defend DACA .\n\u201c Well , we are not going to make an announcement on that today because there is ongoing litigation , and DOJ and DHS are reviewing that , \u201d Miller said in response to a question from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nWhile Trump has voiced support for Dreamers , it 's unclear to what extent he supports the program .\nThe president has described DACA and DAPA as \u201c President Obama \u2019 s two illegal executive amnesties . \u201d\nStill , Trump renewed DACA in June in the same memo in which he formally terminated DAPA and a DACA extension . Both DAPA and the extension had previously been blocked by courts , so their official termination had no real-world effects on individual immigrants .\nBut in a one-line statement within that memo , Trump allowed DACA to continue as an official policy , maintaining benefits for the nearly 800,000 beneficiaries of the program and allowing new qualifying applicants to join .\n\u201c It 's a decision that I make and it 's a decision that 's very , very hard to make .
