''\nRepublicans , however , have countered that there is no `` existing '' impeachment inquiry because the House has not voted to open one as it did during the Clinton and Nixon impeachments -- and Tuesday 's resolution does not explicitly open the probe , either .\n`` The resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats \u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote , '' the White House said in a statement . `` It continues this scam by allowing Chairman Schiff , who repeatedly lies to the American people , to hold a new round of hearings , still without any due process for the President . ''\nThe statement continued : `` The White House is barred from participating at all , until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee . Even then , the White House 's rights remain undefined , unclear , and uncertain \u2013 because those rules still haven \u2019 t been written .

''\nThe Democrats ' resolution specifies that ranking Republicans in the minority on the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees ( Reps.

It is common in other proceedings for committee chairs to essentially have veto authority over subpoenas sought by ranking minority members .\nThe resolution also authorizes the Intelligence Committee to conduct an `` open hearing or hearings '' in which minority Republicans have equal time to question witnesses .\nAnd , after that hearing is concluded , `` to allow for full evaluation of minority witness requests , the ranking minority member may submit to the chair , in writing , any requests for witness testimony relevant to the investigation described in the first section of this resolution within 72 hours after notice is given .

The House Rules Committee , which is the gateway for most measures in the House , will meet Wednesday at 3 p.m .
