Another side of the Boston marketing worker believes the election was \u201c stolen \u201d from Hillary Clinton and that every day Trump shows he \u2019 s unfit for the Oval Office .

Some 66 million American citizens voted for someone other than Donald Trump for president . For many of them today \u2013 the day the Electoral College is expected to make Trump \u2019 s election official \u2013 is a Rubicon they can \u2019 t quite believe the nation will cross .\nThat has spawned a kind of political magical thinking .
