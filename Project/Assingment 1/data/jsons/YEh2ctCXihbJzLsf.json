It is the worst party trick .\nI am not , however , deleting Facebook . I have n't even seriously entertained the idea , despite being the author of a useful CNN Business article called , `` Here 's how to delete Facebook . '' I do n't think my leaving would make me happier , or put a dent in the company 's $ 500 billion market value and convince it to change its ways .
