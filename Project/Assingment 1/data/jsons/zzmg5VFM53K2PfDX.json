Will it be safe to travel ? To go to theaters and restaurants and gyms ? Should I finally get around to writing my will ?\nBut just as important are the shifts for businesses and financial markets . The coronavirus trauma will remake everything from national productivity to how much Americans participate in the stock market DJIA , -0.13 % and how much they stash under the mattress .
