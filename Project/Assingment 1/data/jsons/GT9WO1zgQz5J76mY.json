Ambassador Nikki Haley \u2019 s surprise announcement to resign by the end of the year sent shock waves across Washington \u2019 s foreign policy landscape Tuesday , triggering speculation that President Trump is gearing up for a new hard-line shift on international affairs as he heads toward his third year in office .\nWith Mr. Trump saying he \u2019 ll nominate a successor within three weeks , foreign diplomats are already speculating that the president is bent on naming someone who \u2019 ll take his \u201c America First \u201d agenda toward the United Nations to heights even Ms. Haley may have balked at during her run as ambassador over the past 20 months .\n\u201c A lot of U.N. officials and foreign diplomats will fret that Trump will select a much more hard-line unilateralist to replace Haley , \u201d said Richard Gowan , a Columbia University professor and expert on U.N. politics .\nOthers say Mr. Trump , who claimed Tuesday to have known for months of Ms. Haley \u2019 s intention to leave the post by the end of 2018 , decided suddenly to fast-track her resignation to ensure a successor can be confirmed quickly by the Republican-controlled Senate ahead of a difficult and uncertain midterm vote next month .\n\u201c This administration is all politics all the time , so it wouldn \u2019 t surprise me that they wanted to get ahead of the election , \u201d said Gordon Adams , a long-time foreign policy commentator who teaches at American University . While Mr. Adams added that \u201c it \u2019 s not clear at all why [ Ms. Haley ] resigned \u201d and \u201c it \u2019 s almost impossible to read meaning into it , \u201d there were signs Tuesday that Democrats are already gearing up to make life difficult for whomever Mr. Trump nominates to the post .\nNew Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who could wield the panel gavel with a huge Democratic wave in November , said Tuesday Ms. Haley \u2019 s surprise resignation was a \u201c sign of the Trump administration \u2019 s chaotic foreign policy , \u201d adding that he \u2019 s \u201c deeply concerned about the leadership vacuum she leaves and the national security impact of her departure at this time of continued disarray for this administration . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Ivanka Trump : Nikki Haley \u2019 s replacement \u2018 will not be me \u2019\nMs. Haley was one of the administration \u2019 s few foreign policy \u201c stars \u201d in the early months of the Trump administration , when then-Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and senior White House national security aides struggled to fit Mr. Trump \u2019 s policy preferences to a more traditional foreign policy-making machinery . With the rise of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John R. Bolton as trusted executors of Mr. Trump \u2019 s agenda , Ms. Haley \u2019 s role has been less prominent .\nThe list of names circulating as possible Haley successors included U.S . Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell and former administration adviser Dina Powell . But the surprise vacancy also fueled some speculation that Mr. Trump might turn to his daughter Ivanka or son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 both White House advisers \u2014 to fill what the president said has become an increasingly \u201c glamorous \u201d assignment .\nMr. Trump told reporters \u201c Ivanka would be dynamite \u201d as U.N. ambassador , but that he doesn \u2019 t want to be accused of nepotism . The president separately said Mrs. Powell , who served as a deputy national security adviser through 2017 but left during an exodus of administration officials at the end of the president \u2019 s first year , is \u201c under consideration . \u201d\nAnalysts said Mr. Grenell may be a top choice of the hawkish Mr. Bolton , who is widely seen to be the most hardline member of the president \u2019 s inner foreign policy circle . Mr. Grenell served under Mr. Bolton when he was U.N. ambassador in the George W. Bush administration .\nMr. Kushner \u2019 s name came to the fore , meanwhile , because Ms. Haley unexpectedly referred to him as a \u201c hidden genius \u201d during the unusual Oval Office session with Mr. Trump announcing her resignation on Tuesday .\nHow the transition to a new U.N. ambassador ultimately plays out will impact \u201c the internal balance of power within the Trump administration , \u201d said P.J . Crowley , who served as an assistant secretary of state for public affairs in the Obama administration .\nThe extent of the impact is going to depend on Ms. Haley \u2019 s \u201c replacement and that person \u2019 s relationship with the president , \u201d Mr. Crowley said in an email Tuesday .\n\u201c There is not a long line of folks willing to serve in an international organization given the administration \u2019 s skepticism of multilateralism , \u201d he wrote .\nWhoever gets the nod will have big shoes to fill . While foreign diplomats \u201c often had fierce differences \u201d with Ms. Haley over issues like Israel , Iran and internal U.N. reforms , Mr. Gowan said , she \u201c did earn other diplomats \u2019 respect . \u201d\n\u201c She was a pragmatist and showed real diplomatic skill handling problems like North Korea with the Chinese in the Security Council , \u201d he said .
