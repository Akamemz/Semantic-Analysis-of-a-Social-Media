Big business is bringing the GOP into the future .\nMark McKinnon is chairman of Texas Wins and former media adviser to George W.

I \u2019 ve always been attracted to the GOP message of more freedom and less government , but thought it hypocritical and counter to the core of our philosophy that Republicans would not apply those tenets to gay rights . But of course I was often the black sheep in campaign meetings during the 1990s and 2000s . There goes McKinnon again . Taking up for the gays . Although \u201c gay \u201d wasn \u2019 t the word that was used back then .\nPolitically , while it once helped political parties to use gay rights to divide and score political points ( and the GOP didn \u2019 t have a monopoly on the issue ; remember it was Bill Clinton who signed the Defense of Marriage Act ) , the wedge issue has now lost its edge , even , I would argue , in the 2016 Republican presidential primary . No Republican can win the nomination without the support of the business community . And Big Business is now at odds with the social conservative faction of the Republican Party over gay and transgender equality \u2014 and Big Business is winning .\nLook at what \u2019 s happened in four states dominated by the GOP in the past year .\nWeeks before the Super Bowl kickoff in 2014 , the Arizona Legislature passed a bill allowing businesses to refuse service to gay customers . This \u201c religious freedom \u201d measure made it OK for business owners to kick customers out of their establishments if they opposed homosexuality on religious grounds . Scores of corporate titans in the travel and tourism industry , together with the NFL , opposed the bill . Gov . Jan Brewer vetoed it .\nIn Indiana this March , lawmakers tried to pass similar legislation , followed by a hell-hath-no-fury response led by Eli Lilly , Salesforce and Angie \u2019 s List , which canceled a $ 40 million project planned for Indianapolis . Marriott \u2019 s CEO said the legislation was \u201c pure idiocy from a business perspective. \u201d Gov . Mike Pence modified the bill , but the damage was done . ( The state has since hired a global PR firm to resuscitate its image following the brouhaha . )\nIn Arkansas , same story . Seeing the firestorm that occurred in Indiana , Republican Gov . Asa Hutchinson didn \u2019 t sign the original bill that hit his desk after calls for him to veto it came from his own son , and from Arkansas-based Wal-Mart , which said the bill ran counter to the company \u2019 s values . In the end , the governor signed a less toxic , less controversial bill .\nAnd this week , Texas became the latest to join the fray .\nThe Lone Star State just wrapped its legislative session , which included two \u201c religious freedom \u201d constitutional amendments . Learning from what happened in the above states , industry groups and major businesses went out pre-emptively \u2014 let me say that again : pre-emptively \u2014 before such bills made it too far in the Legislature . The conservative state chamber of commerce , the Texas Association of Business , took the lead .\nThe amendments \u201c would devastate economic development , tourism and the convention business , \u201d said Bill Hammond , TAB \u2019 s CEO . \u201c One has to look no further than Indiana to realize what a detriment this would be , and how hard it would be to sell Texas to the rest of the country .
