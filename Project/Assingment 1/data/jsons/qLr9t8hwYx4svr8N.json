    "content": "Jesse Kelly , a conservative writer , radio host , and failed Republican political candidate , is no longer welcome on Twitter : The social media site permanently banned him on Sunday , for reasons unknown .\nMany on the right saw this as evidence that Twitter is unfairly silencing conservatives ; others were neither surprised nor particularly sad to see Kelly disappear . Twitter is a private company and can ban anyone it wants , of course . But it would be helpful if the site administrators explained what exactly Kelly did to merit such draconian measures\u2014especially if Twitter wishes to put a damper on the right-wing notion that social media censorship is a serious issue meriting federal intervention .\nIt 's not clear which tweets got Kelly in trouble , or if it was something else . The decision to ban him could have been the result of baseless complaints , or even an error on Twitter 's part . Kelly told other conservative writers that he was left completely in the dark , reportedly receiving the following message from Twitter : `` Your account was permanently suspended due to multiple or repeat violations of the Twitter rules . The account will not restored . Please do not respond to this email as replies and new appeals for this account will not be monitored . ''\nIf this was truly the full extent of Twitter 's communication with Kelly , then the social media platform has violated its own policy . As the writer Jeryl Bier pointed out , Twitter 's terms claim that a permanent ban will be accompanied by an explanation of which policies were violated `` and which content was in violation . ''\nKelly 's tough-guy shtick is fairly obnoxious . He called Sen. Jeff Flake ( R\u2013AZ ) a coward for siding with `` the enemy '' ( Democrats ) and delaying the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court . He also fantasized about a second American civil war , refusing to submit passively to `` the liberal utopian nightmare of 57 genders . '' But if demonizing your political opponents is a crime on Twitter , there are millions more accounts to ban . To my knowledge , Kelly has n't engaged in the kind of targeted harassment or direct advocacy of violence that should earn a rebuke from the platform . And if he has , Twitter should point it out .\nI say should , because this free service is not obligated to humor its conservative users ' desire for transparency and fairness , no matter how loudly they complain . But the idea that major tech companies are beholden to progressive goals is becoming a major talking point on cable news ; absent proper justification , Twitter 's treatment of Kelly will add fuel to this fire .",
