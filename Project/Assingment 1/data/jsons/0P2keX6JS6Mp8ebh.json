This firestorm has engulfed the Trump campaign , prompting denunciations from the nominee 's running mate and wife , and a rare apology from Trump himself . Mike Pence is reportedly `` beside himself '' over the episode , telling Trump that he can not speak on his behalf for at least 48 hours . His official calendar has been cleared . With rank-and-file Republicans and major GOP donors in a state of panic , one major Trump ally and surrogate told Fox News that there are more shoes left to drop :\nDr. Ben Carson tells @ FoxNews more Trump revelations are coming . \u2014 toddstarnes ( @ toddstarnes ) October 8 , 2016\nRadio host Hugh Hewitt , who has been urging listeners to support Trump for weeks , joined the chorus of voices seeking Trump 's ouster , citing `` more and worse oppo '' to come . The nominee himself is defiant , insisting that he will never , ever leave the race :\nThe media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE , WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN ! # MAGA \u2014 Donald J.

The smallest plurality of Republican voters in modern-era primary history granted her wish . In light of Carson 's comment and Hewitt 's suggestion , I began digging a bit , eventually connecting with a right-leaning Trump opponent and operative who told me with a seemingly strong degree of confidence that at least two more mega bombs are waiting to fall on Trump 's head before November 8th :\nAnti-Trump operative tells me 2 more big oppo hits coming .

We 'll see . \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) October 8 , 2016\nThis individual declined to offer any more information when I sought further information , so it 's probably wise to take this information of a grain of salt . Then again , CNN has already reported comments from Trump during an interview with Howard Stern in which he assented to allow the host to refer to his daughter , Ivanka , as a `` piece of ass . '' In my judgment , that 's much closer to sexualized `` locker room banter '' than what voters heard on the Access Hollywood tape yesterday ; that involved boasting of infidelity and an explicit articulation of his attitude of absolute sexual entitlement due to his celebrity status . Nevertheless , there is a strong creepiness factor listening to a grown man agree to such a description of his own child . The road ahead for Republicans in 2016 is now fraught with growing concerns . Some of Trump 's most devoted followers are furious over the party 's increasing abandonment of their man . Some may withhold their support of other Republicans as revenge . Anti-Trump or Trump-skeptical Republicans may be so demoralized and disgusted that they may not turn out . Down ticket GOP candidates appeared to be weathering this cycle 's wild storm rather well so far , despite Trump 's rollercoaster performance in public polling -- which was already on a major down-swing before this 'October Surprise ' reared its head . That calculus just got struck by political lightning . Any predictions about exactly how it 'll shake out prior to solid , scientific , post-debate polling are pure conjecture . But if there truly are more bombshells coming , the party could be in real trouble .
