    "content": "President Obama recently sat down with the editorial board of Iowa 's largest newspaper , the Des Moines Register , for what his campaign stipulated would be an off-the-record discussion :\nThe Des Moines Register \u2019 s publisher and I spoke with President Barack Obama this morning \u2014 but we can \u2019 t tell you what he said . Just four days before the Register \u2019 s presidential endorsement is released , Laura Hollingsworth and I received a phone call from the president . He was calling from Florida , on the heels of a morning campaign appearance and about 14 hours after his debate with GOP nominee Mitt Romney at Lynn University in Boca Raton , Fla . The conference call lasted nearly 30 minutes and was an incredibly informative exchange of questions , answers and an insightful glimpse into the president \u2019 s vision for a second term . He made a genuine and passionate case for our endorsement and for reelection . Just two weeks before Election Day , the discussion , I believe , would have been valuable to all voters , but especially those in Iowa and around the country who have yet to decide between the incumbent Democrat and his Republican opponent . Unfortunately , what we discussed was off-the-record . It was a condition , we were told , set by the White House .\nThe Register 's editors contrast this rigmarole from the most transparent administration evah with the access they were granted by Mitt Romney 's campaign :\nRomney appeared before our board Oct. 9 . We literally met in a barn on a family farm owned by Jeff Koch , just west of Van Meter . We had a wide-ranging conversation in a little under an hour of access . He squeezed us in just before a campaign stop that spotlighted his agriculture policies . With the exception of one final question ( \u201c Why have you earned the Des Moines Register \u2019 s endorsement ? \u201d ) his camp said the interview could not be videotaped , which has become our typical practice with politicians meeting our editorial board . But the audio was digitally recorded and posted on DesMoinesRegister.com .\nThat full audio is available here , by the way . With Iowa looking like a dead heat , an endorsement from a major newspaper could help tip the scales -- so after a protracted battle , Team Obama finally relented and agreed to allow the content of meeting to be released for the record . During that roundtable conversation , Obama predicted Latino voters would push him over the top in November because Republicans have alienated the growing demographic . The president was also asked about his decision to spend his substantial political capital , and exploit his large Congressional majorities , to aggressively push his partisan health care law , rather than in pursuit of other economic priorities . Obama 's answer ? `` Absolutely '' no regrets :\nQUESTION : \u201c Some say you had a super majority in your first two years and had this incredible opportunity , but because of what you were talking about , as you were running , you had to go to get Obamacare done . Do you have any regrets taking on some of the economic issues , some of the issues that we 're talking about for your second term , that when you had the chance , so to speak , during your first -- do you have any regrets that you didn \u2019 t do that at that time ? \u201d OBAMA : \u201c Absolutely not , Laura . \u201d\nObama projects unflinching confidence that he was entirely correct to put jobs , economic growth , immigration reform -- everything -- on the back burner in order to jam through Obamacare . He 's proud of his law , which raises government healthcare spending , hikes family premiums , adds to the deficit , rations care through an unelected panel of bureaucrats , exacerbates our doctor shortage , and boots millions off of plans they hoped to keep . All of these outcomes explicitly violate promises the president made during the national healthcare debate . Meanwhile , the nation 's economic outlook remains bleak .
