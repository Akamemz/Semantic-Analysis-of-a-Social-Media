Terror takes a front seat\n\nPresident Barack Obama wasn\u2019t shy about invoking Osama bin Laden\u2019s killing during the 2012 campaign \u2014 but when it comes to his larger approach to terrorism he\u2019s pursued a policy of speaking softly and ordering lots of drone strikes.\n\nThat delicate balance was shattered by the Boston Marathon attack, thrusting a downplayed anti-terror campaign into the spotlight and the issue of terrorism to the top of Obama\u2019s second-term priorities, at least in the short term.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama, whose 2008 election was propelled by opposition to the Iraq War, has jettisoned the clash-of-civilizations rhetoric favored by George W. Bush \u2014 even as he\u2019s embraced or ramped up many of the same anti-terror methods \u2014 the deployment of unmanned drones, warrant-less wiretapping, the open-ended use of Guantanamo Bay to warehouse potential terrorists.\n\n( PHOTOS: 18 defining Obama moments)\n\nThose two seemingly contradictory strategies are bound by a single motive: Obama wanted to go after terrorists without allowing the War on Terror to devour a second presidency, hoping to put it on the back burner behind domestic issues, the economy and his top foreign policy priority of rebuilding America\u2019s image around the world.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got this disconnect between his body language, his emotions and his actions,\u201d says former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer, who thinks Obama has charted the right course in the wake of the Boston attacks so far. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of how he wants to prioritize the public discussion\u2026 He\u2019s been pretty tough and good on anti-terror policy but he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it that much\u2026 He doesn\u2019t want this to be the conversation, he doesn\u2019t want to lean in to it emotionally like [we] did.\n\n\u201cThat will have to change now, obviously,\u201d he added.\n\nObama and his advisers have counseled moderation and engagement to deal with the challenge of radicalization over the years, but the marathon attacks are already spurring demands for a tougher response. The standard Obama approach doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to work \u2014 there\u2019s deep concern about the independent, homegrown nature of the attackers and key Congressional Republicans immediately criticized the administration for its decision not to classify the captured bomber as an enemy combatant.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev)\n\n\u201cEven if it turns out that these guys aren\u2019t foreign-directed, that you had at least one American citizen launching a homegrown terrorist attack on American soil, that changes the game,\u201d says Matt Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman under Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\n\u201cFor years, the president and experts have warned about this kind of homegrown terrorism, coming from communities in our midst, but it hasn\u2019t happened and the public didn\u2019t really pay that much attention to the threat\u2026 The issue of radicalization of our own people is now a reality, and that\u2019s something this administration has feared for a long time,\u201d he added.\n\nIn statements to the press, and in his speech at the memorial service for the three people killed at the marathon last week, Obama has taken pains to avoid casting the attack as part of a larger conflict, warning people not to draw \u201cpremature\u201d conclusions from the reports surfacing about the Chechen brothers accused of detonating a pair or crude but murderous homemade pressure-cooker bombs.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: W.H.: Suspect not 'enemy combatant')\n\nBut, as commander-in-chief, he\u2019s also been careful to strike a defiant tone, keeping the door open to a broader response if the attack is found to be part of a larger plot.",
