Then there is the generations-long fight for political gains among African Americans , helping culminate in the re-election of the nation 's first black president .\nThe growing political power among other minority groups and vocal youth vote has meant that the party these groups largely back -- Democrats -- netted huge gains during this election cycle .\nThe new American electorate , it seems , has arrived .
