Not likely .\nHealth industry consultant Bob Laszewski says it \u2019 s too late for these measures to help Americans losing their policies on January 1 . If Congress and the president agreed to a new law , insurance companies would still need time to re-open canceled plans , state insurance commissioners would have to expedite the approval of those plans ( a process that usually takes months ) , and Americans would need time to choose to sign up for their old plan or hold out for a subsidized Obamacare plan .\n\u201c You \u2019 ve got to have a process where [ insurers ] send them a letter , and you have to work with their questions , and they have to affirmatively sign up for left or right , \u201d Laszewski tells THE WEEKLY STANDARD . \u201c You \u2019 re not going to do that in six weeks . \u201d\nRegardless , if legislation gets through the House and Senate in an effort at least trying to get plans back , it will land on President Obama 's desk . At that point , he 'll have to either sign it in an attempt to make up for his bogus `` if you like your plan you can keep it '' promise , or he 'll veto it , making matters even worse .\nWe have an insurance crisis looming . Millions of Americans will no longer have health insurance on January 1 thanks to Obamacare and millions still are n't able to sign up for new plans through healthcare.gov . Train-wreck indeed .",
