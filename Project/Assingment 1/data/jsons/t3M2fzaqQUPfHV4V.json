    "content": "Back when he was a Republican senator , Attorney General Jeff Sessions once called President Obama an \u201c emperor. \u201d Republican Gov . Chris Christie of New Jersey once called him a \u201c dictator. \u201d Four years ago Donald Trump , too , was part of the chorus .\n\u201c Why is @ BarackObama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority ? \u201d Mr. Trump tweeted in 2012 , pointing to a defense-related order .\nNow that Trump is president , and has unleashed his own wave of executive actions , Republicans have responded with applause , Democrats with alarm .\nWith great flourish , Mr. Trump has signed one executive order and memorandum after another . Some undo actions by Mr. Obama , such as last week \u2019 s reversal of protections for transgender students .\nOthers push into new territory , and have elicited an uproar \u2013 foremost a temporary ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and indefinite suspension of Syrian refugee resettlement . The measure is now legally on hold , and the administration is expected to release a new version this week .\nTrump administration directives aimed at more aggressive enforcement of the nation \u2019 s immigration laws have also instilled fear in immigrant communities , and anxiety among their supporters . Trump adviser Stephen Miller only deepened the fear when he asserted on TV that presidential powers on national security \u201c will not be questioned . \u201d\nSome voters express deep concern that Trump is a nascent autocrat , and see his actions through that lens .\nBut so far there is no evidence that he has gone further in his use of executive power than President Obama , some of whose actions were overturned by the Supreme Court . While federal courts suspended Trump 's travel ban while they consider its constitutionality , it remains to be seen whether Trump 's actions will withstand legal scrutiny in the nation 's highest court .\n\u201c The idea that we \u2019 re off on an unprecedented dictatorial path ? \u201d says Steven Schier , a presidential scholar at Carleton College in Northfield , Minn. \u201c No . Not happening . Not yet . Maybe down the road , but not now . \u201d\nIf Trump , for example , were to insist that his \u201c travel ban \u201d was constitutional , and he ignored the courts and demanded that his administration enforce the ban as originally written , that would be an authoritarian move , says Professor Schier .\n\u201c What is he doing instead ? He \u2019 s rewriting it to make it acceptable to the courts and to more people in the political system , \u201d Schier says . \u201c That doesn \u2019 t sound like an unprecedented dictatorial path . \u201d\nIn a way , Trump is behaving like many other American presidents . From George Washington on , presidents have invoked the Constitution in issuing orders that don \u2019 t require congressional approval . At times , the courts have shot them down . But more often , executive actions have stood , effectively carrying the power of law .\nOf course , in other ways , Trump is an utterly atypical president \u2013 with his tweets , his misstatements of fact , his attacks on the media , his emphasis at times on quick action over careful planning . And he faces major pushback from liberals and other voters who see his treatment of undocumented immigrants , Muslims , and transgender people as unfair , inhumane , and undemocratic .\n\u201c Trump made all these utterances as a candidate that sounded dictatorial , \u201d says Schier . \u201c But look at what he \u2019 s doing , not what he \u2019 s saying . And what he \u2019 s doing is not out of bounds or unusual for a new president . \u201d\nOthers argue that the words matter , however \u2013 as a signal of where he intends to take the country .\n\u201c Trump and the people around him have been quite open about their desire to smash the system , \u201d says Ken Mayer , a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin , Madison .\nProfessor Mayer points to remarks Thursday by top Trump adviser Stephen Bannon at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference , in which he talked about \u201c the deconstruction of the administrative state \u201d \u2013 that is , cuts to government agencies and the slashing of regulations .\n\u201c If you look at these cabinet appointees , they were selected for a reason and that is the deconstruction \u201d of the administrative state , Mr. Bannon said , referring to the proliferation of regulations that many conservatives see as usurping Congress \u2019 s authority .\nOn how to take aggressive executive action , Trump needed look no further than his immediate predecessor .\nIt \u2019 s not just that Obama signed a series of executive orders in his first days in office , as Trump did . Mr. Obama \u2019 s predecessors did the same . It \u2019 s Obama \u2019 s use of executive power to effect big , sweeping change that captured Trump \u2019 s fancy .\nTrump the candidate said as much . Obama has \u201c led the way \u201d on executive orders , he said in January 2016 . \u201c But I \u2019 m going to use them much better and they \u2019 re going to serve a much better purpose than he \u2019 s done , \u201d Trump added .\nWhat 's different , now that Trump is president , is the speed and scope of his turn to major executive actions .\nObama \u2019 s switch to a \u201c pen and phone \u201d strategy , as he called it , came after the Democrats lost control of Congress . Trump has both houses of Congress in his corner , but he \u2019 s already acting unilaterally in a big way , most controversially on illegal immigration .\nTrump 's three orders in that area deal with the border wall and \u201c immigration enforcement improvements , \u201d sanctuary cities , and the travel ban . Follow-up directives to support the first of these orders expand the pool of illegal immigrants subject to deportation , call for thousands more enforcement agents , and enlist local law enforcement in making arrests .\nObama , for his part , moved to defer deportation of certain groups after Democrats failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform in Congress .\nSuch executive action from Obama on immigration , plus other moves related to the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , recess appointments , climate change , gay rights , welfare reform , and education , led to cries that he was behaving like an \u201c imperial president . \u201d\nIn some instances , his actions were struck down or temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court .
