    "content": "Once resigned to a November defeat , swing state Republicans are increasingly optimistic about Donald Trump \u2019 s chances now that the GOP presidential nominee has closed a once-yawning deficit in the polls against Hillary Clinton .\nThat \u2019 s according to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus \u2014 a panel of activists , operatives and strategists in 11 battleground states , 10 of which President Barack Obama carried in 2012 . While a majority of GOP insiders still say Clinton would carry their state if the election were held today , significantly more Republicans now say Trump would win than even just a few weeks ago .\nBut despite Trump \u2019 s improving prospects , GOP insiders express little confidence in the Trump campaign \u2019 s infrastructure \u2014 particularly compared with how Democrats feel about Clinton \u2019 s campaign .\nStill , the uptick in how Republicans view Trump \u2019 s chances is striking . In this week \u2019 s survey , 61 percent of GOP insiders said Clinton would win their state , but the 39 percent who picked Trump to win is a new high-water mark for the GOP nominee . It \u2019 s a measure The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus tracks on a weekly basis , and for most of August , only about one-in-five Republican insiders thought Trump would win their state .\n\u201c Trump has turned the tide in Ohio , and he would win by a microscopic margin if the race were held today , \u201d said a Republican there . ( All respondents completed the survey anonymously . )\n\u201c The political landscape has changed in the past few weeks in Colorado , as well as the nation , \u201d added a Republican there . \u201c Reluctant Republicans are realizing the choice is ideological , angry Bernie supporters just ca n't support Hillary because of what the DNC leaks exposed , and independents are indicating many will also throw support for Trump in Colorado because Hillary is so toxic . \u201d\nAn Iowa Republican added : \u201c Hillary has spent millions here . She 's pounded on him for months , unopposed and unrelenting . And she 's still behind . She 's functionally the incumbent and she has little to no room for growth . In short : she has n't put him away , she probably ca n't put him away , so he wins . \u201d\nStill , many Republicans still think Clinton \u2019 s organizational advantage will prevail .\n\u201c Tightening numbers make the ground game even more important , \u201d said a New Hampshire Republican , \u201c and without a Trump ground game \u2026 he ca n't win here . \u201d\nGOP insiders are mostly downcast about the state of Trump \u2019 s organization . Only 17 percent said they have \u201c a lot of confidence \u201d in the Trump campaign infrastructure in their state , while 39 percent have \u201c only some confidence \u201d in the campaign , and 44 percent have \u201c no confidence at all . \u201d\nDemocrats are much more confident about Clinton \u2019 s campaign : 82 percent said they have \u201c a lot of confidence , \u201d much more than the 17 percent who express \u201c only some confidence \u201d and 1 percent who have \u201c no confidence at all . \u201d\nAnecdotes from the field about the Trump ground game amount to the stuff of nightmares for national Republicans .\n\u2014 A Colorado Republican : \u201c The most visible manifestation of Trump 's campaign in Jefferson County , Colorado , is a small office in a low-rent building that also happens to feature a psychic and a massage parlor . Add to that the constant robocalls , and Trump 's Colorado effort has the look and feel of a county commissioner campaign . \u201d\n\u2014 A Florida Republican said Trump was operating the \u201c weakest Republican campaign in the state since \u2026 well , I 've only been working here 30 years and can not think of one worse . \u201d\n\u2014 A Michigan Republican : \u201c The Trump campaign hired a number of staff , but they are all from out of state . \u201d\n\u2014A New Hampshire Republican : \u201c Are you telling me there is a Trump infrastructure in New Hampshire ? I have more confidence in the Red Sox ' bullpen than I do in the Trump infrastructure . \u201d\n\u2014 An Ohio Republican : \u201c They have a pro at the top , \u201d in state director Bob Paduchik , \u201c but he has a staff of C players . Right now , they are putting a premium on yard sign locations vs. an actual Get Out The Vote effort . \u201d\n\u2014 A Pennsylvania Republican : \u201c They seem to have signs out and about , so I suppose they have something in place . \u201d\n\u2014 A Virginia Republican : \u201c Republican officials tell me they are having a hard time getting Trump signs , and the locals have to pay for them . So far I have seen no walk-around literature , which we had at this point in 2008 and 2012 . \u201d\n\u201c The Trump campaign infrastructure is in better shape in Iowa than in other states , \u201d said a Republican there , \u201c primarily because of the establishment support he has attracted there . However , the campaign is still far behind the Clinton effort in terms of staff and resources on the ground . It may not matter , though , because a drive through rural Iowa reveals a far greater level of organic support for Trump than for Clinton . \u201d\nAdded an Ohio Republican : \u201c Bob Paduchik knows Ohio very well , and he 's an elite political operative with few peers . If he 's given the resources , he can help Trump win Ohio . \u201d\nFor Democrats , Clinton \u2019 s more developed and sophisticated organization is a panacea at a time when the polls are tightening . In addition to the strong ratings insiders gave her campaign , the vast majority of Democrats , 94 percent , said she would win their state if the election were held today , though that 's down from a range of 98 percent to 100 percent in the past five weeks .\n\u201c Just here in Hamilton County we have five Hillary offices , three dozen paid field staff and hundreds of engaged volunteers , \u201d said an Ohio Democrat . \u201c Trump does not have a single office . \u201d\nA North Carolina Democrat called it the \u201c best I have ever seen here . Better than Obama in 2008 or 2012 . \u201d\nEven so , some Democrats are less satisfied with Clinton \u2019 s organization .\n\u201c It is good , but it is n't anywhere close to Obama , \u201d said a Florida Democrat .\n\u201c This is a young , talented team but only knows what Brooklyn tells them , \u201d added an Iowa Democrat . \u201c They are n't spending enough to cancel how low her numbers are in the state . \u201d\nAnd one New Hampshire Democrat recalled Clinton \u2019 s landslide loss to Bernie Sanders in the first-in-the-nation primary .\n\u201c The infrastructure is good . But is the candidate ? \u201d the Democrat asked . \u201c Bernie blew the same team Clinton out of the water in February . Infrastructure can only go so far with a flawed candidate . \u201d\nThese are the members of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus , not all of whom participated in this special survey :\nColorado : Ryan Call , Laura Carno , Matt Chandler , Will Coyne , Adam Eichberg , Mark Ferrandino , Cole Finegan , Michael Fortney , Andrew Freedman , Ted Harvey , Craig Hughes , Owen Loftus , Pete Maysmith , Frank McNulty , Karen Middleton , Christopher Murray , BJ Nikkel , Josh Penry , Rick Ridder , Alan Salazar , Janice Sinden , Pat Steadman , Pat Waak , Steve Welchert , Taylor West , Roxane White , Rob Witwer\nFlorida : Fernand Amandi , Scott Arceneaux , JP Austin , Tim Baker , Dennis K.
