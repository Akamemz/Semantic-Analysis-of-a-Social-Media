Ilhan Omar claimed on Twitter Sunday that 40 percent of people in the United States have less than $ 400 in their bank accounts .\nThe claim also made recent appearances in comments by Sen.

Households in 2018 , which found that 61 percent of Americans said they would be able to cover a hypothetical expense of $ 400 using cash they had on hand , savings , or a credit card which would then be paid off on their next statement . In that same report , 27 percent of respondents said they would cover the expense some other way , such as carrying a balance on their credit card or borrowing from friends and family , and 12 percent said they would be unable to cover the expense at all .\nThe report notes , however , that \u201c [ a ] lthough so many incurring additional costs for a modest expense is disconcerting , it is possible that some would choose to borrow even if they had $ 400 available , preserving their cash as a buffer for other expenses. \u201d In other words , the study was a self-reported record of how people would respond to an unforeseen additional $ 400 expense . It did not directly address whether respondents had $ 400 in their bank account .\nIn fact , the report cites a study based on the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances by Neil Bhutta and Lisa Dettling , which found that even with monthly expenses included , \u201c 76 percent of families have at least $ 400 in liquid savings. \u201d This directly contradicts Omar \u2019 s claim .\nEven if this statistic were true , however , it still wouldn \u2019 t serve as a good indicator of how well most Americans will be able to withstand the economic distress brought on by the current reality . The study that Omar cited used $ 400 to represent \u201c small , unexpected expenses \u201d individuals might face , but that number is likely far lower than the financial shortfall faced by many Americans during a prolonged economic shutdown without a clear end date .\nTo address this question , the Bhutta and Dettling study offered a far better\u2014and more dire\u2014indicator , noting that \u201c only about 40 percent of families have liquid savings equivalent to at least three months of expenses , and less than 30 percent have liquid savings equivalent to at least six months of expenses . \u201d\nThere is no evidence to support Rep.
