    "content": "Illegal immigration across the Southwest border has surged back to Obama-era levels , according to the latest data released last week that suggests the gains President Trump made early in his tenure have worn off .\nNearly 40,000 illegal immigrants were nabbed attempting to jump the border in November , which was up about 12 percent compared to October , and more than twice the monthly numbers from March and April , when Mr. Trump touted his early accomplishments .\nPerhaps just as worrisome for officials is the rise in families traveling together , which surged 45 percent last month , and unaccompanied minors traveling without parents , which rose 26 percent in November , according to the numbers released Friday .\nHomeland Security said those numbers are still an improvement over the worst years of President Obama .\n\u201c Under President Trump , illegal immigration has declined dramatically over the last year , \u201d said spokesman Tyler Q. Houston .\nBut he said more needs to be done , and said action needs to come from Capitol Hill .\n\u201c The administration is working tirelessly to secure the border , enhance interior enforcement and establish a merit-based immigration system .
