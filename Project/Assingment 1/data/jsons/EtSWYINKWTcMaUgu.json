    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 In the weeks after a pair of massacres in El Paso , Texas , and Dayton , Ohio , left 31 dead , local police and federal authorities scrambled to contain a succession of chilling new threats .\nA Florida man allegedly vows to `` break a world record '' for mass shooting casualties ; a disgruntled hotel cook in California threatens to transform a Marriott lobby into a killing field ; a Jewish community center in Ohio is the target in a suspected shooting plot .\nPolice stopped each one before anyone was harmed . But the arrests , spanning just over a week , highlighted a frequent theme in the government 's efforts to prevent domestic terrorism and other forms of mass violence : law enforcement did n't see the potentially deadly storms approaching until members of the public stepped forward with crucial information , and authorities had little power to intercede until an attack appeared imminent .\nThe FBI has warned for months that domestic terrorism , often animated by racial animus and religious discord , represents one of the United States ' most pressing national security threats . Yet time after time the central weapons against such threats for local and federal law enforcement have largely proved to be timely tips , or even a stroke of luck .\nIn the 18 years since 9/11 , the United States has taken aggressive steps to prevent terrorist acts in the name of the Islamic State , al-Qaida and other international terror groups . The government built a vast security apparatus to target threats to the United States from extremist groups based overseas , including an extensive effort to identify , track and arrest Americans who give them support .\nMore : 'People are on edge ' : Mass violence threats \u2013 at least 30 in 18 states \u2013 have surged since El Paso , Dayton\nMore:3 mass shooting plots stopped around the country in separate incidents , police say\nPotential domestic attackers , largely untethered to specific organizations and protected from police scrutiny by free-speech rights , have proven more difficult for the government to investigate .

''\nCongress could be moving in that direction : Recent mass shootings have prompted members of both parties to seriously consider legislation that would expand the government 's authority over domestic terrorist threats . House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , and Sen. Martha McSally , R-Ariz. , have proposed bills that would essentially allow federal law enforcement to pursue domestic terror suspects as they would international operatives .\nWhile domestic terrorism is codified in federal law as an effort to `` intimidate or coerce '' a civilian population or government , there are no corresponding criminal penalties to back it . That has law enforcement officials moving to head off potential threats with the tools at their disposal , including leaning on the public to provide tips and charging suspects with violating weapons laws , hate crimes or illegal threats in the absence of a domestic terrorism charge .\nNot every mass attack would meet that standard . Local and federal officials investigating the Dayton shooting said they have found evidence of the shooter 's `` violent ideology , '' though they did not offer specific information on the gunman 's motivations . And some of the plots authorities said they thwarted in recent weeks did not have a clear political motive . But they raise similar questions for authorities seeking to prevent them .\nMore : Disgruntled cook had arsenal of guns , threatened mass shooting at Long Beach Marriott hotel , police say\nLast month in Connecticut , a 22-year-old Norwalk man was arrested after local police and the FBI were tipped that he sought to obtain high-capacity rifle magazines .

During the first week of August , the period covering the El Paso and Dayton shootings , the FBI reported that 38,000 tips had streamed into its National Threat Operations Center , up from a weekly average of about 22,000 .\n`` Such increases are often observed after major incidents , '' the FBI said in a statement . `` As always , the FBI encourages the public to remain vigilant and report any and all suspicious activity to law enforcement immediately . ''\nIn the aftermath of 9/11 , the internet quickly emerged as key battleground in the war on al-Qaida and later the Islamic State , also known as ISIS .

Alhaggagi was looking for weapons and seized on a post referencing an available supply of Kalashnikov rifles and hand grenades .\nWhat followed , by the FBI \u2019 s own account detailed in court documents , was an extraordinary pursuit by teams of agents who for weeks smothered the suspect with round-the-clock surveillance . An undercover investigator , posing as an experienced bombmaker , met with him extensively to discuss desired body counts . The bureau 's monitoring even included a backup SWAT unit in case Alhaggagi sought to make good on a boast to \u201d redefine terror \u201d by leaving \u201c the whole Bay Area \u2026 in flames . \u201d\nIn almost every way , the threat posed by the young suspect \u2013 whose targets included bars , nightclubs and schools \u2013 followed a now all-to-familiar path to mass murder .\nExcept for one key difference : Alhaggagi \u2019 s allegiance to an international terror group , ISIS , set in motion the aggressive federal inquiry whose supporting laws do not apply in rooting out domestic terror suspects .\nAlthough Alhaggagi 's lawyers argued that their client 's threats were the product of immature boasts , he was sentenced in February to more than 15 years in prison on charges of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization .\n\u201c Today is a tragedy for the Alhaggagi family and our community as we have lost yet another young person to the allure of extremist ideology focused on hatred and violence , \u201d San Francisco FBI chief John Bennett said after the sentencing . `` This ... serves as a reminder of how persistent and pervasive online radicalization has become and this should be a precautionary example for individuals who may be tempted by terrorist propaganda . ''\nAlthough investigators are now limited in the battle against homegrown violence unconnected to overseas terror groups , President Donald Trump seemed to call for more aggressive internet monitoring after the shootings in El Paso and Dayton .\nBut there is widespread disagreement on how much power the government should have to do that , and on how it would work if it did .\nMichael German , a former FBI special agent who specialized in domestic terrorism , has opposed an expanded domestic terrorism statute , saying that providing law enforcement unfettered access to investigative and surveillance techniques has led to perverse consequences .\nGerman cites an elaborate sting operation targeting Nicholas Young , a former Washington transit police officer who converted to Islam and whom the FBI monitored for several years . Young was arrested in 2016 after he sent $ 245 in gift cards to a friend he believed had gone to Syria to join the Islamic State . Unknown to Young , the friend was an informant , and Young was charged with attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State .\nProsecutors argued that Young 's activity was anything but benign , saying the cards were intended to assist ISIS recruitment efforts . He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in June .\nGerman , now a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice , said there are other potential dangers in arming investigators with more authority in domestic terror inquiries . Targeting radical right-wing groups , he said , could thrust law enforcement into the realm of policing political speech .\n\u201c You ca n't imagine how many people entertain conspiracy theories who would never commit an act of violence , '' German said . `` Clearly a lot of these people are engaged in the political process . ''\nBut civil liberties group such as the American Civil Liberties Union oppose expanding domestic terrorism laws , saying doing so would target people of color and other marginalized communities .\nMary McCord , former acting chief of the Justice Department 's National Security Division , said the extreme violence that has marked recent attacks and the stream of further threats of mass attacks have all but eliminated the distinction between international and domestic terror .\nAfter the October shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh , McCord urged Congress to make domestic terrorism a federal crime , saying doing so would create a moral equivalency between domestic and international actors .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the same crime , \u201d McCord said , adding that a domestic terrorism statute would give the FBI \u201c the mandate and the impetus and the resources \u201d to conduct undercover and sting operations .

The 21-year-old suspect has been charged by state prosecutors with capital murder , which carries a potential death sentence .\nIn some cases , the government has moved to thwart right-wing extremism when it appeared to be on the precipice of violence , though authorities face some significant limits on its ability to do so because some of what would come up would be protected speech .\nFederal prosecutors in Las Vegas announced charges Aug. 9 against a 23-year-old man they described as an associate of a white supremacist group .
