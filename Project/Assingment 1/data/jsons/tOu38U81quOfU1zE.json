    "content": "America \u2019 s public health experts are working hard to map out a plan to combat the coronavirus in America . And there are indeed many proposals \u2014 from academic centers , from think tanks , and from the government .\nWhile the plans differ , nearly all of them rely on some combination of surveillance , mass testing , isolation , and contact tracing . Many of them point to countries like Singapore , South Korea , and Germany as examples of how to intelligently respond to the pandemic .\nBut what if the successful strategies in those countries just won \u2019 t work in America ?\nThis question was posed by Keith Humphreys , a Stanford University professor who works on addiction and public health policy , in a viral Twitter thread last week . Humphreys argued that a lot of his public health colleagues weren \u2019 t thinking seriously enough about the cultural obstacles that might undercut the country \u2019 s efforts to test , trace , and isolate Americans . He later penned a Washington Post column drawing out his arguments in a little more detail .\nHumphreys \u2019 s basic claim is that any plan we adopt , no matter how wise , is useless without \u201c widespread political consent \u201d from American citizens . And the obsession with individual liberties in America , coupled with a general distrust of government , poses an enormous challenge to even the best conceivable plan .\nI spoke to Humphreys by phone about what he thinks public health experts are failing to recognize , and if he believes America is too libertarian to handle a collective action problem like the coronavirus pandemic .\nLay out America \u2019 s \u201c political-cultural \u201d problem for me . Why are you worried that we can \u2019 t deal with this pandemic the way other countries have ?\nWell , I think we \u2019 re different from the other democracies that have handled this well in our long-term resistance to the growth of the state in general , but also in the domain of health . Why is it that every other developed country has government-guaranteed health care and we do not ? The obvious reason is that there \u2019 s an instinctive aversion to government power in the DNA of America . This is the only major democracy in which a huge number of people have fought to prevent a government guarantee of health care for all citizens .\nThis aversion is especially potent now , but it goes back to the very beginning of the country , a country founded by people who lived in fear of a king . Our Constitution was set up with checks and balances out of fear of the power of the state . And that libertarian streak is with us through everything and it also applies in the domain of health .\nThere are some advantages to that libertarian instinct , and I think you admit that , but the problem is that it \u2019 s just the wrong ideological software to be running in a pandemic\u2014\nRight . I don \u2019 t think we want to live in [ a more authoritarian society ] like Singapore , for example . But the question is what do you do about an epidemic when we really are all in it together and there is no way to run a test , trace , and isolate program without seriously increasing government surveillance and having access to a lot of quite intimate personal information ? Those libertarian impulses stand athwart that .\nSo I just don \u2019 t think we can do what Germany does , where there \u2019 s higher confidence in the state and higher trust in the state . I don \u2019 t think we can do what democracies in East Asia are doing , where there \u2019 s a more recent history of autocracy and a lot of deference to the state . Even though I \u2019 m a public health person and I admire all the people working on all the technical problems and thinking about what we should do to halt this virus , I just believe that we \u2019 re underestimating the political and cultural obstacles here .\nWhat , exactly , can countries like South Korea and Germany do that we can \u2019 t ?\nIn South Korea , you basically had authoritarian rule up until the \u2019 80s . The adults in that country grew up in a place where if the government was worried about a parasitic infection , you had to submit stool samples to the officials \u2014 it \u2019 s just what you did . And these are the people deciding , right now , whether or not to follow the orders of their government or whether to hand over personal information . And what we \u2019 ve seen is that most people are willing to do it .\nThe case of Germany is a little different . Contrary to stereotypes , Germans are not deferent to their state . They have a lot of concerns about health information , for example . But I think the big difference there is that people have comparatively more trust in the state . They believe their state is fundamentally competent . Virtually all the polling we have on Americans shows that many of them simply don \u2019 t trust the state , and that \u2019 s a huge problem when the state is asking you to sacrifice so much for the sake of the public good .\nMy problem with libertarianism has always been that it gives us a language of rights but it can \u2019 t give us a language of obligations \u2014 it \u2019 s fundamentally an individualistic philosophy . What you \u2019 re really saying , in my mind at least , is that America is too libertarian to deal with a collective action problem like this .\nYes , that \u2019 s a very pithy way to express what I \u2019 m saying , but it \u2019 s exactly right .\nI should say that I \u2019 m raising all these questions out of anxiety . In other words , I \u2019 ll be delighted if I \u2019 m wrong . But I keep thinking about other times where we \u2019 ve been in precisely this situation around health , going back to Harry Truman proposing national health insurance and getting beaten . And I worked for President Obama , so I was right there as we struggled to get some version of the Affordable Care Act passed . I watched several states turn down Medicaid expansion . And I saw how the ACA was unable to get a single Republican vote and I don \u2019 t think anyone lost their seat because of that , because they voted against it .\nSo I \u2019 ve seen this dynamic play out over and over again in different contexts and I worry it will be the thing that limits what we \u2019 re able to do in our efforts to stamp out this virus . I guess I can \u2019 t put it any better than you : I don \u2019 t think we can reconcile our libertarianism with the need for a sense of shared purpose in a time of crisis .\nIf what you \u2019 re saying is true , then it makes no difference who the president is or which party is in charge , because our problems are fundamentally cultural . And in that sense , you \u2019 re defining the problem as insoluble .\nI think that would be a little bleak . I would say that the president does matter . I was talking to a friend the other day and he said that if Trump put on a mask at a press conference and said , \u201c I \u2019 m doing this because it \u2019 s a smart thing to do , \u201d that would matter to some people who are resistant , that signal from someone they trust would matter . So it \u2019 s not that leadership is irrelevant , but I do think there are real limits to what \u2019 s possible in the country and the origins of that stretch back to our founding .\nAll right , Keith , you \u2019 ve forced me to play the optimist here . I take all your points and I don \u2019 t think anyone can deny our libertarian streak , but here \u2019 s my counter : A majority of Americans have shown a remarkable willingness to cooperate and social distance in spite of the vacuum of leadership at the top \u2014 and that \u2019 s true across party lines .\nThat \u2019 s a very good point and it is encouraging . And some of the data I \u2019 ve seen from across the country shows that most people are choosing to stay home , even in places that have lifted their lockdown , like Georgia . So there is some consensus on that .\nThe question for me is , does that translate into behavior ? The psychologist in me can see that 80 percent of Americans think masks are a good idea , for example , but does that mean 80 percent of Americans are actually wearing masks ? Because I \u2019 m not seeing that and I live in one of the places you \u2019 d expect to see that .\nWouldn \u2019 t it , at least , be fair to say that our cultural capacity might be wider than you \u2019 re suggesting ? I think we have to be careful not to confuse distrust of this administration with distrust of government as such , even though I agree Americans are unusually distrustful of government .\nStill , there are reasons to think that there \u2019 s a reservoir of goodwill that could be marshaled if we had a competent leader who mapped out a clear plan to deal with this pandemic , a plan that inspired confidence and justified the sacrifices and the inconveniences\u2014\nWell , there are some places where I think you could establish that empirically by looking around the country . I live in the Bay Area , for instance , and the governor , Gavin Newsom , is pretty well-regarded . He was out ahead on this and he imposed a lot of restrictions that people mostly accepted . I suspect most people will follow their local leaders when the restrictions are wise and explained decently .\nI would say , though , that I think a lot depends on there being an actual shared interest that \u2019 s obvious to everyone . My parents , for example , live in an assisted living community where everyone else is in exactly the same situation , so there \u2019 s a total consensus . They do not take visitors , they do not go out . But they can do it because everyone recognizes the shared risks .\nTo be even more clear , I recognize that a lot of people are willing to cooperate and sacrifice . The question we have to ask , the question that virologists , in particular , have to ask , is will it be enough ? If 20 percent of the country opts out , or if several states opt out , will that compromise our national response ? Or will it be just enough to keep the pandemic raging on ?\nMy worry is that we \u2019 ll have just enough dissent , for all the reasons we already discussed , to keep this thing going . In that case , we might want to factor that into our thinking about what \u2019 s possible here . We need some idea of the level of compliance we \u2019 ll need for any plan to work , and if we can \u2019 t replicate the compliance levels in countries like South Korea or Germany , we probably shouldn \u2019 t try to replicate their approach .\nThose are good questions and I don \u2019 t know the answers .\nNeither do I . But look , when I say we \u2019 re different from other countries , I \u2019 m not saying we \u2019 re bad or worse . I \u2019 m just making an assessment of what we \u2019 re good at and what we \u2019 re not good at . I mean , if someone wanted to write a book about how much they hate Keith Humphreys , I \u2019 d tell them to publish it in America , not Britain , because the libel laws are more lenient here and we value free expression and you can get away with it . So that \u2019 s just an assessment based on the legal culture in this country .\nWe have lots of strengths in America that can be of incredible value in normal times , but in a pandemic , those same strengths can become a liability . That \u2019 s all I \u2019 m really saying .\nYou conclude your thread by saying we \u2019 ll probably end up with something like a Swedish coronavirus policy by default . What does that mean exactly ? How does that scenario end ?\nOne of the pushbacks I got was that our approach won \u2019 t be as good as Sweden \u2019 s because we don \u2019 t have universal health care . So , I think what this means is that the virus will continue to spread fairly consistently across the country . I wouldn \u2019 t be surprised if the death toll has doubled by Labor Day . I would , of course , be incredibly happy to be wrong about that .\nAnd there \u2019 s really only two things that could interrupt this : 1 ) a vaccine , which is very unlikely for at least a year or more , or 2 ) increased development of therapeutics . So maybe we \u2019 ll have a breakthrough in our ability to treat the symptoms . What I think is most likely is that a huge number of people contract this virus and we develop immunity over time . If that happens , the virus will diminish over time , but it won \u2019 t be because of our test , trace , and isolate efforts .\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives . Our mission has never been more vital than it is in this moment : to empower you through understanding . \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s work is reaching more people than ever , but our distinctive brand of explanatory journalism takes resources \u2014 particularly during a pandemic and an economic downturn .
