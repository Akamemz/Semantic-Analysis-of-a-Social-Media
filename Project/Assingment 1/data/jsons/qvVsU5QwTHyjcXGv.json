    "content": "The New York Times editorial page accused the appeals court panel that on March 9 struck down portions of Washington , D.C. \u2019 s ultra-strict gun-control law of storming \u201c blithely past a longstanding Supreme Court precedent , the language of the Constitution and the pressing needs of public safety. \u201d My former colleagues at the Washington Post described the decision as a \u201c radical ruling \u201d that \u201c will inevitably mean more people killed and wounded as keeping guns out of the city becomes harder . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not hard to see where the anger comes from . The two-to-one decision by the famously conservative Judge Laurence Silberman is , indeed , radical . Consider the following :\nThe \u201c central object \u201d of the Second Amendment \u201c is to arm \u2018 We the People \u2019 so that ordinary citizens can participate in the collective defense of their community and their state . \u2026 [ T ] he amendment achieves its central purpose by assuring that the federal government may not disarm individual citizens without some unusually strong justification . \u2026 That assurance in turn is provided through recognizing a right \u2026 on the part of individuals to possess and use firearms in defense of themselves and their homes . \u201d\n\u201c For too long , most members of the legal academy have treated the Second Amendment as the equivalent of an embarrassing relative , whose mention brings a quick change of subject to other , more respectable , family members . That will no longer do . It is time for the Second Amendment to enter full scale into the consciousness of the legal academy . \u201d\nWhile at the Founding , the Second Amendment may have embodied a \u201c collective \u201d right , after the Civil War amendments , the constitutional landscape changed dramatically , and \u201c gun-toting was individualistic , accentuating not group rights of the citizenry but self-regarding \u2018 privileges \u2019 of discrete \u2018 citizens \u2019 to individual self-protection . \u201d\nRadical stuff , indeed . But there \u2019 s a big problem with blasting Silberman for entertaining the notion that the people \u2019 s right to \u201c keep and bear arms \u201d may actually include an individual right to , well , keep or bear a gun in the District of Columbia : None of these words actually come from his opinion . All , in fact , were written by esteemed liberal law professors .\nThe first is from Laurence Tribe \u2019 s famed treatise on the Constitution , the latest version of which Tribe altered in recognition of the growing power of the individual-rights view of the amendment\u2014a view he had long rejected . The second is by Sanford Levinson , who\u2014before he stopped believing in the Constitution altogether\u2014wrote an illuminating law review article called \u201c the embarrassing second amendment. \u201d The final quotation is from Akhil Reed Amar \u2019 s ambitious history , The Bill of Rights . One can still muster strong arguments in favor of a collective-rights conception of the Second Amendment , the view that has prevailed in most other circuits ; and the individual-rights view does not necessarily doom all gun control ( though it probably does doom the most sweeping bans ) . But the simple truth is that the individual-rights view is in intellectual ascendancy , and not just among gun-loving wing nuts . If Silberman is a radical with blithe disregard for public safety , he is in exceptionally strong company .\nIt \u2019 s time for gun-control supporters to come to grips with the fact that the amendment actually means something in contemporary society . For which reason , I hereby advance a modest proposal : Let \u2019 s repeal the damned thing .\nThis seems to me the right response to the amendment no matter which broad historical interpretation is correct . If , in fact , the amendment embodies only a collective right and the right to keep guns is indelibly linked to membership in the old militias\u2014institutions that no longer exist\u2014the amendment is already a dead letter . Repealing it would be then a simple matter of constitutional hygiene , the removal of a constitutional provision that has no function now nor could in the future but that , by its language , encourages the belief in an armed citizenry that I , for one , do not wish to see .\nIf , on the other hand , the amendment really does as Silberman , Tribe , Amar , and Levinson essentially claim\u2013and I suspect they are all more right than wrong\u2014then it embodies values in which I don \u2019 t believe . I grew up obsessively shooting .22 caliber target rifles at summer camp in the Adirondacks . I like guns well enough in rural areas . I don \u2019 t like them in cities . I don \u2019 t believe that the Constitution ought to prevent my hometown of Washington , D.C.\u2014which has a serious problem with gun violence\u2014from making a profoundly different judgment about how available handguns should be than the New York legislature would make for the hamlet near my old camp . Guns , in other words , present a legitimate policy question on which different jurisdictions should take very different approaches\u2014including , in some areas , outright bans .\nThere are lots of good reasons why our values today might not coincide with those of the Founders on the question of guns .
