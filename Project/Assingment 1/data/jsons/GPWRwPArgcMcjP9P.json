Even at the time , it was clear that a feckless , frenetic media -- which immediately went on to treat Obamacare web site glitches as just as catastrophic as the GOP \u2019 s shutdown debacle -- would let the party off the hook .

Continued Beltway optimism about that prospect is delusional . Given that the Senate already passed a ( slightly bipartisan ) bill , GOP control won \u2019 t change anything . Sadly , even the president fell for the fiction that the House would eventually take up the issue for far too long , postponing executive action on deferring deportations so that he couldn \u2019 t do it before the midterms \u2013 and now there \u2019 s worry about depressed Latino 2014 turnout as a result . Let \u2019 s hope nobody in the White House falls for that again .\nScher takes special comfort from the fact that 2016 looms , giving the GOP \u201c the opportunity to work out its dysfunctional family issues under the white-hot spotlight of a presidential campaign. \u201d There \u2019 s no doubt 2016 will be much better for Democrats . The base turns out for presidential elections , and the Senate map that year will be as tough on Republicans as it is in 2014 on Democrats , forcing the GOP to defend more seats and offering their rivals more pickups . All of that is a given .\nBut even a 2016 rout is unlikely to force Republicans to focus on a policy agenda and commit to governing again .
