    "content": "With both the Republican and Democratic conventions now concluded , it \u2019 s time to judge the news media on how fairly they covered the two parties . \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysts looked at various aspects of coverage , all of which demonstrate that journalists obviously favored the Democratic gathering .\nBy a 12-to-1 margin , journalists spent far more time deriding the Republican convention for its negativity , even as their reactions to Democratic speakers were consistently positive and often enthusiastic . Cable news had its own unique biases : MSNBC carved out time on each night of the GOP convention for interviews with top Democratic officials , but \u2014 despite promises to the contrary \u2014 aired no such interviews with Republicans during the Democratic convention . Meanwhile , CNN devoted more than an hour of airtime during the Democratic convention to airing 18 party-produced videos , but only included three such videos during the GOP convention .\nHere are details of our research evaluating the convention coverage , with special thanks to MRC analysts Matthew Balan , Mike Ciandella , Nicholas Fondacaro , Curtis Houck and Scott Whitlock .\n\u25a0 Double standard on convention videos : During the Republican convention , CNN \u2019 s primetime ( 8pm to midnight , ET ) coverage included just three RNC-produced videos totalling a bit more than 14 minutes of airtime : a non-partisan tribute to the Apollo 11 mission ; a video narrated by Lynne Patton telling how she was helped by the Trump family ; and the six-minute Thursday night biography of Donald Trump shown in advance of his acceptance speech . CNN skipped videos on important topics such as the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration \u2019 s Fast and Furious scandal , instead airing journalist panel discussions .\nBut during the Democratic convention , CNN chose to air 18 of the Democrats \u2019 videos , six times more party videos than they aired during the GOP convention . Included in those that made the cut on CNN : two \u201c Funny or Die \u201d videos mocking Donald Trump \u2019 s policies , and several \u201c Trump In His Own Words \u201d videos criticizing the GOP candidate \u2019 s controversial statements . In addition , CNN showed the party-produced videos introducing speakers including Michelle Obama , Bernie Sanders , Bill Clinton , Joe Biden , Tim Kaine , President Obama , and the nearly 12-minute video for Hillary Clinton that aired on the final night of the convention .\nThe total airtime for Democratic videos shown during CNN \u2019 s primetime coverage : 62 minutes , or more than four times the 14 minutes of airtime given to Republican videos during the same time slot the prior week .\n\u25a0 Double standard on giving free airtime to the opposition : During the first night of the Republican convention , CBS \u2019 s 10pm ET primetime coverage included a four-minute long segment of an interview of Hillary Clinton , during which Rose invited Clinton to bash her Republican opponent , asking if Donald Trump was \u201c the most dangerous man ever to run for President of the United States ? \u201d\nBut during their primetime coverage of the Democratic convention , CBS included no interviews with Republicans so they could bash Hillary Clinton .\nSimilarly , MSNBC \u2019 s primetime coverage ( 8pm to midnight ET ) of the GOP convention included five interviews with elected Democrats : Representatives Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) and Tim Ryan ( D-OH ) on Monday , July 18 ; Senator Amy Klobuchar ( D-MN ) on Tuesday , July 19 ; Senator Claire McCaskill ( D-MO ) on Wednesday , July 20 ; and Senator Al Franken ( D-MN ) on Thursday , July 21 .\nNone of the Democratic interlopers missed a chance to take shots at the GOP . Schiff was brought on board a few minutes after Pat Smith spoke about the loss of her son in Benghazi . \u201c We \u2019 ve never politicized a tragedy like this , \u201d Schiff claimed , \u201c and I just think it really is unfortunate to bring a grieving woman before the convention this way . \u201d\nLater in the week , Senator McCaskill condemned the GOP program as \u201c very dark and angry , and mostly fact-free , \u201d points echoed the next day by Senator Franken , who blasted the convention as \u201c very ugly . \u201d\nSetting up his interview with Representative Ryan , anchor Brian Williams explained that \u201c we like to bring in the other side , as in fairness we \u2019 ll be doing when it \u2019 s the Democrats \u2019 turn. \u201d But that wasn \u2019 t true : during all four nights of the Democratic convention , MSNBC \u2019 s 8pm to midnight coverage included absolutely no interviews with any Republicans .\n\u25a0 Double standard on complaining about negative rhetoric : During the first two days of the Democratic convention , various speakers called Donald Trump a con man , a fraud , a bigot , and a racist ; someone who \u201c cheats students , cheats investors , cheats workers , \u201d who \u201c rejects science \u201d and would take America \u201c back to the dark days when women died in back alleys. \u201d Trump \u2019 s policies and rhetoric was described as \u201c cruel , \u201d \u201c frightening , \u201d \u201c deceitful , \u201d \u201c deeply disturbing \u201d and \u201c ugly. \u201d He was someone who promoted \u201c racial hatred , \u201d who had \u201c hate in their heart , \u201d and was \u201c making America hate again . \u201d\nBut while the media routinely attacked the Republicans during the GOP convention for negative attacks on Hillary Clinton , the Democrats \u2019 attacks on Trump were given a pass . MRC studied ABC , CBS , CNN , MSNBC and NBC \u2019 s coverage from 9pm to midnight during the first two nights of each convention . During the GOP convention , journalists scolded the Republicans for negativity 63 times ; for the same time period during the Democratic convention , viewers heard only five such comments from reporters , a more than 12-to-1 disparity .\nA few examples : CBS \u2019 s Bob Schieffer on July 19 said Clinton had been \u201c accused of everything from a \u2018 who \u2019 d a thought it \u2019 to the diphtheria epidemic. \u201d On NBC , Tom Brokaw said the convention was trying to \u201c work up a big hate for Hillary. \u201d On MSNBC , Chris Matthews called the convention a \u201c festival of hating Hillary tonight , this brewing up of almost a witch-like ritual tonight , \u201d adding the words \u201c bloodthirsty \u201d and \u201c blood curdling \u201d to describe the delegates \u2019 reaction to Chris Christie \u2019 s speech . [ See video compilation below for many more examples . ]\nDuring the Democratic convention , the references to negativity were far fewer and much milder . CNN \u2019 s Gloria Borger on July 25 pointed out that speakers were \u201c belittling and making fun of Donald Trump a lot tonight. \u201d On MSNBC the next night , regular panelist Steve Schmidt , a former GOP campaign consultant , said there had been \u201c real tough blows tonight on Donald Trump , \u201d for the purpose of \u201c the destruction of Donald Trump \u2019 s character . \u201d\n\u25a0 Gushing over Democratic speeches while panning the GOP : In addition to the supposed negativity of the overall program , journalists scorned the individual speeches delivered at the GOP convention , especially nominee Donald Trump . CBS \u2019 s Scott Pelley said Trump was \u201c more vengeful than hopeful , \u201d while ABC \u2019 s Terry Moran called it \u201c more of a harangue than a speech. \u201d NBC \u2019 s Tom Brokaw thought some viewers \u201c are going to see someone they will only think of as a demagogue of some kind . \u201d\nThursday \u2019 s reactions to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s address , while unenthusiastic , included none of the criticism aimed at Trump . NBC \u2019 s Savannah Guthrie said Clinton \u2019 s was \u201c a do-no harm speech , \u201d while her colleague Chuck Todd thought it \u201c was a grinder \u201d of an address . CNN \u2019 s Gloria Borger admitted \u201c it was not an oratorical masterpiece \u201d but called Clinton \u2019 s speech \u201c sturdy \u201d and \u201c steely. \u201d Over on CBS , co-anchor Norah O \u2019 Donnell touted Clinton for \u201c stressing her steadiness , her readiness , her experience and her empathy . \u201d\nUp until Clinton \u2019 s speech , the media had been positively swooning over the Democratic speakers . On Monday , CNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper was excited by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker , calling his speech \u201c a crowd pleaser like no speech I \u2019 ve seen at a convention since a young state senator Barack Obama in 2004 . \u201d\nMinutes later on ABC , anchor George Stephanopoulos gushed over First Lady Michelle Obama : \u201c Polished , passionate and personal , \u201d while on MSNBC , Joy Reid called the First Lady \u2019 s speech \u201c magnificent , exquisite ... [ and ] splendid . \u201d\nHardball host Chris Matthews loved all of it : \u201c I just thought the whole night was a slugger \u2019 s row of wonderful sentiments . \u201d\nAs the week wore on , none of the major Democrats earned a bad review . On Tuesday night , CBS \u2019 s Gayle King found Bill Clinton \u2019 s speech on behalf of Hillary \u201c heartwarming. \u201d The next night , correspondents for NBC , CBS and ABC praised vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine for his \u201c suburban dad \u201d personality , whose \u201c extraordinary \u201d Spanish-speaking skills made for \u201c a Spanish lesson down here . \u201d\nAnd , of course , President Obama sent thrills up journalists \u2019 legs . \u201c I don \u2019 t think we \u2019 ve ever had a President , save Lincoln , who is as great a speechwriter as this man , \u201d NBC \u2019 s Andrea Mitchell oozed . \u201c It was magnificent , \u201d MSNBC \u2019 s Matthews tingled , \u201c a wonderful farewell address . \u201d\nEvery four years , the party conventions give the establishment news media a chance to provide even-handed coverage of the two parties .
