( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - In his brief three-month campaign for president , Michael Bloomberg poured nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars into building an advertising and data-mining juggernaut unlike anything the political world had ever seen .\nU.S. Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg speaks to volunteers during a canvass kick-off as he campaigns in Manassas , Virginia , U.S. , March 2 , 2020 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Kevin Lamarque\nBut a big part of the strategy hinged on a wildcard named Joe Biden .\nBiden \u2019 s resurgence after a dominant victory on Saturday in South Carolina has upset that calculation in the critical do-or-die sprint before \u201c Super Tuesday , \u201d when Democrats in 14 states vote for the candidate to challenge Republican Donald Trump in November \u2019 s election .\nIt wasn \u2019 t supposed to be this way . The billionaire former New York City mayor \u2019 s strategy was partly based on expectations that Biden would falter in the first four states . Bloomberg , who skipped the early contests , would then become the moderate alternative to frontrunner Bernie Sanders , the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist .\nAlthough Biden underperformed in Iowa and New Hampshire , he did better in Nevada and bounced back in South Carolina on a wave of African-American support to end Sanders \u2019 winning streak and establish himself as the race \u2019 s top-tier moderate Democrat .\nMeanwhile , Bloomberg \u2019 s once-ascendant campaign has struggled after he came under fire in debates over past comments criticized as sexist and a policing policy he employed as New York \u2019 s mayor seen as racially discriminatory . He has apologized for the policing policy and for telling \u201c bawdy \u201d jokes .\nAdvisors and people close to the Bloomberg campaign say they are still in the race and rebuff criticism that he \u2019 s splitting the moderate vote and making it easier for Sanders to win .\nThe campaign \u2019 s internal polling showed that Bloomberg \u2019 s supporters have both Biden and Sanders as their second choices , contrary to the perception that he was mostly peeling off Biden \u2019 s support , one campaign official said .\nIf Bloomberg dropped out , Sanders would be on a stronger path to victory , the official said .\nBloomberg has hovered around 15 % in national polls , suggesting he will earn some delegates on Tuesday . If those polls are correct , he will likely earn fewer delegates than Sanders and Biden .\nAnother moderate , Pete Buttigieg , dropped out on Sunday , driven in part by a desire not to hand the nomination to Sanders , a top adviser said . \u201c Pete was not going to play the role of spoiler . \u201d\nBloomberg , however , has vowed to stay in the race until a candidate wins a majority of delegates needed to clinch the nomination . His campaign has spent heavily on advertising in states that vote on Tuesday , when a third of the available delegates that help select a Democratic nominee are awarded in a single day .\nAnd it \u2019 s pinning some of its hopes on Virginia , the fourth-biggest state at stake on Tuesday and a key testing ground for Bloomberg . He made his first campaign visit here last November , and has visited another six times since . Last week , his campaign had hopes he could win or come close .\nAfter Biden \u2019 s win in South Carolina , the former vice president picked up endorsements from former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine , the 2016 Democratic vice presidential candidate \u2014 underlining how Biden \u2019 s comeback is drawing establishment Democrats who might have otherwise backed Bloomberg .\nDan Blue , a prominent Democrat in the North Carolina State Senate who endorsed Bloomberg last week , said Biden \u2019 s strong showing in South Carolina reset the race . But he said he still believes that Bloomberg can win by playing the long game and gradually accumulating delegates .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no question in my mind that this thing is very fluid and not absolute , \u201d he said .\nBloomberg \u2019 s heavy advertising spending , however , makes him a uniquely powerful candidate even if he lags in opinion polls .\nHe has spent more than half a billion dollars on ads ahead of Tuesday , more than four times the combined ad spending of his four remaining main rivals - Sanders , Biden , Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar , according to data from ad tracker Advertising Analytics .\nThe biggest chunk was spent in Super Tuesday states , $ 214 million through Feb. 25 , including more than $ 63 million in California and $ 50 million in Texas , where one analysis said 80 percent of the ads were Bloomberg \u2019 s .\nAlready , Bloomberg has spent more on television ads than Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did in their entire 2016 campaigns .\n\u201c It \u2019 s truly astonishing , \u201d said Michael Franz at Bowdoin College in Maine , a leading researcher on political advertising .\nMany of his ads feature Trump , mocking the president as a \u201c bully. \u201d Others introduce his life story . When he drew criticism for sexist comments and past treatment of women on the job , one ad countered with endorsements from longtime women employees .\nThe campaign also has pushed beyond old frontiers with digital spending . More than $ 106 million have been poured into Google and Facebook ads , according to disclosures by the social media giants .\nWithout a young network of enthusiasts on social media like the one enjoyed by Sanders , Bloomberg has tried to boost his online presence by paying for one : he has hired influential meme accounts to post messages on Instagram , and paid others $ 2,500 a month to share pro-Bloomberg messages on texts and social media .\nInside his campaign headquarters in New York , the staff of Hawkfish , a start-up digital analytics company , sift through huge tranches of voter data to help chart his campaign strategy .\nBloomberg decided Hawkfish was necessary because Democrats haven \u2019 t kept up with Trump \u2019 s ability to target voters and bombard them with messages , said Dan Kanninen , the campaign \u2019 s states director . \u201c It \u2019 s a very potent , very difficult-to-overcome weapon . \u201d\nHis unprecedented spending has likely fueled his rise in public opinion polls from just around 5 % when he entered the race on Nov. 24 to about 16 % in recent polls .\n\u201c The question is , how much can it buy him , and there \u2019 s definitely a ceiling , \u201d said Amanda Wintersieck , a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond , Virginia .\nIn South Carolina , where he was not on the ballot but had still spent $ 2.3 million on advertising through Feb. 25 , two thirds of the primary voters said they viewed Bloomberg unfavorably , according to Edison Research exit polls . About 77 % and 51 % of these voters had favorable views of Biden and Sanders , respectively .\nThe spending has also provided a target for opponents who say Bloomberg is stark proof that the wealthy wield too much influence over U.S. elections .\nIn conversations with dozens of mostly Democratic voters across seven states last week , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found that Bloomberg \u2019 s spending blitz had won him a little enthusiasm , and some respect . Paula Abrams drove 100 miles through a snowstorm to attend a rally in an airplane hangar in Blountville , Tennessee , and plans to vote for him on Tuesday . \u201c He seems like he cares , \u201d said Abrams , 55 , an educator in Knoxville , Tennessee .\nAnd Joy West , 62 , a retired teacher , says she thinks he \u2019 s the only one who can beat Trump . \u201c He really has the only chance of winning this thing . \u201d\nOthers were less forgiving . Bloomberg has apologized for overseeing an increase in the use of a police practice called \u201c stop and frisk \u201d in New York City that disproportionately affected black and other racial minority residents .\nOn Sunday , as Bloomberg started to speak about racial inequality at a chapel in Selma , Alabama \u2014 one of the 14 Super Tuesday states \u2014 about 10 people , mostly black , stood up and turned their backs .
