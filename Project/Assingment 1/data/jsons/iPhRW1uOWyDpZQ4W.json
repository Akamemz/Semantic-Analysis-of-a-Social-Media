    "content": "The Trump administration is making a concession on its proposed minimum fuel economy requirement for new vehicles , but environmental groups and a key Democratic senator complain it does not go far enough , and still falls well below the requirements set under the Obama administration .\nFuel economy standards would increase 1.5 % per year from 2021 through 2026 under the new proposal . That 's a reversal from the Trump administration 's proposal in 2018 , which sought to freeze the standards at 2020 levels .\nEnvironmentalists and Delaware Senator Tom Carper hardly cheered the move , which does n't come close to the 5 % annual increase mandated by the Obama administration .\nCarper , who is the senior Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee , released some details of the latest fuel-standards proposal in a letter Wednesday urging the administration to scrap its new mileage proposal as ineffective and costly .\n`` My office 's review of the draft final rule indicates that it utterly fails to provide any demonstrable safety , environmental or economic benefit to consumers or the country , '' Carper wrote in a letter to the Office of Management and Budget .\nCarper also said that the draft rule documents sent by the Trump administration , which `` had been characterized as close to ready to be finalized , '' appear to consist only of the Transportation Department 's preamble , and includes `` some apparent typographical and other errors , and placeholders for analysis and narrative sections that have seemingly not yet been written .

The mileage rollback has become one of the most fiercely contested rollback efforts by the administration , prompting legal battles with California and other states and splitting loyalties of top automakers .\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which develops fuel economy rules , would n't comment Thursday . It reissued a statement saying the rule will improve fuel economy , cut pollution and make vehicles more affordable .\nWhen the Trump administration released its proposed `` Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule '' in 2018 , it calculated that the rule would save 12,700 lives in car crashes through model year 2029 . The logic was that relaxed fuel mileage standards would cut the cost of vehicles , making them more affordable and increasing sales . Since new vehicles are safer , lives would be saved .\nThe proposal pegged the cost of meeting Obama-era requirements at $ 2,700 per vehicle and said buyers would save that much per car by 2025 .\nBut Carper wrote that the administration 's final proposal claims total savings of 474 lives through 2029 .
