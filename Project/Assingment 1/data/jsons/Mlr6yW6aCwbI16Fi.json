'' But on the same day , his partymates in the state legislature voted down a bill pushed by Republican governor Larry Hogan that would strengthen penalties for violent criminals .\nHogan \u2019 s Violent Firearms Offenders Act would make the theft of a firearm a felony and increase penalties for those who repeatedly carry illegal guns or use a gun while drug dealing . The bill passed the state Senate on March 10 following a contentious back-and-forth between lawmakers . Democrats successfully removed the legislation 's mandatory minimum sentencing increase , arguing it would punish violent criminals too severely .\nFollowing the removal of mandatory minimums and the bill 's subsequent passage , state Senate president and Baltimore Democrat Bill Ferguson lauded the legislation 's bipartisan nature , saying it included `` the legislature 's priorities and some of the governor 's priorities .
