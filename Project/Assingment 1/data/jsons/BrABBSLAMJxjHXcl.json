A message from the National Security Agency included with Grenell 's note to the Republicans says it is n't clear who may actually have viewed it .\nNonetheless , President Trump and his supporters have sought political revenge with the release of the material years after what they perceive as a pernicious attack by the expiring Obama team .\nBiden 's campaign slammed what it called a political stunt that it said was an attempt by the White House to distract Americans from the coronavirus pandemic .\nThe melodrama began years ago , when a White House official in the final days of the Obama era revealed to The Washington Post that Flynn had spoken with Russia 's then-ambassador to the United States during the presidential transition period .\nThat kernel of news snowballed into a scandal that led to Flynn 's ouster and a guilty plea for lying to the FBI . All along , Flynn 's allies have slammed Obama-era officials for leaking his identity in a political attack , calling that an abuse of power .\nMeanwhile , Flynn 's case never was resolved , and he has been battling back against federal authorities , helped politically by revelations about problems with the Russia investigation and by allies eager to rehabilitate him and strike at the Obama team .\nThis month , as the Justice Department said it was moving to drop its case against Flynn , Grenell was working behind the scenes to identify and then reveal the Obama-era officials who might have had access to the information about Flynn 's phone conversation .\nBiden , the likely Democratic Party nominee for president this year , was just one of a number of top Obama lieutenants on the list provided by Grenell . Also present were then-Chief of Staff Denis McDonough , then-FBI Director James Comey , then-CIA Director John Brennan and others .\nGrenell provided the list to Republican Sens . Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin , who unveiled it on Wednesday . The senators demanded explanations from Biden and the others .\n`` The officials listed should confirm whether they reviewed this information , why they asked for it and what they did with it , and answer many other questions that have been raised by recent revelations , '' Grassley and Johnson said in a statement . `` We are making this public because the American people have a right to know what happened . ''\nRevealing classified information is against the law , and the identification of the names on Wednesday could set the stage , at least in theory , for the prosecution of whoever was connected definitively with talking to The Post .\nAndrew Bates , a spokesman for Biden 's campaign , slammed what he called an attempt by the Trump administration to change the subject in Washington from the coronavirus disaster .\n`` Donald Trump 's attempt at dishonest media manipulation to distract from his response to the worst public health crisis in 100 years has backfired , '' he said .\n`` These documents simply indicate the breadth and depth of concern across the American government \u2014 including among career officials \u2014 over intelligence reports of Michael Flynn 's attempts to undermine ongoing American national security policy through discussions with Russian officials or other foreign representatives . ''\nThe U.S. intelligence community produces a flood of reporting about myriad targets and issues around the world . In much of what it yields , the identities of `` U.S. persons '' are `` minimized '' : Rather than saying `` Foreign Agent X communicated with John Smith , '' a report might say , `` X communicated with U.S . Person 1 . ''\nGovernment officials of sufficient stature can request that `` Person 1 , '' in this example , be `` unmasked '' to learn more about the report .
