    "content": "The sudden collapse of nonprofit health plans supported by tens of millions of dollars in Obamacare loans is igniting a new political wildfire over the health law \u2014 and it \u2019 s playing out in a tight gubernatorial race in Kentucky .\nThe recent demise of Kentucky Health Cooperative , a nonprofit startup seeded with federal loan dollars under the Affordable Care Act , is part of a bigger , national trend . More than a third of the 23 nonprofit health plans created under Obamacare with $ 2.4 billion in federal loan dollars have collapsed , and most experts predict more failures on the horizon .
