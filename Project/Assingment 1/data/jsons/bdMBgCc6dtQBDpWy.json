    "content": "Classified emails passed through commercial email services like Google and AOL on their path to or from a private server maintained by Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state , but so far , the government appears to have done little to retrieve or secure the messages .\nA \u2588\u2588\u2588 review of Clinton emails made public by the State Department shows that at least 55 messages now deemed to include classified information appear to have been sent to or from private accounts other than Clinton \u2019 s . That number is certain to grow substantially as State processes all Clinton emails and sorts through emails turned over to the department by several of her top aides .\nOnly about a quarter of the former secretary \u2019 s messages have been released up to this point , and her advisers sent emails on the same topics that never reached Clinton . The nonchalant response to messages stored on commercial servers contrasts sharply with recent FBI efforts to take possession of email copies on a thumb drive maintained by Clinton \u2019 s attorney David Kendall and on a server kept by a Denver tech company that managed Clinton \u2019 s account .\n\u201c They are discordant , and they reflect inconsistent notions of information security , \u201d said Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists . \u201c They are totally incompatible positions . \u201d\n\u201c The logic is classic government logic : If I know classified material is in place X , I \u2019 m going to go get it , \u201d said one former senior State Department official . \u201c They \u2019 re not going to , without reasonable cause , start searching everyone \u2019 s home email . In a sense , [ Clinton ] is suffering the mortification on behalf of the entire department . \u201d\nThe most evident example of the discrepancy in the government \u2019 s response is the private email account used by former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills .\nIn a July 31 letter to lawyers for Mills and other former officials , State Department Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy \u2014 who had previously allowed ex-officials to keep copies of any records they were returning to the department \u2014 struck a newly urgent tone .\n\u201c For records management purposes , the Department asks that you and your client now take steps to return all copies of potential federal records in your possession to the Department as soon as possible , \u201d Kennedy wrote . \u201c The Department \u2019 s Office of Information \u2026 will contact you regarding additional steps with respect to the disposition of your and/or your client \u2019 s electronic copies of these documents . \u201d\nMills \u2019 lawyer Beth Wilkinson replied that Mills planned to delete her electronic copies of work-related emails on her personal account after she finished providing copies of those emails to the State Department .\nHowever , U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan stepped in , asking Mills , fellow Clinton aide Huma Abedin and Clinton not to delete any records in their possession . All three agreed .\nThe result is that any classified emails Mills has in her account now can \u2019 t be erased without a court order but are housed outside the government \u2019 s control and without the usual safeguards taken to protect classified information .\nThe status of Abedin \u2019 s emails is less clear because most of her work-related emails sent on a private account appear to have involved an account she had on Clinton \u2019 s server . Attorneys for Mills and Abedin declined to comment for this story .\nBecause the information was not marked classified at the time it was sent , some of those who now have such messages in their accounts may not even know it . One lawyer reached by \u2588\u2588\u2588 expressed surprise that information his client received from Clinton is considered classified .\n\u201c Nobody contacted me , \u201d said the attorney , who asked not to be named . \u201c It doesn \u2019 t make a lot of sense . \u201d\nAsked about efforts to recover classified information from commercial email services , the FBI declined to comment . A State Department official was vague about precise actions .\n\u201c The Department is taking appropriate steps . There are reviews and investigations underway , so beyond that we can not comment any further , \u201d said the official , who asked not to be named .\nA spokesman for Google , which operates Gmail , declined to discuss specifics . However , the spokesman said the company would usually encourage the government to contact a user directly to get sensitive data erased . In the absence of such an agreement , some type of legal order would be required , the Google spokesman said . An AOL spokeswoman suggested that the company would not erase user data without a legal order or customer permission .\n\u201c Federal law and our privacy policy prohibits us from disclosing information about our users or their use of our services absent legal process or user consent , \u201d spokeswoman Natalie Azzoli said .\nThe former head of the federal government \u2019 s classification policy office said the discrepancy between the handling of Clinton \u2019 s server and the private accounts could reflect a conclusion that trying to recover all classified material might just draw more attention to it .\n\u201c In reality , what it does reflect is the challenge that once stuff gets out into the wild , it is almost impossible to corral it again , \u201d said Bill Leonard , former director of the Information Security Oversight Office . \u201c When I \u2019 ve confronted situations like this in the past , one of the first things you should do is a gain-loss type of assessment of what the gain is and what you are losing by trying to corral all this material . Sometimes , just by going after material , you bring more attention to it and cause greater damage than if you just kind of let it lay low . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s also possible the State Department or other authorities have decided to try to recall all copies of \u201c secret \u201d or \u201c top secret \u201d information but not anything classified at the lowest tier of classification , \u201c confidential . \u201d\nSo far , only one document containing information officially designated \u201c secret \u201d has been released \u2014 in edited form \u2014 from Clinton \u2019 s email trove : a Nov. 18 , 2012 , memo about arrests in Libya possibly related to the deadly attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi two months earlier . The copy of that message forwarded to Clinton does not appear to have circulated outside official but unclassified State Department accounts , although it is difficult to know whether anyone in the chain might have forwarded it to others .\nHowever , intelligence agencies contend that even more sensitive classified information \u2014 which should have been marked \u201c top secret \u201d \u2014 was found during a review of a small sample of Clinton \u2019 s messages . Those messages reportedly related to drone strikes in Pakistan and nuclear tests in North Korea . The State Department is disputing the classification of those messages .\nBut even the kind of triage that allows \u201c confidential \u201d information to live unmolested outside the government \u2019 s control would appear to run afoul of claims by some in the intelligence community that individual government employees , as Clinton and her aides were , have a duty to step in whenever classified information appears to have \u201c spilled . \u201d\nIndeed , some national security specialists have argued that President Barack Obama \u2019 s executive order on classification and the State Department \u2019 s rules require that all or most information obtained from a foreign government be classified at least at the \u201c confidential \u201d level and treated as such .\nOthers say that treating all such information as classified would bring the work of the State Department and the National Security Council to a screeching halt .\n\u201c The daily operations of State and , I would add , the White House , would not be possible if everyone put everything on the classified email system that involved foreign government information , \u201d the former State official said . \u201c Classification has an element of discretion given to the person responsible for classifying . There \u2019 s a lot of stuff you would get from a foreign government that you would say \u2018 let \u2019 s not put that on the unclassified system \u2019 and you \u2019 d put it on the classified system , or you \u2019 d run down the hall and have a meeting , [ but ] it doesn \u2019 t make sense to me that every single conversation with a foreign government official is per force classified . \u201d\nAftergood also noted that State Department regulations actually allow classified \u201c confidential \u201d foreign government information to be handled on official , unclassified email accounts under certain circumstances .\nThat \u2019 s something that would be anathema at many intelligence agencies where most employees don \u2019 t even have unclassified work email accounts .\nPart of what is playing out in the furor over Clinton \u2019 s emails is a culture clash between intelligence agencies that allow little or no interaction with the public by their employees and places like State or the White House that must regularly engage journalists , foreign officials and think tanks .\n\u201c The fact that the intelligence community inspector general is involved in this means you \u2019 re basically applying different rules from different universes .
