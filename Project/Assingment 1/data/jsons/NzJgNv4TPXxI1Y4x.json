Another tepid jobs report\n\nThe trend of sluggish economic growth continued Friday, as federal economists reported that the economy added 162,000 jobs in July while the unemployment rate edged down from 7.6 percent to 7.4 percent.\n\nThe jobs count, which narrowly missed analyst expectations, follows Wednesday\u2019s dour news that the economy grew by only 1.7 percent in the second quarter. Federal economists also reduced their estimate for first quarter growth down to 1.1 percent.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe 7.4 percent unemployment rate is the lowest of President Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, as the rate dipped to its lowest level since December of 2008.\n\nThe unemployment rate is based on a separate survey \u2014 one that relies on data from a survey of households \u2014 than from the jobs number, which is calculated via a survey of employers\u2019 payrolls. The household survey, which has a larger margin for error than the payroll count, estimated 227,000 more people were employed in July than in the month before.\n\nBut the falling unemployment stems from both positive and negative news, as the additional 37,000 people who left the labor force in July also contributed to rate\u2019s decline.\n\n\u201cThe report, like many of late, contains good news and less good news,\u201d Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, said in a post on his website. \u201cMost of the decline in unemployment was due to more people getting jobs but part of it was due to a slight fall off in the labor force, a signal of not-too-strong labor demand.\u201d\n\nThe stubbornly slow job growth left 11.5 million people unemployed, with another 8.2 million part-time employees unsuccessfully looking to add more hours to their work week. Among the unemployed, 4.2 million have been unsuccessfully seeking work for 6 months or more.\n\nIn the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen 0.8 percent with the count of officially unemployed persons falling by 1.2 million.\n\nAt this point, the job reports are used as little more than talking points in the fiscal debate between the White House and Republicans, but they are a key indicator for the Federal Reserve as it weighs when it will begin to scale back its efforts to stimulate the stalled economy.\n\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said the central bank is watching for signs that it should scale back a series of monthly multi-billion dollar asset purchases that are aimed at driving down long-term interest rates and sparking new growth.\n\nPaul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, predicted Friday that the report will push the Fed to ramp down its efforts when the bank\u2019s policy committee next convenes in September.\n\nWhile it may not spur action in Congress, the employment report and GDP data jointly add further urgency to the newly reinvigorated economic debate between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans.",
