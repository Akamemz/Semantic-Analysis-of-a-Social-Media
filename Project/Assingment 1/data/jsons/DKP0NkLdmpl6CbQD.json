    "content": "Statistics from the most recent Gallup poll indicate that Americans \u2019 moral views have become increasingly liberal over the past 14 years , with U.S. citizens tending to approve of behavior they would have deemed immoral or sinful just a generation ago .\nThe biggest change percentage-wise has been in Americans \u2019 positive moral evaluation of polygamy and human cloning , both of which more than doubled since first measured by Gallup in the early 2000s . In 2003 , a mere 7 % thought that polygamy was morally acceptable , whereas in 2015 , the figure has grown to 16 % . Similarly , the recent poll found that 15 % of Americans now accept human cloning , up from just 7 % of the population in 2001 .\nApproval of gay and lesbian relations has also soared in the same time period , with an absolute majority of 63 % of the population now seeing nothing wrong with this behavior , as opposed to 40 % in 2001\u2014an increase of 23 percent .\nIn 2001 , a majority of 53 % of U.S. citizens already approved of fornication , and this group has continued to swell also , with 68 % now viewing sex between unmarried people as morally unproblematic . The study found , in fact , that in nearly all of the 16 categories compared , Americans \u2019 moral views had shifted left , with the exception of only two : the death penalty and scientific experimentation on animals .\nUnsurprisingly , the leftward shift in Americans \u2019 moral views has been matched by a corresponding loss of religiosity . A recent Pew Center study on religion in the United States found that despite America \u2019 s reputation as one of the more religious countries in the world , it has experienced a notable dip in religiosity in the past seven years .\nThe religious category to take the biggest hit was Christianity , especially \u201c mainline \u201d Christianity , which fell by 3.4 percent . Though the United States is still a statistically \u201c Christian nation , \u201d with about 70 % identifying themselves as followers of Jesus , it is markedly less so than even a generation ago .\nEvangelicalism , on the other hand , saw significantly smaller losses than mainline Protestant churches , dropping less than one percent of its adherents during this same period . Those identifying as Evangelicals fell from 26.3 to 25.4 % for a total loss in membership of just 0.9 % .\nThough it is impossible to establish a strict causal relationship between the two phenomena of moral liberalism and declining religiosity , the correlation between them is still striking .\nWhat may not seem immediately apparent is why as Americans become increasingly progressive , they are abandoning liberal religious denominations in favor of conservative ones .\nOne theory , advanced by Arthur E.

Many Christians seem to find Christ \u2019 s moral teachings increasingly embarrassing in an age that is tolerant of virtually any consensual human behavior . Abandoning a more literal approach to biblical morality , many have reinterpreted even the clearest biblical doctrines to make them resemble societal trends . As sociological criteria have replaced biblical principles as a moral guide , the Bible has been reduced to a source of \u201c spiritual inspiration. \u201d Having lost their belief in the power of the Bible to teach moral truth , many have drifted away from Christianity altogether .\nA third development has been a shift in emphasis from eternity to the here and now . Traditionally , Christianity placed greater importance on the \u201c salvation of souls \u201d than on the immediate benefits of religion , meaning that more attention was given to the \u201c eternal truths \u201d of final judgment , heaven and hell , than to the psychological rewards of faith .
