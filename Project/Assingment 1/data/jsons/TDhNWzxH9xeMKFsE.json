Sure , congressional elections come every two years , but it is really unusual for the majorities in the House and Senate to actually be teetering on the edge .\nUsually one party goes into an election with a strong , if not prohibitive advantage , but with a change in power fairly unlikely . Control of the House has flipped three times in the past 25 years , a period encompassing a half-dozen midterm and presidential elections each , with all three party changes occurring in midterm years . Democrats lost their 40-year majority in President Clinton \u2019 s midterm election of 1994 . Republicans then held it for 12 years until they lost it in the 2006 midterms under President George W. Bush . Democrats held on for just four years , losing their majority in the 2010 midterms under President Obama . GOP control is now in its eighth year .\nIn the Senate , Democrats entered the 1994 midterms having held majorities for 34 of the preceding 40 years . The six years of GOP control during that period followed Ronald Reagan \u2019 s landslide win over President Carter in 1980 , a rare instance of control switching in an presidential-election year . Democrats had a brief edge in 2001-2002 , when previously-Republican Sen. Jim Jeffords effectively changed parties and broke a 50-50 Senate tie . The GOP recovered their majority in 2002 , and Bush had a 63-percent Gallup job approval rating going into that midterm , held just 14 months after the 9/11 attacks . Republicans lost their Senate majority in 2006 and regained it in 2014 , so the current GOP majority is four years old .\nWhat happens now ? A micro-political , race-by-race House analysis suggests that Democrats are headed for pretty substantial gains , perhaps in the 30-seat neighborhood ( 30 seats would be seven more seats than they need to get to 218 ) . The limitation is that the micro approach works well in normal \u201c all politics is local \u201d elections , but it chronically understates party gains and losses in wave years\u2014when the political sum is greater than the parts . It dramatically understated Republican gains in 1994 and Democratic gains in 2006 , for example ; when dominos start tumbling in wave elections , they have a cascading effect . A more macro-political analysis , factoring in national and statewide polling and what appears to be a wave , suggests something more like a 40-seat Democratic pickup .\nObviously six months is a long time and much can and will happen , but the trajectory seems to be in a single direction and consistent with the party holding the White House losing seats in 35 out of 38 ( 92 percent ) midterm elections since the end of the Civil War . In midterms with a president having job-approval ratings in the mid-40s or less , losses are typically in the 40-seat range . It is premature to say that the GOP majority in the House is toast , but is it in very serious danger ? Absolutely .\nPatterns aren \u2019 t nearly as strong in the Senate , where which third of the chamber is up\u2014which specific seats\u2014matters . The White House \u2019 s party has lost seats in 19 out of 26 ( 73 percent ) midterm elections since we started the direct election of senators in 1913 , an impressive pattern but nowhere near the House averages .

The best-case scenario for Democrats in the House , a gain of 40 or 50 seats , would give them roughly the advantage that Republicans have had for the past two years , when they could pass some things , but even something that unified the majority as much as repealing and replacing Obamacare only passed on the third attempt . The best-case scenario for Republicans would probably be losing 10 to 20 seats , holding onto their majority by their fingernails . In the Senate , a best-case scenario for Democrats might be a net gain of three seats , giving them a scant 52-48 seat majority , while a best-case scenario for Republicans might end up with the GOP gaining three or four seats , putting them at 54 or 55 seats .\nPutting all that together , giving the difficulty of getting anything controversial through the Senate ( except under budget reconciliation , when a simple majority is sufficient ) , between filibusters and President Trump \u2019 s veto pen , it \u2019 s hard to see the next two years being any more productive than the last two .
