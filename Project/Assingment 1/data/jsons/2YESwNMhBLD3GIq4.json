    "content": "In 2003 , the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer diagnosed a new affliction in some of George W. Bush 's fiercest critics . He described the condition as `` the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies , the presidency -- nay -- the very existence of George W . Bush . '' He called it Bush Derangement Syndrome .\nBDS , at least in the examples Krauthammer gave , was mostly about Bush 's policies . Howard Dean , for instance , wondered whether Bush was suppressing the release of the 9/11 report because `` he was warned ahead of time by the Saudis . '' Barbra Streisand speculated that the war in Iraq was partially motivated by the influence the logging industry wielded in the Bush administration .\nBush Derangement Syndrome was , in other words , a function of 9/11 and the Iraq War : it was an effort , often misguided , to explain how the worst terrorist attack in American history happened , and why the most puzzling war in American history was launched .\nObama Derangement Syndrome is different . It is n't so much paranoia about President Obama 's policies as it is paranoia about the man himself \u2014 that he is , in some fundamental way , different , foreign , untrustworthy , even traitorous . What 's odd is that it is attached to a president whose presidency has been , in almost every respect , conventionally liberal . Bush Derangement Syndrome sought extraordinary explanations for extraordinary events ; Obama Derangement Syndrome seeks extraordinary explanations for an ordinary presidency .\nRudy Giuliani 's now infamous remarks fit the pattern . `` I do not believe \u2014 and I know this is a horrible thing to say \u2014 but I do not believe that the president loves America , '' the former New York City mayor said said Wednesday . `` He does n't love you . And he does n't love me . He was n't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country . ''\nGiuliani 's remarks were condemned in most circles \u2014 but not all . Louisiana Governor ( and 2016 hopeful ) Bobby Jindal said Giuliani `` should have used different phraseology . '' You 've heard of non-denial denials ? That 's a non-endorsement endorsement .\nGov . Scott Walker \u2014 another 2016 hopeful \u2014 refused , when asked , to say whether Obama loves his country , and then sparked a mini-furor when he said he did n't know whether he thought Obama was a Christian ( his spokesperson later said Walker was objecting to the line of questioning , and does believe Obama to be a Christian ) .\nAll this is simply the latest iteration of long-running Republican suspicions about Obama 's otherness . In the run-up to the 2012 election , for instance , Newt Gingrich mused , `` What if [ Obama ] is so outside our comprehension , that only if you understand Kenyan , anti-colonial behavior , can you begin to piece together [ his actions ] ? ''\nGiuliani , Jindal , and Gingrich are simply echoing a political movement that has never been persuaded that Obama is actually American . As Jen\u00e9e Desmond-Harris notes , a 2014 Economist/YouGov poll found that `` a full 23 percent of Americans said they still believed it was possible that Obama was born outside the United States ...

No one loves America more than Joe Biden .\nBut then , that 's why Obama Derangement Syndrome is different than Bush Derangement Syndrome : it 's not really about Obama 's presidency . It 's about Obama himself . It 's about his blackness , his father 's foreignness , his strange name , his radical pastor . Obama 's presidency is in many ways ordinary , but the feelings it evokes are not . There is something about seeing Obama in the White House that deeply unsettles his critics . Obama Derangement Syndrome rationalizes those feelings .\nIf it 's really true that Obama does n't love this country , if it 's really true that his birth was a conspiracy and his ideology is baroque , foreign , and hateful , then the discomfort some Americans feel when they look at Obama is justified \u2014 it 's a kind of patriotic spidey-sense .
