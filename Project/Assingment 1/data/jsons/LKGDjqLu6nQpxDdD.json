He made it fiercely clear to students at his workshops that nonviolent black protest would bring out the worst of the Deep South . They would be attacked for sitting down , beaten for marching , murdered for registering black voters . The road to change passed through pain and even martyrdom .\nLewis and Vivian graduated from Lawson \u2019 s school on different , complementary paths .
