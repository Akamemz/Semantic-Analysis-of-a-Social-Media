    "content": "FLINT , Mich. \u2014 For Hillary Clinton , the city hosting Sunday \u2019 s Democratic debate is a place whose \u201c children were poisoned by toxic water because their governor wanted to save a little money \u201d \u2014 but also , she declared on Super Tuesday , \u201c a community that \u2019 s been knocked down but refused to be knocked out . \u201d\nBut while Flint and its lead-contaminated drinking water have become almost a sacred cause among national Democratic leaders , residents of its hardest-hit neighborhoods say they \u2019 ve seen little benefit from the political spotlight shining on them . That includes Clinton \u2019 s own visit to the city early last month , when she declared that \u201c what happened in Flint is immoral . \u201d\n\u201c Hillary came , it was pure show , \u201d said Katrina Crater , a volunteer at Joy Tabernacle Church in Flint \u2019 s blighted Civic Park neighborhood . \u201c Playing up for the cameras \u2014 I understand that . But what comes next ? \u201d\n\u201c Flint is just living through this like it lived through everything else , \u201d said Noah Patton , one of the church \u2019 s pastors , whose 3-year-old daughter has tested positive for lead poisoning . `` But we need more than bottled water and reporters . ''\nA look at the lives of Flint \u2019 s residents reveals a city whose economic and social problems , following decades of job losses that have left homes and factories vacant , lie well beyond any easy political fixes \u2014 even before a cost-cutting move by Republican Gov . Rick Snyder \u2019 s administration caused a surge in lead levels in the community \u2019 s drinking water . Eighteen months after the contamination began , and five months after state officials finally acknowledged the problem , people here say they are still largely on their own .\nAt Joy Tabernacle , volunteers are bringing in bottles of water , but many residents don \u2019 t have cars to haul them home . Others , including Patton , can \u2019 t legally drive their lead-poisoned children to the doctor thanks to a state law that imposed thousands of dollars in fees for traffic offenses .\nWith human assistance faltering , the senior pastor at the nearly century-old church turned to divine intervention last weekend .\n\u201c I declare you healed from whatever damage may have been done by the lead , \u201d the Rev . Robert McCathern said , hands raised heavenward , after calling the congregation \u2019 s children to a makeshift pulpit for a blessing . The Sunday services took place in the basement , because the church 's roof collapsed in 2012 and the congregation still ca n't afford to fix it .\n\u201c I am not an angry black man , \u201d McCathern said in an interview . \u201c I \u2019 m very patriotic . I believe in our country . But I \u2019 m so close to saying what Jeremiah Wright said : 'Goddamn America . ' It \u2019 s because our children are dying and America is following Donald Trump . \u201d\nState and federal leaders have promised more help is on the way : Snyder has sent in the National Guard to distribute water , won an expansion of Medicaid for children up to age 21 and pregnant women , and pushed the Republican-controlled state legislature to provide money to help pay residents \u2019 water bills and provide medical support . Congress is debating an $ 850 million federal-state aid package for Flint and other troubled water systems \u2014 though that \u2019 s been delayed by objections from Republican senators , including presidential contender Ted Cruz of Texas .\nBut the water crisis is hitting a city that was already ill-equipped to handle any additional burdens , saddled with a 40 percent poverty rate , a tax base that has shrunk by half since the 2008 financial crisis , and a dwindling population that has left nearly one-quarter of Flint \u2019 s private parcels in the hands of a nonprofit land bank . Attempts to fix the city \u2019 s fiscal straits have further worsened problems for residents , who pay some of the nation \u2019 s highest utility rates for water that \u2019 s now unsafe to drink .\n\u201c Everyone who could leave has left , \u201d said Doug Weiland , executive director of the Genesee County Land Bank , which takes ownership of properties that have been lost to foreclosure because of delinquent taxes .\nExperts say it may cost as much as $ 1.5 billion to replace all of Flint \u2019 s lead-lined pipes , one of the most drastic potential remedies for the crisis . That \u2019 s on top of the medical attention and extra schooling that children will require to deal with the potent neurotoxin \u2019 s effects on brain development and behavior .\nThe aid package being debated in Congress , as part of a wide-ranging energy bill , would provide money for water pipes across the country , with $ 100 million tagged specifically for Flint , as well as $ 50 million for federal lead poisoning programs . Cruz lifted his \u201c soft hold \u201d on the bill late last month , although it remains bottled up by objections from Sen.

His dad left town , and when Patton was 15 his mother shot herself , leaving the teenager to scrap aluminum from neighborhood houses to get by .\nAfter having his first child at age 19 , Patton was shocked to discover how much diapers cost .
