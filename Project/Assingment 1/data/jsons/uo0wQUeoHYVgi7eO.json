    "content": "It 's official : The Romney campaign possesses a wicked sense of humor and an enviable degree of patience . After months of caterwauling , breathless innuendo and baseless slander , the Democrats and their media allies are being treated to a Friday feast of piping hot crow . The Romney campaign has released a detailed report of the the candidate 's 2011 tax returns , as well as an extensive summary of the Romneys ' taxes over the last two decades , prepared by analysts at PricewaterhouseCoopers . What do these documents contain ? Brad Malt , the Romney family 's trustee , summarizes the 2011 data :\n- In 2011 , the Romneys paid $ 1,935,708 in taxes on $ 13,696,951 in mostly investment income . - The Romneys \u2019 effective tax rate for 2011 was 14.1 % . -The Romneys donated $ 4,020,772 to charity in 2011 , amounting to nearly 30 % of their income . -The Romneys claimed a deduction for $ 2.25 million of those charitable contributions . The Romneys \u2019 generous charitable donations in 2011 would have significantly reduced their tax obligation for the year . The Romneys thus limited their deduction of charitable contributions to conform to the Governor 's statement in August , based upon the January estimate of income , that he paid at least 13 % in income taxes in each of the last 10 years .\nIn short , and as Kevin noted , Romney forked over nearly $ 2 million to Uncle Sam last year and donated more than $ 4 million to charity . He overpaid his taxes by limiting the charitable deductions he chose to claim , which could have driven his obligations to government even lower . Liberals are now actually complaining that Romney intentionally paid * too much * in taxes to boost his own effective rate , due to his prodigious philanthropic giving . This line of criticism is downright hilarious . It 's okay to point and laugh . And what about the last 20 years ?\n- In each year during the entire 20-year period , the Romneys owed both state and federal income taxes . -Over the entire 20-year period , the average annual effective federal tax rate was 20.20 % . -Over the entire 20-year period , the lowest annual effective federal personal tax rate was 13.66 % . -Over the entire 20-year period , the Romneys gave to charity an average of 13.45 % of their adjusted gross income . -Over the entire 20-year period , the total federal and state taxes owed plus the total charitable donations deducted represented 38.49 % of total AGI . -During the 20-year period covered by the PWC letter , Gov . and Mrs. Romney paid 100 percent of the taxes that they owed .\nLet 's unpack these numbers . The Romneys owed and paid state and federal income taxes every single year stretching back to at least 1990 . Harry Reid 's imaginary friend is unavailable for comment . Their effective tax rate , on average , was over 20 pecent ( nearly double the average effective rate in America , according to the non-partisan Tax Foundation ) . Does this qualify as a `` fair share '' ? In the last two decades , the Romney 's donated 13.45 percent of their adjusted gross income to charity . This totally dwarfs the long-term giving of the Obamas and the Bidens , in case anyone in the class warfare camp is keeping score . But remember , Mitt Romney is callously dismissive and uncaring toward poor people and the '47 percent . ' Overall , the Romney family paid every cent they owed -- and more -- forking over nearly 40 percent of their income to either the government or charitable organizations , including their church . I 've got to hand it to the Romney campaign : They played a long game here , and did so masterfully . One of the most obnoxious and relentless arrows in Democrats ' attack quiver has been the tax returns issue . See how greedy and secretive Romney is ? Even his own father released 12 years of returns ! He 's probably a tax cheat ! That 's all gone now , and the whiners look petty , small , and stupid . And Mitt Romney looks like the remarkably generous , law-abiding , productive member of society that he is . Bravo .\nUPDATE - Cross off criticism number one from this list .\nUPDATE II - The Romney camp sends out this statement from former IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg , who reviewed the Romneys ' tax documents :\nThese returns reflect the complexity of our tax laws and the types of investment activity that I would anticipate for persons in their circumstances . There is no indication or suggestion of any tax-motivated or aggressive tax planning activities . In my judgment , they have fully satisfied their responsibilities as taxpayers . They have done so by relying on a highly reputable return preparer and other advisors , who have in turn relied primarily on information provided by third parties to them and to the IRS . The end result of that process has been returns that include a multitude of schedules , IRS forms and accompanying statements that provide appropriate transparency and the proper payment of taxes that Governor and Mrs. Romney owe under current law .\nUPDATE III - Flashback video of the petty , clueless Senate Majority `` Leader : ''\nHe \u2019 s refused to release his tax returns , as we know . If a person coming before this body wanted to be a cabinet officer , he couldn \u2019 t be if he did the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns . So the word \u2019 s out that he hasn \u2019 t paid any taxes for ten years . Let him prove that he has paid taxes , because he hasn \u2019 t .\nOops . Now what happens to all those Obama ads claiming that Romney `` probably '' pays a lower rate `` than you '' ?\nUPDATE IV - In addition to the tax information , the Romney campaign has also released medical information about both candidates , physicians ' letters , and a whole heap of additional disclosures :\nIn addition to the complete 2010 and 2011 tax returns , Gov . Romney has released nine financial disclosures since 2002 , which are posted on this site as well . There are 3 federal Public Financial Disclosures ( from 2007 , 2011 , and 2012 ) , and 6 Massachusetts Statements of Financial Interests ( from 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 ) . The site also includes Congressman Paul Ryan \u2019 s financial information : tax returns from 2011 and 2010 for Paul and Janna Ryan , as well as 14 federal Public Financial Disclosures covering 1999-2012 .\nHow about a look at the Fast & Furious documents ( especially now that your AG has been `` vindicated '' ) and your academic records , Mr. President ? Why so secretive ?\nUPDATE V - Romney 's average effective tax rate over two decades is equivalent to what President Obama paid last year . I am beyond amused by Leftists who have dreamed up two more angry gripes : First , `` This release is a distraction ! '' Yesterday , they were * demanding * this release . Second : `` This notarized document from PricewaterhouseCoopers is a fake ! They 're lying ! Show us the long form tax returns , or we wo n't believe it . '' Congrats , guys , you 're the new birthers .\nUPDATE VI - Reid 's pitiful reaction is pretty much exactly what you might expect :\nReid on Romney deciding to release 2011 returns : `` He 's hiding something . He 's hiding something ! It is so evident he 's hiding something ! '' \u2014 Anjeanette Damon ( @ AnjeanetteDamon ) September 21 , 2012\nThanks for the laugh , Senator .
