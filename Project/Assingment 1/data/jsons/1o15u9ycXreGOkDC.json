    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Former special counsel Robert Mueller used a pair of long-anticipated appearance before Congress to drive home a central finding of his investigation : Russia 's interference in the 2016 presidential election `` is not a hoax , '' and is likely to be repeated .\nTaking questions for the first time about his two-year investigation , Mueller challenged President Donald Trump 's persistent criticism about the inquiry that cast a shadow over much of his time in office , telling lawmakers that `` it is not a witch hunt . ''\nMueller delivered nearly seven hours of testimony to the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees during a pair of hearings that Democrats hoped could change the trajectory of Trump 's presidency , even if they delivered few revelations . At times faltering , and at times facing sharp questions from Trump 's political allies , Mueller mostly offered a terse confirmation of the central findings of his inquiry .\nMueller told lawmakers that the Russian government had sought to meddle in the 2016 election in a dramatic fashion , and that it did so with an eye toward benefiting Trump . He said Trump 's campaign welcomed , even praised , that assistance , and while he said investigators did not gather sufficient evidence to prove a conspiracy , `` problematic is an understatement '' to describe some of Trump 's conduct .\nMore : What we learned from Robert Mueller : Seven hours , zero bombshells and everyone declares victory\nMore : 'It is not a witch hunt ' : Top moments from Robert Mueller 's testimony before Congress\n`` They \u2019 re doing it as we sit here . And they expect to do it again during the next campaign , '' Mueller , speaking in a soft , raspy voice , told the House Intelligence Committee . His report , he said , is a `` signal '' to those in power `` not to let this kind of thing happen again . ''\nMueller also reinforced his conclusion that his investigation had `` not exculpated '' Trump on the question of whether he sought to had attempted to obstruct justice by thwarting the special counsel inquiry .\nAs the hearing ended , Trump and his allies declared the episode closed .\n`` The American people understand that this issue is over . They also understand that the case is closed , '' Trump 's attorney , Jay Sekulow , said . Trump 's campaign manager , Brad Parscale , said Mueller 's testimony was a vindication for the president and that Democrats were `` trying to undo the legitimate result '' of the election .\nDuring his opening statements , Mueller , who led the FBI during the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , said Russia 's `` sweeping and systematic '' interference in American elections is among the most serious challenges to democracy he has seen throughout his career in law enforcement . He also said his team 's investigation of efforts to obstruct the inquiry into Russia 's actions `` was of critical importance . ''\n`` Obstruction of justice strikes at the core of the government 's effort to find the truth and to hold wrongdoers accountable , '' Mueller said .\nDemocrats spent much of the day asking Mueller to confirm episodes detailed in his report , focusing on the president 's efforts to thwart the investigation . Republicans sought to poke holes in Mueller 's legal theory and air allegations of bias and wrongdoing . Both factions were eager to score points from Mueller 's remarks , though many lawmakers appeared to have already made up their minds about the importance of what he might say .\n`` The report is my testimony . And I will stay within that text , '' Mueller said at the start of day 's first hearing , before the Judiciary committee .\nRep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , said during his opening statements that the investigation revealed the president himself `` knew that a foreign power was intervening in our election and welcomed it , built Russian meddling into their strategy , and used it . ''\nMore : Former special counsel Robert Mueller 's testimony , like his report , promises an ink-blot test for partisans\nMore : Democrats betting on Robert Mueller 's public testimony to make the case his report so far has not\n`` Worse than all the lies and the greed is the disloyalty to country , '' Schiff said .\nRep. Devin Nunes , R-Calif. , the Intelligence Committee 's ranking member , echoed familiar accusations that the FBI investigation that later became the special counsel probe was `` marred with corruption '' and bias against Trump .\n\u201c It \u2019 s time to close the curtain on the Russia hoax , \u201d he said . \u201c The conspiracy theory is dead . \u201d\nAt times , Mueller appeared to struggle to keep up with the volley of inquiries , asking that questions be repeated , appealing for help locating citations in the report . At other times , lawmakers raised their arms to flag Mueller 's attention , as the questioning moved from one end of the dais to the other .\nAsked by one lawmaker , Rep. Ted Lieu , D-Calif. , whether `` you did not indict Donald Trump is because of ( Justice Department ) opinion that you can not indict a sitting president , correct ? '' Mueller replied : `` That is correct . ''\nMueller later clarified that answer during his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee , saying his team did not reach a determination on whether Trump had obstructed justice . He told another lawmaker that Justice Department rules allow the government to bring charges against a president once he leaves office , but he did not say Trump should be charged .\nDemocrats went into the hearings betting that the spectacle of Mueller 's public appearance will carry far more weight than the report . They had hoped that words from Mueller himself would be pivotal and would make the case that the president 's conduct should be punishable by impeachment or a 2020 defeat .\nRepublicans , who have long questioned the integrity and genesis of the Russia inquiry that they say exonerated the president , used the rare public appearance to highlight the lack of charges against Trump and the perceived political motivation behind the probe . The president and his allies have accused Democrats of trying to redo the investigation by staging a belated spectacle .\nRep. Jerry Nadler , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , began the day with a summary of Mueller 's years in public service as a Marine officer who was awarded a Purple Heart and as director of the FBI .\n`` Director Mueller , we have a responsibility to address the evidence you 've uncovered , '' Nadler , D-N.Y. , said in a prepared opening statement . `` You recognized as much when you said , 'the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing . ' ''\nNadler said the hearing would highlight episodes in which Trump sought to thwart Mueller 's investigation . `` Any other person who acted this way would have been charged with a crime . And in this nation , not even the president is above the law . ''\nRep. Doug Collins , R-Ga. , the panel 's ranking member , emphasized that Mueller 's investigation did not find that Trump or his campaign conspired with Russia . Trump 's reaction to the investigation of him and his campaign was `` understandably negative , '' Collins said , `` but he did not shut down '' the inquiry .\nMueller acknowledged early on his role as a reluctant witness , telling lawmakers he can not answer questions central to ongoing investigations into the origins of the Russia inquiry and citing restrictions the Justice Department has placed on what he can and ca n't say . The department said in a letter to Mueller on Monday that his testimony `` must remain within the boundaries '' of his report and that information such as presidential communications , discussion about investigative steps and decisions made during the probe ca n't be disclosed .\nMueller largely rebuffed requests from Republican lawmakers to talk about their critiques of his investigation , some repeated by the president . He declined to answer questions about former British spy Christopher Steele , an FBI informant who wrote a `` dossier '' alleging Trump had plotted with Moscow to win the election . He sidestepped allegations of political bias , and declined to answer questions about how the FBI began investigating Trump , because he said the Justice Department , which is conducting its own review , asked him not to .\nThroughout the hearing , Democratic lawmakers focused on the investigation 's most damaging findings , flashing selected excerpts from Mueller 's report on video screens on the walls of the hearing room in an attempt to bolster evidence that Trump had engaged in obstruction . In each case , Mueller acknowledged that underlying conduct by the president necessary to support had been identified , including an alleged `` corrupt intent '' by Trump .\nMueller largely responded with one-word answers as Democratic lawmakers asked him to confirm several instances when Trump sought to limit or obstruct the investigation .\n`` No , '' Mueller said when asked of Trump was totally exonerated .\n`` True , '' Mueller said when asked whether the president sought to have then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse a decision to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia inquiry .\n`` True , '' he said when asked if Trump had ordered White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire the special counsel .\n`` Yes , '' when asked whether obstruction of justice warrant a lot of jail time if convicted .\nRepublicans , meanwhile , stepped up their challenges to Mueller , suggesting that the special counsel went beyond his authority by indicating that Trump could not be `` exonerated '' from accusations of obstruction of justice . Stacking law books on the desk in front of him , Rep. Mike Turner , R-Ohio , called on Mueller to point to a specific provision in the law that allowed him or other prosecutors to make such a determination .\n`` I 'm not prepared to have a legal discussion in that arena , '' Mueller said .\nIn one of the most animated exchanges of the day , Rep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , launched a broadside on Mueller \u2019 s investigation , questioning why prosecutors did not bring charges against a Joseph Mifsud , a Maltese academic who helped kick-start the Russian election interference inquiry in 2016 .\nMifsud first alerted Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos that Russia had derogatory information on Hillary Clinton .\nThe Mueller report documents several false statements Mifsud made to investigators .\nJordan asked why the government choose not prosecute Mifsud , asserting that prosecutors chose instead to focus on Papadopoulos and other Trump campaign advisers .\nPressed to respond , Mueller said , \u201c I can \u2019 t get into that . \u201d\n\u201c There seems to be a lot of things that you can \u2019 t get into , \u201d Jordan snapped .\nRep.

''\nMueller said he first learned of the Strzok and Page communications in the summer of 2017 and \u201c acted swiftly \u201d to remove them .\nRep .
