The federal government will start those re-enrollments now , and it will likely mean a significant increase in the number of people getting Obamacare at the start of 2015 .\nTo put that in perspective : at the start of 2014 , there were 3.3 million Obamacare enrollees \u2014 and those numbers included both Healthcare.gov and the 14 state-based exchanges . This time around , and without counting any re-enrollments , sign-ups have easily surpassed that total in half the time .\nMuch of this likely boils down to the fact that the Obama administration ( and states ) built health shopping websites that actually work this time .\nEnrollment is moving faster , and shoppers have more options when they turn up to buy . Health and Human Services put out a report earlier this month finding that the number of options on Healthcare.gov has increased 25 percent over the past year .\nMore insurers want to sell on the marketplace , and that seems to be restraining the growth of insurance premiums . The average benchmark insurance premium ( the mid-level plan that the government uses to figure out how big subsidies will be ) went up 2 percent between 2013 and 2014 . In the years before the health insurance expansion , premiums in the individual market typically went up by at least 10 percent annually .\nObamacare , despite one political disaster after another , is delivering on some of the key things the law meant to change about the health care system .
