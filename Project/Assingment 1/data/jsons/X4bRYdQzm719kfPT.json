She \u2019 s still the odds-on favorite to win her party \u2019 s nomination , more so if Vice President Biden doesn \u2019 t run .\nClinton \u2019 s challenge is voters \u2019 views of her character . And Tuesday \u2019 s televised debate in Las Vegas ( 9 p.m. Eastern time on CNN ) is her best opportunity yet to show millions of Americans why they should be inspired by her and give her their trust .\n\u201c There has been a strange disconnect between Clinton and Democratic voters and a sense of resignation , rather than excitement , about her candidacy , \u201d writes David Axelrod , former top political adviser to President Obama .\n\u201c Whatever else you think about him , [ Vermont Senator ] Sanders is utterly authentic . And right now , that is Clinton 's challenge , \u201d adds Mr. Axelrod , now director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago . \u201c It has been exacerbated by her clumsy , ever-evolving approach to the email issue \u2013 something certain to come up again in the debate \u2013 and her rapid-fire race to the left to co-opt Sanders ' positions on trade , climate change and other issues that fire up the Democratic base . \u201d\nAxelrod \u2019 s analysis suggests that it may be too late for Clinton to change voters \u2019 views of her . She can \u2019 t undo the decision to use a private e-mail server as secretary of State , and her bungled response to questions about that practice . She \u2019 s also highly unlikely ( at least while a candidate ) to rethink her newfound opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline and the major Pacific Rim trade deal that she supported while it was in the works .\nIn particular , it may be difficult for Clinton to boost her poor rating among voters on honesty and trustworthiness . Only 35 percent of voters ( of all political stripes ) see her positively on those qualities , according to the latest CBS News poll . And unlike most other candidates in the race , Clinton is widely known to the American public , thus making it hard to change impressions .\nBut she does have some aces in her hand . A majority ( 53 percent ) of all voters see her as a strong leader , and 51 percent see her as having the right experience to be a good president , according to CBS . Biden beats her on both counts \u2013 55 percent on leadership and 60 percent on experience . And he beats all candidates of both parties on honesty and trustworthiness , at 61 percent .\nSo while Biden will not be on stage Tuesday night , his potential candidacy will loom large . Of course , a candidate never looks better than before they announce ( and after they drop out ) , so if he were to get in , his record would get a thorough look in the media , which would likely bring his numbers down .\nIf Biden opts out , that leaves Clinton vs. Sanders as the main Democratic show . On Tuesday night , their rivalry will be center stage \u2013 the insider vs. the outsider , the pragmatist vs. the populist .
