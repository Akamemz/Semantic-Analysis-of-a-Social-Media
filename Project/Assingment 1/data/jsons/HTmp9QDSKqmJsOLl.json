    "content": "In the summer of 1991 , I was a very innocent 15 year-old with the remnants of childish plumpness on my face and the suggestion of womanly plumpness on my figure . I had just completed grade 10 at a private Christian school and was starting my first job as a hostess and cashier at a local 24-hour restaurant . Over the next few weeks I was subjected to relentless sexual harassment : comments on my figure , sexist jokes and innuendo , and outright sexual propositions . The kitchen was staffed by coarse young men , all around their mid-twenties , who were clearly gratified by teasing a sweet young girl with their vulgar running commentary .\nIn the wake of the # MeToo movement , women \u2019 s stories such as this one have become a familiar narrative . With one important difference : after recovering from my initial sense of awkwardness and embarrassment , I found the sexual banter empowering , exciting , and even\u2014gasp ! \u2014funny . I started to realize that if the line cooks threw a sexual joke or comment to me , I was invited to throw one back to them . I soon realized that , although one of them would proposition me a number of times during an eight hour shift , I had the power to reject him\u2014not just reject him but to do so with a playful insult that then made him the butt of jokes along the short order line for the rest of the shift .\nWhat I learned that summer was that the adult world was often about sex . I learned that I didn \u2019 t need to be afraid of it . I learned that I had a lot more power over men than I originally thought\u2014not simply because , as a cute young thing , I was awakening to my own feminine sexuality and realized how keenly the guys wanted me to like them , but because I had more power than I realized to reject their advances , to assert my sense of sexual agency not because it was a private and protected part of me , but precisely because it was so openly commented upon .\nWhat I realized , too , is that these exchanges weren \u2019 t offensive , they were playful ; that they weren \u2019 t demeaning , but led to mutual respect . It was the very indecency of the back of house culture that made working at that 24-hour restaurant a tolerable job , and it was all the vulgar insults of the workplace that gave a kind of gritty dignity to our work there . Working there one became part of family . Flouting the rules that govern social niceties , which had to be observed carefully in the restaurant dining room , was the initiation into the clan . What I \u2019 ve learned since that summer is that the culture of that greasy spoon kitchen has a rich anthropology ; it \u2019 s the type of community that populates the taverns of Shakespeare \u2019 s plays , for instance , and it functions in direct opposition to officialdom . Its currency is an abundance of filthy light-heartedness , and its economy subverts the normative claims of merit and respectability , those two pillars of social authority and middle-class morality . In the kitchen , the more horrible you are , the better ! The profane and free culture of the kitchen was the antidote to the polite restraint of the dining room , as it is to ethic of rigid inoffensiveness that governs our politically correct culture .\nWhat I experienced that summer are two related but distinct aspects of feminine sexual empowerment . The first was an awareness that it is the dirty jokes and sexual jibes of anti-official cultures that allow its members to feel a closeness to each other ; it is a kind of solidarity achieved through a laughing disregard for formal decency . The sexual language of the back of house erased the social divisions that would normally demand our politeness . ( Some of the line cooks were high-school dropouts ; a few had criminal records . I was the daughter of civil engineer , attending private school , and on a fairly streamlined track to academic studies . And yet here I was , being teased by these guys , and in turn jabbing back at them , tit for tat . ) What would now be considered clear-cut sexual harassment was the very thing that forged a true respect amongst us : the guys in the kitchen believed I was tough enough to take their insults . It was in their very coarseness that they treated me with honesty and equality . Treating me as a fragile young woman too delicate to handle their dirty comments , now that would be have been insulting !\nThe other component of female strength that I discovered that summer was the power inherent in my sexual self-restraint , or what historically has been known as \u201c feminine virtue. \u201d I \u2019 m certainly not advocating for any notion of sexual purity or for some cult of female chastity . Rather , what I \u2019 m suggesting is that there is a uniquely feminine power to say either yes or , as was the case with me , no . I felt connected to women \u2019 s history in a way we don \u2019 t hear about often today : I am empowered as a woman because I am a woman . I began to understand that feminine virtue instructs men in masculine virtue . At times , I returned a sexual comment not with another insult , but with an eyeroll , and sometimes I \u2019 d assert myself not by outdoing a dirty remark , but by activating codes of gallantry and manliness . A blush and a quiet \u201c Alright . That \u2019 s enough , \u201d would change the tone of the kitchen banter entirely . In contrast to the dining room where a polite separation existed between staff and customers , in the kitchen intimacy was displayed not just through insults but also through gentleness , and through gentlemanliness\u2014and all it took was a blush ! Resting on my feminine \u201c weaker \u201d nature was the way to control the social dynamic of the \u201c toxic masculinity \u201d of the back of house culture .\nBefore I go any further , I should make one thing clear : at 15 I was virginal and innocent , but I was in no way na\u00efve\u2014the constant crackling of the sexual tension in the kitchen of that 24-hour restaurant was instructive to me in other important ways : though I was beginning to develop a clear sense of my feminine power , I realized I was not invulnerable to predatory masculine sexuality . A large part of my tutelage that summer was in street smarts . Occasionally a table of men would come in who were real pigs . Not part of the working tribe , they had no claim to insult me with impunity . Their comments were often disgusting , and it was a humiliating experience\u2014for them ! I had by then learned the power of female scorn , and it worked pretty effectively to shut down lewd comments . Most of the time . Rarely , but occasionally , at the end of a shift , one of these men would still be lounging in a booth , drinking coffee and smoking without much else going on . I don \u2019 t know if any one of these guys ever posed an actual threat to me or to my female co-workers . We never took the chance to find out . If a shift ended late and it was dark out and one of the girls \u2019 car was parked at the far end of the lot , she would ask one of the cooks or male servers to walk her out . And they always behaved like gentlemen when they did so\u2014though they very likely were \u201c harassing \u201d us during the shift . This wasn \u2019 t seen by any of us as unfair or a double standard or in any way remarkable . It was just good common sense . As far as I know , even though that restaurant was open 24 hours and every night there would always be a rowdy post-midnight rush after the local bars shut their doors , not once was a female staff assaulted at work or while leaving it .\nYes , I have other female friends who weren \u2019 t so fortunate , and it ought to go without saying that the men who assaulted them should be subjected to the fullest rigour of the law . There is a tremendous difference , however , between coarse co-workers and dangerous misogynists ; a difference between colleagues who tell a dirty joke and those who use coercion to elicit sex . Losing the ability to appreciate nuance is not a triumph of moral progress . It is stupidity masquerading as enlightenment . If we elide the two , then it is true that women will no longer feel the confusion and embarrassment I felt during my first couple of shifts . But we will also eliminate the opportunity for women to embody a position of strength and maturity that is only possible when confronted with sexual advances . There was nothing special about me as a 15 year-old girl . My sense of myself as a strong , free woman developed as a direct result of being subjected to the propositions of my coworkers . I said no . A lot . Saying no did not cause the jokes and the indecency to stop . Far from it . That part of restaurant culture remained very much alive . It was in fact an essential part of the health of the restaurant\u2014funny though that sounds today\u2014because it was accompanied by joy and toughness , and because it helped me to understand the power of my feminine sexual virtue . It felt like a superpower .\nContemporary feminism insists that the ideals of feminine virtue were a trick played on women by the patriarchy in order to keep female sexuality under control . Yet what I learned that summer was the opposite : my feminine virtue , traditionally understood , allowed me to control men . Women throughout the centuries have not primarily understood themselves as victims of patriarchal oppression\u2014all one has to do is look to Jane Austen \u2019 s plucky heroines , or Shakespeare \u2019 s witty bar-wenches , or Chaucer \u2019 s sexual dynamo the Wife of Bath . But since the 1980s , young women , and men , have increasingly been taught that this has been the case , and we retroactively reinterpret the narratives of the past in order to reconfirm our own sense of moral progress . This has resulted , however , not in women becoming stronger , but rather in a pervasive culture of victimhood . One can \u2019 t be virtuous by the old standards , since those were devised by men to keep women oppressed , and one can \u2019 t claim to embody feminine virtue in itself , because that would essentialize gender , and we now know that gender is socially constructed . The only avenue left is to claim righteous indignation at the mistreatment of women by men . This is the narrative of perpetual victimization . It is a story of despair\u2014plus it isn \u2019 t much fun !\nOf course , a reasonable objection to the kind of sexually saturated culture I \u2019 m describing here is that an individual should be treated as a professional in their job , not as any kind of representative of gender and certainly not as a sexual object . Professional androgyny is the ideal . Yet I can \u2019 t think of a more Orwellian nightmare than everyone becoming reduced to their job , to their function in the service of\u2026 what ? Corporate gain ? Bureaucratic convenience ? To their utility ? As though the highest aim of humanity is to be treated as the mere conduit of some professional task ?\nSince my time at that restaurant , I have experienced professional sexual discrimination , and assault . I understand what it feels like . And I understand what a dirty joke feels like . If we have lost the ability to distinguish between the two , then there we are either a society of frankly stupid people who are calling a social triumph what is actually our inability to differentiate between coercive sexual threats and a kind of proletarian sexual rambunctiousness , or we are moving toward administrated and alienating human relations with a kind of gleeful despair . We are defining as justice what is really our transfer of sovereignty to impersonal and inhumane bureaucratic systems of authority .\nIf we maintain that a world without sexual commentary of any kind is better than a world in which one has to negotiate sexual advances\u2014oh , the horror ! \u2014for oneself , then we are denying our young girls the opportunity to become strong , tough , and independent women who are capable of handling adult sexuality .
