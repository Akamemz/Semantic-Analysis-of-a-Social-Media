    "content": "Weeks later , the Sunshine State has emerged as a coronavirus epicenter . Nearly 1 out of every 100 residents is infected with the virus , hospital intensive care units are full or filling up , and big-name visitors who chose Florida for their first post-isolation events are now mired in questions and controversies about safety .\nAmid escalating infections , Florida , once held up by President Trump as a model for how to manage the novel coronavirus , is faring poorly . Residents worry the situation will get much worse . Florida is now one of a handful of states whose spiking numbers are driving a major resurgence of the virus in the United States , which is approaching 3 million cases .\nGov . Ron DeSantis ( R ) has downplayed the growing outbreak in Florida , saying expanded testing is responsible for more positive results and emphasizing that many new infections are among younger people less likely to experience the worst effects of the virus .\nOn Tuesday there were 213,794 cases of the coronavirus in Florida , according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 data . The state has tallied a record number of cases over the past week , averaging 8,766 a day , according to Post data .\nIn a sign of intensifying trouble , 52 intensive care units across more than a third of the state \u2019 s counties had reached capacity by Tuesday , according to data released by the state \u2019 s Agency for Health Care Administration . Another 17 hospitals had also run out of regular beds . The state has \u201c abundant capacity , \u201d DeSantis said at a news conference Tuesday .\nSome nurses at Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm Beach have been working 18 hours instead of the usual 12 because of overnight staffing shortages , according to a nurse who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing her job . Patients are being treated in an open area cordoned off by curtains that is typically used for quick medical consultations , she said .\nRyan Lieber , a spokesman for the hospital , denied employees were being asked to work 18-hour shifts , adding in a statement , \u201c Patients are being treated in areas of the hospital which are considered appropriate for their care , and respectful of their privacy at all times . \u201d\nFlorida Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran late Monday ordered that the state \u2019 s schools open for in-person instruction next month , igniting fears that a new round of classroom interactions would lead to a new round of infections .\n\u201c We want to proceed with caution , but unfortunately the governor continues to deny the science , \u201d said Fedrick Ingram , president of the Florida Education Association . \u201c The trend over the last 30 days has been astronomical . We \u2019 re in regression , we \u2019 re going backward . In terms of the amount of cases , we are literally going backward as a state . \u201d\nHospital leaders , lawmakers , physicians , epidemiologists , advocates and others familiar with the state \u2019 s response said a false sense of security set in when grim predictions about the virus \u2019 s spread in Florida did not come to pass in March and April . DeSantis declared victory , attending a laudatory news conference at the White House with President Trump . The editor of National Review wrote an editorial titled \u201c Where does Ron DeSantis go to get his apology ? \u201d\nBut observers maintain the state then failed to prepare for a surge of the virus , which struck as residents were seeking refuge in air-conditioned indoor spaces , where the virus is believed to be most easily transmitted .\nSports leagues that opted to restart their seasons in Florida will now play in a state that is in worse shape than when the pandemic began . Many teams are already in the state , and they face a growing number of critics who believe they should cancel games .\nThe Republican National Convention , scheduled to take place in Jacksonville next month , faces similar questions about safety .

But as cases mount in the city , worries have crept in .\n\u201c My concern has grown since a week ago . It has gotten worse , \u201d said Tommy Hazouri , the Democratic president of the city council and a former Jacksonville mayor . Hazouri was initially supportive of his city \u2019 s effort to secure the convention .\n\u201c It is time to accept reality , and no one can be in denial about what is going on , \u201d he said . \u201c At some point our council and the leaders in this community have to draw a line in the sand on where we need to be going . \u201d\nSeveral hundred doctors have signed a petition that says the convention needs stronger safety measures . Nancy Staats , a retired anesthesiologist who lives in the Jacksonville area , said she hoped a few dozen doctors would sign the petition she helped circulate .

That \u2019 s still six or seven weeks off and we \u2019 re still climbing scarily , rapidly , \u201d Staats said . \u201c This is about people \u2019 s lives , including the attendees of this event . \u201d\nNBA and Major League Soccer teams have already landed in Orlando , hoping they play in a coronavirus-free bubble .\nA day before resuming summer tournaments , FC Dallas was sent home after a coach and 10 players tested positive for the coronavirus at the same Disney sports complex that will host the NBA later this month .
