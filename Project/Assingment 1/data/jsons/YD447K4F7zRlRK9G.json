    "content": "The party of Donald Trump began almost 10 years ago to the day , when John McCain tapped Sarah Palin to join his ticket .\nIt \u2019 s one of the most important moments of McCain \u2019 s career . He proved willing to empower a demagogue when he thought doing so would improve his political fortunes , exactly the sin so many of his colleagues in the Republican Party have committed since Trump won their party \u2019 s nomination .\n\u201c She \u2019 s not from these parts and she \u2019 s not from Washington , but when you get to know her , you \u2019 re going to be as impressed as I am , \u201d McCain said when he announced his decision . \u201c She \u2019 s got the grit , integrity , the good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in Washington today . \u201d\nPalin \u2019 s big moment in front of a national audience was at the Republican National Convention . Her big opener was to ask the crowd : \u201c What \u2019 s the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull ? \u201d Her answer : \u201c Lipstick . \u201d\nHer showdown with Joe Biden at the first vice presidential debate was the most anticipated moment of the campaign . The debate began with a handshake between the two candidates and Palin asking Biden , \u201c Hey , can I call you Joe ? \u201d It went downhill from there . She stumbled through or garbled talking points on basic policy questions , weaving in half a dozen references to \u201c maverick \u201d and \u201c a team of mavericks. \u201d The event drew 70 million viewers \u2014 the largest audience for a vice presidential debate in history . She dazzled conservatives .\nNational Review editor Rich Lowry described her as \u201c so sparkling it was almost mesmerizing , [ sending ] little starbursts through the screen and ricocheting around the living rooms of America . \u201d\nPalin \u2019 s run solidified the Republican Party \u2019 s comfort with a candidate who would say absurdities . When Katie Couric wanted to know what newspapers she read , Palin answered , \u201c Um , all of them , any of them that have been in front of me over all these years . \u201d\nEven though McCain and Palin were bested by Barack Obama and Joe Biden , Palin inspired a slew of copycats , unleashing a political style and a values system that animated the Tea Party movement and laid the groundwork for a Trump presidency .\nMcCain , who passed away at age 81 , is remembered as a maverick , a man who crossed the aisle and built relationships with Democrats . But he also betrayed his own values hoping to win a presidential election , and sent the Republican Party down the path to Trump .\nMcCain \u2019 s campaign was in free fall at the end of August 2008 . He needed a Hail Mary , as many in the media put it at the time .\nHe seemed interested in tapping his close friend Sen. Joe Lieberman , a moderate Democrat , though a foreign policy hawk , who ran with Al Gore in 2000 . Lieberman endorsed McCain over Obama . He wasn \u2019 t exactly a figure who \u2019 d excite ... anyone .\nPalin , on the other hand , was a charismatic figure who campaign manager Steve Schmidt thought might appeal to women and to the party \u2019 s base . She was the governor of Alaska and had been the mayor of her small town , Wasilla . She \u2019 d also been called a \u201c maverick \u201d for confronting corruption in the state legislature , an identity that meshed well with McCain \u2019 s own .\nPretty quickly , though , Palin \u2019 s shortcomings started to show . She flubbed basic questions in interviews . Like : Why did you think Roe v. Wade was a bad decision ? ( Abortion was a central theme of Palin \u2019 s politics . )\nMcCain \u2019 s decision to pick her was called into question right away . How did McCain miss the signs that maybe she wasn \u2019 t up to the job ?\nIn 2008 , I flew to Wasilla , Alaska , the day after Palin was tapped . I headed to the city clerk \u2019 s office to pick up copies of meeting minutes from when she was mayor . I assumed the McCain campaign had done the same , but no . As I wrote at the time :\nI just got off the phone with the very helpful city clerk at the Wasilla City Clerk \u2019 s office , Kristie Smithers , who is pulling some documents for me from when Gov . Sarah Palin was mayor . I told her I appreciated her help , since I \u2019 m sure she \u2019 s been bombarded with requests these last few weeks . The clerk \u2019 s office keeps all City Council meeting agendas , minutes , legislation , ordinances , etc . She chuckled . Then she told me that I \u2019 m the first person who has asked her office for anything .\nMcCain was prepared to put Palin a \u201c heartbeat away from the presidency \u201d without even checking if she could do the job . Instead , he picked her because she seemed like a good play to the base .\nConservatives had long dallied in race baiting , like the the push poll credited with dooming McCain in the 2000 presidential primary in South Carolina .
