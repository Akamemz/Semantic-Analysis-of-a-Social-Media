Each won about three-fifths of the vote and widened their already imposing leads among pledged delegates .\nIn so doing , both Trump and Clinton opened a pathway to winning their nominations outright before the conventions begin in July . In recent weeks , doubts had arisen as both front-runners seemed to lose altitude and as rivals promoted the prospect of open conventions in both Cleveland and Philadelphia .\nBut after New York , the pressure is back on the challengers , who will find fewer opportunities to narrow the gap in delegates with every passing week . The last best chance to stop either Trump or Clinton may well be next week , when Pennsylvania , Maryland , Connecticut , Rhode Island and Delaware hold the next-to-last round of multistate primaries . A total of 144 delegates will be available for Republicans and 392 for Democrats . There will not be a comparable package until the season 's final day on June 7 .\nA sweep for either front-runner next week would make stopping Trump or Clinton not only daunting but mathematically infeasible .

She did not dominate the delegate count quite as much as Trump , but only because the Democrats divide their delegates proportionally \u2014 both statewide and district by district .
