Since taking office, he has aligned himself with the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, which has become a reliable ally of the Trump White House.\n\nLast year, as protesters crashed his events in the midst of a House push to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare program, Brat remarked that \u201cwomen are in my grille no matter where I go.\u201d\n\nThose words have followed him ever since.\n\nIn September, Brat held his first town hall in a year and did so with supportive audience of older veterans.\n\nSarah Montgomery, a librarian for the U.S. Department of Defense who attended Spanberger\u2019s event in Spotsylvania, said that after Brat\u2019s district was redrawn in 2016 to include her home, she researched him, and the video of his \u201cgrille\u201d remark was the first thing she found.\n\n\u201cHe obviously has no respect for women,\u201d she said.\n\nThe firestorm over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault while in high school, came at a perilous moment for Brat, given his already difficult reputation with some women voters.\n\nTrump has played a part. Both Sneed and Lesser were angry that he chose to attack Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, at a rally last week.\n\n\u201cIt was disgusting,\u201d Lesser said.\n\nKavanaugh was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Saturday. Democratic activists hope discontent with his nomination will linger through November.\n\nRepublicans, however, see the Kavanaugh fracas as galvanizing conservatives who have been looking for a reason to come out and vote in November\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cIt has mobilized and energized Republican voters in a way that only a Supreme Court nomination can,\u201d said Matt Gorman, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the arm of the party that supports House candidates like Brat.\n\nBrat has been a solid supporter of Kavanaugh, even though the House served no role in his nomination, and reasserted that support last week in a Facebook post.\n\nHis campaign rejected the notion that he is not supportive of women, pointing to his efforts to combat human trafficking and the opioid epidemic and the passage of tax reform last year.\n\n\u201cCongressman Brat has worked hard on issues affecting women since day one,\u201d said a spokesperson, Katey Price.\n\nA MODERATE TONE\n\nA 39-year-old former officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, Spanberger looks like she could be the face of the Resistance, the woman-driven protest movement against Trump.\n\nBut she has been careful to not alienate the independent and moderate voters she needs to win the district.
