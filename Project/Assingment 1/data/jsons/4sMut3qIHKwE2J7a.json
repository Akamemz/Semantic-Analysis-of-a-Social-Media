Virginia is really the crucible of that . \u201d\nVirginia , a historically gun-friendly Southern state , has become a front line in the battle over gun rights in the United States , as newly elected Democrats move forward with a ban on new sales of assault-style rifles .\nBut if you are like the 22,000 people who gathered in Richmond , Virginia , late last month , openly carrying an assault-style rifle is a form of protest and a reminder of Second Amendment rights . \u201c The pictures that are taken from here ... can live forever and encourage people to remember our rights , \u201d says Jeff Hulbert , a gun-rights advocate from Maryland who attended the rally .\nIf you are like Laura Kinzinger of Cape Charles , Virginia , you might call the police and then duck , run , and hide . \u201c It might be legal , \u201d she says . \u201c But it \u2019 s not normal . \u201d\nHow would you react to a plainclothes resident strolling down the street with an AR-15 tossed over his shoulder ?\nAs chants of \u201c USA ! USA ! \u201d poured over him , Jeff Hulbert stood at the ready \u2013 a soldier , in his eyes , of democracy . Behind him rose the peak of the Virginia Capitol in the state that has become ground zero in the shifting politics of gun rights across the United States .\nOn a fence fluttered a \u201c We Will Not Comply \u201d banner . Strapped around his shoulder , an Israeli Tavor rifle , which fires the same ammunition as an AR-15 \u2013 a military-style weapon that has become popular as an avatar of armed citizenship on the right and decried as a machine of mass death on the left .\n\u201c We think it \u2019 s very symbolic to wear our sidearms , to wear a rifle , because the pictures that are taken from here ... can live forever and encourage people to remember our rights , \u201d says Mr. Hulbert , a Maryland resident and founder of Patriot Picket , a gun-rights advocacy group .\nBut Cape Charles resident Laura Kinzinger has an opposite reaction . If she saw someone openly carrying a long rifle , she says she \u2019 d call the police and then duck , run , and hide .\n\u201c It might be legal . But it \u2019 s not normal , \u201d she says . \u201c That person might suddenly use it . I mean , there could be accidents . The thought of walking around with an [ assault-style ] rifle is just horrific . They are designed to kill people . That \u2019 s what they do . \u201d\nAs complaints of government overreach still echo from the 22,000-strong show of largely armed force in Richmond late last month , newly elected Democrats are moving forward with a ban on new sales of the assault-style rifles , including misdemeanor penalties for possession of magazines that hold more than seven rounds .\nThe turn of a historically gun-friendly Southern state toward gun restrictions comes as the U.S. Supreme Court takes its first gun rights case in a decade to determine how far municipalities can go to restrict guns . Given that a conservative majority is unlikely to OK broad new restraints , battles at the state level have come to define an epic shift for Second Amendment reformers .\n\u201c It is an amazing moment , \u201d says Adam Winkler , a law professor at the University of California , Los Angeles , and author of \u201c Gunfight : The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America. \u201d \u201c A lot of people since [ the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre ] have expressed disappointment that nothing has changed , but we have actually seen a real shift in American gun politics . Virginia is really the crucible of that . \u201d\nOn Monday , the House of Delegates advanced the assault-style ban to its final reading , with Democratic lawmakers contending that it will not infringe on anybody \u2019 s Second Amendment rights . Republicans argue otherwise , saying it would criminalize ownership of some magazines , even after Democrats tempered penalties to a misdemeanor . At one point , police escorted protesters out of the chamber . \u201c Whose side are you on ? \u201d they shouted at officers .\nBut the political fight between blue suburbs and red rural areas over the proposed ban has also bared tensions among gun owners themselves . Does open carry , as Mr. Hulbert hopes , normalize the image of an armed citizenry ? Or does it further entrench the idea that the right to carry a long rifle infringes on the freedoms of non-gun owners ?\nWilliamsburg , Virginia , resident Josiah Gray says open carry should be restricted to police officers . The parking officer says carrying a gun might make some people feel safer , but others could be intimidated or possibly traumatized , especially if they lost someone they knew to gun violence .\n\u201c You never know how it affects other people , \u201d he says . \u201c If you don \u2019 t have a uniform , it looks kind of off to the other people that you have a gun . \u201d\nSome gun owners share those doubts . Few gun owners question the right , but many ask about the \u201c pragmatic aspect of open carry , \u201d says Wake Forest University sociologist David Yamane , founder of the Gun Culture 2.0 blog . \u201c There are many people in the gun community who really dislike open carry as a method of normalizing firearms . \u201d\nIn essence , an open source platform that has sold more than 8 million exemplars on its journey to become \u201c America \u2019 s Gun , \u201d the Armalite Rifle , gun owners say , is basically a slick-looking single-fire rifle . Mechanically and caliber-wise , that is correct . But it is also a masterpiece of war . Its military cousin was a replacement for the unreliable M-14 ; its ability to kill Viet Cong in tight quarters stunned Army researchers .\nThe AR was first introduced to the civilian population as a hunting rifle , and its advertising slogan belies its appeal : If it is good enough for the military , it is good enough for all of us . The sunsetting of the federal assault weapons ban in 2004 opened an era of gun rights expansion , where three-quarters of states have now loosened regulations on concealed and open carry , and have expanded the rights of lethal self defense .\nBut that arc has been complicated by the gun \u2019 s use in a growing number of mass killings , as well as the rise of violent far-right nationalism , members of which law enforcement said posed credible threats as they sought to infiltrate the Richmond rally .\nAs a result , some of the states that led the expansion of gun rights \u2013 like Florida \u2013 are tapping the brakes .
