( OVER SIDE VIEW OF PUTINSPEAKING ) There are also some questions to both the government and the central bank ( OVER WIDE OF NEWS CONFERENCE ) about the timing and quality of those measures , but as a whole the actions are absolutely adequate and in the right direction. \u201d ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201c But there is also no doubt , and I would like to underline it , the rebound , the subsequent rise ( of the rouble ) and the exit from the current situation is unavoidable . ( SHOWING TWO FINGERS ) There are at least two reasons for it . ( OVER WIDE OF NEWS CONFERENCE ) First , the global economic growth will remain , the pace is declining but the growth will still be there , ( OVER SIDE VIEW OFPUTIN SPEAKING ) the economy will be growing . And our economy too will emerge from the current situation . How much time will it take ? In the worst case scenario I think about two years . And let me repeat once again , ( BACK TO PUTIN ) after this the growth is unavoidable , also because the economic situation will also be changing . With the global economic growth more energy resources will be needed. \u201d 4172 ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201c We do not attack anyone , we only defend our interests . ( CONTINUES OVER WIDE SHOT OF NEWS CONFERENCE ) And dissatisfaction of our partners , first of all American ones , ( CONTINUES OVER SHOT OF REPORTER LISTENING ) is related with us doing exactly this and not with us making steps ( CONTINUES OVER WIDE OF NEWS CONFERENCE ) that provoke tension in the security field. \u201d 3 . VARIOUS OF REPORTERS LISTENING 6 . ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201d ( STARTS OVER SHOT OF REPORTERS LISTENING ) US ( military ) bases are all over the world and you want to say that we behave aggressively ? Is there a common sense there ? ( CONTINUES IN FRAME ) What are US armed forces doing in Europe , including tactical nuclear weapons ? What are they doing there ? Listen , the budget of our Defence ministry for the next year has increased , in dollars it is about 50 billion . And the Pentagon budget is almost ten times bigger. \u201d 7 . PUTIN AT NEWS CONFERENCE 8 . ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201c Are we the ones moving troops towards the US or other states \u2019 borders ? Who moves NATO bases and military infrastructure towards us ? Not us . Does anyone listen to us ? Is anyone having some kind of a dialogue with us on that ? ( CONTINUES OVER WIDE OF NEWS CONFERENCE ) No , none . We always get the same answer - \u201d this is none of your business , every country has the right to choose its ways of ensuring its security. \u201d Ok , but in this case we will do the same. \u201d 4077 ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT , VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201c Didn \u2019 t they ( the West ) tell us after the fall of the Berlin Wall that there will be no NATO \u2019 s expansion eastwards ? It has begun immediately after . Two waves of expansion . ( OVER WIDE OF HALL ) Isn \u2019 t it a wall ? ( OVER SHOT OF REPORTER LISTENING ) Yes , they haven \u2019 t dug it out , it is a virtual wall , but they have started to create it . What about the missile defence system ( CONTINUES IN SHOT ) next to our borders ? Isn \u2019 t it a wall ? \u201d 3 . UKRAINIAN REPORTER ASKING QUESTION 4 . NEWS CONFERENCE IN PROGRESS 5 . ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201d ( STARTS OVER SHOT OF REPORTER LISTENING ) In our public consciousness ( CONTINUES IN SHOT ) what \u2019 s happening in the south-east of Ukraine is a punitive operation but it is being carried out by the current Kiev authorities , and not the opposite . ( CONTINUES OVER SHOT OF MEDIA ) Because not the rebels of the south-east sent their troops to Kiev , ( CONTINUES IN SHOT ) on the opposite - the Kiev authorities sent their armed forces towards the south-east and used missile launchers , artillery and military jets. \u201d 6 . MEDIA 7 . ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201d ( STARTS OVER SHOT OF WOMAN LISTENING ) Today they ( Kiev authorities ) are trying to resolve the issue ( in the east ) also through force , by using an economic blockade . ( CONTINUES IN SHOT ) I find that this method does not have any potential , it is harmful to the fate of Ukraine \u2019 s statehood and the Ukrainian people. \u201d 8 . MEDIA 9 . ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201c I hope that we will be able through the dialogue - and we are ready to mediate here - to reach direct political dialogue and through these means and political methods to settle the situation. \u201d 10 . NEWS CONFERENCE IN PROGRESS 11 . ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201c Sometimes I myself think - maybe our bear has just to sit quite ( CONTINUES OVER MEDIUM SHOT OF NEWS CONFERENCE ) , not to chase piglets and pigs through the taiga , ( CONTINUES IN SHOT ) but to eat berries , honey and maybe then he will be left alone ? No , he won \u2019 t , because they will always try ( CONTINUES OVER WIDE OF NEWS CONFERENCE ) to put him on a chain and once they succeed in it - they will rip out both teeth and nails . In today \u2019 s words - ( CONTINUES IN SHOT ) these mean nuclear deterrent forces . As soon as this happens God forbid - they would not need the bear anymore , they will take over the taiga. \u201d \u201d 4189 ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201c The economy will inevitably adapt to the environment of low energy prices . It will necessarily be diversified . And second , even if we believe that energy prices will remain low or become even lower , there will inevitably be a point in time when they will start rising again , almost like it \u2019 s something planned , with the global economic growth and rising energy demand . And I have no doubt this will happen. \u201d 4 . WIDE OF NEWS CONFERENCE IN PROGRESS 5 . ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201c But one thing we can be absolutely confident about is that we will overcome this period and we will emerge from this current complicated situation having straightened our positions both inside the country and in the global economy and on the international arena. \u201d 9 . ( SOUNDBITE ) ( Russian ) RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN , SAYING : \u201d ( STARTING OVER TOP VIEW OF NEWS CONFERENCE ) The responsibility for everything that happens in the country always lies with the head of state , and then with other people down the ranks .
