It wo n't happen again . \u2014 Anthony Scaramucci ( @ Scaramucci ) July 28 , 2017\nNow , as a lifelong anti-Communist \u2014 never mind a National Review guy \u2014 I am happy to concede that McCarthy was on the right side of the argument . But he undermined the cause by the demagogic and dishonest way he tried to win the argument . He made up evidence , wildly exaggerated , and accused anyone who disagreed with him or his tactics of being traitors . The Left wanted to make any concern about Communist infiltration of the government into a disreputable \u201c witch hunt. \u201d McCarthy helped them make that claim more easily . But the truth is that , despite whatever witch-hunt atmosphere there may have been , there were actual witches to be worried about .\nConsider the difference between these two contexts . During the Cold War , the Soviets were determined to overthrow the United States of America , at least in theory . In practice , they were definitely determined to undermine American interests at home and abroad . Treating people who were sympathetic to the Soviet cause \u2014 never mind actively engaged in helping them \u2014 as less than patriotic is to my mind entirely justified .\nBut here we have a man who thinks McCarthyite tactics are justified to support Donald Trump . Scaramucci says he \u2019 s doing this to advance the \u201c president \u2019 s agenda \u201d to make America great again . But it seems more obvious that his first priority is to curry favor with the boss and solidify his own power .\nAlso , let me just say that loyalty to a person isn \u2019 t how we define patriotism in this country . Patriotism is about adherence to ideas and principles . Rich Lowry would be the first to insist it \u2019 s also defined as loyalty to historic concepts of nationhood . That \u2019 s fine . But it \u2019 s not defined by loyalty to man . Not here .\nAnd that brings me to the second reason why this is all so disturbing . Trump apparently approves of what Scaramucci is doing and how he \u2019 s doing it .\nI \u2019 m not going to offer a big post-mortem on the kakistocratic cock-up that unfolded yesterday , largely because I did a pre-mortem on Monday and it holds up pretty well . The only thing I \u2019 d add is that winning is not a sufficient motivation to win in legislative politics . In sports , winning is its own reward , and all the interests of the players are aligned to that singular goal . Campaigns are more like sports in this regard . Winning the election is the game . But , even here , electoral politics are different than sports in that the team on the field has to convince the people in the stands and watching the game on TV to root for them . Football teams may like a cheering crowd , but the cheers alone don \u2019 t put points on the board . Legislative politics is even more different . All Mitch McConnell wanted was a win \u2014 defined as checking a box and moving on \u2014 and so he focused on process , even as he jettisoned critical points of policy like so much extra cargo in a sinking ship .\nAll the White House wanted was a win for Trump and so it took no interest in the substance of the legislation . Trump even talked up losing votes like they were a football score ( \u201c The vote would have been pretty close to , \u201d Trump said ten days ago , \u201c if you look at it , 48 to 4 . That \u2019 s a pretty impressive vote by any standard \u201d ) .\nThe same goes for large swathes of conservative electronic media , which covered the Republican health-care push like a playoff where the goal was to give either the GOP or Trump a victory rather than as a legislative process that requires selling a program to the viewers at home .\nCanine Update : I really , really don \u2019 t want to jinx anything , but I \u2019 m starting to think that Zo\u00eb is finally mellowing in middle age . Oh , she \u2019 s still known to squirrels as Zo\u00eb Bringer of Death and as The Tan Menace to deer . Rabbit moms still tell their babies to finish their carrots or the Dingo might get them . But after many long years of fighting with her to get in the car when called and trying to keep her out of scraps with other dogs , she \u2019 s starting to act like , well , a dog and not a half-feral swamp beast .\nEven a year ago , if you let her out of the car without her leash , she would likely run up the street to make sure there were no varmint cells in our neighbors back yards . If she chased a deer , I could call for her for 20 minutes before she would emerge from the bush . She still won \u2019 t tolerate back-talk from yip dogs and the like , but every day I worry a little less about having to pry some poodle out of her mouth . On the flip side , she \u2019 s become much needier for coddling and affection from her humans and much more jealous of the cats and Pippa . Thou shalt pet me first , last , and always is becoming her daily command . We \u2019 re trying to disabuse her of that a bit .\nThe Spaniel needs love ( and tennis balls ) , too . But this is a much better problem to have than having her run into traffic or getting shot for her dingo-ness . And still she maintains her capacity to entertain .\nDon \u2019 t be shocked to find presidents using federal money to coerce .\nThe strange similarity of neuron and galaxy networks ( Simpsons did it )\nGiant deep-sea worms may live to be 1,000 years old",
