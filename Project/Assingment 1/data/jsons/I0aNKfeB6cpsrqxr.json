Expensive , yes , but not a joy ride .\nHere are four takeaways , now that the Republican local has completed its northeastern course .\nTrump Towered . I \u2019 ve kept struggling with a way to best characterize Donald Trump \u2019 s roll \u2013 New York last week ; Connecticut , Delaware , Maryland , Pennsylvania and Rhode Island all this week .\nOne thought : Trump 2016 looks a lot like the American map circa the mid-1700 \u2019 s . He \u2019 s conquered 12 of the 13 original colonies ( New Jersey votes on June 7 ) , plus most of the southeast . Except for a few states here and there , Trump controls the American continent east of the Mississippi River .\nBut now the race moves west . First up : Indiana , on May 3 ( more on that in a moment ) . A week later : West Virginia and Nebraska .\nAfter that , the GOP field spends quality time on the West Coast \u2013 two weeks in Oregon and Washington \u2013 before a final push in California , Montana , New Mexico , South Dakota and the aforementioned New Jersey .\nThe question : Trump has momentum as he steps off the Acela . Then again , so too did Texas Sen. Ted Cruz after he rolled Trump in Wisconsin \u2019 s April 5 primary .\nFrom this point forward to California , will it be \u201c nomemtum \u201d or \u201c big mo \u201d for The Donald ?\nIsn \u2019 t It Bromantic ? You \u2019 ve heard of Rudolph Valentino , but maybe not Jean Acker . She was Valentino \u2019 s first wife \u2013 best known for supposedly locking him out of the bedroom on their wedding night , never consummating the marriage , yet suing for the legal right to \u201c Mrs . Rudolph Valentino \u201d .\nThe political marriage between Cruz and Ohio Gov . John Kasich ( quicker even than Valentino and Acker \u2019 s two-month courtship ) may not turn out to be as cinematic .\nCruz thinks Kasich intends to cede Indiana to the more conservative Texan ; Kasich has told reporters he \u2019 s not instructing his followers to switch to Cruz .\nIt \u2019 s anyone \u2019 s guess as to whether Cruz and Kasich much care for each other . What I don \u2019 t understand : why they felt the need to go public with their hasty nuptials . Other than the obvious reason : they both realize the urgency of the moment \u2013 far behind in delegates , needing to defeat Trump soon before he salts away the GOP nomination .\nIt \u2019 s funny how fast things can change in politics : we entered April with Trump looking wobbly ; we \u2019 ll exit the month with Cruz and Kasich resorting to a bromance that reeks of desperation .\nHoosier Daddy . A word about campaigning in Indiana , home to a pivotal presidential contest and a contentious GOP Senate primary both of which are playing out along \u201c establishment/outsider \u201d lines : if I were working the basketball-crazy state , I \u2019 d want one of three individuals by my side \u2013 basketball legend Larry Bird , former Indiana University Coach Bobby Knight , or the kid who drained the jumper at the end of \u201c Hoosiers \u201d .\nOK , Jimmy Chitwood doesn \u2019 t exist in real life and \u201c Larry Legend \u201d isn \u2019 t all that political ( though he once snubbed Ronald Reagan ) . That leaves us with Coach Knight , who \u2019 s appearing with Trump at a Wednesday evening rally in Indianapolis .\nIt \u2019 s not the first sports endorsement to come Trump \u2019 s way \u2013 Buffalo Bills Coach Rex Ryan warmed up the crowd for him at a rally the day before New York \u2019 s primary . And it begs the question of pro-Trump star power other than the \u201c Apprentice \u201d and Gary Busey , Wayne Newton and Jon Voight .\nWith polls showing Trump holding a narrow lead among Hoosiers , Cruz could use some star-power of his own \u2013 better yet , maybe a Gene Hackman pep talk .\nCalifornia .
