And most Republican and Democratic presidential candidates propose doing even more than the raids that Obama has authorized , which skeptics call \u201c mission creep \u201d . The war pits the Syrian president , Bashar al-Assad , against various rebels and the jihadi group Islamic State , and now involves the US , Russia , Iran , Gulf states , Turkey , the Kurds and Iraq . Here \u2019 s how foreign policy might look under the ideas of potential presidents .\nNearly all the candidates of both parties have called for a no-fly zone over Syria , arguing that denying Assad \u2019 s air force will better protect civilians and rebels from bombing runs .\n\u201c A superpower can impose a no-fly zone if it decides it wants to , \u201d said Stephen Biddle , a professor of international affairs at George Washington University . \u201c But the problems are it \u2019 s very expensive , no one is willing to pay the price , and these days there are serious risks of escalation . \u201d\nA no-fly zone would require far more airstrikes on airfields and anti-aircraft batteries , for instance , putting American pilots in danger against Syrian missiles and jets . Russia \u2019 s entry into the war further complicates the proposal , increasing the risk of shooting down Russian aircraft bombing rebels .\nAnd while a future president could warn Vladimir Putin to fly strikes at his own peril , the US stands to lose more should Putin simply continue strikes . An American president \u2019 s choice would then be to stand down or risk a wider , far more dangerous war \u2013 and political disaster at home \u2013 by firing on Russian pilots .\nNor would a no-fly zone offer certain protection to civilians or rebels whom an American president finds acceptable . Most of the war \u2019 s dead \u2013 civilian or combatant \u2013 have not been killed from the air but on the ground , by bullets , mortars and artillery shells , according to the Violations Documentation Center .\nThe statistics suggest a no-fly zone would not do much to staunch the bleeding of civilians or any friendly rebels . In contrast , Russia \u2019 s strategy of indiscriminate bombing boosts Assad \u2019 s much more limited aims , which do not take civilian casualties into account .\nOnly Republican Rand Paul and Democrats Martin O \u2019 Malley and Bernie Sanders oppose a no-fly zone .\nBillionaire Donald Trump has maintained that \u201c safe zones \u201d on the ground in Syria and Iraq would help end the war and solve the refugee crisis , and said that Turkey and the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia , the UAE and Qatar should lead the effort with US help .\nBut while a ground campaign could defend civilians from the deadliest threats , it would also entail all the dangers of mission creep and the painstaking logistics of a war effort . One American has already died in a raid on an Isis facility , and a Russian soldier died in Syria last week .\n\u201c To keep it safe would require fighting , \u201d the defense secretary , Ash Carter , told Congress on Tuesday . \u201c You need to think in each case \u2026 who \u2019 s in , who is kept out and how the enforcement of it is done . \u201d\nAny campaign would probably need snipers , radar and recon teams , artillery and special operations teams \u2013 if not full infantry battalions , Micah Zenko , a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations , has noted in Foreign Policy .\n\u201c The types of interventions that proponents have endorsed for Syria are often based on deep misunderstandings of how US force was used on behalf of humanitarian missions in the past , \u201d Zenko wrote . \u201c Proposals that consciously ignore or downplay the amount and type of force needed to protect civilians are just wishful thinking . \u201d\nBiddle agreed , adding that another problem is that safe zones offer cover to both civilians and combatants .\n\u201c Say you set up a safe zone along the Turkish-Syrian border , and lo and behold guerrillas start operating within it , and the government starts firing artillery into it . What do you do then ? Silence the artillery by expanding your perimeter ? Push the perimeter until it \u2019 s all of Syria ? \u201d\nHe also noted the problem of policing \u2013 for instance , the dilemma of a suspected rebel whose family vouches for the person \u2019 s innocence .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t have to walk very far down the thought experiment to end up with all sorts of problems and ambiguities , \u201d Biddle said .\nSenator Marco Rubio is the most vocal supporter of embedding special forces with rebel and Kurdish ground troops .\nMost of the candidates support arms for rebels , though few have specified which groups they find acceptable and how they would vet them \u2013 the same problems that have slowed Pentagon efforts in the last two years .\nMore problematically , most of the Syrian rebels eager for weapons and aid are not interested in a concerted fight against Isis . \u201c While there are tens of thousands of rebels willing to receive training and equipment to go after the Assad regime , few are willing to fight the Islamic State , \u201d Zenko wrote earlier this year .\nArming anti-Assad rebels may suit US interests , but it would also pit the US against Russia and Iran in a proxy war . Even regional allies disagree with American priorities about Isis , Biddle noted , which is why Turkey continues to bomb Kurds and Saudi Arabia and the UAE arm groups around the region , most notably in Syria but also in the ruins of Yemen . These same conflicted interests make it unlikely that the nations would ever band together to form their own \u201c safe zone \u201d .\n\u201c They all have bigger fish to fry , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 re the biggest , but we \u2019 re the only one who thinks Isil is the threat to be resolved first . \u201d\nAlthough Kurdish fighters have proven the most reliable allies for US ground offensives , Turkish warplanes have increased bombing sorties against Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq , meaning increased arms for the Kurds could fuel a war between two American allies on yet another border .\nArming Kurdish fighters could also lead to the US supplying groups that it has named terrorists , if it hasn \u2019 t inadvertently done so already . In October Amnesty International accused the Kurdish group YPG of human rights violations .\nRubio , Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham have spoken strongly in favor of arming Syrian rebel groups and Kurds , Ted Cruz has called for directly arming the Kurds , Hillary Clinton urged arms for rebels and Kurds while she was secretary of state , and even O \u2019 Malley has said the US should \u201c probably \u201d arm the fighters .\nAll candidates except Senator Rand Paul have said they support Obama \u2019 s decision to extend the US military presence in Afghanistan to 2017 , though a handful say they only do so out of deference to the generals \u2019 advice .\nBut the presence of 5,500 to 10,000 troops , as the president and candidates prescribe , would have little effect on the war against the Taliban , experts said . Most said a steady run of airstrikes had prevented the Taliban from massing , and that the end of \u201c combat operations \u201d \u2013 resulting in a lull in airstrikes \u2013 had given the militants opportunity to retake cities and regroup .\nThe spread of American troops at four airbases around Afghanistan and continued airstrikes \u2013 including one that bombed a hospital \u2013 suggests Obama plans to let generals use as much airpower as possible to support Afghan forces . But neither he nor any candidate has shown any appetite for a major reinforcement .\nBarring dramatic changes to Barack Obama \u2019 s plans and the politics of the Middle East , 2017 will begin with 5,500 troops across Afghanistan and a number of special forces teams operating in Syria and Iraq .\nPaul , Trump and Cruz have all offered variations on a plan that could see US forces withdraw from the region , ceding a lead military role to Russia and Iran but continuing airstrikes against Isis . But while staying out of foreign conflicts has appeal at home to Democrats and Republicans alike \u2013 and arguably supports US interests \u2013 \u201c it still sacrifices interests that are real , even if they \u2019 re limited , \u201d Biddle said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s the prospective future terrorist threat of an ungoverned region , the risk of a war if that metastasizes and spreads , \u201d he said . \u201c If you wash your hands of it , you \u2019 re running a social science experiment to sit back and see how many of these bad things unfold .
