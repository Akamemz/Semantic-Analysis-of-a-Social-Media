Photo by Alex Brandon/AP Images .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 's Who Counts ? series is made possible by the support of \u2588\u2588\u2588 Plus members and readers like you .\nLuxury cabanas atop Austin \u2019 s JW Marriott kept state legislators cool poolside as August-in-Texas temperatures soared above 103 degrees during each day of the American Legislative Exchange Council \u2019 s 2019 annual meeting . The gathered Republican officials could enjoy a $ 14 rooftop Peppered Paloma cocktail with Patr\u00f3n silver , housemade grapefruit poblano soda , and Chilean salt , all while gazing over Lady Bird Lake and the nearby state Capitol , or catching a ballgame on the cabana \u2019 s 55-inch private TV .\nDownstairs , meanwhile , five of the GOP \u2019 s most seasoned redistricting minds and \u00fcber-lawyers would teach them the finer points of tilting maps and drawing districts that would allow them to retain such spoils for another decade .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 has obtained an exclusive audio recording of the closed-door panel called \u201c How to Survive Redistricting , \u201d moderated by influential Republican lawyer Cleta Mitchell . The panel \u2019 s four experts\u2014Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation , North Carolina election lawyer Thomas Farr , former Georgia Rep. Lynn Westmoreland , and Texas state Rep. Phil King\u2014are among the architects and defenders of some of the most notorious gerrymanders and voter suppression plans of this decade .\nDuring the session , the legislators were advised to treat redistricting as \u201c political adult blood sport , \u201d trash potential evidence before it can be discovered through litigation , avoid the word gerrymander , and make deals with black and Latino legislators that guarantee them easy reelections by packing as many minority voters as possible into their districts , thereby making the rest of the map whiter and more conservative .\n\u201c You are going to be sued . Let \u2019 s start with that. \u201d \u2014 Cleta Mitchell\nPanelists offered complicated technical advice , such as adding a legal provision that would allow a legislature to defend its maps in court even if the state attorney general refuses . And then there was less-technical advice , like being sure to put \u201c sharp \u201d legislators on redistricting committees because they \u2019 ll spend a lot of time explaining the maps in court .\n\u201c You are going to be sued . Let \u2019 s start with that , \u201d Mitchell told a packed room at the ALEC gathering , attended by more than 1,400 people , including Trump administration officials and top conservative lawmakers , thinkers , donors , and activists . Mitchell made light of ALEC \u2019 s reputation as a conveyor belt for cookie-cutter conservative legislation enacted by state after state . \u201c Mindless state legislators , we \u2019 re just pouring in information and we \u2019 re indoctrinating you , pouring into your empty skulls ! \u201d she said , sarcastically . \u201c We \u2019 re going to teach you how to gerrymander . \u201d\nAnd then she did . \u201c Let us begin with the fact that , probably , your notes from this conference , and this workshop , will probably be part of a discovery demand , \u201d Mitchell said on the recording , dropping the sarcasm . \u201c My advice to you is : If you don \u2019 t want it turned over in discovery , you probably ought to get rid of it before you go home . \u201d\nFarr , the veteran North Carolina election lawyer whose nomination to the federal bench in North Carolina ended amid persistent allegations that he had defended efforts to suppress the black vote , compared lawsuits against GOP redistricting plans to a cancer diagnosis . \u201c You better get some chemotherapy , \u201d he said , \u201c because if you don \u2019 t , things aren \u2019 t going to turn out real well for you. \u201d He also told legislators that they needed to think about any trial as a play that he would direct as the counsel , and to be sure that they created a script that an attorney could work with before a judge .\nWestmoreland , the former Georgia congressman who co-chaired a Republican 2010 redistricting initiative called REDMAP , told a story about giving black Democrats in his state mapmaking software and encouraging them to draw their \u201c perfect district , \u201d knowing that districts filled with minority voters would make surrounding districts whiter and more Republican .\n\u201c We ended up being very successful with it , \u201d Westmoreland said .\nWestmoreland recalled inviting the members of the \u201c black caucus \u201d to his office , \u201c off campus , \u201d to create their \u201c perfect map. \u201d One incumbent , he said , \u201c finally fell into the trap and came over there and drew his perfect district. \u201d To show the redistricting plan benefited black Democrats too , he \u201c immediately got the local paper down there \u201d to run an article on that lawmaker \u2019 s perfect district . Westmoreland then included a district as close as possible to that overwhelmingly black and Democratic one in the state \u2019 s official map . The legislator , he said , voted against the map and soon lost his seat .\n\u201c I promise you it \u2019 ll be beneficial to you , \u201d he told the ALEC attendees . \u201c They still want to be reelected . They still want to have the best district they can have . \u201d\nThe speakers repeatedly insisted that there is no such thing as a nonpartisan redistricting process . Farr argued that maps can never be neutral . \u201c Every time you draw a districting line , it benefits one party and hurts the other party , \u201d he said .\nThe idea that Republicans are simply fighting similarly skewed Democratic gerrymanders has been debunked . According to a University of Southern California study , 59 million Americans live in states where at least one chamber of the state legislature is controlled by the party that won fewer votes in 2018 . In every case , Republicans drew the lines , and hold minority control . That the process is inherently political has been disproved as well : Several states , including California , Iowa , and New Jersey , use independent commissions or various neutral or bipartisan processes that have successfully created fairer and more competitive maps . Three-quarters of the seats that flipped during the 2018 U.S. House elections were drawn by commissions or courts . Studies show that maps become more representative and equitable when more parties have a seat at the table .\nNevertheless , Farr urged these lawmakers to make their processes appear as open as possible , even though they are driven by partisanship behind closed doors .\nThe legislative record , he told them , must appear to be business as usual , following every statute , with every transcript and debate filed for the record .\nGiven that every map could end up in court , Farr advised extraordinary caution . \u201c You never know what you might say , even if it \u2019 s unjust , that the left can take out of context and try to use to make the Republicans look like they \u2019 re evil . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s like I \u2019 m a director of a play , \u201d he explained to the room . \u201c I know what I want the play to look like for the judges when we actually have to go and defend what we \u2019 ve done in court , and so this is why you want to make it look like\u2014I know most of you know this already\u2014you \u2019 re very cordial , cooperative with the minority party or the opposing party . \u2026 The more you take the high road in the legislative process , the better it \u2019 s going to look in court when you have to defend what you \u2019 ve done . \u201d\nRepublicans , Farr suggested , are outgunned by the litigation power and the expert witnesses on the side of fair maps . He complained that Republicans have only five or six expert witnesses , while Democrats have between 18 and 20 \u201c really outstanding and smart people \u201d able to explain \u201c newfangled theories \u201d about identifying gerrymanders .\nMany of those expert witnesses create tens of thousands of neutral maps using nonpartisan , legal redistricting criteria . Courts in North Carolina , Pennsylvania , and Ohio were all persuaded to overturn maps as partisan gerrymanders by relying , in part , on simulated maps that demonstrate that the ones drawn by legislators are wild partisan outliers . This technological advancement offers the potential of using the same technology that partisans use to rig maps to strip their intent bare . For Farr , this is a great threat . He warned the legislators that computer-assisted maps would be the tactic deployed against their maps as partisan gerrymandering moves to state courts during the upcoming 2020 redistricting cycle\u2014and that he would help them defeat those maps .\n\u201c Garbage in and garbage out , \u201d he said . \u201c You can read these things to get the results that you want. \u201d Farr said that the professors working on these simulated maps were \u201c very smart \u201d and that the work is \u201c very complex. \u201d \u201c You \u2019 ve got to get the right experts to look at their algorithm and all the backup that they have . But there \u2019 s a definite way to defeat the concept of computer-simulated maps . \u201d\nAs Farr and Westmoreland taught lawmakers to conceal the true intent of their maps and appear to play by the rules , Von Spakovsky envisioned a longer game to change the rules of redistricting entirely .\nVon Spakovsky , a member of the Trump-Kobach \u201c election fraud \u201d commission , urged GOP lawmakers to use citizenship data to redistrict state legislatures rather than count the total populations of districts , the latter being the constitutional standard for U.S. House districts and the longtime norm for states , as well . Most state legislatures , however , could redistrict state legislative lines based on citizen population , in most cases simply by passing a statute . ( Recent revelations from the files of late GOP redistricting mastermind Thomas Hofeller demonstrated that Republicans attempted to place a citizenship question on the 2020 census to gather citizenship data for this purpose . )\n\u201c All of you need to seriously consider switching to using citizen population to do redistricting , \u201d he said , asserting that the concept of \u201c one person , one vote \u201d was just something that liberal justices on the U.S. Supreme Court \u201c created \u2026 out of whole cloth . \u201d\nVon Spakovsky also told lawmakers that census data is important for two reasons : the apportionment of U.S. House seats , and state and federal redistricting . Congressional apportionment based on total population , as the Constitution mandates , is \u201c fundamentally unfair , \u201d he said , because \u201c states with large numbers of aliens , particularly illegal aliens , are getting more political power . \u201d\n\u201c Liberals do not want you doing this , \u201d he said , because \u201c the higher the number of noncitizens in a district , the greater the chances they \u2019 re going to vote for a liberal . \u201d\nVon Spakovsky also praised Chief Justice John Roberts \u2019 majority , 5\u20134 opinion earlier this year in Rucho v. Common Cause , which essentially closed the federal courts to partisan gerrymandering claims . But he warned that other legal avenues are still open to proponents of fair maps . \u201c What you have to understand is this is not the end of this , \u201d he said .\nGerrymandered maps could get challenged under state constitutions as a political question , he said , or in federal courts for unconstitutional use of race data and for diluting the votes of minorities contrary to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act . He called this \u201c the Goldilocks principle of redistricting , \u201d noting that \u201c you can \u2019 t use too much race , \u201d but if you don \u2019 t use race at all , \u201c Hispanics , African Americans are going to claim you didn \u2019 t create a district in which they can elect a candidate of their choice . \u201d\nTo withstand these inevitable legal challenges , the panelists said , it is important to control not only legislative majorities but also the judges approving or rejecting redistricting plans .\n\u201c Always know who \u2019 s going to end up ruling on your maps , \u201d Westmoreland , the Georgia lawmaker , advised . \u201c It \u2019 s important to work with the judges , the judicial system . You need to work for your attorney generals . \u2026 You need to work with as many organizations that you can to make sure that not only you win the majority , but that you elect people that are going to be able to supervise what these maps , or what you , come up with . \u201d\nEnticing more \u201c dance partners \u201d from minority groups to protect their own seats is another key part of that plan .\nThis story is part of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Who Counts ? project , which investigates who has decision-making power in America and what happens to those who don \u2019 t .
