    "content": "Loeffler \u2019 s five months as a senator have not been easy . She \u2019 s facing attacks from the left and right for selling millions of dollars in stocks after receiving a private briefing on the coronavirus pandemic . What \u2019 s more , she \u2019 s fighting off a serious challenge from Rep. Doug Collins ( R-Ga. ) \u2014 a strong ally of President Donald Trump \u2014 who is ahead in most recent public polling .\nSince news of her stock trades broke , Loeffler has tried to erase the cloud hanging over her . She insists her financial transactions were done through a third-party adviser , vowed to divest from her individual stocks and recused herself from a Senate agriculture subcommittee . She \u2019 s also donated $ 1 million to provide food for hungry Georgians during the economic crisis .\nBut Loeffler \u2019 s portfolio threatens to overshadow everything else . And Collins knows it .\n\u201c Instead of working for the people of Georgia for the past five months in D.C. , she seems to have been working for herself , \u201d he said in an interview Thursday . \u201c Because all she \u2019 s been able to do is have to explain her stock scandal and left her doing nothing else more than that . \u201d\nJust last week , Loeffler revealed that she handed over documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee , one day after the FBI seized the phone of another senator facing his own stock trades problem , Sen. Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) .\nIn the interview , Loeffler declined to answer whether the FBI has contacted her or whether she \u2019 s requested an Ethics Committee investigation into her own finances , as Burr did . The Georgia Republican pointed to her previous statements saying she turned over documents and would `` absolutely '' cooperate with the SEC or Ethics Committee .\n\u201c This is the liberal media attacking someone who supports free enterprise , \u201d she said . \u201c I 'm not going to be deterred by it . \u201d\nCollins , who has done work as a defense attorney , isn \u2019 t buying it : \u201c When somebody won \u2019 t say they \u2019 re under investigation , the probable answer is they \u2019 re under investigation . \u201d\n\u201c She \u2019 s going to have to answer it , \u201d said Sen. John Kennedy ( R-La . ) \u201c And I mean she \u2019 s been trying to . It \u2019 s an issue , there \u2019 s no question . \u201d\nThe intraparty warfare over the seat could cede ground to Democrats in Georgia , with both Loeffler and her colleague , Sen. David Perdue ( R-Ga. ) , up in November and the Senate majority up for grabs . Perdue declined to comment on the status of the Loeffler-Collins race and didn \u2019 t indicate whether he \u2019 d campaign with Loeffler , citing a campaigning hiatus because of coronavirus .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not commenting on that race , \u201d said Perdue , adding that the Republican candidates were better than the Democrats in the race .\nGeorgia Gov . Brian Kemp appointed Loeffler to the seat in December to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson ( R-Ga. ) , who retired for health reasons . The state \u2019 s November special election is a nonpartisan contest with close to two dozen Republican and Democratic candidates . If no candidate receives a majority , it will go to a January 2021 runoff .\n`` Not only am I not dropping out , but I 'm gon na win . '' Sen. Kelly Loeffler\nLoeffler has indicated she 's ready to go on the offensive , describing Collins in the interview as a `` do-nothing , career politician who has tax and spend as a strategy . '' Collins retorted : `` It 's amazing she can read a cue card from her consultants . ''\nLoeffler entered the Senate in the run-up to Trump \u2019 s impeachment trial , providing an unprecedented challenge for a junior senator trying to establish herself . She moves through the Capitol quietly and calmly , generally refusing to engage with reporters . In the interview , she was disciplined and talked herself up as a political outsider just like Trump .\nThough Collins can boast that he was a prominent opponent of Trump \u2019 s impeachment in the House , Loeffler can say she voted to acquit the president . In the interview , she also touted securing coronavirus relief for Georgians through the CARES Act and introducing proposals to help the economy recover amid the pandemic . She said her tenure in Washington has been about what she expected . Except for one thing .\n\u201c I knew I 'd be attacked for my success , and I knew it would come from the left , \u201d she said . \u201c What 's been surprising is it \u2019 s come from the right , as well . And I think that 's shameful . \u201d\nDespite her struggles in the polls , Loeffler has the backing of many of her Senate GOP colleagues as well as the National Republican Senatorial Committee . The campaign committee has attacked Collins for being selfish and putting Perdue 's seat at risk by running \u2014 even dubbing him a `` convenient conservative . '' But Loeffler , a former chief executive of a financial services company , is a wealthy self-funder , so it 's unclear what level of financial commitment the GOP will make for her .\n\u201c We think she \u2019 s a very strong candidate , \u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota . Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa , a member of GOP leadership who is up for reelection , has spoken personally with Loeffler about her stock trades and said her defense was compelling . She said Loeffler was a strong conservative woman .\nStill , some members of the caucus are not picking sides . Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota , who served with Collins in the House , said he disagrees with the NRSC \u2019 s aggressive attacks on his former colleague .\n\u201c He has every right to do it , and he \u2019 s not just a gadfly , obviously , he 's a serious member of Congress , \u201d Cramer said .\nAnd Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana said Loeffler is a \u201c great candidate \u201d but he will let her battle with Collins play out rather than making any endorsements : \u201c I \u2019 m one that loves transparency and competition . \u201d\nPrivately , some Republican senators and aides have more dour assessments . They understand the NRSC needs to back incumbents to guard against primary challenges , which have dogged Republicans in the past , but several said she \u2019 s in a dangerous situation and might need to drop out of the race . No sitting GOP senator has publicly said , however , that she should quit .\nSome recently appointed senators have gone poorly for each party . In Alabama , then-Sen.
