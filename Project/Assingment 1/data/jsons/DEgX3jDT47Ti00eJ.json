One of the purposes of fasting during Lent is to rediscover life \u2019 s everyday joys through a period of self-reflection and abstinence .\n\u201c So my hope and my prayer is that people will come back to the altar at a time when it \u2019 s safe again , and have a deeper understanding of what it is that we are receiving , \u201d he says .\nJust two weeks into an unprecedented era of social distancing and canceled community gatherings , many of the nation \u2019 s communities of worship , including mosques , synagogues , and other traditions of worship , have been forced to find alternative forms of gatherings for prescribed rituals and forms of worship .\nWithin America \u2019 s tapestry of religious traditions , the vast majority have turned to technology , including interactive teleconferenced gatherings , livestreamed services , and even old-fashioned conference calls .\nBut for many , the absence of certain physical rites and community rituals have presented profound theological conundrums .\n\u201c To suspend the Friday prayer , to suspend an obligation that has been made quite clear in the Scripture , is quite serious \u2013 you are almost upending God \u2019 s law , \u201d says Selaedin Maksut , a religious scholar and civil rights advocate in New Jersey who was scheduled to preach a sermon at the Muslim Community Center in Paramus last Friday before it was canceled .\nTwo weeks ago , as the scope and seriousness of the coronavirus epidemic was beginning to unfold in the U.S. , Muslim communities throughout New York and New Jersey were \u201c pulling their hair out , \u201d Mr. Maksut says , as the community tried to decide on Thursday whether or not to cancel prayer services , the primary day of worship that Muslims call jumu \u2019 ah . It is a religious requirement for all adult Muslim men .\n\u201c The conversation was , well , how about we just have the sermon on Facebook so everyone can observe from home ? \u201d continues Mr. Maksut , executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations . \u201c But the scholars came to their collective opinion that this wouldn \u2019 t qualify as jumu \u2019 ah . Jumu \u2019 ah is essentially a congregational thing . You can \u2019 t check the box and say , \u2018 OK , today I went to jumu \u2019 ah because I listened to the sermon online. \u2019 You might be listening at home , but you \u2019 re really not participating in the essential physical , collective , and group effort . \u201d\nFriday services are also part of the social rhythms of American Muslim communities , a time and place to gather to discuss politics , business , and other aspects of life .\nStill , in Muslim theology , Mr. Maksut and others say , the preservation of human life is paramount and supersedes all other religious obligations .\n\u201c It is our moral duty as Muslims that we take all steps necessary to safeguard ourselves and others around us from this terrible disease , \u201d said the Fiqh Council of North America in a joint statement with organizations including The Islamic Medical Association of North America and the Islamic Society of North America . \u201c One \u2019 s personal desire to do obligatory prayers at the masjid or fulfill other religious duties comes secondary to ensuring the common health of the larger community . \u201d\nLast Friday , the Conservative synagogue Temple Beth O \u2019 r Beth Torah in Clark , New Jersey , welcomed Shabbat as a congregation using Zoom .
