Many of them are being helped by some big names. Last week we listened to what some of the major surrogates in the Democratic Party are saying on the stump. This morning we'll check in on some of the big names in the Republican Party. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea has been out on the trail this fall listening to a lot of campaign speeches, and he joins us in the studio. Good morning, Don.\n\nDON GONYEA, BYLINE: Indeed, glad to be here.\n\nMONTAGNE: Now, one of the most active and aggressive campaigners for Republicans in the midterm has been New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. What's he been up to?\n\nGONYEA: A lot of it's been in his role as the current head of the Republican Governors Association. But he's not limiting himself to helping gubernatorial candidates. He'll go to a state. If there's a Senate race, he's getting a piece of that. Like this moment in New Hampshire with challenger Scott Brown, the former Republican Massachusetts senator now trying to return to Washington in this new state.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE: This is somebody who has seen it, and he's actually willing to go back there. That is a fighter everybody. That's somebody who's willing to fight for New Hampshire.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGONYEA: Again, New Hampshire, you know Christie is there. There's a lot of buzz about 2016. There's a sense he's running for president, that he's collecting chits and he's trying to move beyond that bridge scandal of the past year and of course that he's looking ahead.\n\nMONTAGNE: Which brings us to another likely 2016 contender.

But he's also done things like this - a Spanish language ad in Colorado, a state with a growing Latino population that has been good to Democrats. Here's Jeb.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD)\n\nJEB BUSH: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nMONTAGNE: And, Don, does an ad like this suggest that Jeb Bush is preparing to run for president?\n\nGONYEA: Maybe, Maybe (laughter).
