    "content": "Pope Francis last week issued an expansive document outlining the mission behind his papacy , including a strongly worded indictment of free market economics and the government leaders and corporate executives who are the system 's greatest beneficiaries . The pope 's declarations on poverty and economic justice may have been a new turn for the church , but the rest of the 84-page document was a regurgitation of the same old doctrine .\nSpecifically , the church 's hard line on abortion and other issues of reproductive justice remains as rigid and as dangerous as ever . Which is why the timing of the American Civil Liberty Union 's lawsuit alleging gross medical negligence against the United States Congress of Catholic Bishops , filed just days after the pope released his `` Evangelii Gaudium , '' felt significant . The suit was a necessary reminder that a church doctrine that refuses to respect women 's bodily autonomy and the medical judgment of doctors -- no matter how progressive its economic agenda -- is still a dangerous thing . ( Related : Economic justice and reproductive justice are not distinct agendas , but I digress . )\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of Tamesha Means , a 27-year-old mother of two who presented at the emergency room of a Catholic hospital in Michigan -- the only hospital within 30 miles -- after her water broke while she was 18 weeks pregnant . According to the suit , Means ' fetus had virtually no chance of survival , but the hospital did not tell her this information , nor did it tell her that the safest treatment option would be to induce labor in order to terminate the doomed pregnancy .\nInstead , she says she was sent home with Tylenol . When she returned later that same night , bleeding and with an elevated temperature , she says the hospital attempted to send her home a second time . Means experienced a painful miscarriage while the hospital staff was in the process of filing her discharge papers . ( Mercy Health Muskegon has declined to comment . )\n\u201c Each time I went into the hospital , the same thing happened , \u201d Means said in a statement . \u201c They should act like it \u2019 s their mother or sister or daughter they \u2019 re treating . I pray to God someone stops this from happening again . My life could have been taken . I was in a very dangerous situation . \u201d\nNotice that Means said she prays that this does n't happen to anyone else . She is part of a growing number of people of faith who believe that the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services -- the religious guidelines that dictate what care can and can not be administered in a Catholic hospital -- are dangerously at odds with quality medical care .\nThe movement against the religious directives enforced at Catholic hospitals includes many Catholics who want comprehensive healthcare for themselves and their neighbors -- without interference from American bishops or the Vatican .\n`` Most people are shocked to learn about the impact that the bishops have on everyday healthcare , and that absolutely includes healthcare that takes place at Catholic hospitals , '' Meghan Smith , a domestic program associate at progressive advocacy group Catholics for Choice , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nAnd while the bishops may govern the care available at Catholic hospitals , the American public pays for it . These hospitals benefit from significant amounts of public funding , including state and federal grants for Title X family planning programs , Medicare and Medicaid . Despite receiving public subsidies , Catholic hospitals regularly deny basic reproductive health services based on religious directives that openly defy medical best practice . Giving bishops with zero medical expertise this kind of discretionary authority is dangerous for patients , dangerous for doctors and an outrageous overstep to many Catholics .\n`` There are 68 million Catholics in the United States , and only 250 of them are bishops , '' Smith continued . `` The vast majority of Catholics disagree with the bishops on sex , sexuality and reproductive healthcare . ''\nNot only do a majority of Catholics disagree with their church 's absolutes on issues like contraception and abortion care , they tend to disregard them entirely . Around 98 percent of sexually active Catholic women have at some point in their lives used a form of birth control that the Vatican does not approve of , and they have abortions at the same rate as other groups of women , around 28 percent . Recent data also reveals that 65 percent of Catholics believe that hospitals and clinics that receive public money should not be allowed to deny medical services based on religious doctrine , and 68 percent of Catholic women do n't want a Catholic hospital to be the only medical care option in their communities .\nAll of which explains why so many Catholics are pushing back against the expansion of Catholic hospitals , which currently serve one in six people seeking medical attention . In Baltimore last year , a group of Catholic doctors led protests against the University of Maryland Medical System 's merger with a Catholic hospital , explaining that it was because of their faith -- not in spite of it -- that they wanted their community hospital to provide comprehensive care to all patients , including birth control , miscarriage management and abortion care . In a letter opposing the partnership , the group wrote , `` Our faith 's call for social justice for all ... compels us to speak out against the disproportionate impact the continued influence that the [ American bishops ' ] directives ... would have on our neighbors . ''\nCatholic legislators in Louisville , Ky. , were also among the loudest voices opposing a Catholic hospital merger with their local hospital , explaining that a partnership with a Catholic Health Initiatives-affiliate would mean less care for the people of Louisville , who , they said , `` have a right to be worried '' about religious doctrine interfering with their care .\n`` St. Mary 's is a division of Catholic Health Initiatives , which means the hospital will soon be playing by different rules , '' wrote Rep. Thomas J. Burch and Rep. Mary Lou Marzian in an editorial opposing the merger . `` The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services govern Catholic-owned or affiliated institutions , including hospitals , and they follow a different calculus for patients ' treatment . According to Michael Rowan , executive vice president of Catholic Health Initiatives , the merger 'will mean greater access to care . ' In reality , the directives will assure women less access to reproductive health care . ''\nLike the doctors in Baltimore and Louisville , many Catholics ground their support for comprehensive healthcare -- and opposition to the expansion of Catholic hospitals that enforce the bishops ' directives -- directly in their faith . `` When Catholic hospitals are n't providing the services that a community needs , they are not providing the services that Catholics want , '' Smith explained .\nTalk to a rank-and-file Catholic , and they will likely tell you the same thing . Judith Ceja , a Catholic nurse from Queens , N.Y. ( who also happens to be my aunt ) , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , `` Every woman has a right to make a decision about her body , and the right to safe medical care . There is no church , no man , no president to stand in the way of that .\n`` The Catholic Church , the way it is now , if we do n't come to terms with our doctrine , we are going to lose people , '' she continued . `` People will practice Catholicism -- they will practice their faith to be good kind people -- but they will not be going to church . ''\nAnd she 's right . Only 41 percent of American Catholics attend Mass regularly , and that number drops to 30 percent among younger Catholics , who are increasingly at odds with the entrenched positions of church leadership .\nWhen asked if she believed her views on reproductive rights make her any less of a Catholic , Ceja responded with a definitive `` no . ''\n`` You have to live your faith , you have to be kind , you have to be compassionate , you have to be respectful , '' she explained . `` Being pro-choice is a compassionate position . I believe in it because I am Catholic . ''",
