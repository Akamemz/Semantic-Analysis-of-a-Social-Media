Three days later , the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision in Bostock v. Clayton County , which casts the legality of this regulation into serious doubt .\nThe Court \u2019 s decision in Bostock does not raise significant clouds of doubt over the new health care regulation alone : Trump \u2019 s education department also opposes anti-discrimination protections for transgender students , but education discrimination against LGBTQ students is now likely to be held illegal after Bostock .\nBostock held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which bans discrimination \u201c because of ... sex , \u201d is broad enough to forbid workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity . If an employer \u201c intentionally relies in part on an individual employee \u2019 s sex when deciding to discharge the employee \u201d or \u201c if changing the employee \u2019 s sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer , \u201d then an employer violates Title VII , according to Bostock .\nFor example , if an employer permits male employees to date and have sex with women , but doesn \u2019 t permit female employees to do the same , then it engages in forbidden sex discrimination .\nBut Title VII is hardly the only federal law prohibiting sex discrimination . Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides that \u201c no person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. \u201d The Affordable Care Act similarly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex by \u201c any health program or activity , any part of which is receiving Federal financial assistance . \u201d\nAs a practical matter , these two provisions apply to nearly all public schools , colleges , universities , and hospitals , because nearly all of those institutions receive federal assistance of some kind \u2014 such as through student financial aid or through Medicare and Medicaid .\nBostock , in other words , strongly suggests that neither educational institutions nor health care providers may discriminate against LGBTQ individuals .

Gwinnett County Public Schools ( 1992 ) , for example , the Supreme Court held that Title IX \u2019 s ban on discrimination \u201c on the basis of sex \u201d imposes the same duty to avoid sexual harassment that Title VII imposes on employers . Similarly , in Safeco Ins . Co. of America v. Burr ( 2007 ) , the Court considered an amendment to a federal law that changed the language of a statute from \u201c because of \u201d to \u201c based on. \u201d But the Court concluded that this amendment did not matter because \u201c there was no indication that this change was meant to be a substantive alteration of the statute \u2019 s scope . \u201d\nUntil Bostock , however , the meaning of the word \u201c sex \u201d was hotly contested .

The Trump administration \u2019 s new regulations , by contrast , read the word \u201c sex \u201d much more narrowly .
