    "content": "Here \u2019 s how we analyzed in real time the Republican Nevada caucuses .\nSenator Ted Cruz \u2019 s presidential campaign erupted in turmoil on Monday as Mr. Cruz fired his chief spokesman for spreading a misleading video of Senator Marco Rubio \u2014 an ill-timed shake-up for a campaign already under duress on the eve of the Republican caucuses in Nevada .\nFor Mr. Cruz , who has vigorously defended himself in recent weeks as rivals accused him of running an underhanded race , the episode cuts at the premise of his bid . He has cast himself as the candidate of honesty and integrity , with a faith-based pitch and a backdrop that reads \u201c TrusTed \u201d during speeches .\nOn Monday , amid persistent sniping from Mr. Rubio and Donald J. Trump about the Cruz campaign \u2019 s penchant to mislead , the Texas senator was at last forced to acknowledge his team had gone too far .\nAt issue was a video of a hotel lobby encounter between Mr. Rubio and a Cruz staff member who had a Bible with him . The video \u2019 s subtitles suggested Mr. Rubio had said there were \u201c not many answers \u201d in the Bible . Mr. Cruz \u2019 s communications director , Rick Tyler , posted the video on Facebook and Twitter on Sunday , needling Mr. Rubio for an \u201c awkward remark . \u201d\nIn fact , Mr. Rubio had said the Bible had \u201c all the answers . \u201d\nMr. Cruz said Monday that he had spent the morning investigating the episode .\n\u201c I have made clear in this campaign that we will conduct this campaign with the very highest standards of integrity , \u201d he told reporters during a news conference in Las Vegas , describing his decision to request Mr. Tyler \u2019 s resignation .\nHe called Mr. Tyler a \u201c good man , \u201d but said that his sharing of the video was \u201c a grave error in judgment . \u201d\n\u201c Even if it was true , we are not a campaign that is going to question the faith of another candidate , \u201d Mr. Cruz said . \u201c Even if it was true , our campaign should not have sent it . \u201d\nMr. Cruz took no questions about Mr. Tyler before making a hasty exit .\nThe campaign \u2019 s self-inflicted drama came as Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio , who edged past him in South Carolina , strained to emerge as the chief challenger to Mr. Trump . The two are also tussling over evangelical support , which is particularly essential to Mr. Cruz , making the dust-up over a remark about the Bible especially tense .\nBut Mr. Tyler \u2019 s dismissal , and Mr. Cruz \u2019 s acknowledgment of a campaign misstep , were a clear boon to Mr. Rubio on another front , creating the kind of cudgel that could prove powerful at a crucial stage of the race .\nIt represents a public admission of what Mr. Rubio and Mr. Trump have angrily asserted for weeks : that Mr. Cruz has employed deceitful tactics to undermine his rivals , including a photograph doctored by his aides that suggested Mr. Rubio was shaking hands with President Obama in front of the Capitol in Washington .\nAfter Mr. Tyler \u2019 s dismissal , Mr. Rubio \u2019 s team moved quickly to focus attention on his boss .\n\u201c Rick is a really good spokesman who had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected , \u201d said Mr. Rubio \u2019 s spokesman , Alex Conant . \u201c There is a culture in the Cruz campaign , from top to bottom , that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty . Rick did the right thing by apologizing to Marco . It \u2019 s high time for Ted Cruz to do the right thing and stop the lies . \u201d\nMr. Trump has , less credibly , attacked Mr. Cruz on similar grounds , threatening a defamation suit over an ad reminding voters of his past support for abortion rights . He was likewise eager to seize on Monday \u2019 s news .\n\u201c Wow , Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director , \u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter . \u201c More dirty tricks ! \u201d\nPrivately , Mr. Cruz \u2019 s advisers have acknowledged that perceptions about his integrity had taken a toll since his victory in Iowa . On caucus night , his team spread word to voters \u2014 with a liberal interpretation of a CNN report \u2014 that Ben Carson planned to suspend his campaign .\nThe mild-mannered Mr. Carson , widely admired even by non-supporters , seethed with anger , and much of the Republican field came to his defense .\nDays earlier , Mr. Cruz had earned a rebuke from Iowa \u2019 s secretary of state for mailers that accused residents of nonexistent \u201c voter violations . \u201d\nAs the race reached South Carolina , Mr. Rubio \u2019 s team assailed Mr. Cruz and his allies for myriad alleged mistruths . After a legal review , some television stations in South Carolina pulled an ad from a pro-Cruz \u201c super PAC \u201d that had criticized Mr. Rubio \u2019 s record on immigration . Mr. Cruz also faced criticism from National Right to Life for what it called \u201c inaccurate and misleading \u201d remarks about Mr. Rubio \u2019 s record on abortion .\nThere have been lesser unforced errors , as when Mr. Cruz pulled one of his campaign ads after learning that an actress in it had a prior career in soft-core pornography .\nMr. Cruz , once one of the most broadly popular candidates in the field , has seen his favorability ratings slip as the race has taken a sharply negative turn . A Monmouth University poll of South Carolina Republicans showed Mr. Cruz with a 45 percent favorability rating and a 39 percent unfavorable rating , a steep fall from November figures of 52 and 21 .\nThe latest episode is unlikely to help , even as Mr. Cruz \u2019 s team made clear it was moving on . Shortly after the announcement , the campaign circulated a memo arguing Mr. Cruz is \u201c the only candidate who can defeat Donald Trump . \u201d\nBob Vander Plaats , an Iowa evangelical activist and national co-chairman for Mr. Cruz , said the senator was determined to show his campaign operated at \u201c the highest level of integrity , \u201d after weeks of accusations from rivals .\nMr. Vander Plaats said he believed Mr. Tyler \u2019 s misstep would not have been a major controversy , if not for recent history .\n\u201c At another time , it \u2019 s probably not a big deal , but this time it \u2019 s a big deal , \u201d Mr. Vander Plaats said , adding , \u201c I love Rick , but it \u2019 s something that probably had to be done . \u201d\nAfter posting the video about Mr. Rubio and the Bible on Sunday morning , Mr. Tyler apologized late that night . \u201c I would not knowingly post a false story , \u201d he wrote on Facebook , adding that the initial article , from the University of Pennsylvania \u2019 s student newspaper , The Daily Pennsylvanian , had misquoted Mr. Rubio in its video . \u201c But the fact remains that I did post it when I should have checked its accuracy first .
