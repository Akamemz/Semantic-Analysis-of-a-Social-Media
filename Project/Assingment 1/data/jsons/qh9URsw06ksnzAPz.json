The promising firm received millions in stimulus money and would soon open new factories near Detroit . ( David Goldman/Boston Herald via AP Photo )\nAt a Democratic Party presidential debate in February , candidate Joe Biden sounded like he did back in 2009 and 2010 , traveling the country as Barack Obama \u2019 s vice president to tout stimulus spending . Asked how the country should address climate change , he ticked down a list that included a familiar prescription .\nAs if his White House hadn \u2019 t tried to do exactly that .\nBiden was an early cheerleader for the Obama administration \u2019 s investment in battery research and production . Electric cars were catching on , but their batteries were produced almost exclusively in Asia , which had originally commercialized them for use in camcorders and cellphones before moving on to cars . To fix that , the Obama administration parceled out $ 2.4 billion to manufacturers willing to make batteries in the U.S. and put people back to work in the process .\nA123 Systems , a startup that had spun out of MIT with promising new lithium ion technology in 2005 , was granted $ 249 million , the battery stimulus \u2019 second-largest recipient . It announced new factories in Romulus and Livonia that would ultimately create more than 4,000 jobs . Michigan offered $ 135 million in grants and tax credits and named A123 \u2019 s planned 75-acre campus a \u201c Renaissance Zone , \u201d erasing state and local taxes for 15 years .\nIn 2010 , at a splashy ribbon-cutting event to showcase the Livonia plant , Obama called in and was piped through loudspeaker , proclaiming that America \u2019 s economic policies would no longer \u201c put us behind the innovation race . \u201d\nAttending that ribbon-cutting in person was Perry Seay , hired by A123 about a year after he was laid off from a dental supply company . He took a contract position managing inventory and was excited about joining a startup offering a bright future .\n\u201c The government wanted this to happen , \u201d Seay said , \u201c and they threw all this money at it . We all had high hopes . \u201d\nWhen both of its factories were built , A123 had the capacity to be America \u2019 s biggest lithium ion battery producer . Its signature client was the startup Fisker Automotive , which made the sleek , battery-powered Karma sports car .\nMaking lithium ion batteries is not unlike baking cinnamon rolls . At A123 \u2019 s Romulus plant , where workers donned hazmat suits for protection , batches of graphite and lithium were mixed into a \u201c slurry \u201d that was stored in giant holding tanks . Each mixture was rolled out onto copper or aluminum foil , baked in a special oven and pressed to a precise thickness .\nThe coils were then transported to Livonia , where they were unwound , cut into smaller rolls and re-wound before going into a vacuum oven . Workers fashioned them into circular \u201c jelly rolls , \u201d inserted them into metal housings , drizzled them with electrolyte icing and squeezed to help carry lithium ions between the cathode and the anode , which is what releases energy . They were packed into slender cylinders or slim , flat packets . For car batteries , those packets were stacked like pancakes and bolted into metal boxes .\nIn 2011 , defective A123 batteries sold to Fisker led to a $ 66.8 million recall that tanked the company \u2019 s stock price . Seay , who by that time had been hired on full time , said A123 \u2019 s batteries suffered from inconsistent quality . \u201c It appeared to me like a rush to get things done so we could make use of this money and start selling the Fisker car , \u201d he said .\nA123 also struggled to build a customer base . General Motors , still recovering from its own financial crisis , chose South Korea \u2019 s LG Chem over A123 to make batteries for the Chevy Volt . \u201c I was unwilling to take a risk on a startup battery company , \u201d said Tony Posawatz , who ran GM \u2019 s Volt program at the time .\nA123 wasn \u2019 t the only battery-maker slowly wilting . Johnson Controls , a leading manufacturer of lead acid batteries , scrapped plans for a new plant that would focus on lithium ion batteries . After disappointing GM Volt sales , a federal audit found that LG Chem had spent nearly all of its stimulus grant but constructed only 60 % of the promised capacity . EnerDel went bankrupt in 2012 and was purchased by a Russian investor . Dow to sold a German firm its interest in a plant it built in Midland , Michigan .\nWhen A123 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2012 , it had used $ 132 million of its $ 249 million federal grant , and its Michigan hiring peaked at 1,000 employees .\nDeepening the wounds , a Chinese industrial conglomerate called Wanxiang paid only $ 256.6 million for A123 \u2019 s assets in 2013 . There was bipartisan outrage in Congress about the deal , but not enough to stop the sale . Wanxiang later bought Fisker too .\nFor automakers , battery technology still could not compete with gasoline engines . Nancy Gioia , who ran Ford Motor Company \u2019 s electrification initiatives , couldn \u2019 t use batteries for trucks and SUVs demanded by American drivers . \u201c Battery-powered vehicles , at that time , that was a bridge too far , \u201d Gioia said .\nBy 2015 , instead of the million electric vehicles projected by the White House , with sales further depressed by low gas prices , only about 400,000 were on American roads .\nThe federal money had been irresistible , but it also led A123 to invest in manufacturing before enough customers existed for the product , said co-founder and former chief technology officer Bart Riley . \u201c If you \u2019 re responding to something that \u2019 s artificial in the market , you do so at your peril , \u201d Riley said .\nLast October , British data analyst Simon Moores came to the Old Executive Office Building beside the White House to brief some of Trump \u2019 s staff on the lithium ion battery supply chain .\n\u201c The White House thinks of this in terms of jobs , \u201d said Moores , a managing director of the research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence . If developed , the full supply chain of battery manufacturing could create around 45,000 jobs , he said . The bigger stakes were what America stood to forfeit .\n\u201c If the U.S. doesn \u2019 t get its own battery capacity , large scale and high quality , it \u2019 s going to lose its automotive industry in the next 50 years , \u201d Moores said .\nTo be competitive , innovation and manufacturing must exist in a virtuous circle \u2014 with engineering improvements closely tied to factory production . For the moment , consumers still demand trucks and SUVs because gas is cheap and battery-powered vehicles come at a premium . But as the cost of batteries declines , that could shift quickly , before Detroit is ready for it .\nSo far , the trajectory isn \u2019 t good . By 2024 , Benchmark expects America to have 8.2 % of the world \u2019 s lithium ion battery-making capacity , while China has 72.8 % and Europe has 14.2 % .\nTrump \u2019 s administration has urged companies to move their supply chains out of China . Trade adviser Navarro , a longtime critic of trade with China , has explicitly cited America \u2019 s lack of battery manufacturing as a national security threat because of the substantial military applications \u2014 ranging from portable radios to thermal imaging for surveillance . China also controls the raw materials used in advanced batteries . Lithium , the world \u2019 s lightest metal , is primarily mined in Chile and Australia and processed in China .\n\u201c We have virtually all of the battery production migrating elsewhere now , \u201d Navarro said in a 2018 speech at a Washington think tank . \u201c And we have the lithium that \u2019 s used for some of this is coming under the control of foreign powers . \u201d\nBut so far , the administration \u2019 s efforts have either been small-scale or even counterproductive .\nTake Trump \u2019 s trade war , which imposed a 15 % tariff on lithium ion batteries coming from China starting in September 2019 . ( It \u2019 s since been cut in half . ) Companies and associations \u2014 including the Korean company LG Chem and Tesla , the two biggest manufacturers of batteries in the U.S. \u2014 pleaded for exemptions with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative because of the difficulty finding sources .\nBut the tariffs did not spur domestic production , said Cairn Energy Research Advisors analyst Sam Jaffe . \u201c If you \u2019 re going to build a factory here to take advantage of that , how do you know it \u2019 s not going to disappear in six months ? \u201d Jaffe said . \u201c It \u2019 s almost frozen people in their tracks . \u201d\nWhat would spur domestic production ? According to experts I interviewed : More battery research investment , and policies that foster demand for electric vehicles , like tax incentives and strong emissions standards . That \u2019 s because regardless of tariffs , global supply chains have been contracting for years . Heavy goods especially now tend to be assembled closer to where they \u2019 re going to be sold , so if you want something to be made in your country , it makes sense to consume more of it .\nInstead , Trump has enthusiastically supported fossil fuels . His Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back Obama-era vehicle fuel economy rules and fighting the extension of a $ 7,500 electric vehicle tax credit . Trump \u2019 s Bureau of Land Management has eased the way for lithium mining on public lands , but investors have been leery .\nAny policy proposal involving climate has become politicized . For example : A bill proposed in December by Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier to create new electric vehicle tax incentives , boost charging infrastructure and issue bonds for domestic battery manufacturers has 31 Democratic co-sponsors and no Republicans .\n\u201c The administration \u2019 s policy is that this is not a problem , \u201d said David Hart , director of the Center for Science , Technology and Innovation Policy at George Mason \u2019 s Schar School of Policy and Government .\nAs his assistant secretary of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy , Trump installed Daniel Simmons , a former staffer at oil- and gas-friendly think tanks .\nWhite House budgets have proposed slashing renewable energy research funding and even sought to eliminate the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy , the office heading federal energy storage research initiatives . Congress has so far declined to adopt the cuts , and some battery research continues , although experts say it \u2019 s less than needed .\n\u201c People were really interested in what we were doing in the U.S. , \u201d Jim Greenberger , executive director of the National Alliance for Advanced Technology Batteries , told me . \u201c Now we \u2019 re irrelevant internationally . \u201d\nThe Trump administration has made a few steps forward . In January , the Energy Department announced an \u201c energy storage grand challenge \u201d that will direct $ 158 million toward research and manufacturing improvements . And there have been glimmers of new investment in battery production , such as GM \u2019 s $ 2.3 billion partnership with LG Chem to produce batteries at its shuttered plant in Lordstown , Ohio .\nRead More Coronavirus Advice From Abroad : 7 Lessons America \u2019 s Governors Should Not Ignore as They Reopen Their Economies We spoke to frontline experts from around the globe and have compiled a list of recommendations for reopening U.S. states . Their consensus ? It \u2019 s tough to find policies that simultaneously save lives and livelihoods .\nBut that pales in comparison to Europe and Asia , which are galloping ahead in electric vehicle adoption . Several European nations aim to phase out gas-powered vehicles entirely , for example , and the EU has a bloc-wide \u201c strategic action plan \u201d to ratchet up emissions standards and spend more than $ 3.5 billion on advanced battery research . China established electric vehicle production targets and requires automakers to buy batteries domestically .\nKota , the former White House advanced manufacturing chief now at the University of Michigan , advocates a new policy that would require spending at least 5 % of America \u2019 s $ 150 billion annual science budget on research that turns laboratory breakthroughs into commercially viable products . The government should support startups by buying their products , and companies benefiting from government-subsidized research should be required to manufacture them mostly in the U.S. , he said .\nBut the problem isn \u2019 t only with government policy . In contrast to the patient , long-term view of investors in countries like Japan and South Korea , America \u2019 s fast-churning capital markets tend to abandon companies that don \u2019 t grow quickly enough . To fill that gap , Kota thinks governments should raise money for publicly managed , privately financed venture funds .\n\u201c When it comes to scale-up , that shouldn \u2019 t be the government \u2019 s responsibility , \u201d Kota told me . \u201c Because then you \u2019 ll be establishing A123 . \u201d\nAfter A123 \u2019 s bankruptcy , company executives assured the Department of Energy that the new Chinese owners would maintain production in Michigan .\n\u201c They are historically a hands-off owner , retain U.S. management , preserve U.S. jobs provided financial targets are met , and on several occasions have exported product from U.S. divisions to their Chinese customers , \u201d senior technical director Mike Wixom wrote , according to documents reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nTo Perry Seay , the Chinese company \u2019 s U.S. manufacturing operations never made much sense , given how few electric cars Americans were buying . \u201c We were trying to sell to people here in the U.S. , but nobody wanted it , \u201d Seay said . And batteries are heavy \u2014 it \u2019 s hard to compete on cost when you \u2019 re shipping overseas .\nIn 2019 , A123 announced it would close its factories and consolidate its engineering personnel in Novi , Michigan . The federal Department of Labor approved a petition for trade adjustment assistance , which is granted when jobs are moved offshore , to dozens of A123 \u2019 s laid-off workers . A skeletal crew is doing cleanup at the Romulus plant , and when I visited , the parking lot was almost empty , the chargers ripped out of several spaces reserved for electric cars .\nThe quiet town has likely felt more economic impact from a new Amazon fulfillment center than it ever did from A123 . Tim Keyes , the city \u2019 s former development director , told me A123 management always kept its distance ; he never heard back when he called to check in .\n\u201c They were a ghost tenant , \u201d Keyes said , just taking up space that otherwise would \u2019 ve been on the town \u2019 s tax rolls . \u201c I imagine the city is looking forward to them finally moving out . \u201d",

By 2024, Benchmark expects America to have 8.2% of the world\u2019s lithium ion battery-making capacity, while China has 72.8% and Europe has 14.2%.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has urged companies to move their supply chains out of China. Trade adviser Navarro, a longtime critic of trade with China, has explicitly cited America\u2019s lack of battery manufacturing as a national security threat because of the substantial military applications \u2014 ranging from portable radios to thermal imaging for surveillance. China also controls the raw materials used in advanced batteries. Lithium, the world\u2019s lightest metal, is primarily mined in Chile and Australia and processed in China.\n\n\u201cWe have virtually all of the battery production migrating elsewhere now,\u201d Navarro said in a 2018 speech at a Washington think tank. \u201cAnd we have the lithium that\u2019s used for some of this is coming under the control of foreign powers.\u201d\n\nBut so far, the administration\u2019s efforts have either been small-scale or even counterproductive.\n\nTake Trump\u2019s trade war, which imposed a 15% tariff on lithium ion batteries coming from China starting in September 2019. (It\u2019s since been cut in half.) Companies and associations \u2014 including the Korean company LG Chem and Tesla, the two biggest manufacturers of batteries in the U.S. \u2014 pleaded for exemptions with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative because of the difficulty finding sources.\n\nBut the tariffs did not spur domestic production, said Cairn Energy Research Advisors analyst Sam Jaffe. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to build a factory here to take advantage of that, how do you know it\u2019s not going to disappear in six months?\u201d Jaffe said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost frozen people in their tracks.\u201d\n\nWhat would spur domestic production? According to experts I interviewed: More battery research investment, and policies that foster demand for electric vehicles, like tax incentives and strong emissions standards. That\u2019s because regardless of tariffs, global supply chains have been contracting for years. Heavy goods especially now tend to be assembled closer to where they\u2019re going to be sold, so if you want something to be made in your country, it makes sense to consume more of it.\n\nInstead, Trump has enthusiastically supported fossil fuels. His Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back Obama-era vehicle fuel economy rules and fighting the extension of a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Trump\u2019s Bureau of Land Management has eased the way for lithium mining on public lands, but investors have been leery.\n\nAny policy proposal involving climate has become politicized. For example: A bill proposed in December by Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier to create new electric vehicle tax incentives, boost charging infrastructure and issue bonds for domestic battery manufacturers has 31 Democratic co-sponsors and no Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s policy is that this is not a problem,\u201d said David Hart, director of the Center for Science, Technology and Innovation Policy at George Mason\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government.\n\nAs his assistant secretary of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Trump installed Daniel Simmons, a former staffer at oil- and gas-friendly think tanks.\n\nWhite House budgets have proposed slashing renewable energy research funding and even sought to eliminate the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, the office heading federal energy storage research initiatives. Congress has so far declined to adopt the cuts, and some battery research continues, although experts say it\u2019s less than needed.\n\n\u201cPeople were really interested in what we were doing in the U.S.,\u201d Jim Greenberger, executive director of the National Alliance for Advanced Technology Batteries, told me. \u201cNow we\u2019re irrelevant internationally.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has made a few steps forward. In January, the Energy Department announced an \u201cenergy storage grand challenge\u201d that will direct $158 million toward research and manufacturing improvements. And there have been glimmers of new investment in battery production, such as GM\u2019s $2.3 billion partnership with LG Chem to produce batteries at its shuttered plant in Lordstown, Ohio.\n\nRead More Coronavirus Advice From Abroad: 7 Lessons America\u2019s Governors Should Not Ignore as They Reopen Their Economies We spoke to frontline experts from around the globe and have compiled a list of recommendations for reopening U.S. states. Their consensus? It\u2019s tough to find policies that simultaneously save lives and livelihoods.\n\nBut that pales in comparison to Europe and Asia, which are galloping ahead in electric vehicle adoption. Several European nations aim to phase out gas-powered vehicles entirely, for example, and the EU has a bloc-wide \u201cstrategic action plan\u201d to ratchet up emissions standards and spend more than $3.5 billion on advanced battery research. China established electric vehicle production targets and requires automakers to buy batteries domestically.\n\nKota, the former White House advanced manufacturing chief now at the University of Michigan, advocates a new policy that would require spending at least 5% of America\u2019s $150 billion annual science budget on research that turns laboratory breakthroughs into commercially viable products. The government should support startups by buying their products, and companies benefiting from government-subsidized research should be required to manufacture them mostly in the U.S., he said.\n\nBut the problem isn\u2019t only with government policy. In contrast to the patient, long-term view of investors in countries like Japan and South Korea, America\u2019s fast-churning capital markets tend to abandon companies that don\u2019t grow quickly enough. To fill that gap, Kota thinks governments should raise money for publicly managed, privately financed venture funds.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to scale-up, that shouldn\u2019t be the government\u2019s responsibility,\u201d Kota told me. \u201cBecause then you\u2019ll be establishing A123.\u201d\n\nAfter A123\u2019s bankruptcy, company executives assured the Department of Energy that the new Chinese owners would maintain production in Michigan.\n\n\u201cThey are historically a hands-off owner, retain U.S. management, preserve U.S. jobs provided financial targets are met, and on several occasions have exported product from U.S. divisions to their Chinese customers,\u201d senior technical director Mike Wixom wrote, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica.\n\nTo Perry Seay, the Chinese company\u2019s U.S. manufacturing operations never made much sense, given how few electric cars Americans were buying. \u201cWe were trying to sell to people here in the U.S., but nobody wanted it,\u201d Seay said. And batteries are heavy \u2014 it\u2019s hard to compete on cost when you\u2019re shipping overseas.\n\nIn 2019, A123 announced it would close its factories and consolidate its engineering personnel in Novi, Michigan. The federal Department of Labor approved a petition for trade adjustment assistance, which is granted when jobs are moved offshore, to dozens of A123\u2019s laid-off workers. A skeletal crew is doing cleanup at the Romulus plant, and when I visited, the parking lot was almost empty, the chargers ripped out of several spaces reserved for electric cars.\n\nThe quiet town has likely felt more economic impact from a new Amazon fulfillment center than it ever did from A123. Tim Keyes, the city\u2019s former development director, told me A123 management always kept its distance; he never heard back when he called to check in.\n\n\u201cThey were a ghost tenant,\u201d Keyes said, just taking up space that otherwise would\u2019ve been on the town\u2019s tax rolls. \u201cI imagine the city is looking forward to them finally moving out.\u201d",
