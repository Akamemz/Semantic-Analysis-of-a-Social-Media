Lindsey Graham introduced a bill Thursday that would ban most abortions nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 putting the veteran lawmaker in the middle of a renewed national debate over late-term abortions .\nThe push comes despite some concerns \u2014 including from within the Republican ranks \u2014 that the proposal could be unconstitutional .\nFlanked by pro-life advocates , Mr. Graham said advancements in science and technology have shown that unborn children can feel pain after about six months and that he is speaking up on their behalf by pushing the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act .\n\u201c We are choosing today to speak up for all babies at 20 weeks , and trying to create legal protections under the theory that if you can feel pain , the government should protect you from being destroyed by an abortion , which I imagine would be a very painful way to die , \u201d the South Carolina Republican said .\nThe two-term senator has been targeted by tea party conservatives and will have at least three challengers in the South Carolina GOP primary next year .\nThe legislation he rolled out Thursday carves out abortion exemptions in the case of rape or incest against a minor or to save the life of the mother .\nMore than 30 Republicans in the Senate have signed onto the bill , though there are some notable exceptions , including Sens . Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah , a pair of tea party favorites and self-described constitutional conservatives .\nBrian Phillips , a Lee spokesman , said the freshman senator is still mulling over the potential constitutional hurdles . \u201c That \u2019 s what he \u2019 s working on and why he \u2019 s talking to other members and outside groups , \u201d Mr. Phillips said . Mr. Paul \u2019 s office did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment .\nThe proposal , though , does have support from a couple of other tea party favorites : Sens . Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll continue to work with other senators on language that addresses the constitutional issues , but he wanted to co-sponsor Graham \u2019 s legislation because he agrees with the bill \u2019 s goals , \u201d said Alex Conant , a Rubio spokesman .\nPro-life supporters of the bill say they are confident they have legal standing , and say the Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to control interstate commerce , and is broad enough to encompass limiting abortions .
