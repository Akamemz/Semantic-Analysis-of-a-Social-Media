This is terrible . This is the end of my presidency . I 'm f * * * ed , ' `` according to the report by special counsel Robert Mueller that was released Thursday in redacted form .\nThe president 's prediction , written down by an aide and contained in the 448 pages of the Mueller report , has not come to pass . But Mueller 's 22-month investigation did turn up numerous instances of the president trying to prevent investigators from carrying out their mandate \u2014 and it suggests that he might have been successful were it not for his own aides ignoring his directives .\nThose dissenting figures included former White House counsel Don McGahn , deputy national security adviser K.T . McFarland and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions .\nAs a result , the Mueller report 's conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice was decidedly noncommittal .\n`` If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice , we would so state , '' the report reads . `` Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards however we are unable to reach that judgment .
