    "content": "Michael Bloomberg did not want to be in Selma on Sunday . When the Rev . Leodis Strong invited him to participate in the 55th anniversary of the 1965 civil rights march known as \u201c Bloody Sunday , \u201d the former mayor at first declined , saying that he was too busy running for president . A week later , he changed his mind \u2014 or had it changed for him \u2014 and decided that attending the historic Brown Chapel the Sunday before Super Tuesday and crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge with ailing congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis wasn \u2019 t a distraction from his campaign , but an important piece of it . Bloomberg \u2019 s instinct to stay away was understandable . He had already spent an unprecedented amount of money in a bid for Alabama \u2019 s 52 pledged delegates and was about to pull off an impressive political trick : the rapid financial orchestration of a strong position in the state \u2019 s minority-majority primary , including a main office facing a statue of Rosa Parks , without having drawn any local attention to his legacy as the mayor responsible for stop-and-frisk policing . Being invited onto the most hallowed ground of the civil rights movement on its most hallowed day on the eve of this achievement may have felt like a trap . Accepting and rejecting the invitation both risked highlighting the nettlesome legacy that he needs black voters \u2014 who made up 54 percent of the 2016 Alabama Democratic primary \u2014 to forget . Bloomberg surprised many inside the church when he took a seat in the front row . Adding further contrast between himself and former Vice President Joe Biden , who assumed a pride of place behind the altar , Strong pointedly reminded his flock inside the church , and the thousands more watching the service on the Jumbotron outside , that Bloomberg opposed the invitation before he supported it .\nBloomberg may have been expecting worse when it finally happened , toward the end of his boilerplate speech , and a dozen or so churchgoers in a center pew stood and turned their backs to him until he finished .
