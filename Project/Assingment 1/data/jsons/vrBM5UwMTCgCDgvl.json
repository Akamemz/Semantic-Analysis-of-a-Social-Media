Republicans pledge to erase the president's acts as soon as a Republican is again sitting behind the Oval Office desk.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is among those calling for a reversal. Rubio spoke with NPR on Monday, the day he announced his presidential campaign.

He says he wants \"free and fair elections\" in Cuba and that U.S. policy can provide \"major leverage.\"\n\nThis was largely the approach that U.S. presidents took for generations \u2014 until December 2014, when Obama said that more than half a century of waiting was long enough.\n\nRubio is just as definite on Iran.\n\nThe U.S., other world powers and Iran have negotiated a framework agreement under which Iran would accept limits on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of global economic sanctions.\n\nRubio contends that what one president gives, the next may take away. \"What [Obama] is banking on,\" Rubio says, \"is that he is going to use a national security waiver to lift the sanctions,\" a move that allows the president to act without a vote in Congress. \"We would simply re-impose the sanctions.\"\n\nRubio says he would make this move even if other world powers and the United Nations failed to follow suit, though he admits his move \"wouldn't be as effective\" that way.\n\nSuch a move could lead to a new confrontation with Iran.

The simplest is this: Could a President Rubio (or Walker, or Cruz, or ...) really do these things?\n\nStrictly speaking, yes.\n\nA president can break diplomatic relations with Cuba, even if they've just been restored.\n\nSupporters of Obama's Cuba policy, however, expect a different dynamic.
