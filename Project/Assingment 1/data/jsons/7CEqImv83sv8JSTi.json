For many , it \u2019 s the most direct approach to the president \u2019 s sometimes unpredictable policy decisions .\nMr. Trump has encouraged such approaches , but they have added a layer of ambiguity to foreign affairs . Some aides fret that the personal talks can sow confusion within the administration . At times , senior officials have been left in the dark or had to backtrack on some of Mr. Trump \u2019 s remarks .\nSupporters point to Mr. Trump \u2019 s hands-on strategy for making deals , drawn from his business background , as one of his strengths . He has given out his personal cellphone number to allies including Canada \u2019 s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France \u2019 s President Emmanuel Macron , said U.S. and foreign officials , so they can speak freely without the bureaucratic headaches and security measures that often come with official calls .\n\u201c At this point , foreign leaders understand that nobody can speak authoritatively other than Trump , and that what other interlocutors say may not represent the president \u2019 s position today , \u201d said Robert Danin , a longtime U.S. diplomat , now at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Harvard Kennedy School \u2019 s Belfer Center .\nMr. Trump has extolled his \u201c very strong and personal relationship \u201d with China \u2019 s President Xi Jinping on Twitter and elsewhere , adding in a tweet in December , \u201c He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change , on trade and far beyond , between our two great Nations . \u201d\nAfter February \u2019 s failed summit with North Korea , however , delicate U.S.-China trade talks have taken a more conventional turn over concern on both sides , particularly China \u2019 s , that a meeting of the two top leaders could go awry . Now , top aides are toiling away at details before a potential meeting in Florida between the two leaders later this month .\nMr. Trump has opted to hold meetings with Mr. Putin without standard note-taking , out of concerns about previous leaks of his conversations with foreign leaders . Such notes are typically circulated among government agencies to keep everyone up-to-date on the latest discussions .\nSome advisers worry that Mr. Trump , a foreign-policy novice when he became president , could overpromise where the U.S. isn \u2019 t prepared to deliver , or fail to properly hold leaders accountable on issues with national security implications .\nAfter a July 2018 meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki , Mr. Trump questioned the U.S. intelligence conclusion that Moscow had meddled in the 2016 U.S. election . \u201c President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial , \u201d he said at a news conference . Mr. Trump reversed his comments the next day , saying he supported U.S. intelligence agencies .\nAn official familiar with the inner workings of the White House said the president \u2019 s advisers suspect that he regularly speaks with world leaders on his phone .\n\u201c We never know who he \u2019 s talking to or what he \u2019 s agreed to , \u201d the official said .\nTensions between the U.S. and Turkey were simmering when Mr. Erdogan picked up the phone and called Mr. Trump in January .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s national security adviser , John Bolton , had clashed with Turkish officials over U.S. plans to withdraw from Syria . Mr. Erdogan wanted to hear about those issues from Mr. Trump himself , \u201c bypassing everyone else \u201d by calling the president directly , a U.S. official said .\nA Turkish official said , \u201c There was a sense that it is better to wait and see what President Trump will say on the matter before any actions are taken . \u201d\nMr. Trump has said that he \u2019 s his own best spokesman and has criticized his own administration \u2019 s ability , at times , to portray a unified public message .\n\u201c It is not clear Trump really wants others speaking for him unless it is to quote verbatim what he has already said , \u201d said the Council on Foreign Relations \u2019 s Mr. Danin .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s supporters applaud his \u201c Art of the Deal \u201d approach to diplomacy . Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he would be willing to meet anyone , including the leaders of North Korea and Iran , if he felt that he could secure some sort of agreement or an assurance from the other side that an agreement is possible .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s preference for one-on-one discussions is his way of cutting through the red tape that often dictates international negotiations , according to those familiar with his thinking .\nBefore his first meeting with North Korea \u2019 s Mr. Kim last year , Mr. Trump told reporters he would know \u201c within the first minute \u201d whether talks would succeed . \u201c Just my touch , my feel.That \u2019 s what I do . \u201d\nMr. Kim has shunned some of Mr. Trump \u2019 s most senior diplomats , including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , and sent letters directly to Mr. Trump suggesting a personal bond .\nIn one letter , Mr. Kim noted that only they could address the longstanding conflict between the two countries , according to several people briefed on the contents of the letter .\n\u201c Kim Jong Un has concluded that Trump is a good guy to talk to , while conversations at a lower level are a waste of time , \u201d said Wi Sung-lac , a former South Korean diplomat .\nHopes ran high around last month \u2019 s summit between the U.S. and North Korea in Hanoi , with the White House announcing one day before the formal meeting that a joint agreement would be signed the next day .
