    "content": "Marco Rubio , needing a breakout performance going into Tuesday 's Florida primary , changed tactics and used substance during Thursday night 's GOP debate to attack Donald Trump on several fronts \u2013 while Trump , subdued and trying to look more presidential , held steady to the campaign-tested themes that have made him the front-runner .\nAt the end of the two-hour debate , Trump \u2014 coming off a string of primary wins \u2014 summed up the reality that Rubio and rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich face : that only \u201c two of us \u201d can get the delegates to win \u2013 meaning Trump and Cruz \u2014 and \u201c two of us \u201d can not , referring to Rubio and Kasich .\n\u201c That is not meant to be a criticism \u2026 that \u2019 s just a mathematical fact , \u201d Trump said , urging the party to \u201c be smart and unify . \u201d\nThe reminder amounted to just about the toughest criticism of the night , at a debate where personal attacks were replaced by more substantive policy discussion .\nBut Rubio , in particular , who drastically changed his campaign approach in recent weeks to turn up the heat on Trump and even mock his physical appearance , dialed all that back onstage Thursday \u2013 after having said he regrets some of those personal insults .\nInstead , he hit Trump on his defense of his \u201c Islam hates us '' remarks , Trump 's suggestion he 'd do a deal with the Palestinians and his vow that he would n't touch Social Security \u2014 despite warnings it would start running out of money in two decades .\nTrump 's rivals , though , did not criticize him after he was asked about whether his tone is encouraging violence at his rallies , a reference to a recent incident where a protester was punched .\n\u201c I hope not , I truly hope not , '' Trump said , saying he does not `` condone '' violence but also that some protesters are `` bad dudes . ''\nOne of the most pointed debate clashes came over the diplomatic thaw with Cuba \u2014 a huge issue in Florida , host of the CNN debate and next week \u2019 s critical primary . Trump tangled with his rivals as he claimed he \u2019 s \u201c in the middle \u201d on the issue .\nTrump said \u201c something \u201d should take place after a decades-long freeze , but , \u201c I want to get a much better deal . \u201d\n\u201c Here \u2019 s a good deal , \u201d Florida Sen. Rubio snapped back . \u201c Cuba has free elections . Cuba stops putting people in jail . \u201d\nWhether Rubio \u2019 s performance is enough is the big question . Pressure was already mounting on him to drop out , and Texas Sen. Cruz added to that pressure Thursday night .\n\u201c There are only two of us who have a path to winning the nomination -- Donald and myself , \u201d Cruz said , while also jokingly referring to Trump as the \u201c son of a businessman . \u201d\nRubio entered the debate clinging to life in the GOP primary race after a string of losses .
