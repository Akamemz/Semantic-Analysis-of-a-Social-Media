She is running in a crowded Democratic primary to succeed her late husband , Rep. Elijah E. Cummings , in the 7th District . ( Tom Williams/CQ \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nBALTIMORE \u2014 Two dozen Democrats are running for the nomination in Maryland \u2019 s 7th District , but no one looms larger over the race than the late Rep. Elijah E. Cummings , whose death last fall prompted the upcoming special election .\nWhat Cummings wanted in a successor \u2014 and what people think he would have wanted \u2014 have become big factors in this contest , where the two best-known candidates are his widow , Maya Rockeymoore Cummings , and his friend and predecessor , Kweisi Mfume , who left Congress in 1996 to lead the NAACP .\n\u201c My late husband was a beautiful man , \u201d Rockeymoore Cummings said , her voice rising as she addressed the congregation at Zion Baptist Church on Sunday . \u201c And I ask you to continue to pray for me and our family as we continue to walk this path . \u201d\nBut family in this race is complicated . The late congressman \u2019 s daughters are backing one of his former staffers , while at least two of his sisters were at a \u201c Women for Mfume \u201d rally later that day .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nobody else that I would vote for . Not even my sister-in-law , \u201d said Cheretheria Blount , Cummings \u2019 70-year-old sister .\n\u201c My motto is : A vote for Maya Rockeymoore is not a vote for Elijah , \u201d added Diane Woodson , Cummings \u2019 63-year-old sister .\nBut this race may also be a test of how much times have changed , with Rockeymoore Cummings \u2014 who is two decades younger than Mfume \u2014 striving to be the first woman to hold this seat and the only woman in Maryland \u2019 s all-male congressional delegation . Mfume is facing allegations of sexual harassment during his tenure at the NAACP , which he denies . In the two decades since he left Congress , though , similar allegations have derailed other lawmakers \u2019 careers .\nNext week \u2019 s contest , expected to be a low-turnout election , has been overshadowed by the equally crowded April mayoral primary and by national Democrats jockeying to take on President Donald Trump .\nVoters in this solidly blue district go to the polls next Tuesday , the day after the Iowa caucuses and the same day Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address . Whoever wins the Democratic primary will likely win the special general election on April 28 , which is the same day as the primary for the regular November election .\nAll eyes are on Mfume and Rockeymoore Cummings , but state Sen. Jill Carter has consolidated some progressive support , including the backing of 2018 gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous , while law professor Michael Higginbotham has poured more than $ 500,000 of his own money into his campaign . Rockeymoore Cummings has earned media attention \u2014 she announced her campaign on MSNBC and was on \u201c The View \u201d last week .\nSeated in the second-from-the-front pew in church Sunday morning , Rockeymoore Cummings often had a hand outstretched \u2014 either above her in prayer or to the side to embrace a fellow parishioner . The women who packed the service \u2014 even those who said they hadn \u2019 t made up their minds about whom to support \u2014 beamed at her .\nBlack women are motivated voters , and they \u2019 re an influential part of the primary electorate in the 7th District , which includes parts of Baltimore City and Baltimore and Howard counties . Half of the district \u2019 s voters live in the city .\n\u201c Black women are the heart and soul , the pumping power , of the Democratic Party . It is time that our party looked like us , \u201d state Del . Robbyn Lewis said at a Monday news conference when Rockeymoore Cummings touted endorsements from EMILY \u2019 s List , Baltimore Women United for Action , Higher Heights for America , which supports black female candidates , and local leaders .\nRockeymoore Cummings talks about \u201c shattering the glass ceiling , \u201d but she \u2019 s running on more than just making history . Her pitch is twofold : She has congressional and policy experience , and she wants to continue the legacy of her late husband , whom she met on Capitol Hill . She worked on the Ways and Means Committee and was chief of staff to former New York Rep. Charles B. Rangel before starting her own consulting firm .\nBut among activists and politicos , at least , the significance of electing a woman to this seat has been underscored by a Jan. 17 Baltimore Sun story about Mfume \u2019 s departure from the NAACP . The executive committee took a secret vote in 2004 not to renew his contract , according to the Sun \u2019 s review of former NAACP Chairman Julian Bond \u2019 s papers , now at the University of Virginia . The newspaper unearthed allegations of sexual harassment , including a threat of a lawsuit against Mfume and the NAACP .\n\u201c I really don \u2019 t like talking ill of a dead person except to say that Julian \u2019 s recollection in all this was not correct , \u201d Mfume told CQ \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Sunday .\n\u201c I was a single man who , on the job , dated a single woman for about six months , \u201d he said . \u201c There were , I think , one or two other people who thought , \u2018 Maybe he should have been dating me . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c Voters want people who have exhibited good judgment in the past , \u201d she told CQ \u2588\u2588\u2588 when asked about them .\n\u201c I \u2019 m standing for women , that I \u2019 m not about exploitation , that I \u2019 m focused on women \u2019 s empowerment and opportunities , \u201d she added .\nLater that afternoon , hundreds of women crowded a ballroom across town , waving blue pompoms and chanting , \u201c We are women for Mfume ! \u201d\nThe women here weren \u2019 t bothered by the sexual harassment allegations against the former congressman , if they even believed them .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not an issue for me .
