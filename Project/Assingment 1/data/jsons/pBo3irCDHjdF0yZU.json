In the anonymous report\u2014published over the weekend by Babe\u2014a woman shares her account the alleged misconduct which took place on a date in September 2017 .\nThe responses to the woman 's story are peppered with the word `` should . '' She should have said no ; she should have walked out ; she should never have taken off her clothes ; she should n't have been there in the first place . These responses , which are disturbingly widespread , not only shift the blame and responsibility onto the woman , they also fail to recognise an important truth . For many women , uttering an explicit `` no '' is not as easy or straightforward as you might think .\nThe woman\u2014who 's identified as `` Grace '' \u2014describes going out for dinner with Ansari before going to his apartment where events took place which left her feeling `` violated '' . Grace describes using verbal and non-verbal cues to convey how `` uncomfortable and distressed she was . ''\n`` Most of my discomfort was expressed in me pulling away and mumbling . I know that my hand stopped moving at some points , '' Grace told Babe . `` I stopped moving my lips and turned cold . He probably moved my hand to his dick five to seven times , '' says Grace . `` He really kept doing it after I moved it away . ''\nOne moment in particular is depicted as `` particularly significant '' for Grace . She leaves the room , and spends around five minutes in the bathroom before re-entering .\nHe asked her if she was okay . \u201c I said I don \u2019 t want to feel forced because then I \u2019 ll hate you , and I \u2019 d rather not hate you , \u201d she said .\nGrace told Babe that this remark about `` not wanting to feel `` forced '' '' had `` added a verbal component to the cues she was trying to give him about her discomfort '' . Grace says that , despite raising a verbal red flag about her discomfort , Ansari `` motioned '' for Grace to perform oral sex on him .\nAnsari instructed her to turn around . \u201c He sat back and pointed to his penis and motioned for me to go down on him . And I did . I think I just felt really pressured . It was literally the most unexpected thing I thought would happen at that moment because I told him I was uncomfortable. \u201d Soon , he pulled her back up onto the couch . She would tell her friend via text later that night , \u201c He [ made out ] with me again and says , \u2018 Doesn \u2019 t look like you hate me . \u2019 \u201d\nAnsari responded to the allegations in statement , in which he appeared to agree with Grace 's account of the evening . Ansari said `` by all indications '' the `` sexual activity '' that took place was `` completely consensual . ''\nThe next day , I got a text from her saying that although \u201c it may have seemed okay , \u201d upon further reflection , she felt uncomfortable . It was true that everything did seem okay to me , so when I heard that it was not the case for her , I was surprised and concerned . I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said .\nSince this story 's publication , one troubling thread of conversation has persisted . The assertion that Grace should have said something . A quick glance at the Twitter responses to Babe 's tweet will give you a sense of the kind of views being shared :\n`` You know what 's clearer than any non-verbal cue ? A verbal one . * Gasp * '' wrote one person .\n`` There were a couple of moments where `` Grace '' could 've easily walked away and go home after all the foreplay you claim you were doing . Just say you should meet another time with a better state of mind or not see him ever again , '' reads another reply .\n`` Maybe verbal clues would have been best . Something like , I 'm not interested pal , '' wrote another . `` Ok I 'm sorry but 1st what did she was gon na happen going to his pad .. and 2nd the very second she felt uncomfortable she shoulda said ' got ta go .. bye !
