Despite a slight upward revision from the original estimate , February hiring remained the weakest since September 2017 .\nMeanwhile , the unemployment rate remained at 3.8 % , a level near historic lows .\nWhile March hiring was robust , it brings the first-quarter average to 180,000 jobs created per month , down from 223,000 per month on average in 2018 . Economists have been expecting a slowdown , and so far it looks gradual enough to support the idea that the economy may glide to a lower level of activity in 2019 rather than shudder to a halt\n`` Markets are looking at every shadow and around every corner , whether it 's an inverted yield curve or bad jobs report , '' said Sean Snaith , director of the University of Central Florida 's Institute for Economic Forecasting . `` This should assure people that the boogeyman is n't hiding in the closet .
