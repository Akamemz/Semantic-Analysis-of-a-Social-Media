But four years later , he acknowledges that unemployment and underemployment are still too high .\nHe promised liberals who were weary of George W. Bush \u2019 s war on terrorism four years ago that he would close the detention center for terrorism suspects at U.S . Naval Base Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , but it remains open .\nHe excited Hispanic voters by holding out the goal of immigration reform ; four years later , the president is trying to mobilize that constituency again with the same promise that has gone unfulfilled .\nNow locked in a tight race with Republican nominee Mitt Romney as the campaign heads into the final week , the president is trying to keep his supporters in the fold by arguing that he needs more time to accomplish the goals he laid out in 2008 .\n\u201c We haven \u2019 t finished everything that we want to get done , \u201d Mr. Obama said at a rally in the battleground state of Colorado last week . \u201c That \u2019 s why I \u2019 m running for a second term . \u201d\nThe number of people willing to give Mr. Obama the benefit of the doubt is dwindling . Gallup said the president \u2019 s job-approval rating suffered its biggest drop last week in more than a year , falling from 53 percent on Wednesday to 46 percent on Friday , a 7-point decline in just three days .\nThose who are still eager to give Mr. Obama another chance blame Republicans in Congress for Mr. Obama \u2019 s unkept promises .\n\u201c What he didn \u2019 t get done was mainly what the Republicans blocked , like the jobs bill , \u201d said Roz Dudden , a retired medical librarian from Denver , referring to the second economic-recovery proposal that the president introduced in September 2011 at a cost of nearly $ 450 billion . \u201c Every time he wanted to do something that was progressive or interesting or that helps the American people , the Republicans blocked him with their \u2018 no \u2019 votes in Congress . \u201d\nDonald Estabrook , a senior citizen from Brooksville , Fla. , said he doesn \u2019 t hold Mr. Obama \u2019 s failures against him because the Republican Party has not cooperated .\n\u201c He \u2019 s done the best he can , \u201d Mr. Estabrook said . \u201c Being the president , you don \u2019 t always get what you think you can get , because it \u2019 s got to go through the Congress . That \u2019 s the reason why he can \u2019 t get a lot done . \u201d\nMr. Obama \u2019 s die-hard supporters rarely acknowledge that Congress was controlled by Democrats during the president \u2019 s first two years in office , when lawmakers passed his signature health care legislation , as well as an $ 821 billion economic-stimulus program that the president rarely mentions anymore .\nSome voters are just plain misinformed about what Mr. Obama has done over the past four years .\nAsked to name the most important promise that Mr. Obama hasn \u2019 t kept in the past four years , Katie Merritt , a high school English teacher from Tampa , Fla. , responded : \u201c Get our troops out of Iraq . \u201d\nTold that the president had indeed pulled U.S. forces out of Iraq , she replied : \u201c Well , we \u2019 ve still got plenty of people over there .
