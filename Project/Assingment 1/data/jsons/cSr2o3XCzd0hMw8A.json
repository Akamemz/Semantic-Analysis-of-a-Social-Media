Indeed , as Michael Lind and Robert Atkinson note in their recent book Big Is Beautiful , productivity growth in any era tends to be driven by a handful of highly innovative frontier companies at one end of the size distribution .

The first chancellor of Germany after World War II , Adenauer is revered for having instituted the \u201c social-market \u201d model that led to West Germany \u2019 s post-war economic miracle .

When Steve Jobs took over Apple in 1996 , for instance , he famously forced the resignation of most of its board of directors , installing close friends who would be loyal to his vision . He then proceeded to lay off 3,000 workers and shuttered a number of the company \u2019 s biggest boondoggles . This earned him a reputation for ruthlessness , but it also set Apple on the path to become America \u2019 s first trillion-dollar company .
