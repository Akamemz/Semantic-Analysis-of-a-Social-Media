Four Americans died at a U.S. diplomatic compound there after an attack by Islamist terrorist groups.\n\nOld case, new developments\n\nDuring her 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Clinton admitted she kept and exchanged emails on a private account and server during her time as secretary of State. This led the FBI to conduct an investigation that included an interview with Clinton. It found dozens of messages contained highly classified information, but ultimately recommended against criminal charges.\n\nIn July 2016, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

According to NBC, the group has been a strong advocate for complete transparency from the former secretary, claiming no search can be complete without a thorough search of every email.\n\nInitially, the State Department found 69 pages \"responsive\" to the group's FOIA request. However, Judicial Watch has continually filed requests in hopes of accessing the entire server. Most recently, the group has filed FOIA requests for more emails from Clinton and her longtime aide, Cheryl Mills, both of whom have released thousands of emails so far.\n\nAfter a long delay, on March 2, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth issued an order that Clinton and Mills would be required to sit for sworn depositions to Judicial Watch about records relating to the 2012 Benghazi attack.\n\nHowever, immediately after Lamberth's order, both Clinton's and Mills' lawyers petitioned the D.C.

According to a legal dictionary provided by the Legal Information Institute, a writ of mandamus \"is an order from a court, to an inferior government official, ordering the government official to properly fulfill their official duties or correct an abuse of discretion.\"\n\nWhat happened on June 2?\n\nOn June 2, attorneys for Clinton and Mills attended a telehearing with the D.C. Circuit. Judges heard arguments regarding a petition to reverse Lamberth's March 2 ruling that Clinton and Mills be required to give in-person depositions to Judicial Watch.\n\nNo ruling was made on the petition.\n\nJudicial Watch attorney Ramona Cotca argued that by proceeding with the depositions, Clinton and Mills might help clarify where the State Department can broaden its search.
