    "content": "( CNN ) Washington , DC , always puts on a show for the Fourth of July , but for the first time this year , President Donald Trump is personally planning and throwing together his own Independence Day event at the Lincoln Memorial .\nAll are welcome , but VIPs , including Republican donors , will get some special seating . There will be tanks -- standing still , not rolling -- and there will be fighter jets flying overhead . Trump 's show will be followed by the regular , PBS-broadcast annual concert in front of the Capitol , but the fireworks will be bigger than usual , unless it rains -- which the forecast says it may .\nHere 's what we know about what 's changing in DC for the Fourth of July this year in roughly the order we learned about it :\nAlthough the Lincoln Memorial is usually utilized for fireworks watching , this year it will feature a speech by Trump . The area in front of the memorial has been cordoned off for a VIP area and tickets have been distributed to the RNC and political donors , among others .\nHOLD THE DATE ! We will be having one of the biggest gatherings in the history of Washington , D.C. , on July 4th . It will be called `` A Salute To America '' and will be held at the Lincoln Memorial . Major fireworks display , entertainment and an address by your favorite President , me ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 24 , 2019\nIt 's unrelated to Trump 's `` Salute to America , '' but in a major change partially related to the government shutdown earlier in the year , the Smithsonian truncated its yearly Folk Life Festival from 10 days down to just two . The festival , which is meant to expose Americans attending July Fourth celebrations to other cultures , wrapped over the weekend . Instead , this year the festival celebrated the social power of music in the DC area .\nDue to Trump 's event , the launch site for the DC fireworks show was moved from the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial to West Potomac park , along the Potomac river .\nAn image from the 2017 fireworks display in Washington , DC .\nThe DC fireworks show , televised on PBS , usually runs about 20 minutes from 9:07 until 9:27 p.m . ET . This year , thanks to a donation by a fireworks company , it will run a full 35 minutes and wrap at 9:42 p.m . ET .\nTrump will speak around 6:30 p.m . ET , and there will be a 21-gun salute and a flyover by the plane that 's known as Air Force One when the President is aboard , according to a defense official .\nTrump will say an introduction and then speak individually about each service . He will first talk about the Coast Guard , with his remarks being followed by the Coast Guard flyover . This format will be repeated for the Air Force , then the Navy , the Marine Corps and the Army .\nThe President will then make closing remarks and the Navy 's elite airshow squadron , the Blue Angels -- which canceled a planned rest to participate -- will do their demonstration .\nIn an expensive headache for commercial airlines , airspace around Washington , DC , will close twice on the 4th of July . In normal years it does not close at all . But moving the fireworks display launch site closer to the river and adding the aircraft flyovers means new restrictions just before and during the 6:30 p.m . ET `` Salute to America '' and the 9:07 p.m . ET fireworks .\nThe closures will impact nearly 100 scheduled flights , according to a CNN review of flight records .\nThe last time DC airspace was closed was in 2015 , when World War II fighters did a ceremonial flyover along the Mall .\nJUST WATCHED See tanks that will be used in Trump 's July Fourth event Replay More Videos ...

Anti-Trump veterans will hand out T-shirts for the USS John McCain in order to troll Trump , who has belittled the dead senator and former prisoner of war .\nCompounding concerns that Trump 's event will seem more like a political rally , Republican donors and VIPs will get special access to the event . Roughly 15,000 tickets are being issued for the event and 500 of those are for VIPs , including some given to the RNC , CNN reports\nIt 's nowhere near the budget-busting $ 90 million estimate Trump got for his preferred Veterans Day parade of thousands of service members through DC streets , but there is certainly a cost to the `` Salute to America . '' What that cost will ultimately be is not clear .\nThe Air Force told CNN it would cover the cost of flyovers by classifying the events as training missions and using existing funds for pilot hours . But the Washington Post reported the National Park Service would need to redirect at least $ 2.5 million from funds earmarked to improve parks around the country to help cover new costs as a result of the event .\nIn a tweet , Trump said the cost would be `` very little compared to what it 's worth . '' It 's just not clear how much very little is .\nWhile most of the top US military brass will attend the event , some had prior engagements planned .
