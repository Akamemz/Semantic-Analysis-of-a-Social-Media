Mary Landrieu's (D-La.) controversial comments about racism and President Obama's unpopularity. In the midst of an uphill battle in which Obama's low approval numbers were dragging her campaign down, Landrieu said, \"The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans.\"\n\nLandrieu probably won't be in the Senate next year. The Louisiana Senate runoff is one of the few races still outstanding, and she's likely to lose. (At least national Democrats seemed to think so, though they appear to be having second thoughts now.)\n\nBut Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the first African-American senator elected from the Deep South since Reconstruction, will be. And he was mostly elected by white, conservative Southern voters.\n\nWhite conservatives also elected two black Republicans, Mia Love of Utah and Will Hurd of Texas, to the House.\n\nThese same Tea Party voters who are said to dislike the president because he is black are clamoring for Ben Carson to run for president. Carson is also black.\n\nIt was these overwhelmingly white conservatives who propelled Herman Cain, another African-American presidential candidate, to the top of the polls. Cain briefly led among Republicans both nationally and in Iowa, home of the first caucuses.\n\nSo is all the fuss about Obama really over race? (To be fair to Landrieu, she did not claim it was only about race, noting that the \"No. 1\" reason voters in Louisiana disapproved of Obama was his moratorium on offshore drilling that followed the 2010 BP oil spill.)\n\nIn 2014, the same South that remains \"more of a conservative place,\" as Landrieu put it, would vote for senators like Scott and nonwhite governors like South Carolina's Nikki Haley and Louisiana's own Bobby Jindal.\n\nThings have changed from when Strom Thurmond was a segregationist or even when David Duke was a significant player in Louisiana politics in the 1990s.\n\nSpeaking of the 1990s, Bill Clinton was every bit as unpopular among conservatives as Obama is today.
