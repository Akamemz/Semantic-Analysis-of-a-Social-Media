That a handful of people in the United States have Ebola hemorrhagic fever , or that we 're in an environment where a figure like Scott Brown can argue that ISIS may be sneaking Ebola across the border and surge in the polls ?\nElection-season Ebola hysteria materialized in frightening form over the weekend , when New Jersey Gov .

He eventually freed her after she threatened to sue , and she was shipped off to Maine to become Maine 's problem .\nAnd she sure is Maine 's problem . She 's supposed to be under mandatory quarantine there , too , but at least she 's allowed to stay in her house instead of some tent out back of the hospital in Newark . She 's declared that she has no intention of adhering to the mandatory quarantine , since she 's asymptomatic , which essentially made her quarantine a political imprisonment .\nThis morning , she officially broke the quarantine and went on a bike ride with her boyfriend ( and a pack of reporters and cops ) . What a scene !\nThe nurse , Kaci Hickox , left her house on the edge of Fort Kent just after 9 a.m. , biking with her boyfriend , Ted Wilbur , down a quiet paved road , followed closely by two police cars and a caravan of reporters . The couple rode less than a mile , then turned onto a graded gravel trail on a former railroad right-of-way flanked by pines . One police car , which has been posted outside her house for days , followed slowly behind . Ms. Hickox and her boyfriend , wearing jackets in the crisp Maine morning , returned to the house an hour later .\nThis could set up a fascinating legal case . The administration of Gov . Paul LePage can go to court to get an order enforcing the quarantine . They 'd have to prove that she represents an emergency threat to public health . Reality and election year politics , then , would go to battle .\nKaci Hickox is brave for daring to push this conflict to a head . She 's well on her way to earning the total enmity of the people for whom The Ebola , the political weapon , is the key to all good things electoral . They are trying to keep both her and reality locked up in a home for at least another week , lest they disrupt the convenient atmosphere of misplaced panic .\nIt 's likely that over the next few days , we 'll see the sort of individual character destruction directed at Kaci Hickox that has n't been seen since Sandra Fluke . That 's because she 's playing a very dangerous game , trying to live a levelheaded life in the public spotlight during a time when that 's not welcome . She is the counter-narrative , the anti-election . Bravo to her .",
