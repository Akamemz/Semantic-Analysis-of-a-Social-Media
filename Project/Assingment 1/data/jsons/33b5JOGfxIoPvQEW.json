    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We turn now to look at U.S.-Russian relations . Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has wrapped up a visit to Moscow , where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov . The meetings come at a time of increased tension between Washington and Moscow . On Wednesday during a press conference , President Trump said relations with Russia had reached a new low point .\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : It would be wonderful , as we were discussing just a little while ago , if NATO and our country could get along with Russia . Right now we \u2019 re not getting along with Russia at all . We may be at an all-time low in terms of relationship with Russia . This has built for a long period of time . But we \u2019 re going to see what happens . Putin is the leader of Russia . Russia is a strong country . We \u2019 re a very , very strong country .\nAMY GOODMAN : Trump \u2019 s comments came a day after the White House accused Russia of attempting to cover up the role of the Syrian government in the recent chemical attack in Syria that killed 87 people . Russia has rejected the claim , saying the U.S. has been too quick to blame Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . At the United Nations , Russia blocked a Security Council resolution Wednesday to denounce the chemical attack and to call on Assad \u2019 s government to cooperate with an international probe . Meanwhile , Russia has accused the United States of violating international law by bombing a Syrian air base last week .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : The rising tension also comes at a time when President Trump is reversing his criticism of NATO . On the campaign trail , Trump described NATO as \u201c obsolete \u201d and vowed to reconsider U.S. membership because it was , quote , \u201c costing us a fortune. \u201d But on Wednesday , Trump struck a different tone .\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : The secretary general and I had a productive discussion about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism . I complained about that a long time ago , and they made a change , and now they do fight terrorism . I said it was obsolete . It \u2019 s no longer obsolete . It \u2019 s my hope that NATO will take on an increased role in supporting our Iraqi partners in their battle against ISIS .\nAMY GOODMAN : President Trump \u2019 s remark came one day after he signed off on allowing the former Yugoslav republic Montenegro to join NATO , a move opposed by Russia , which has criticized the expansion of NATO .\nWe \u2019 re joined now by Stephen Cohen , professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at New York University and Princeton University . His most recent book , Soviet Fates and Lost Alternatives : From Stalinism to the New Cold War , it \u2019 s out in paperback . He \u2019 s a contributing editor at The Nation magazine .\nAnd joining us from London , Jonathan Steele , former Moscow correspondent for The Guardian , chief reporter at the website Middle East Eye . He \u2019 s the author of Eternal Russia : Yeltsin , Gorbachev , and the Mirage of Democracy .\nStephen Cohen , let \u2019 s begin with you . Explain what you understand took place in Moscow yesterday in this meeting between the foreign minister , Lavrov , and Rex Tillerson , the secretary of state , joined by the president , Putin .\nSTEPHEN COHEN : The Russian leadership knows Mr. Tillerson very , very well . For six or seven years , they dealt directly with him , including Putin , on one of the largest energy deals Russia had ever made with a Western energy giant , in this case , ExxonMobil . They would not have made that deal , for many billions of dollars , if they did not think\u2014excuse me\u2014that Mr. Tillerson was a deeply serious , competent and honorable man . Now , we can have our own views about the power of global oil companies in world affairs , but this is a bilateral relationship that was very important . Therefore , when Tillerson came to Moscow yesterday in his new capacity , they knew they were talking with a man of immense experience , because ExxonMobil has its own State Department , its own intelligence services , and a man that they could trust to be candid with them .\nAnd they had questions for Mr. Tillerson . We only heard echoes of that in the public statements . One question was\u2014and , by the way , Lavrov , the foreign minister , met first with Tillerson , then Putin joined them . But altogether , it was about five hours . The first was : What \u2019 s going on in Washington ? What is this all\u2014all this talk that Putin is our puppet ? Are you people operating on that assumption ?\nSecondly , and this was very important : Who \u2019 s making policy toward us in Washington ? Remember that when President Obama had reached an agreement last year with President Putin for joint military cooperation in Syria , our Department of Defense sabotaged that policy by bombing a Syrian troop camp . And Putin publicly said , \u201c Who \u2019 s making policy in Washington ? \u201d So I think those were the two fundamental questions they were going to ask .\nAnd the third question was that \u201c We had agreed , \u201d said Putin to Tillerson , I assume , \u201c that you now accepted our position , which we have held to for years , but which President Obama rejected , that the choice is between President Assad in Damascus or the Islamic State in Damascus . You said you accepted that position . But after this chemical gas attack , you seem to have drifted from that position . We need to know now your position , because we \u2019 re going to base our military calculations in Syria on what you tell us today . \u201d\nI end by saying that Tillerson and President Trump said something extremely important yesterday\u2014it \u2019 s been lost in all this madcap Kremlingate in Washington\u2014that American-Russian relations , said President Trump , may be at an all-time low . That \u2019 s a very important statement . It gets our attention back on what \u2019 s essential . And Tillerson said\u2014and this was important\u2014there is no trust between us . And that \u2019 s not acceptable when we \u2019 re talking about the two nuclear superpowers . So , for all the media blitz and riff on this , because the mainstream media hears what it wants to hear and has its own narratives , I thought that was very important . The news is very bad , but that was a piece of good news .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : But when you say that Russia wanted to know who \u2019 s making policy in Washington , what do they suspect , if it \u2019 s not Trump and Tillerson ? Who might be making policy in Washington ?\nSTEPHEN COHEN : Well , we\u2014I mean , I \u2019 m not a conspiracy buff , but we have a certain reality . I did not vote for President Trump , but I certainly supported his campaign promise that cooperation with Russia would be , as he put it , great . And if I have a minute , let me tell you why I think it \u2019 s great . I think\u2014and I \u2019 ve been doing this for 40 years , studying American-Russian relations , as a professor , but I \u2019 ve also been inside occasionally . I think this is the most dangerous moment in American-Russian relations , at least since the Cuban missile crisis . And arguably , it \u2019 s more dangerous , because it \u2019 s more complex . Therefore , we\u2014and then , meanwhile , we have in Washington these\u2014and , in my judgment , factless accusations that Trump has somehow been compromised by the Kremlin . So , at this worst moment in American-Russian relations , we have an American president who \u2019 s being politically crippled by the worst imaginable\u2014it \u2019 s unprecedented . Let \u2019 s stop and think . No American president has ever been accused , essentially , of treason . This is what we \u2019 re talking about here , or that his associates have committed treason .\nImagine , for example , John Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis . And for the viewers who are not of a certain age , the Kennedy administration was presented\u2014and the evidence , by the way , was presented to us ; they showed us the surveillance photos . There was no doubt what the Soviets had done , putting missile silos in Cuba . No evidence has been presented today of anything . Imagine if Kennedy had been accused of being a secret Soviet Kremlin agent . He would have been crippled . And the only way he could have proved he wasn \u2019 t was to have launched a war against the Soviet Union . And at that time , the option was nuclear war .\nSo the question arises , naturally : Why did Trump launch 50 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian Air Force base , when , God help us , he did kill some people , but was of no military value whatsoever ? Was this meant to show \u201c I \u2019 m not a Kremlin agent \u201d ? Because , normally , a president would have done the following . You would go to the United Nations\u2014though Putin says you should go to The Hague , but they both have investigative units\u2014and ask for an investigation about what happened with those chemical weapons . And then you would decide what to do . But while having dinner at Mar-a-Lago with the leader of China , who was deeply humiliated , because he \u2019 s an ally of Russia , they rushed off these Tomahawk missiles . So\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN : Over chocolate cake , you heard Donald Trump himself describe .\nSTEPHEN COHEN : I didn \u2019 t take umbrage at that , because I often say that about carrot cake . I often say , \u201c God , this is the best carrot cake I \u2019 ve ever seen in the world. \u201d I mean , that \u2019 s an American expression .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well , he also initially said Iraq , and not Syria .\nSTEPHEN COHEN : Yeah , I \u2019 m not in the mode of bashing Trump if he gets something right . We have to cling to what we have . But\u2014so we asked this question : Why did they do that ? And why did Trump do it ? And was he fed bad intelligence information or dubious information ? We have a long history of that in America . And that \u2019 s why the Russians wanted to ask Tillerson , \u201c Who \u2019 s making policy ? Because we tell you that your narratives aren \u2019 t true . But we are \u201d \u2014and , by the way , let me add one thing , because this is\u2014and then I \u2019 ll stop . This is very important .\nThe number two man in the Kremlin leadership , the prime minister of Russia , Dmitry Medvedev , now , remember who he is . He \u2019 s considered to be the most pro-Western member of the leadership . And he was the man on whom President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton based their entire so-called reset . And if we could only\u2014he was sitting in the presidency at the moment\u2014only keep him in power . So everybody liked Prime Minister Medvedev\u2014said , in the aftermath of this , \u201c We are on the brink of war , and American-Russian relations are utterly ruined. \u201d So if the pro-Western faction in the Kremlin is saying that , need I tell you what the so-called state patriots are telling Putin about what \u2019 s going on ? That \u2019 s why what Tillerson said was so important .\nAMY GOODMAN : We \u2019 re going to break and then come back to this discussion . In addition to Stephen Cohen , professor emeritus of Russian studies at both New York University and Princeton University , we \u2019 ll be joined by Jonathan Steele , former correspondent for The Guardian Moscow for years and now working with Middle East Eye .
