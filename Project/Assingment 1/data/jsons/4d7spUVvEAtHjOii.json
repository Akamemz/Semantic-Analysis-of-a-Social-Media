Ted Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio were forced to defend what appeared to be flip-flops on their stances on the thorny issue .\nShe confronted Mr. Rubio with videos of himself in 2009 and 2010 insisting he would oppose \u201c blanket amnesty \u201d \u2014 which he defined at the time as a path to citizenship \u2014 and then asked him to square that with his position in 2013 , when he was a key author of a bill to offer such a path .\n\u201c If you look at the quote \u2014 and it \u2019 s very specific \u2014 and it says blanket amnesty , and I do not support blanket amnesty , I do not support amnesty , \u201d Mr. Rubio explained .\nSEE ALSO : Donald Trump declares victory over Fox News in debate dispute\nFormer Florida Gov . Jeb Bush said that represented a flip-flop between 2009 and 2013 , and he accused Mr. Rubio of changing yet again in this current campaign and distancing himself from the very bill he wrote .\n\u201c He cut and run because it wasn \u2019 t popular amongst conservatives , \u201d Mr. Bush said .\nMr. Cruz , meanwhile , struggled to explain his own amendment during that 2013 debate that would have allowed illegal immigrants to gain legal status , though it would have stopped their special path to citizenship .\n\u201c I introduced a series of amendments , each designed to fix a problem in the bill , \u201d he said .\nMr. Rubio pounced , saying Mr. Cruz was trying to bamboozle voters .\n\u201c This is the lie Ted \u2019 s campaign is built on , \u201d Mr. Rubio said . \u201c The truth is , Ted , throughout this campaign you \u2019 ve been willing to say or do anything to get votes . \u201d\nThe seventh debate of the primary season came with candidates increasingly desperate to carve space out for themselves \u2014 and having a grand opportunity for the first time without Mr. Trump on stage .\nMr. Cruz , running second in polling and at the center of the stage for the first time in the campaign , seemed to bristle at the attention showered on him .\n\u201c The last four questions have been Rand , please attack Ted , Marco , please attack Ted , Chris please attack Ted , Jeb , please attack Ted , \u201d he said , then quipped , \u201c If you guys ask one more mean question , I may have to leave the stage . \u201d\nMr. Bush said he was a little sad to see Mr. Trump not show up , because it meant he lost his chief target .\n\u201c I kind of miss Donald Trump . He was a little teddy bear to me , \u201d Mr. Bush said .\nEven without Mr. Trump on stage , the candidates were arguing over his anti-establishment rhetoric and whether it was the right approach for Republicans heading into the November election .\nMr. Bush said he wouldn \u2019 t run away from the label of establishment , which he has earned because of his family , including two former presidents .\n\u201c I am in the establishment because my dad , the greatest man alive , was the president of the United States , and my brother , who I adore as well , is a fantastic brother , was president , fine I will take it , and I guess I am part of the establishment because Barbara Bush is my mom . I will take that too , \u201d he said . \u201c But this election is not about our pedigree ; this is an election about people that are really hurting and we a leader who will fix things and have a proven record to do it . \u201d\nAlso on stage were Ohio Gov . John Kasich , retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie .\nAcross town , Mr. Trump made good on his boycott threat by hosting an event at Drake University that he said was raising money for veterans \u2014 and drawing attention away from the debate , which was aired exclusively on Fox News Channel , while the other cable news networks covered his rally .\nIn an interview with CNN just ahead of his event , he said Fox News called him , apologized and asked him to reconsider and appear at the debate . He wouldn \u2019 t say who apologized but that he might have considered it if he hadn \u2019 t already organized his veterans fundraiser .\nHe also said voters will reward him for his bold decision to refuse to debate .\nA huge crowd showed up for the event , with Trump fans streaming in from out of state , leaving a line stretching for blocks to enter the Sheslow Auditorium . The crowd easily exceeded the seating capacity of the auditorium , and the Trump campaign prepared to accommodate the overflow with a screen to telecast the event outside .\nThe competing events came as the polling in Iowa was shifting and Mr. Trump was back on top , taking the lead from Mr. Cruz , who is in second place .\nCarl Raue , 43 , a retired Air Force technical sergeant , drove about 2\u00bd hours from his home in North Omaha , Nebraska , and said he didn \u2019 t feel that Mr. Trump was exploiting veterans as some veterans groups have charged .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s what we have here , \u201d he said . \u201c He knows veterans have been screwed over for a while now . \u201d\nHe also sided with Mr. Trump in the showdown with Fox News .\n\u201c I would probably have done the same thing , \u201d said Mr. Raue , who got into the event in an expedited line for veterans .\nThe events competed for attention as polling in Iowa was shifting and Mr. Trump was back on top , having taking the lead from Mr. Cruz , who is in second place .

Rick Santorum , the winner of the caucuses in 2012 , as he pleaded with Iowans to upset the prognosticators and deliver him another win .\nBusinesswoman Carly Fiorina at one point blasted moderator Martha MacCallum for asking Mr. Santorum why he missed last week \u2019 s pro-life March for Life in Washington . Mr. Santorum said he has marched for two decades , but this year stayed in Iowa to campaign , afraid he otherwise would have been trapped in Washington by a snowstorm \u2014 and Mrs. Fiorina told Ms. MacCallum that the question itself was unfair .\n\u201c It is outrageous , frankly , that Fox News , and you , would question the pro-life credentials of Rick Santorum . That is outrageous , \u201d Mrs. Fiorina said .\nMr. Santorum and former Arkansas Gov .
