The theme of this year \u2019 s march is \u201c Love Saves Lives . \u201d\nIn the future , love is likely to get a helping hand from science and technology to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court \u2019 s 1973 Roe v.

The ruling struck down laws banning abortion across the nation .\nThere have been enormous advances in science and technology in the last 45 years since the Supreme Court ruling .

The impact can be measure in opinion polls .\nAn annual poll released Wednesday by The Knights of Columbus and Marist on Americans \u2019 abortion views found that 63 percent of Americans now strongly support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy , up from 59 percent just a year ago . The number of Democrats who support the same ban has increased to 56 percent from 49 percent in January 2017 . Also noteworthy is that 61 percent of Democrats want significant restrictions on abortion .\nThe poll also found that 62 percent of Americans said they believe life begins within the first three months of a woman \u2019 s pregnancy . Among those who believe life begins at conception , 46 percent said they believe so because it is \u201c a biological and scientific fact , \u201d versus 45 percent who said they believe it based on \u201c a philosophical or religious belief . \u201d\nIn a survey conducted by the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates ( NIFLA ) , a network of pro-life pregnancy centers , reported confirming 75,318 pregnancies through ultrasound technology in 2013 on patients identified as either seriously considering an abortion or open to getting an abortion . Of those , 78 percent \u2013 or 58,634 \u2013 chose to carry their baby to term after seeing an ultrasound image of their child in the womb .\nThe list of advances in science and technology dealing with pregnancy and unborn children is since the Roe v.
