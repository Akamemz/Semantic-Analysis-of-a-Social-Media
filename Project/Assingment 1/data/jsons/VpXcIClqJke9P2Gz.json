Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey .\nToday \u2019 s resurgent Blue Dogs say they \u2019 re sticking to the original vision of providing an alternative to the party \u2019 s liberal wing . But they \u2019 re decidedly not the Blue Dogs of old . Many push back against being labeled conservative , or even moderate . Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy , one of the group \u2019 s co-chairs , prefers \u201c pragmatic Democrats. \u201d And their current membership reflects how much the demographic and geographic profiles of the Democratic Party have changed \u2013 and how much the political center has shifted .\nThat changed after this last midterm . The so-called \u201c blue wave \u201d brought to Congress 42 Democrats who had flipped their districts \u2013 and brought the Blue Dogs back up to 27 , enough to influence legislation , given the Democrats \u2019 18-seat House majority .\nThe congressional Blue Dog coalition was founded nearly a quarter-century ago by conservative Democrats , many from the South , who were focused on fiscal responsibility and national defense . In recent years , as polarization intensified on Capitol Hill , its numbers had dwindled to the point of near-extinction .\nWhen Mikie Sherrill first ran into the congressional Blue Dog coalition in 2018 , she wasn \u2019 t sure it would be the place for her .\nShe knew the caucus focused on fiscal and national defense issues , which she \u2013 a Democrat then running for a GOP-held seat in northern New Jersey \u2013 cared deeply about . But she also knew it had been founded by a group of white Democratic congressmen , most from the South , who felt they were being \u201c choked blue \u201d by the party \u2019 s leftward shift . She remembered that the coalition , back in 2009 , had urged changes to the Affordable Care Act that some in the party say watered down President Barack Obama \u2019 s signature bill .\n\u201c I had some pause , \u201d Representative Sherrill says in a phone interview . \u201c I had some concerns about the policies , about the history . \u201d\nWhat won her over was Stephanie Murphy , the Vietnam-born Florida lawmaker who came to Congress in 2017 and now serves as the first woman of color to co-chair the Blue Dogs . The two women connected instantly on the issues . \u201c She was incredibly thoughtful about how to move the economy forward , creating broad coalitions , moving on infrastructure , \u201d Representative Sherrill recalls . They also shared experiences : young kids at home , careers in public service ( the Pentagon for Representative Murphy , the Navy for Representative Sherrill ) , and support for LGBTQ and women \u2019 s rights .\nSuch r\u00e9sum\u00e9s would have been unusual , if not unimaginable , for the original Blue Dogs . Today \u2019 s coalition , however , looks a lot like the rest of the Democratic caucus : less white , less male , and less conservative . Current Blue Dogs hail from red and purple districts across the country , including the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest . And like Representative Sherrill , their newest members campaigned \u2013 and won \u2013 on bread-and-butter issues like health care and infrastructure .\nBlue Dog members say they still stand by the old centrist mantra of fiscal responsibility , a strong national defense , and commonsense solutions to practical problems . But their membership today reflects how much the demographic and geographic profiles of the Democratic Party have changed \u2013 and how much the political center has shifted .\n\u201c It seems so clich\u00e9 , but I can \u2019 t help but think , \u2018 This is not your father \u2019 s Blue Dog committee , \u2019 \u201d says Representative Sherrill . \u201c Those who say it \u2019 s an old , white , Southern caucus \u2013 I tell them they haven \u2019 t seen the Blue Dogs lately . \u201d\nThe Blue Dogs were founded in 1995 , the year after Republicans took control of the House for the first time in four decades . Though the caucus didn \u2019 t officially take positions on social issues , most of its members were Southern Democrats with conservative views on things like abortion and gun control . They focused on fiscal issues , however , and rose to prominence in their early years during budget negotiations . Their bills straddled the line between what Republicans wanted , which was usually tax cuts or reduced spending , and what Democrats called for , which was often more investment in federal programs .\nThe 2009-10 session , with the coalition at 51 members , was a productive legislative term for them : They got Congress to restore Pay-As-You-Go budget rules , which require lawmakers to offset the cost of any increased spending on entitlements by cutting funding for other programs or raising other revenues . They successfully opposed a public option to compete with private insurance companies under what would become the Affordable Care Act . And they sponsored a bill that required federal agencies to report their achievements every fiscal year so that congressional committees had a basis for setting each agency \u2019 s annual budget .\nThe work was rarely easy , or popular . Their role in the public option debate , for instance , drew criticism from the progressive left , which accused them of being DINOs \u2013 \u201c Democrats in name only \u201d \u2013 and using fiscal responsibility as camouflage for their support of corporate interests . \u201c [ They ] seemed to exist to stop Democrats from achieving their objectives , \u201d says Alex Lawson , executive director of Social Security Works , a progressive advocacy firm .\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call/AP/File Then-freshman Rep. Stephanie Murphy , D-Fla. ( center ) smiles at a meeting of the Bipartisan Working Group on Capitol Hill , July 12 , 2017 . Representative Murphy \u2013 who fled communist Vietnam with her family in 1979 \u2013 is one of the new co-chairs of the Blue Dog coalition .\n\u201c Blue Dogs are in the middle of the road all right \u2013 but only in the sense that a dog hugging the center stripe amid whizzing 18-wheelers is in the middle of the road , \u201d Dennis Farney wrote for The Wall Street Journal back in 1997 . \u201c In today \u2019 s Congress the center may be the most dangerous and discouraging place of all . \u201d\nOver the years , as party lines deepened and conservative Democrats either retired , were challenged in the primaries , or defected to the GOP , the coalition \u2013 like centrists in general \u2013 dwindled . In the wake of the tea party takeover , Blue Dogs were down to just 15 members .\nThe situation began to turn after this last midterm . The so-called \u201c blue wave \u201d that brought to Congress the most diverse class of freshmen in history included 42 Democrats who had flipped their districts . Ten , including Representative Sherrill , became Blue Dogs , bringing the coalition \u2019 s numbers up to 27 \u2013 enough to influence legislation , given the Democrats \u2019 18-seat House majority .\n\u201c When they have a sizable number , like they do now , their votes are needed , \u201d says Jennifer Walsh , a public affairs director for the D.C. law firm Foley and Lardner , and former chief of staff to California Rep. Dennis Cardoza , a Blue Dog who retired in 2012 . \u201c It \u2019 s fun when your votes are needed . People care what you think . \u201d\nThe Blue Dogs began taking advantage of their new numbers right after the election . Representative Murphy was among those who held back her vote for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi until leadership promised a group of moderates that bipartisan bills would have an easier time making it to the floor for votes . ( Some Blue Dogs , like Representatives Sherrill and Ben McAdams of Utah , didn \u2019 t vote for Speaker Pelosi at all . )\nOnce the session started , they made sure that their party \u2019 s agenda-setting H.R . 1 included language around campaign finance and redistricting reform . They took vocal positions on infrastructure and rural broadband . They \u2019 re supporting Representative McAdams \u2019 proposal for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and stalling a $ 15 minimum wage bill until it \u2019 s more amenable to rural areas .\nBlue Dogs say these efforts prove they \u2019 ve stuck to the coalition \u2019 s founding vision of providing an alternative to the party \u2019 s liberal wing . \u201c We \u2019 re still united around the same issues that we \u2019 ve always been united around , and that \u2019 s fiscal responsibility , national security , \u201d Representative Murphy says at a meeting of the coalition \u2019 s co-chairs at her offices on Capitol Hill .\nBut they \u2019 re decidedly not the Blue Dogs of old . Though there \u2019 s still some variety in their social views \u2013 Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois , for instance , is prominently antiabortion \u2013 most members align with their party on issues like reproductive health , gun laws , and immigration . Many push back against being labeled conservative , or even moderate . Representative Murphy would rather they \u2019 re called \u201c pragmatic Democrats , \u201d willing to work with Republicans and progressives alike to move practical legislation forward .\nAnd members say it \u2019 s she \u2013 who fled communist Vietnam with her family in 1979 , and recently penned an op-ed defending capitalism \u2013 who embodies the new narrative that \u2019 s driving the coalition . She \u201c was able to lift herself up and create opportunities for herself and her family , \u201d Representative McAdams says in a phone interview . \u201c Her personal story encapsulates for me a lot of what the Blue Dogs are . \u201d\nSome observers say this shows that the coalition , like the party , is drifting away from the center . The Blue Dogs may have regained some influence after 2018 , but it \u2019 s hard to imagine the trend of polarization reversing itself . \u201c They make a stylistically moderate point , \u201d says Danielle Thomsen , a visiting scholar in politics at Princeton University and author of a book on the political center . But from the policy side , she says , \u201c the actual demands that they \u2019 re trying to make might not differ so much from the party mainstream . \u201d\nProgressives like Mr. Lawson disagree ; he says many Blue Dogs today use socially liberal views to win support from Democratic voters , despite the fact that on economic matters they represent corporate interests . He says the coalition wrongly identifies the political center as a place where Wall Street gets a bigger piece than Main Street . \u201c It \u2019 s \u2018 fiscal responsibility \u2019 that happens to hurt the people , \u201d he says .\nBlue Dogs say they \u2019 re used to skepticism from across the political spectrum . At the meeting with Blue Dog leaders , Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon remembers having to convince former Reps. John Tanner of Tennessee and Allen Boyd of Florida that he was serious about addressing fiscal issues . \u201c Everyone assumed , \u2018 Oregon \u2019 s very deep blue , and therefore you \u2019 re a tax-and-spend liberal Democrat , \u2019 \u201d Representative Schrader says .\nHe says the coalition \u2019 s growing diversity , reflective of both the Democratic Party and the country , shows that more Americans want what they offer than ever before . After most of the other members have left the meeting , rushing off to committee hearings and floor votes , he and freshman co-chair Anthony Brindisi of New York stick around to hammer their point home .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
