One top contender is White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri , who is close to likely campaign chairman John Podesta .\nNumerous lessons from Clinton \u2019 s failed 2008 campaign are being baked into the 2016 plan , including a determination to improve relations with the news media \u2014 or , at the very least , to have a \u201c good cop \u201d role to help her get off on a better foot with the journalists who will help shape her image .\nReflecting other lessons learned , the campaign is being planned with more of a \u201c big-tent mentality , \u201d as one adviser put it . And Bill Clinton is being integrated from the start , after feeling isolated from parts of her campaign against Barack Obama .\nOne component of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emerging strategy involves quietly but aggressively courting key endorsers from the left , who could help increase progressives \u2019 comfort level and take the wind out of a potential challenge . Two top targets : Robert Reich , the economist and former labor secretary in her husband \u2019 s administration , and Rep. John Lewis ( D-Ga. ) , the civil rights icon .

Jeb Bush made his surprise Facebook announcement in December that he would \u201c actively explore \u201d a campaign .

Jim Webb of Virginia .\nThe potential opposition is so weak that Clinton might wind up not even debating during the primaries , which many Democrats view as a mixed blessing .\nThe Clinton team knows it can \u2019 t campaign with the swagger of a presumptive nominee because the air of inevitability was so damaging last time around .
