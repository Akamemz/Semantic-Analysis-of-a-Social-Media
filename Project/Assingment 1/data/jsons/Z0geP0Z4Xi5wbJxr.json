She had set off alone from southern Turkey , walked for hours , rode in a sealed truck , boarded an overcrowded raft and slept on the streets and in a jail cell .\nA college English professor before the war , Ezzideen first joined the protests against Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2011 and hoped the popular demonstration could transform her country .\nShe founded the first women 's center in Syria 's northwestern city of Idlib after rebels liberated the surrounding countryside .

When militants threatened to kill her , she fled to Turkey and continued her work .\nBut a few weeks ago her hope ran out that there would be a resolution to the Syrian war anytime soon . So she , like so many others this summer , headed to Europe .\n`` Suddenly , I felt we are doing nothing serious for the people , '' Ezzideen said via Skype from the refugee camp .\nI had interviewed her in southern Turkey just a few weeks earlier , a dynamic activist committed to shaping Syria 's future .
