    "content": "Appearing in an Instagram live chat with soccer star Megan Rapinoe on April 30 , presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden made a spontaneous , vague statement about how he \u2019 s been \u201c speaking to a lot of Republicans , \u201d including \u201c former colleagues , who are calling and saying \u2018 Joe , if you win , we \u2019 re gon na help . \u2019 \u201d\nThen he showed his hand : \u201c Matter of fact , there \u2019 s some major Republicans who are already forming \u2018 Republicans for Biden , \u2019 \u201d the former vice president said . \u201c Major officeholders . \u201d\nThe comment hardly received any attention at the time . But in declaring it , Biden ended up tipping off the earliest stages of a brewing effort that \u2019 s starting to get underway in certain Republican circles behind-the-scenes .\nInterviews with several of the most prominent NeverTrump Republicans reveal that for now , the nascent effort is loosely defined and could ultimately take a variety of forms . But preliminary talks about messaging , engagement , leadership , and rollout are starting to be broadly sketched out , according to sources directly familiar with the matter . And the talks have happened more frequently as Biden moves solidly into general election mode .\n\u201c It is literally just forming , \u201d one former top Republican Party official involved with the preliminary discussions told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I \u2019 ve had several conversations with people who have approached me . It \u2019 s going to take off , it \u2019 s going to happen . The question is to what degree and form it does , \u201d the source , who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about private discussions , said .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t want something like this out on the street before it needs to be , \u201d the GOP source added . \u201c It just makes it much harder to do . \u201d\nThe contours of a developing \u201c Republicans for Biden \u201d movement are indeed fluid , with longtime operatives and former party loyalists mixed on what a final product would look like and when it might come into fruition . The movement behind-the-scenes is in contrast to the very public effort to unite the left , but matches Biden \u2019 s own professed fondness for working with Republicans .\nWhen presented with Biden \u2019 s comments , GOP sources interviewed referenced two main possibilities : an external group that would work on his behalf as a political action committee \u2014 similar to other Democratic-led outside groups \u2014 that could theoretically clear a pathway for others to join ; or an internal operation within Biden \u2019 s campaign , with one or more recognizable Republican figures joining as the public face .\nA second source well-placed in Republican circles \u2014 who has had conversations with senior Biden advisers in recent weeks \u2014 said that any mounting effort would most likely come from within the campaign \u2019 s vast network .\n\u201c My impression is the official one will be part of the campaign , \u201d the Republican source said , referencing the apparent \u201c Republicans for Biden \u201d group Biden mentioned himself .\nAmong the GOP \u2019 s more ardent anti-Trump faction , several names came up in conversation when asked who could theoretically have a role in an outside political entity , which would not be allowed under campaign-finance laws to coordinate with the campaign directly . Those names include former Sen. Jeff Flake ( R-AZ ) , Wisconsin-based political analyst Charlie Sykes , conservative media giant Bill Kristol , former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele , longtime campaign operative Steve Schmidt , former Rep. David Jolly ( R-FL ) , and columnist Mona Charen , among others .\nMeanwhile , one name in particular has been floated as a choice to help give legs to such an effort from the inside : former Republican Ohio Gov . John Kasich . The source who has spoken to top Biden allies about a number of topics said there has been discussion in Bidenworld about Kasich , a leading NeverTrump voice , who joined as a CNN analyst after leaving office in January 2019 .\n\u201c It \u2019 s done , but the reason it \u2019 s not common is there are few people willing to do that , \u201d longtime Democratic campaign strategist Joe Trippi said about the possibility of a Republican joining a Democrat \u2019 s campaign in this capacity , or vice versa . \u201c It \u2019 s not rare on the Biden campaign \u2019 s part . You just don \u2019 t usually have that many prominent people usually willing to cross lines in the middle of a presidential campaign . \u201d\nBut when presented with both options , Trippi said the campaign would most likely want outside and internal GOP help if available . \u201c If you \u2019 re the Biden campaign , you want both those things to happen , \u201d he said . \u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s either or . \u201d\nReached for comment , a spokesperson for the Biden campaign said , in part , \u201c Vice President Biden is running for president to unite our country and rebuild the soul of the nation , and to accomplish that we need to bring together Americans from across the political spectrum to build the broadest possible coalition to defeat Donald Trump . \u201d\n\u201c As we move into the general election , we 're going to continue to ramp up our outreach to Americans of all political stripes\u2014including the many disaffected Republicans who are horrified by Trump \u2019 s historic mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis. \u201d The campaign declined to elaborate on Biden \u2019 s own prior statement about a \u201c Republicans for Biden \u201d group forming .\nSince securing near-instant party unity following his sweeping victory in South Carolina , Biden \u2019 s campaign has been focused on weaving the values of progressive leaders into their emerging platform . After Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) , his final primary opponent and longtime Senate friend , departed from the race and endorsed him last month , the former rivals announced the formation of several task forces as a way to prioritize progressive issues .\n\u201c My impression , more than an impression , is they have been cautious about going ahead with anything official \u2018 Republicans for Biden , \u2019 [ partly because ] they want to make sure the Democrats are all OK first , \u201d said the source who has been in talks with Biden advisers .\nStill , Biden has already been sending less-than-subtle signals to Republicans on his own .\nThroughout much of the primary , the former VP remained the national frontrunner with the explicit message that he can appeal to a broad coalition of individuals needed to beat Trump , often maintaining more moderate policy positions when his opponents tilted leftward . At one juncture in late 2019 , he even floated the possibility of selecting a Republican running mate , an idea he has since backed away from since becoming the party \u2019 s presumptive nominee .\nAs his campaign continues to plow forward toward November , Biden has taken new steps to appeal to Republicans . In late April , he said during a virtual fundraiser that he would consider naming Republicans to his Cabinet under the stipulation that they were \u201c the best qualified person . \u201d\nTo some Republicans , that type of public messaging from Biden , paired with early private discussions , is setting the right groundwork for one or more efforts to take off in earnest on his behalf , albeit at a slower pace in the age of COVID-19 .\n\u201c I know that it \u2019 s happening and it \u2019 s coming together , \u201d Jennifer Horn , a longtime Republican operative and former state party official , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Horn said she was approached several months ago by a national GOP operative about specifically joining a \u201c Republicans for Biden \u201d effort , but hasn \u2019 t been involved directly . Instead , she \u2019 s focused her attention on the Lincoln Project , an anti-Trump super PAC she advises along with George Conway , the husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway , Schmidt , and political operatives John Weaver and Rick Wilson ( a \u2588\u2588\u2588 columnist ) .\nWith less than six months until Election Day , there are already a number of Republicans and ex-Republicans who have stated they intend to vote for Biden . On Tuesday , former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina , who competed against Trump in 2016 , declared that she \u201c can not vote for Donald Trump in 2020 , \u201d while entertaining the possibility of not voting .\nFor Republicans aiming to get a pro-Biden movement off the ground , that potential scenario \u2014 where voters may feel they simply can \u2019 t vote for Trump or Biden \u2014 is a nightmarish thought .\n\u201c It \u2019 s really hard to get people to take that last step , \u201d Horn said . \u201c To publicly say and do something . You need five or 10 people who are all ready to go at the same time . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s also a mounting concern in at least some corners , according to the GOP source who has been in conversations with other Republicans about the possible difficulties , that Biden \u2019 s campaign might not be able to join forces in a seamless way , noting technical and operational difficulties they have had recently .\n\u201c A coalition like this has to be knitted together very carefully because it can very quickly fall apart and everyone is made to look stupid , \u201d the source said . \u201c That \u2019 s the last thing that anyone who gets out on this bandwagon wants to do when they realize that the wheels aren \u2019 t on securely . \u201d\nWhile most Republicans interviewed spoke candidly about the first portion of Biden \u2019 s statement , when asked about the second part \u2014 that \u201c major officeholders \u201d are starting this effort \u2014 no GOP source contacted could present a concrete name . Indeed , most admitted they would be shocked to hear of anyone at the Senate or House level likely to take such a step , but did not rule out the possibility that Biden could be referring to state or local elected officials .\nOthers are less convinced . Former Rep. Joe Walsh ( R-IL ) , who plans to vote for the Democrat in an expected Trump vs. Biden matchup , said \u201c it \u2019 s still a leap , \u201d for a Republican to publicly say they \u2019 re against Trump . \u201c It still takes some balls , and so I don \u2019 t think you \u2019 ll see a huge number of well-known names , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s any freaking way a current elected Republican would ever sign their name on to Republicans for Biden , \u201d Walsh said . \u201c They \u2019 ve demonstrated over the course of the last three years that they \u2019 re just too damn cowardly to do that . \u201d\nThat sense of skepticism was picked up in other conversations .\n\u201c No one wants to end up like Jeff Flake , \u201d Fergus Cullen , a Trump critic and past chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party , said about the former Arizona senator , who retired with an isolated anti-Trump crusade early last year .\nThe sense of resignation shared among some disgruntled Republicans is built , at least partially , on recent history .

Both failed to gain much traction or sway any prominent current GOP office holders to their cause .\n\u201c This is about killing the alligator closest to the boat , \u201d said Rick Tyler , who served as Sen. Ted Cruz \u2019 s ( R-TX ) communications director during his 2016 presidential campaign . \u201c People say how can you support Biden ? The alligator that \u2019 s going to kill us is the closest one , and that \u2019 s Trump , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want Biden to be president . I don \u2019 t want Trump to be president , \u201d he added . \u201c Am I willing to have Biden be president so Trump won \u2019 t be president ? You \u2019 re damn right I am . \u201d",
