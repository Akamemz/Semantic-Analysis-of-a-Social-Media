The administration is desperate to reduce the number of people entering the US without papers to the anomalously low levels of Donald Trump \u2019 s first few months in office \u2014 even if it means asylum seekers face a bevy of human rights concerns while they remain in Mexico , from criminal victimization to concerns about food and shelter .\nThe US could start implementing the new policy in the coming days or weeks , likely starting at ports of entry ( official border crossings ) in San Diego , where thousands of asylum seekers have been waiting on the other side .\nThere \u2019 s a lot we still don \u2019 t know about how this is going to work , either because it hasn \u2019 t actually been worked out yet or because details aren \u2019 t yet public . As it stands , this could be a temporary inconvenience \u2014 or lead to the US essentially creating refugee camps just across the border . Here \u2019 s what we do and don \u2019 t know .\nWhat we know about the US-Mexico asylum deal and the \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy\nThe Washington Post reported that the Trump administration has negotiated a tentative deal with Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador , or AMLO , the incoming president of Mexico , who takes office December 1 . The Washington Post confirmed the tentative deal in an interview with Olga Sanchez Cordero , AMLO \u2019 s incoming interior minister .\nLopez Obrador \u2019 s administration-in-waiting responded to the Post story with a non-denial denial . On Saturday night , a lot of press outlets reported that the Mexicans had denied there was a deal . But the actual statement , issued by Sanchez Cordero \u2019 s office , didn \u2019 t actually deny that the incoming administration is working on a deal with the Trump administration , or even that they have agreed in principle to allow asylum seekers to stay in Mexico and are just working out the details .\nThe statement said that \u201c there is no agreement of any sort between the government-elect of Mexico and the government of the United States , as the next president , Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , will take office on December 1. \u201d In other words , they deny that the incoming government was already making official deals behind the outgoing government \u2019 s back .\nAnd it said that the incoming Mexican government isn \u2019 t considering becoming a \u201c safe third country \u201d for asylum seekers trying to enter the US \u2014 referring to a specific kind of diplomatic agreement that is different from the plan the Post reported on .\nUnder the deal , asylum seekers would have to demonstrate a reasonable fear of remaining in Mexico to be allowed to stay in the United States . The initial screening interview for asylum seekers requires them to show a credible fear of persecution if they \u2019 re deported to their home countries . If they meet that standard , they \u2019 re allowed to stay in the US while their full application for asylum is pending ; if they don \u2019 t ( and they don \u2019 t appeal the decision ) , they \u2019 re deported .\nUnder the agreement , as the Post describes it , asylum seekers who meet the credible fear standard would also be asked about the prospects of staying in Mexico . If they couldn \u2019 t show a reasonable fear ( a higher standard than credible fear ) of staying in Mexico , they \u2019 d still be allowed to apply for asylum in the US , but they \u2019 d wait in Mexico until their case was completed .\nAs a result , in theory , the majority of Central Americans and other asylum seekers who travel through Mexico would be required to stay in Mexico while their asylum cases were pending in the United States . Right now , it can take months , or years , for an asylum seeker who \u2019 s not detained in a US immigration detention center to have her asylum case evaluated . It \u2019 s not clear whether asylum seekers waiting in Mexico would be processed on an expedited schedule , and , if so , whether that wouldn \u2019 t further delay processing for people waiting for asylum in the US .\nKey details of the plan are still being worked out . According to the Post article , \u201c Senior U.S. officials said they want more assurances on how Mexico intends to keep asylum seekers safe and to ensure they don \u2019 t get deported back to Central America before their asylum claims get resolved. \u201d Those are substantial questions , not least because the US is obligated under international law not to send an asylum seeker back to persecution \u2014 even if it is not the country doing the deporting .\nAsylum officers are already being sent to San Diego to prepare for implementing the policy . An email from a senior official at US Citizenship and Immigration Services , sent out late Wednesday , asked for volunteers who might be sent to San Diego \u201c as early as Friday , \u201d though details were scarce . The Post believes the officers are being sent to implement the new policy , as the US will need a lot of asylum officers at ports of entry to conduct the interviews that will ensure they \u2019 re not sending anyone back to danger in Mexico .\nWhat we don \u2019 t know about the US-Mexico asylum deal and the \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy\nWhen the US will start implementing a \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy . L\u00f3pez Obrador takes office on December 1 , so it \u2019 s probable that the US-Mexico agreement will be signed no sooner than that . ( And it could take several more days or even weeks to work out remaining details . )\nBut it \u2019 s not totally clear that the US is going to wait to have a formal agreement . On Wednesday , the Post reported that Trump senior policy adviser and immigration guru Stephen Miller wanted to start implementing a \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy immediately \u2014 even while negotiations with Mexico were ongoing . The Saturday report from the Post doesn \u2019 t clarify whether this possibility is still on the table .\nWhat legal authority the US will use to implement \u201c Remain in Mexico. \u201d There is a provision in US law that allows the US to force applicants for admission to remain in a \u201c contiguous country \u201d while their claims are being processed . But it \u2019 s not clear whether they \u2019 re using this provision for the \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d plan . Because that \u2019 s ambiguous , there are lots of other unresolved questions , including ...\nWhether the policy will apply to people apprehended by Border Patrol after crossing into the US , or whether it will only apply for people presenting themselves legally at official ports of entry to seek asylum . The \u201c contiguous countries \u201d provision applies to both cases . But the Post \u2019 s reporting implies that \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d will only apply at ports .\nOn the one hand , pushing people back to Mexico after they \u2019 ve crossed into the US could run afoul of the statutory US right to seek asylum . On the other hand , allowing people who cross into the US illegally to stay , while barring those who enter legally by presenting themselves at a port of entry , would make it even harder for the Trump administration to argue they \u2019 re trying to encourage asylum seekers to come legally . ( That \u2019 s the argument the White House is currently using to defend the asylum ban in federal court . )\nWhether the US will need to do anything beyond signing an agreement with Mexico to ratify the policy . In theory , if the policy requires the US to do things differently than the current regulations regarding asylum specify , they \u2019 ll have to rewrite those regulations . ( That \u2019 s something the executive branch can do without Congress , as long as it follows proper procedures and doesn \u2019 t contradict the law . )\nThey could propose a regulation that would take effect immediately , as they did with the asylum ban . Such a change would probably be challenged in court ( as the asylum ban was ) but might be on firmer legal ground than the asylum ban .\nHow people will be taken care of while waiting in Mexico . Migrant shelters along the border are already overcrowded , and Tijuana is currently struggling to house 5,000 asylum seekers . Thousands of them have arrived in the past week as part of the fall \u201c caravan , \u201d but others have been waiting for weeks or months to be admitted at the port of entry .\nThe Post says the US doesn \u2019 t appear to be offering any financial support to Mexico to feed , shelter , and care for asylum seekers while they wait . Some business owners in Tijuana have reportedly offered to give jobs to asylum seekers , but it \u2019 s not clear how they \u2019 d be able to work legally in Mexico without seeking legal status there \u2014 and getting legal status in Mexico could make it much harder for them to get asylum in the US .\nHow this will be challenged in court and if it will ultimately be found legal . It is inevitable that advocates will sue to block the \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy . But because so many things about it are still unclear , it \u2019 s not apparent what exactly their basis for a lawsuit will be . The \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy is another legally aggressive step on asylum , an area of law where Congress has pretty clearly spelled out what \u2019 s supposed to happen . On the other hand , the judicial branch tends to extend the executive branch a lot of deference when foreign policy is involved .\nUltimately , the prospects of the Remain in Mexico policy might not be apparent until the policy has already been put in place \u2014 and in the meantime , asylum seekers will be the subjects of a binational experiment .",
