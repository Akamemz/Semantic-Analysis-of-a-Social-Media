    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Friday to House Democrats in an 11th-hour bid to shore up support for his trade agenda ahead of a series of crucial votes .\nIn a rare visit to Capitol Hill , Mr. Obama delivered his closing argument to a Democratic caucus sharply divided over whether to support legislation that would grant the president fast-track authority for a Pacific trade deal\u2014and extend aid to U.S. workers who lose their jobs because of foreign trade .\nThe House was expected to begin voting midday Friday on two contentious measures , with both expected to face razor-thin margins as a week of last-minute negotiations wound down .\nMr. Obama grounded his message in personal experience , telling lawmakers that his actions were aimed at lifting up American workers . But many Democrats remained opposed to the fast-track bill Friday morning , and some said Mr. Obama \u2019 s argument relied on simply trusting him .\n\u201c The president said , \u2018 I know steelworkers in the South Side of Chicago who lost their jobs and everything I do is for them. \u2019 Well , I was born and raised in Detroit and I represent Minneapolis , so I don \u2019 t really think his emotional tie to displaced workers is greater than mine or anybody else \u2019 s , \u201d said Rep. Keith Ellison ( D. , Minn. ) , co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus , who plans to oppose both key trade measures Friday . \u201c I really disagree with him on this more and more . \u201d\nLawmakers said Mr. Obama boiled down his argument to \u201c play it straight \u201d and not use legislative gambits to bring down a complicated package of trade bills\n\u201c He made a very powerful statement . It was about Democrats voting according to their own conscience and doing the right thing , \u201d said Rep. Michael Honda ( D. , Calif. ) , who opposes the trade package .\nPassage of the trade legislation would deliver a rare , second-term political gift from a GOP-controlled Congress to Mr. Obama\u2014who squared off against labor groups in a bruising Democratic battle\u2014as well as to business groups and Republican leaders who put aside their suspicion of the White House to advocate for the trade legislation .\nThe president \u2019 s excursion to Capitol Hill comes after a surprise appearance Thursday night at the congressional baseball game . There , he made a personal pitch to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif . )\nApproval of fast track would give Mr. Obama the power to submit trade deals to Congress for an up-or-down vote , without amendments , as previous presidents have done . Such power would ease passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a near-final deal between the U.S. and 11 other nations around the Pacific Ocean that would cover nearly 40 % of the world economy .\nThe Senate approved trade legislation late last month , but its fate remained in jeopardy in the House as Democrats Thursday night raised late concerns over the bill , which many in the party oppose .\nIn the latest twist , many Democrats were expected to oppose a measure extending a workers \u2019 assistance program long championed by their party . Democrats had balked at a provision in the Senate bill that pays for the program with cuts to Medicare providers .\nIn a deal painstakingly negotiated and refined this week by Mrs. Pelosi and Speaker John Boehner ( R. , Ohio ) , the program , known as Trade Adjustment Assistance , or TAA , would be funded by a different source . But some Democrats still had qualms because the fix would be made through a separate piece of legislation , and they worried the structure of the deal could open them up to political attacks over the Medicare cuts .\nThe House will hold two fast-track votes Friday , one on the portion of the Senate bill that deals with worker aid legislation and\u2014if that passes\u2014one on the part of the bill providing fast-track powers to Mr. Obama . The two issues were split up in a procedural maneuver known as \u201c dividing the question \u201d to allow conservatives opposed to the workers aid to vote against it . The chamber will also vote on altering and passing a customs and enforcement bill already passed by the Senate .\nLawmakers said Mr. Obama entreated them not to sink the workers \u2019 aid program just to derail the fast-track provisions . The workers \u2019 assistance program expires at the end of September and many Democrats worried that this is their best opportunity to extend it .\n\u201c For us as a party to threaten to bring [ TAA ] down and face the risk that we will lose it in its entirety in the future because the other side won \u2019 t bring it up again , we would own that then as a party , \u201d said Rep. Ron Kind ( D. , Wis. ) , chairman of the New Democrat Coalition , a group of more centrist , business-friendly Democrats . \u201c We would have to go home and look into the faces of those workers who aren \u2019 t caught up in all the political squabbles of Washington and wondering why we \u2019 re not there to help them get back on their feet again . \u201d\nBut Democrats who vote for the trade legislation could face political repercussions heading into next year \u2019 s elections .\nJim Dean , chairman of Democracy for America , a progressive political-action committee , warned Democrats against supporting either the workers \u2019 aid program or the fast-track measure .\n\u201c We will not lift a finger or raise a penny to protect you when you \u2019 re attacked in 2016 , we will encourage our progressive allies to join us in leaving you to rot , and we will actively search for opportunities to primary you with a real Democrat , \u201d Mr. Dean said in a statement Friday .\nThe notion of fast-tracking a trade bill has also met with resistance from conservative Republicans , many of them hesitant to help a president they have clashed with over health care , immigration and other issues .\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan ( R. Wis. ) , an influential conservative , has put much of his own political capital on the line as he has sought to build support for the trade legislation .\n\u201c A yes vote would be a huge win for conservatives , free-market principles and American leadership , \u201d Mr. Ryan wrote in an editorial published late Thursday in the Washington Examiner . \u201c Many of the president \u2019 s critics are rightly concerned that he too often keeps Congress in the dark . But [ the fast-track measure ] will turn on the lights . \u201d\nPassage of both measures would send fast-track legislation straight to Mr. Obama \u2019 s desk , ending the uncertain congressional support that is seen as crucial to completing the Pacific trade deal .\nIf fast track becomes law , the trading partners\u2014including Japan and Vietnam\u2014could wrap up the TPP in coming weeks . Still , complicated bureaucratic requirements mean the TPP is unlikely to come to a final up-or-down vote in Congress before the end of the year , and could come well into next year .\nEven if fast track passes , the later fight on the Pacific trade deal could turn out to be longer and more politically divisive if it occurs in the spotlight of the 2016 election cycle , officials and trade experts say .
