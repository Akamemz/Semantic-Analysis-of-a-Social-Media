    "content": "The heightened security surrounding air travel during this Thanksgiving holiday comes months into a federal effort to plug holes in the nation 's aviation safety net \u2014 from revelations about lax screening at TSA checkpoints to criminal charges against airport employees accused of smuggling guns and drugs .\nOne crackdown , which the Department of Homeland Security imposed months before the latest terrorist attacks in Egypt and Paris , includes measures that travelers will notice at U.S. airports this weekend : more pat-downs , more use of metal-detector wands , and more random swabbing of passengers and luggage for trace explosives . But the department says it is stepping up `` unseen '' security measures , too .\nThe Transportation Security Administration has also clamped down on its use of the speedier PreCheck screening process , ending its past practice of routinely waving passengers into the expedited lines at random . The old , laxer system drew criticism from lawmakers and new TSA chief Peter Neffenger after screeners allowed a former domestic terrorist to go through a PreCheck lane last year .\nThe PreCheck restrictions , coupled with an 8 percent increase in passenger volume this year , has led to longer checkpoint lines even before the holidays . And the TSA warned Tuesday that it expects the busiest travel season in agency history this year , saying the days buffering Thanksgiving will see a 40 percent increase above the nearly 2 million travelers it usually screens daily .\nPlenty of concerns about potential gaps in aviation security remain . The TSA is still trying to improve the performance of its screening process , which according to one audit failed to find 96 percent of mock weapons or explosives sent through airport checkpoints . And the security community is taking a closer look at workers who have access to planes , especially for international flights headed to the U.S. , House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul said in an interview .\n\u201c You can have the best technology to screen . But if you have someone corrupted or radicalized or compromised , it \u2019 s hard to stop that , \u201d McCaul said . \u201c They need to vet those employees better at those last points of departure . We \u2019 ve got to stop them from being compromised . \u201d\nThe Texas Republican cited the Oct. 31 crash of a Russian passenger jet over the Sinai peninsula , which intelligence officials believe may have been downed by a bomb placed on board by an airport or airline worker . ISIL has claimed responsibility for the attack , as well as the Nov. 13 gun and bombing assaults that killed 130 people in Paris .\nAlthough no direct commercial flights go to the U.S. from the part of Egypt where the Russian plane took off , DHS responded by ordering more thorough screenings of items placed on U.S.-bound aircraft . Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson , the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee , said Neffenger has also outlined additional security measures DHS is taking in response to the Russian plane disaster , though the congressman cautioned against disclosing them publicly .\nAt the same time , the Obama administration is telling lawmakers not to overreact . In an open letter of sorts to Congress this week , Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson appeared to urge lawmakers not to make wholesale changes to the vetting of refugees , or to a separate program that relaxes visa requirements for citizens of 38 countries . A group of Senate Democrats , joined by Arizona Republican Jeff Flake , plans to introduce a bill after Thanksgiving that would tighten the rules for foreigners eligible for visa-free access to the United States .\n\u201c In light of recent events , there is anxiety across our country , \u201d Johnson wrote . `` I understand that anxiety . But , we must guard against actions that are misdirected and counterproductive . \u201d\nIf Congress wants to help , Johnson suggested , it should fully fund the administration \u2019 s $ 7.3 billion budget request for aviation security . Lawmakers can also support the expansion of pre-clearance agreements that allow U.S. customs officers to vet travelers before they depart foreign airports , he wrote .\nJohnson and other officials say they do n't know of any specific terror threats against flights in the United States , and the U.S. hasn \u2019 t had a close call with an aviation-related terrorist plot since the arrest of the \u201c underwear bomber \u201d on Christmas Day in 2009 . Still , the State Department issued a three-month worldwide alert this week urging Americans to `` exercise vigilance '' while traveling \u2014 citing , among other reasons , the downing of the Russian passenger jet and extremist threats to \u201c large sporting events , theatres , open markets and aviation services . \u201d\n\u201c Terrorists want to get the most eyeballs , \u201d said Stuart Gottlieb , a counterterrorism expert who formerly served as a foreign policy adviser to Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) and is now an international affairs professor at Columbia University . \u201c Where more do you get that than travel ? \u201d\nForeign air hubs aren \u2019 t the only security worry . Over the last year , security screeners and airport employees from several U.S. cities have been arrested on charges of helping smuggle guns and drugs aboard planes .\nThree screeners at San Francisco International were charged this month with assisting drug smugglers in getting cocaine past airport checkpoints . Federal agents announced in July that they had uncovered a similar operation at Dallas-Fort Worth International that involved the shipment of heroin , cocaine and methamphetamine . In May , prosecutors divulged that baggage handlers at Oakland International had been accused of sneaking marijuana through security checkpoints . And the feds charged in December that four men had exploited special airline worker access to run a massive gun-smuggling operation between Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International and John F. Kennedy International .\n\u201c The threat is real from both a screening standpoint and the employee standpoint at airports , \u201d Rep. John Katko ( R-N.Y. ) said during a House Homeland Security subcommittee hearing this month . \u201c It \u2019 s a systemic problem that we must deal with head on , or it will only be a matter of time before we hear a story about a screener or aviation worker in the United States intentionally allowing explosives or weapons to pass through security checkpoints . \u201d\nThe TSA has , in fact , increased its vetting of aviation workers over the past year , announcing in April that those employees must submit to fingerprint-based criminal history checks every two years . The agency is also requiring airports to reduce employees \u2019 access to sensitive areas to an \u201c operational minimum \u201d and making airline employees go through regular TSA screening when they travel as passengers .\nBut the DHS \u2019 inspector general reported over the summer that the TSA had still failed to identify at least 73 people employed in the airline industry who had been flagged as potentially having terrorist ties . The inspector general also told lawmakers that agencies like the FBI treat the TSA \u201c as if they were a Wal-Mart \u201d when granting priority access to criminal histories of employees .\nAnother worry : lax security surrounding airport grounds . An Associated Press analysis last spring showed that people had committed at least 268 perimeter breaches at the nation \u2019 s 30 busiest airports since the beginning of 2004 . At California \u2019 s San Jose International alone , at least four trespassing incidents occurred after a teenager jumped the airport \u2019 s fence last year and made it to Hawaii in a plane \u2019 s wheel well . One woman made it through security and onto a plane without a boarding pass , while three other people were found wandering around the tarmac , airfield and loading area .\nTwo months after that report came the leak of the IG \u2019 s audit detailing the TSA \u2019 s failure to detect fake bombs and weapons during 67 of 70 covert tests . Lawmakers who have read the classified report have told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the testing uncovered major weaknesses in both the body scanners used at airport checkpoints and the capabilities of the screening workers themselves .\nNo matter how good the TSA gets at keeping dangerous people out of airport terminals , security checkpoints are likely to remain an attractive target for one-off attackers looking to draw blood and make headlines . Those include a man who attacked TSA officers in New Orleans in March while carrying a bag of Molotov cocktails , as well as the gunman who killed a TSA officer and injured several others during a shooting spree at Los Angeles International in 2013 .\nIn response to TSA \u2019 s pitiful results in the security audit , Johnson ordered the increase in pat-downs and other tightened security measures last summer . DHS officials say they \u2019 re also working with the manufacturer of the body-scanning machines to make the technology better and sending TSA officers to \u201c back-to-basics \u201d training . In addition , travelers who haven \u2019 t gone through PreCheck \u2019 s vetting process will no longer be corralled into the expedited lines unless bomb-sniffing dogs are on duty .\nSeparately , the TSA is warning passengers of the havoc they can create by shirking screening rules . It notes that the dozens of travelers who take guns to airport checkpoints each week cause temporary lane closures , and even those who tote water bottles cause minor delays .\nThe TSA has performed abysmally during cover tests with fake explosives . | Getty\nBecause the agency usually finds more than 100 inert or replica grenades each year in carry-on and checked baggage , the TSA also mentioned in its holiday bulletin this week that fake explosives cause extended lane closures and sometimes shut down a whole checkpoint . In Miami this month , 50 flights were delayed for several hours after a suspicious bag slipped through without a second check . Armed police stormed a plane , only to discover that the bag \u2019 s contents were safe .\nMeanwhile , lawmakers of both parties want to tighten visa requirements for people entering the United States . Under the bill expected after Thanksgiving , travelers who have been to Syria or Iraq in the last five years could no longer use the Visa Waiver program , which lets citizens of 38 partner countries visit the U.S. for up to three months without applying for visas . Travelers would also have to submit additional information such as fingerprints and photographs before arriving in the United States .\nSupporters of the bill note that at least three of the terrorists who committed this month \u2019 s assault in Paris were citizens of France , one of the partner nations . The Senate Intelligence Committee \u2019 s top Democrat , California Sen. Dianne Feinstein , said the Visa Waiver program is important to business and tourism but is also \u201c the soft underbelly of our national security policies . \u201d\nDHS took steps of its own to bolster the program in August , including by ordering the partner nations to use electronic passports for all U.S.-bound travelers and to allow more U.S. federal air marshals on flights heading to the United States .
