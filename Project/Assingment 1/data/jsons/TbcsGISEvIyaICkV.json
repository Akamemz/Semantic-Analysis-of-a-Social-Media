The most obvious failure was on display last week when Mr. Obama canceled a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin and likened his adversary to a slouching , bored child after Russia granted asylum to fugitive National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden .\nBut the inability of the Obama administration to capture Mr. Snowden is only the latest in a string of unresolved foreign policy challenges since Mr. Obama won re-election . Some specialists in foreign affairs say it \u2019 s symptomatic of a president who isn \u2019 t devoting much time to hot spots overseas .\n\u201c He \u2019 s one of only 17 presidents elected to a second term , and he \u2019 s clearly trying to figure out where he wants to put the majority of his time , \u201d said Aaron David Miller , a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington . \u201c He \u2019 s much more focused on the middle class than he is on the Middle East . \u201d\nIn April , the White House revealed reports of chemical weapons use in Syria \u2019 s civil war , which Mr. Obama deemed a \u201c game-changer. \u201d Four months later , the civil war rages on , with fresh reports this week that an al Qaeda affiliate is infiltrating Syrian territory that was seized by rebel groups .\nIn Egypt , the military in early July ousted President Mohammed Morsi , who was elected after Mr. Obama encouraged democratic reforms in that country . Mr. Obama had major disagreements with Mr. Morsi , but the military \u2019 s action left the White House in the awkward public position of denying that it met the legal definition of a \u201c coup . \u201d\nEuropean allies such as Germany and France have blistered Mr. Obama with criticism over surveillance programs revealed by Mr. Snowden . At a Group of Eight summit in June in Northern Ireland , the news was Mr. Putin \u2019 s refusal to sign a communique calling for the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad , another setback for Mr. Obama .\nA summit between Mr. Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in June was overshadowed by the breaking news of Mr. Snowden \u2019 s revelations and by the Chinese leader \u2019 s ability to turn the tables on Mr. Obama and claim that China was a \u201c victim \u201d of U.S. cyberattacks .\nAs the summer progresses , Mr. Obama has parsed earlier statements that the U.S. has \u201c decimated \u201d al Qaeda . The administration closed 20 diplomatic facilities overseas because of threatened attacks by al Qaeda and its affiliates .\nJames Jay Carafano , an analyst on national security and foreign affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation , said Mr. Obama \u2019 s second-term problems internationally can be traced to the terrorist attack in September that killed four Americans , including Ambassador J.

Where we have differences , we \u2019 re going to say so clearly .
