    "content": "Perhaps there is no better window on the awfulness of the self-appointed New York-to-DC ruling class than MSNBC \u2019 s Morning Joe . The show revolves around a collection of chattering-class bores who devote the start of their day to seconding each other \u2019 s shallow and smug criticisms of Trump . The women make faces ; the men roll their eyes .\nCo-host Mika Brzezinski is a feminist who lectures other women on the need to show firmness in a man \u2019 s world . Yet she spends most of the show acting like a prim , entitled Victorian-era dingbat on a fainting couch . She grips her chair for balance while she makes faux-terrified faces , then turns to \u201c Joe \u201d for guidance on how to address this or that Trump \u201c outrage. \u201d \u201c Joe \u201d is the vainglorious former Congressman Joe Scarborough . The two are engaged , but one suspects the relationship won \u2019 t last Trump \u2019 s two terms .\nScarborough resembles a beady-eyed frat boy whom one can more easily imagine bellowing over a keg than cracking open a serious book . Yet he casts himself as Trump \u2019 s moral and intellectual better .

The ratings for the show are wan , but from the self-importance of its participants , one would think that they occupy the commanding heights of politics . They imply that poor \u201c Donald \u201d lacks their understanding of the American people and so forth . They see themselves as the cool kids of American politics , whose mission it is to identify the misfits in the cafeteria .

It is sufficient for the mean girls to point and laugh . While pretending to want more depth from the Trump administration , Joe and Mika attack anyone from it , such as Stephen Miller , who provides some . Earlier in the year , after Miller appeared on TV to make serious points about Trump \u2019 s travel ban , Joe and Mika pounced , denouncing him for such high crimes as \u201c looking bad \u201d on TV and daring to participate in presidential politics in his mere thirties .\n\u201c Young , little Miller , \u201d sputtered Scarborough , claiming ludicrously that Miller hadn \u2019 t read the founding documents of the country . \u201c Andrew Jackson \u2014 you go into your president \u2019 s office ; you know , that one \u2014 and you look on the walls , and there are all these pictures of Andrew Jackson and books of Andrew Jackson .
