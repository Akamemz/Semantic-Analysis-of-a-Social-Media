    "content": "How is it possible that Hillary Clinton escaped criminal indictment for mishandling classified documents despite incriminating evidence that she violated the Espionage Act ?\nWhy did Donald Trump become the target of a criminal investigation for allegedly conspiring with Russia to influence the presidential election despite no evidence that he ever did so ?\nThe answer , it seems , comes down to one person who played a vital role in both cases : Peter Strzok , deputy director of counterintelligence at the FBI .\nStrzok was exchanging politically charged texts with an FBI lawyer that denigrated Trump and lauded Clinton at the same time he was leading the bureau \u2019 s criminal investigation of Clinton . He is also the one who changed the critical wording of then-FBI Director James Comey \u2019 s description of Clinton \u2019 s handling of classified material that resulted in no charges being brought against her .\nThen , Strzok reportedly signed the document launching the 2016 investigation into Russia \u2019 s meddling in the election and whether the Trump campaign played any role . After leading the FBI \u2019 s probe into Trump , he then joined Robert Mueller \u2019 s special counsel team as an integral investigator .\nThus , it appears that one man with a strident political agenda accomplished his twin goals of clearing Clinton and accusing Trump , evidence be damned .\nThe Department of Justice inspector general , Michael Horowitz , discovered the electronic texts Strzok exchanged with his lover , FBI lawyer Lisa Page . The messages were so politically incendiary and so threatened the integrity of Mueller \u2019 s investigation that Strzok was quietly canned over the summer from the special counsel team , where he was a pivotal participant .\nDid Mueller or anyone else notify Congress that both the Trump investigation -- and the Clinton case before it -- were corrupted ? Of course not . This was covered up . Mueller surely knew that if the truth were revealed , it would further discredit a Trump-Russia probe that had already taken on the stench of dead fish .\nThe House Intelligence Committee could smell it and knew something was amiss . It demanded answers . But the Justice Department and the FBI refused to respond or otherwise produce relevant documents that the committee subpoenaed . They are still stonewalling many of Congress \u2019 s valid requests and should now face contempt charges .\nImportantly , all of the anti-Trump and pro-Clinton messages should be made public . Americans should decide for themselves whether our system of justice has been compromised by unscrupulous influences .\nJust how rife with political prejudice and corrupt motives is the special counsel \u2019 s investigation ?\nInstead of choosing prosecutors who could be neutral , fair and objective , Mueller stacked his staff with D emocratic donors . Apparently , he conducted little or no vetting of both prosecutors and investigators . How else does one explain the presence of Strzok and Lisa Page on the investigative team ?\nIt appears that Mueller selected people of a particular political persuasion without discerning review or scrutiny . We were supposed to simply trust Mueller \u2019 s judgment , notwithstanding his own disqualifying conflict of interest under the special counsel statute that demanded his recusal .\nThe Trump-Russia investigation is now awash in illegitimacy . Mueller and those who work for him have squandered all credibility . It is imperative that the special counsel be dismissed , the current staff fired , and a new counsel appointed to re-evaluate the evidence objectively .\nEvery member of Mueller \u2019 s hand-picked staff must now be examined . The special counsel has proven he can not be trusted with his assembled team of partisans .\nDo not expect Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to make these changes . He , too , should be removed in his capacity as Mueller \u2019 s supervisor . As both a witness and prosecutor , Rosenstein has his own conspicuous and disabling conflict of interest . Yet he has refused to step aside . Attorney General Jeff Sessions is duty-bound to remove both Mueller and Rosenstein .\nGiven what we know about the composition of the special counsel team , there may well be others who harbor a blatant political bias and have expressed their animus toward Trump in emails or texts .
