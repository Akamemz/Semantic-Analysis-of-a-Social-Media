Questions swirled about who could tame the rambunctious House GOP conference and whether it was even capable of governing .\nBut a few weeks later , Congress wrapped up the year by easily passing a $ 1.8 trillion funding bill that avoids a shutdown and extends dozens of popular tax breaks , a big win for GOP lawmakers who leave Washington for the holidays feeling united and energized for 2016 .\nFor Rep. Paul Ryan , who catapulted from committee chairman to speaker of the House in just seven weeks to replace Boehner , the vote capped off the year with a major legislative victory .\nSitting in his Capitol office talking to reporters after the vote , the new speaker exuded an air of calm confidence , not seeming to be fazed by the whirlwind of the last few weeks .\nHouse Republicans say the Ryan era already feels different because he has taken on the role of national spokesman , and they feel he 's done an effective job articulating the GOP agenda .
