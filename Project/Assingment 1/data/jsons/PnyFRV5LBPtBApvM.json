But with some Republican leaders in open revolt against Cruz as he has surged in Iowa , Trump is pivoting to an argument that he is more electable than Cruz -- suggesting that Cruz 's abrasive personality makes him unfit for the presidency .\nThe Texas senator 's image as a strident party pariah , Trump said in Nevada Thursday , would cripple his ability to `` make deals '' and govern effectively . Noting that not a single one of Cruz 's Senate colleagues has endorsed him , Trump questioned not only whether Cruz could negotiate with members of Congress , but whether he is capable of relating to people at the most basic level .\n`` It 's one thing to be like a very tough guy -- we 're all tough people -- but you 've got to be able to get along a little bit with people .
