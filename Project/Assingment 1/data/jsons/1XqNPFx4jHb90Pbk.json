Thousands of cheering , flag-waving drivers cruised around Pennsylvania . Some demonstrations feature Trump campaign flags , but homemade signs \u2013 such as one in Tennessee that encouraged Americans to `` fear your government , '' not the coronavirus \u2013 are more prevalent .\nFact check : Trump claims coronavirus tests are widely available . They are not\nSuspend immigration : Trump 's vow to halt immigration puts industries on edge\nThey have continued even as some states tentatively began reopening businesses and easing distancing guidelines . More than 46,000 Americans have died from the disease , according to Johns Hopkins University . Trump encouraged states with fewer cases and deaths to begin bringing their economies back online .\nWisconsin had more than 4,800 confirmed cases of the virus by Wednesday and had recorded 246 deaths , according to the state health department .\nElmer said she started organizing a protest for Friday after hearing from friends who were struggling , not because they are sick but because they are running out of money . Friday was the day that Gov . Tony Evers ' social distancing restrictions were initially set to lift .\n`` I was listening to all these concerns , and I was sick of not doing anything about it , '' she said . `` There are people suffering on both sides of this . ''\nMuch like the tea party movement that sprang up a decade ago , the coronavirus protests are a cultural eddy of conservative ideologies , from gun rights advocates to religious groups . Though many organizers insist the `` gridlock '' events and protests are nonpartisan , many have taken on the flavor of Trump rallies \u2013 including a smattering of campaign signs and the president 's trademark red `` MAGA '' caps .\nThe events underscore how efforts to contain the virus have divided millions of Americans along familiar political battle lines .\nNearly 60 % of the nation \u2019 s voters say they are more concerned about additional deaths from the virus than they are about the economic impact , according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll this week . That sentiment is more prevalent among Democrats than Republicans . GOP respondents are divided \u2013 almost half are more concerned with the economy .\nAlvin Tillery , a political scientist at Northwestern University , sees the protests \u2013 and Trump \u2019 s exhortations \u2013 as an attempt to rally his base when he has faced intense criticism from Democrats for his early handling of the crisis .\n\u201c It \u2019 s directed toward the blue states . It \u2019 s meant to distract from Mr. Trump \u2019 s incredibly poor performance in managing the crisis , \u201d Tillery said . \u201c It distracts but also gives them an issue that activates their desire to vote against the Democrats . \u201d\nTrump has encouraged the groups , including from the podium of the White House briefing room . Friday , in a series of tweets , he suggested it was time to `` liberate '' Michigan , Minnesota and Virginia . He has been less clear about what he 'd like those states to do , and he has batted away questions about whether the protesters flout social distancing guidelines he and his aides promoted .\nLiberate : Trump seeks to 'liberate ' states as protesters demand easing of orders\nThe first item in those guidelines is to `` listen and follow '' directions from authorities . The guidance goes on to encourage Americans to work from home , cancel unnecessary travel and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people .\n`` Look , people \u2013 they want to get back to work , they got to make a living , '' Trump said late Tuesday . `` They have to take care of their family . ''\nGeorgia : Trump says he disagrees with Georgia Gov . Brian Kemp 's reopening plan\nTrump took a different approach a day later , saying he disagreed `` strongly '' with Georgia Gov . Brian Kemp 's decision to move toward reopening parts of that state 's economy . Kemp , a Republican and Trump ally , is pushing to reopen gyms , barber shops and other businesses as soon as Friday .\nTrump said Wednesday he thought it was `` just too soon . ''\nElmer stressed that she took no money or help from outside interests , but she 's aware that a group called Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine plans an event Friday at the same place and at roughly the same time as the rally she organized . That entity is associated with a national gun rights group .\n`` Cool \u2013 if they \u2019 re supporting our mission , which is reopening Wisconsin , \u201d she said .\nSimilarly , organizers reached by \u2588\u2588\u2588 in Virginia , Tennessee , Indiana and several other states denied working with national groups but said they were inspired by protests elsewhere . Some tapped into guns rights or tea party organizations to help spread the word but claimed no formal affiliation with wider networks .\nThere is some overlap : In addition to Wisconsin , rallies in Pennsylvania , Ohio and Minnesota were promoted by Facebook pages started by brothers \u2013 Chris , Ben and Aaron Dorr \u2013 who have a network of gun advocacy organizations in multiple states .\nPennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine , which was launched by the Pennsylvania Firearms Association and led by Chris Dorr , was among a trio of groups that helped organize Monday \u2019 s rally in Harrisburg .\n`` A government that is powerful enough to make unilateral decisions that close down the means of production , well , they \u2019 re also then able , in a future school shooting or another Pittsburgh shooting , to reinvoke that same power and say we \u2019 re going to ban constitutional freedoms to bear arms , \u201d said Dorr , the firearms association \u2019 s director .\n\u201c These Facebook groups , they are completely free , '' Dorr said . `` All I did was start the page and then invited about 10 or 15 friends into it , and it spiraled out of control from there .

''\nSeveral national groups that fueled the tea party movement during President Barack Obama 's administration said they are helping but not leading the groups . Many of the same charges about `` AstroTurf '' organizing were leveled against that movement , which sprang up partly in response to the Affordable Care Act .\n`` There is no central person organizing everything , '' said Adam Brandon , president of FreedomWorks , a conservative group that focuses on economic issues .\nBrandon said 25,000 people took his group 's `` grassroots training program , '' and many of them work with groups to stage the demonstrations . The training includes coaching organizers on how to promote their events , such as through writing news releases and contacting reporters .\nJenny Beth Martin , co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots , said the real organizers are `` people who are fed up . ''\nMartin described the events as an organic movement that relies on social media . National groups such as hers , she said , blast out announcements posted to social media by local organizers to help spread the word .\n`` We want to make sure our supporters are aware events are happening , '' Martin said .\n`` It \u2019 s nonsense , '' said Robert Hall , a longtime conservative figure in Indiana who helped promote a protest in Indianapolis . `` It \u2019 s all grassroots . ''\nStephen Moore , an outside economic adviser to Trump , applauded the events but said he declined invitations to speak at them because he does n't want organizers to be seen as swayed by national interests . Moore cautioned protesters against wearing MAGA hats and other Trump merchandise , arguing it could turn off some supporters .\n`` It really has been a spontaneous combustion , '' he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn some cases , the organization of the protests borders on chaotic .\nTeo De Las Heras created a `` ReOpen PA '' Facebook page last week after spotting a similar effort in North Carolina . The tech company employee from Langhorne , Pennsylvania , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the page quickly grew to more than 60,000 members . Within days , other members of the group organized a protest he attended but did n't help to stage .\n\u201c We \u2019 re basically a grassroots thing right now , \u201d said De Las Heras , a registered Republican , who said he abstained from voting in the 2016 election . `` All the admin and moderators are basically just small-business owners and people impacted by this . ''\nHe said an individual reached out to him about having a conversation about `` some kind of national organization , '' but he did n't know the specifics nor the person 's group . `` They 're contacting all the different influencers out there on social media , '' De Las Heras said . He agreed to talk , but the meeting was canceled .\nDe Las Heras said his Facebook group was initially filled with people looking to impeach Gov . Tom Wolf , a Democrat , but he \u2019 s sought to keep it focused on the economy .\nKeeping protesters on message \u2013 and avoiding an association with some of the hate speech that has cropped up \u2013 has been a challenge for organizers . Some protesters have reportedly flashed anti-Semitic signs . Organizers have rebuked that behavior , which has been rare , and said it distracts from the intended message .\nIn Virginia , David Britt , a spokesman for the Reopen Virginia \u201c gridlock \u201d rally , said the support keeps getting `` exponentially bigger '' since the event was organized last Thursday .
