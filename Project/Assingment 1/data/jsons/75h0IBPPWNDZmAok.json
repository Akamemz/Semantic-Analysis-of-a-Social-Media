Not only did the former president make his wife \u2019 s candidacy possible , but he can be a better communicator than perhaps any politician in the business today \u2013 at least when he \u2019 s on his game , something he has rarely been this cycle .\nThere have been some real low spots for Bill , including his dazed expression standing behind his wife during a concession speech in New Hampshire or several pretty potent gaffes including a claim at a Memphis campaign rally that : \u201c We are all mixed-race people . \u201d\nRunning through it all is the sense that the gaunt-looking , reedy-voiced 69-year-old has simply lost his mojo .\nDespite hyperventilation on the left for his sin of daring to contradict Black Lives Matter activists , it was a bravura performance \u2013 Bubba at his best . While the former president has a penchant for losing his temper in such situations , he kept his cool and controlled the moment .\n\u201c I do n't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children , \u201d Clinton told the protesters in defense of the tougher drug laws of his era , \u201c Maybe you thought they were good citizens \u2014 she did n't . \u201d\n\u201c You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter , \u201d he added . \u201c Tell the truth ! \u201d\nIt was powerful and more than a little reminiscent of his 1992 speech condemning rapper Sister Souljah and others for violent lyrics . And for Hillary and her campaign , it was something that needed to be said .\nIf she accepts the premise that the laws she and her husband supported were inherently racist in order to appease activists what would she have left to say to the broader universe of black voters on whom she depends both now and in the general election ?\nAnd speaking of the general election , being tough on crime is a plus , not a minus with voters in all demographic categories .\nWhether Bill is back or this was just a flash of the old brilliance , it was the kind of performance that might make up for the damage he \u2019 s done elsewhere .\nObama faces Mr. Sunday - President Obama sits down for his first-ever exclusive interview as president with \u201c Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace \u201d at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m .
