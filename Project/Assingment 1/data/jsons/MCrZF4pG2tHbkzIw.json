    "content": "President Obama 's Oval Office address Sunday night pointed to a shift in America 's fight against terrorism that could require , as much as bombs and bullets , a more fundamental attack on the idea of terrorism at home .\nResponding to the mass killing last week in San Bernardino , Calif. , by a radicalized Muslim couple that reportedly pledged their allegiance to the Islamic State , Mr. Obama said : `` The terrorist threat has evolved into a new phase . ''\nThe Islamic State is not Al Qaeda , nor at this point does it appear to pose a 9/11-style threat to the United States . Its threat is not in planning attacks on American soil , but in exhorting anyone to do it for them through its hateful , social-media fueled rantings .\nThis new strain of `` lone wolf '' terrorism suggests that , beyond military action abroad , fighting the Islamic State also means engaging it on social media and in homes to disarm the very idea of terrorism .\nThe Islamic State is `` not looking to direct attacks at all , '' said Michael Leiter , a former senior counterterrorism official in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations , to the Los Angeles Times . `` [ T ] heir direction is to inspire . ''\nOne way to stem this inspiration is to destroy the group at the source , and Obama said a combination of airstrikes , special forces on the ground , and cooperation with local fighters would `` achieve a more sustainable victory . ''\nKurdish forces supported by the West have shown success against the Islamic State . But the Kurds are distrusted by many of the major players in the region , and so are not seen as a final solution .\nSunni governments from Turkey to Saudi Arabia , meanwhile , are more concerned with toppling the Iran-backed president of Syria , Bashar al-Assad , than with the Islamic State . Indeed , many Sunni governments see the Islamic State as a useful weapon in their region-wide power struggle with Shiite Iran . These countries have proven unreliable partners in the war against the Islamic State .\nThe West could increase military action on its own , and France has been pushing for this since the Paris attacks last month . But it 's unclear what would be effective , short of a second Iraq-surge-style Sunni Awakening , with the tens of thousands of ground troops that would require .\nEven on the American homefront , experts note that the Islamic State has become savvier . By using the Internet to inspire more than direct , there is less of an online trail for law enforcement to detect . That limits the Islamic State 's ability to carry out a coordinated attack \u2013 as in France \u2013 but allows lone wolves to carry out San Bernardino-style assaults .\n`` There are no direct communications or orders that you can intercept to realize that there 's a plot going on , '' said Bruce Hoffman , a terrorism expert at Georgetown University , to the Times . `` There 's an absence of red flags . ''\nThis dawning realization is forcing the Obama administrations to consider `` a whole new approach '' to the domestic terror threat , Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told The New York Times Saturday .\nTo some , this is precisely what is needed .
