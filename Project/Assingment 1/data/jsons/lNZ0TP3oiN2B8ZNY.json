    "content": "Dan Pfeiffer , who left his position as senior adviser at the White House last week after having worked with Barack Obama since his first presidential campaign , has been involved from the outset in navigating the central contradiction at the heart of Obama \u2019 s public persona : He ran as a figure who could overcome partisan polarization , yet he has instead presided over more of it despite accomplishing the majority of the substantive agenda he promised .\nObama and his spokespeople have spent most of their administration quietly at war with the conventional wisdom in Washington over the cause of this failure , and Pfeiffer has spent much of his time in the administration dealing with , or scolding , members of the media , mostly in off-the-record conversations . But in an interview last week , a few days before he resigned , he explained in unusually candid terms the administration \u2019 s thinking\u2014and how the White House lost its illusions .\n\u201c I think [ Obama ] believes , and I certainly believe , that while we can always do better , this is a case where structural forces are the large actor here , \u201d he told me . Pfeiffer cited three of them . The first is rising polarization\u2014 \u201c the great sorting , \u201d as he called it\u2014which , over a period of decades , has driven white conservatives out of the Democratic Party and moderates out of the Republican Party , creating two ideologically homogeneous political organizations . The second is the disintegration of restrictions on campaign finance , which \u201c gives people even more incentive to play to the far right or to a set of special-interests donors , so that one individual can basically , especially in these House races , do a $ 1 million expenditure and completely tip the balance. \u201d And , finally , the news media has changed so that people select only sources that will confirm their preexisting beliefs .\nAll of this combined makes communication with Republicans mostly hopeless . \u201c There \u2019 s very little we can do to change the Republicans \u2019 political situation because they are worried about a cohort of voters who disagree with most of what the president says , \u201d Pfeiffer said . \u201c We don \u2019 t have the ability to communicate with them\u2014we can \u2019 t even break into the tight communication circles to convince them that climate change is real . They are talking to people who agree with them , they are listening to news outlets that reinforce that point of view , and the president is probably the person with the least ability to break into that because of the partisan bias there . \u201d\nPfeiffer \u2019 s reading of the red-blue impasse isn \u2019 t that it \u2019 s a permanent catastrophe . Demographic change will eventually force Republicans to compete with Democrats for some of the same voters , reopening a national political conversation that is accessible to both parties . And Democrats will find the millennial generation in play . \u201c We \u2019 re going to have to work harder to get them registered to vote and involved , and that offers an opportunity , because while they are very progressive in some of their general leanings , they \u2019 re less tied to institutions and parties. \u201d But that will have to happen after this administration has left the scene .\nThe original premise of Obama \u2019 s first presidential campaign was that he could reason with Republicans\u2014or else , by staking out obviously reasonable stances , force them to moderate or be exposed as extreme and unyielding . It took years for the White House to conclude that this was false , and that , in Pfeiffer \u2019 s words , \u201c what drives 90 percent of stuff is not the small tactical decisions or the personal relationships but the big , macro political incentives . \u201d\nIf you had to pinpoint the moment this worldview began to crystallize , it would probably be around the first debt-ceiling showdown , in 2011 , when Obama tried repeatedly and desperately to cut a budget deal with House Speaker John Boehner only to realize , eventually , that Boehner did not have the power to negotiate . The administration has now decided that in many cases , even adversarial bargaining fails because the Republican leadership is not capable of planning tactically . \u201c You have to be careful not to presume a lot of strategy for this group , \u201d Pfeiffer said . \u201c I \u2019 ve always believed that the fundamental , driving strategic ethos of the Republican House leadership has been , What do we do to get through the next caucus or conference without getting yelled at ?

And it \u2019 s like , no , that \u2019 s not actually the case . Usually he \u2019 s just saying it because he just said it or it \u2019 s the easiest thing to solve his immediate problem . \u201d\nThis analysis puts the administration at odds with the reading of American politics that still dominates much of Washington reporting . Many political journalists imagine that the basic tension for the White House lies between Obama \u2019 s liberal base and appealing to Americans at the center , who will be crucial for tipping elections .\nPfeiffer believes the dynamic is , in fact , the opposite : \u201c The incentive structure moves from going after the diminishing middle to motivating the base. \u201d Ever since Republicans took control of the House four years ago , attempts to court Republicans have mostly failed while simultaneously dividing Democratic voters .
