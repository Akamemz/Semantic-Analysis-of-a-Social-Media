Women have been among the president \u2019 s loudest critics , from the Women \u2019 s Marches that swept the country after his inauguration to the suburban women who led the Democratic wave during the 2018 midterms . They have also been among his fiercest defenders , including his daughter Ivanka and adviser Kellyanne Conway , who became the first woman to manage a winning presidential campaign .\nThe Trump era began with a female nominee failing to break the presidential glass ceiling , and now features a record number of women running for the White House . Misogyny has been uncovered in workplaces , government , and online , and a hashtag has taken down a number of powerful men .\nErin Schaff/Reuters Rep. Elise Stefanik , a New York Republican , speaks during a House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearing with Laura Cooper , deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia , Ukraine and Eurasia , and David Hale , undersecretary of state for political affairs , on Capitol Hill in Washington , Nov. 20 , 2019 .\nIn such a gender-sensitive environment , it has been striking , observers say , to see women calmly showcasing their experience , expertise , and political savvy in a high-stakes affair that has nothing to do with gender .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not a # MeToo situation . It \u2019 s something constitutional . It \u2019 s something that has to do with national security and foreign policy , \u201d says Betsy Fischer Martin , executive director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University . \u201c We see these smart , powerful , articulate women on both sides of the aisle talking about their professional insights . \u201d\nIn her measured , no-nonsense style , Dr. Hill on Thursday laid out for House lawmakers the concerns she had over the Trump administration \u2019 s backdoor Ukraine policy , as well as her frustration with some lawmakers \u2019 efforts to push a discredited theory that it was Ukraine \u2013 rather than Russia \u2013 who meddled in the 2016 election . Russia seeks to benefit from a divided United States , \u201c consumed by partisan rancor , \u201d she added , while reminding the committee multiple times of her nonpartisan role .\n\u201c I have no interest in advancing the outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction , except toward the truth , \u201d said Dr. Hill in her opening statement .\nDr. Hill had long been among the nation \u2019 s top experts on Vladimir Putin \u2019 s Russia before she was appointed to the White House National Security Council in 2017 . She recognized Mr. Putin \u2019 s enduring hold on the Russian state before many of her peers , says Matthew Rojansky , director of the Wilson Center \u2019 s Kennan Institute . And while it \u2019 s difficult to say that any single book can define an entire field , he adds , the two volumes Dr. Hill co-authored on the subject come close .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not an exaggeration to say she is universally respected in the field , \u201d says Mr. Rojansky , himself a Russia expert who \u2019 s long admired Dr. Hill \u2019 s work . \u201c She has been a real fixture in the intellectual discourse about Russia \u2026 [ and ] a serious policy practitioner . You just can \u2019 t say all of those things about many people , in any administration . \u201d\nDr. Hill \u2019 s credentials make her a heavyweight in a witness lineup that has included top diplomats and government officials , like Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union , and the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine , William Taylor .\nOther women who \u2019 ve testified have also held their own . Jennifer Williams , who appeared Wednesday , is a State Department official who serves as Vice President Mike Pence \u2019 s lead Russia adviser . Laura Cooper , who also testified Wednesday , is deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia , Ukraine , and Eurasia at the Pentagon .\nFormer Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch , who spoke to the committee last Friday , is one of the longest-serving women in the U.S. Foreign Service . She worked as a diplomat under both Presidents George W.

Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch arrives to testify to the House Intelligence Committee on Friday , Nov. 15 , 2019 , on Capitol Hill in Washington .\nTheir qualifications haven \u2019 t spared them from attacks . While Ambassador Yovanovitch was on the stand , Mr. Trump sent a tweet that questioned her abilities , asserting that everywhere she went \u201c turned bad. \u201d The missive added weight to Ms. Yovanovitch \u2019 s testimony that her unceremonious recall from Ukraine came along with an attempt to smear her reputation .\nOn Thursday , David Holmes , who served as Ambassador Yovanovitch \u2019 s chief policy adviser in Kyiv , testified in his opening statement about his \u201c deep respect for her dedication , determination , decency , and professionalism. \u201d He added that the \u201c barrage of allegations \u201d leveled against her were \u201c unlike anything I have seen in my professional career . \u201d\nTo be sure , Mr. Trump often treats his perceived enemies this way , regardless of their gender . But observers say there was a certain force to seeing a successful woman gracefully fend off such attacks in real time .\n\u201c No one would say that Yovanovitch \u2019 s testimony was anything less than a master class in integrity-led leadership , \u201d says Jenna Ben-Yehuda , founder of the Women \u2019 s Foreign Policy Network , a global organization for women in foreign affairs . \u201c It shows that leadership takes many forms . I hope we hold on to that . \u201d\nWhen Ms. Yovanovitch \u2019 s hearing wrapped on Friday , she received a standing ovation from the audience .\nWomen lawmakers have also been front-and-center in the impeachment drama .\nFlorida Rep. Val Demings , one of three Democrats on the panel , came out hard against Ambassador Sondland on Wednesday , pressing him on the details of a phone conversation he had with Mr. Trump at a restaurant in Kyiv . California Rep. Jackie Speier \u2013 who as a congressional aide in the 1970s came under gunfire while investigating the Jonestown cult in Guyana \u2013 played a key role in the depositions of Ambassador Taylor and State Department official George Kent , according to transcripts . And Rep. Terri Sewell , the No . 3 Democrat on the panel and the first black woman to serve Alabama in Congress , has also been a vocal interrogator .\nYet it \u2019 s New York Rep. Elise Stefanik , the lone Republican woman on the committee , who has drawn the most attention .\nOn Friday , she sparred with Democratic committee chair Adam Schiff after he shut her down for trying to ask a question before her designated time . She came back with a jab : \u201c Will you be prohibiting witnesses from answering members \u2019 questions , as you have in the closed-door depositions ? \u201d Mr. Schiff responded that he was protecting the identity of the whistleblower who first brought attention to Mr. Trump \u2019 s now-famous July 25 call with Mr. Zelenskiy .\n\u201c We are here to talk about impeachment \u2013 and nothing in that room today , and nothing in that room this week , nothing rises to the level of impeachable offenses , \u201d Ms. Stefanik later told reporters .\nThe episode earned Ms. Stefanik public praise from the president , who called her \u201c a new Republican star . \u201d\n\u201c Elise has been a rock star , \u201d agreed Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel at a Monitor Breakfast Thursday . \u201c She \u2019 s been incredibly succinct in her questioning . She \u2019 s come prepared . ... I think she \u2019 s been excellent. \u201d She added : \u201c And I think she drives Adam Schiff nuts . \u201d\nIndeed , Democrats have roundly criticized Ms. Stefanik as a partisan warrior . But others say her credentials make her a powerful messenger for Republicans . Ms. Stefanik was the youngest woman in Congress when , at 30 , she was first elected in 2014 . She went on to develop a reputation as a moderate , voting against the GOP tax cuts in 2017 , and sounding the alarm about the growing gender disparity in her party \u2019 s congressional caucus . She also has not been afraid to criticize Mr. Trump .\n\u201c They recognize that she \u2019 s a different voice and she has some credibility \u2013 not just because of gender or her younger age , but because she \u2019 s not been that falling-in-line sort of member , \u201d says American University \u2019 s Ms. Fischer Martin . \u201c It \u2019 s not at all a tokenism kind of thing . \u201d\nLess visible since the public hearings began has been House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . But it \u2019 s hard to overstate the part she \u2019 s played in these events . Her hand is in every decision the Democrats have made , from whether or not to move forward with the inquiry , to which committee would lead the investigation , to the scope of the probe .\n\u201c If we think of impeachment as the biggest , or most significant , check that Congress has on the executive branch , then we have a woman orchestrating that check , \u201d says the University of Virginia \u2019 s Professor Lawless . \u201c That \u2019 s not something we \u2019 ve seen before . \u201d\nIn terms of the political impact , the impeachment hearings have been \u2013 and will likely continue to be \u2013 highly divisive , a process that may only confirm Americans \u2019 impression of Washington as a partisan swamp . But \u201c in terms of gender dynamics , \u201d Professor Lawless says , the impact may be far more positive .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\u201c If for nothing else , they \u2019 ve proven that women on the left and the right are asking the tough questions , and are getting answers , \u201d adds Olivia Perez-Cubas , spokesperson for the Winning For Women Action Fund , which recruits Republican women to run for office . \u201c Between the women who have testified , between Elise , between Pelosi \u2013 they are shapers of this entire argument . \u201d",
