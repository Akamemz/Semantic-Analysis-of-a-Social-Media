I stared in the mirror and saw a man who was not me . I began to cry and broke down on the floor , cradling my head in my hands .\nMy name is Shilo Harris , and though I am no longer fighting overseas , I am constantly at war with PTSD .\nThere are some folks who feel PTSD is not a real diagnosis\u2014that the problems are mental and emotional and therefore only minor .\nI know firsthand that it \u2019 s real , and having lost my ears , part of my nose , some fingers and over a third of the skin on my body , I know PTSD to be even more life altering than my physical injuries .\nIf you can imagine rushing down a dirt trail , trying to beat off a ragged pack of dogs that are eating the contents of your comrade \u2019 s head that has been severed and blown from his body , then you may have some small inkling of why that soldier has trouble sleeping at night . If you can imagine washing blood off your armored vehicle , knowing it came from the veins of someone you loved and served with , you might understand why a soldier has lost his train of thought .\nA moment will trigger a memory ; the memory will trigger a horror ; the horror will leave you weak at the knees .\nEvery soldier returning from battle carries the trauma of that war with him or her every day , physically wounded or not .\nAccording to the Veterans Health Administration , more than 350,000 veterans were seen for potential or provisional PTSD at VHA facilities following their return from Iraq or Afghanistan .\nHow soldiers choose to self-medicate varies . Alcohol , cruelty , and rage are all coping mechanisms I \u2019 ve personally resorted to , though none provide relief . And while I know it \u2019 s selfish , suicide stays on the table and at times seems like a delicious choice . PTSD makes suicide seem viable .\nThe number of male veterans under 30 ending their own lives grew by 44 percent in just two years ( 2009-2011 ) . The suicide rate among veterans remains well above that for the general population , with roughly 22 former servicemen and women committing suicide every day .\nWhile not all suicides can be directly related to PTSD , it remains a very real problem and a very difficult war .
