The levies affect goods , imported from almost all U.S. trading partners , such as steel , aluminum and solar panels .\nSo far , none of the active cases challenge the tariffs directly against China , but trade attorneys say that could change .\nThe cases have been filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade , based in New York , the body in the U.S. judicial system that has jurisdiction over all cases dealing with customs and international trade laws .\nThe administration has argued that the various trade statutes allow enough flexibility for the actions that it has taken , and that once an action has been taken , the president has broad authority to make modifications .\nThe U.S. and China reached a \u201c phase one \u201d trade deal this month that authorities say will increase farm sales to China , but it also keeps most tariffs in place while subsequent phases are negotiated . The U.S. still has 25 % tariffs on roughly $ 250 billion in Chinese goods and 7.5 % tariffs on about $ 120 billion in other imports from China .\nThe tariffs are opposed by many U.S. businesses , which have to pay the levies and whose tolerance is starting to wear thin .\nSeveral businesses , trade groups and attorneys have actively considered mounting a legal challenge to the tariffs against China , according to people involved . These people said the prospect of continued tariffs could soon overcome resistance to challenging the Trump administration .\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think potential challenges will affect the Trump administration \u2019 s trade strategy , if at all ?

United States , a ruling by the court said the administration failed to follow required timelines and procedures when in August 2018 it added an additional 25 % tariff against Turkey during a dispute over the detention of an American pastor .\nThe case , which isn \u2019 t fully decided and might face appeal , could result in the administration \u2019 s being forced to refund anyone who made the additional tariff payments .\nThe Transpacific case establishes that tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 must carefully follow the timelines laid out in that law . The administration has used Section 232 to impose its steel and aluminum tariffs and to threaten tariffs against the global automobile industry .\nLast month , the administration missed a Nov. 13 deadline , outlined in the law itself , to make a decision on automobile tariffs on European and Asian imports , which might invalidate an attempt to impose the tariffs .\nThe Commerce Department declined to respond to questions about the missed deadline , though Secretary Wilbur Ross has said he believed the administration could still impose auto tariffs despite missing the deadlines .\n\u201c I would assume there would be immediate lawsuits requesting a temporary restraining order against it at the Court of International Trade , and I think that they would win , \u201d said Ms. Hillman .\nThe Transpacific case could undermine any administration effort to raise steel and aluminum tariffs on Argentina and Brazil . On Dec. 2 , the administration threatened to raise tariffs on the countries , but as with the tariffs on Turkey , it is well outside the timeline originally established for making decisions about steel and aluminum tariffs .\nThe administration never published the formal orders that would implement the tariffs , and in a call with Brazil \u2019 s president , Mr. Trump said he would drop the threat against Brazil .\nMs. Hillman said that without formal language imposing the tariffs , it is too soon to conclude the levies couldn \u2019 t be justified , but that the administration may have concluded the tariffs couldn \u2019 t be legally implemented .\nTwo more active court cases pose challenges to the Section 232 steel tariffs . The first is the case from the American Institute for International Steel , for which Prof. Meyer is one of the attorneys . The group argues that Congress doesn \u2019 t have the authority to grant the White House such sweeping tariff powers .\nThe group lost its case at the Court of International Trade , but the judges said some of the issues raised in the case were \u201c beyond this court \u2019 s power to address. \u201d The case , currently before a federal appeals court , would likely have to be decided by the Supreme Court because it raises constitutional questions .\nA new case , Universal Steel Products Inc. v.
