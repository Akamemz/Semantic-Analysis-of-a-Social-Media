    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump 's craving for loyalty from his top law enforcement officials and alleged efforts to topple those whom he perceives as threats could be leading him into deep trouble -- and even put his presidency in peril .\nThen , in an interview with CNN , former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe -- who was instrumental in opening an obstruction inquiry against Trump -- made his strongest claim yet that he was fired hours before his scheduled retirement as a result of an internal investigation rigged against him at the instigation of the President .\nThe revelations appear to fit into a consistent pattern of attempts by Trump to influence investigations in which he may be implicated and a constant campaign of public and private pressure on the officials involved .\nThey also beg a mysterious question yet again : Why , if the President insists there was no coordination between his 2016 campaign and Russia 's election meddling plot , has he taken such pains to undermine investigations into what he has branded a huge `` hoax ? ''\nThe New York Times reported that Trump called acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker late last year to ask whether it was possible that Geoffrey Berman , the US attorney for the Southern District of New York , who was recused from the case , could take over anyway .\nTrump lashed out at the report on Wednesday , tweeting : `` The New York Times reporting is false . They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE ! ''\nEven in his public remarks , the President has often left the impression that top law enforcement officers had a duty to protect him -- like a personal lawyer -- rather than to the neutral administration of justice and to the Constitution .\nFired FBI Director James Comey said Trump tried to establish a mob-like relationship of patronage with him . Trump also repeatedly berated his former Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his failure to rein in the Russia probe .\nTrump has mounted relentless , almost daily attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller 's inquiry and other investigations targeting his administration .\nIn the worst-case scenario , his incessant private , public and political efforts to influence the investigations could add up to obstruction of justice in plain sight -- and even form part of any future articles of impeachment .\nAsked by CNN 's Brooke Baldwin whether Trump 's request to Whitaker amounted to obstruction , Elie Honig , a former federal prosecutor , answered : `` What else could it be ? ''\n`` What other reason could the President have for calling Matt Whitaker right as the Cohen investigation was growing and starting to threaten him ... and asking Whitaker , 'Can we get my guy ? ' '' he said .\nPaul Rosenzweig , a senior counsel to the Whitewater investigation , told Baldwin that if confirmed , the reporting about Trump could amount to a possible abuse of power .\n`` It 's really hard to come up with an innocent explanation for asking somebody to unrecuse from a recusal that seems wholly appropriate , '' he said . `` It is a little early to say for sure what the facts are since Mr. Whitaker has sort of denied this -- but if the facts prove out as it is , this is potentially impeachable . ''\nThere is no evidence that Whitaker asked Berman , who was appointed by the President 's former Attorney General Jeff Sessions , to take over the inquiry , a decision that led Trump to sour on Whitaker .\nIt is not known what Whitaker might have told the President in private conversations after he was read into the Mueller investigation . He insisted in a hearing before a House committee this month that he had not `` interfered with the special counsel 's investigation in any way .

MUST WATCH Rep. : NYT report would constitute obstruction if true 01:23\nTrump 's lawyers have argued that his firing of Comey and attempts to intervene in personnel decisions in the Justice Department are consistent with his titular authority as the nation 's top law enforcement official .\nIn a confidential letter sent to Mueller last year , Trump 's lawyer Jay Sekulow and his then-colleague John Dowd argued that `` no President has ever faced charges of obstruction merely for exercising his constitutional authority . ''\nThey said that a President can `` order the termination '' of a Justice Department or FBI investigation `` at any time and for any reason . ''\nBut many legal experts believe that should Mueller establish corrupt intent , the normal standard for an obstruction charge in a criminal case , it could be conduct that could be taken up in the political context of an impeachment case .\nTrump 's assertion in an NBC News interview that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation could be evidence for such a finding in any final report that the special counsel decides to file .\nThere is historical precedent for a presidency running into existential peril after an attempt to interfere in the investigative process .\nThe Articles of Impeachment drawn up against Richard Nixon accused the disgraced former president of `` interfering or endeavoring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ... and congressional committees . ''\nThe New York Times reported that Whitaker knew that he could not ask Berman to do what Trump asked and that the President soured on his interim appointee when he could not make the President 's legal problems go away .\nThe Cohen case has turned out to be especially troublesome for Trump because it opened a path for prosecutors into his private and business affairs . In a guilty plea , his former lawyer , Michael Cohen , said Trump ordered him to arrange payments to two women who claimed they had affairs with him -- effectively making the President an unindicted co-conspirator in a violation of campaign finance law .\nJUST WATCHED McCabe to CBS : DOJ held meetings about removing Trump Replay More Videos ...
