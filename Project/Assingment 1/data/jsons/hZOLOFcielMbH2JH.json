While Romney has bounced among various themes in recent weeks , his speech to a Pennsylvania crowd Tuesday and then to the Ohio crowd Wednesday zeroed in on that quote as illustrating a singular difference between his attitude toward the economy and Obama 's .\n`` This is the height of foolishness . It shows how out of touch he is with the character of America , '' Romney said in Ohio . `` When you attack success ... you will see under this president less success . ''\nRomney accused Obama of trying to `` diminish '' individual achievement . Before he launched into his stump speech , Romney asked members of the audience Wednesday to raise their hands if they run a business . `` Take that , Mr. President , '' Romney said after the hands went up .\nRomney earlier described the comments as `` stunning '' and revealing '' and argued they played into a larger narrative of Obama `` changing the nature of America , '' calling his policies `` extraordinarily foreign . ''\nRomney said Obama wants Americans to be `` ashamed of success . '' He suggested the comment was tantamount to saying Steve Jobs did n't build Apple or Ray Kroc did n't build McDonald 's , calling the notion `` insulting '' and wrong .\nWhile Romney was on the trail , House Speaker John Boehner turned up the rhetoric on Capitol Hill Wednesday , saying Obama `` does n't give a damn '' about Americans looking for work .\nBut as Republicans turn up the heat on Obama , the president 's campaign is fighting back . Democrats are accusing Romney of trying to distract from other controversies -- namely his refusal to release more than two years ' worth of tax returns , and questions about when he left private-equity firm Bain Capital .\nThe Obama campaign called Romney 's latest attacks `` off the deep-end '' and `` over the top , '' arguing the president 's comments were taken out of context .\n`` As President Obama said the other day , those who start businesses succeed because of their individual initiative -- their drive , hard work , and creativity . But there are critical actions we must take to support businesses and encourage new ones -- that means we need the best infrastructure , a good education system , and affordable , domestic sources of clean energy . Those are investments we make not as individuals , but as Americans , and our nation benefits from them . Apparently Mitt Romney disagrees , '' the statement said .\nObama campaign adviser David Axelrod countered as well via Twitter .\n`` Is n't it ironic that the guy who sticks his millions in foreign tax havens says the president 's views are 'extremely foreign ? ' '' he said .\nIt 's unclear whether Romney will continue to build Obama 's business quote into a theme of his campaign . The Romney operation , despite the developments of the last few days , is still pushing the message that the Obama administration helped create jobs overseas with its stimulus spending .
