McEnany wanted to be prepared to defend the hope she found in the story of Christ , no matter how aggressively she was questioned by her peers .\nDuring a visit to Fox News around this time , her potential talent piqued the interest of Alan Colmes , then Sean Hannity \u2019 s liberal antagonist on the program Hannity & Colmes . Colmes \u2019 s mentorship led McEnany to an internship on his show . The two would have fierce political debates , and he appreciated her for it .
