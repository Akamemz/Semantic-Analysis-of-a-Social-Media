    "content": "Everywhere I look nowadays liberals are screaming about `` bullying. \u201d It 's the liberal cause `` du jour . '' Liberals hate bullies .\nWell I know a very big bad bully . He \u2019 s the worst bully in all the land . His name is Barack Obama . Funny enough , liberals don \u2019 t care about his vicious bullying . Liberal hypocrites just make absurd excuses for his bullying , because they agree with his politics .\nIs n't it ironic ? The worst bullies of all are liberals- the very people complaining about the traumatic effects of bullying .\nWell I have a personal story that proves what bullies Obama and his socialist cabal really are . You see I believe the Obama White House sent the IRS to bully me . I have proof after obtaining my IRS files that this was a politically-motivated criminal conspiracy . Crimes were committed- the same crimes that forced Richard Nixon to resign . But mostly it \u2019 s a very bad case of bullying , intimidation and persecution by government to try to silence a critic of the president .\nDemocrat politicians using the IRS to bully critics is a terrible thing to do . It \u2019 s a crime . It violates the Constitution . It could very well silence our most basic right- free speech . But worst of all it could lead to depression , divorce , bankruptcy and suicide . Why are liberals not concerned about this terrible case of bullying ? I guess for the same reason feminists talked all day about sexual harassment , but when it was committed by their hero Bill Clinton against a young White House intern\u2026not a peep .\nSo it turns out liberals turn a blind eye to crimes committed by\u2026Liberals .\nThis Obama-Democrat-IRS conspiracy that happened to me was intended to destroy my life . I spent 3 years under IRS attack . My marriage was strained to the breaking point . What if this political witch-hunt led to a divorce ? What if the result had been a suicide ? What if I had been sent to jail on trumped up charges ? What if my reputation and career as a business speaker and best-selling author had been ruined ? What if the legal bills bankrupted an innocent man ? Isn \u2019 t that the worst kind of bullying possible ?\nThis isn \u2019 t telling someone they are fat or ugly . I guess liberals heard a lot of that in their childhood . This is much worse . My story is BULLYING by government against it 's own citizens . It is reminiscent of the Gestapo .\nI was targeted by the IRS in a coordinated attack at the highest levels of government ... and I now have the proof .\nMy IRS files , obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch , clearly implicate the IRS and a Democratic U.S. senator .\n\u201c The Obama IRS obstructed the release of Wayne Root \u2019 s tax documents . The abuse of process Judicial Watch and Wayne suffered through to get these documents is scandalous . Now we know why the Obama IRS was hesitant to give Wayne his own IRS files . These documents show the Obama IRS scandal was more than just suppressing the Tea Party , it was also about auditing critics of President Obama . Richard Nixon had to resign from office for less . The first order of business for AG Loretta Lynch should be to appoint a special counsel who can convene a grand jury to look into the Obama IRS outrages . \u201d\nAs you \u2019 ll read , the fingerprints of the Obama administration and the Democratic Party are all over my case . Until now , no one could prove the IRS was using politics as a basis for vicious attacks against critics of the president . That just changed . Up until now , no one could prove leading Democrat politicians were involved . That just changed too .\nI was audited in 2011 , and it started in a way that government officials and IRS spokesmen claimed in a recent Wall Street Journal article can never happen- with a phone call .\nThe IRS agent left a voicemail , and then took another unheard-of step and called my accountant ( who had my power of attorney and told the agent he was forbidden to ever contact me again ) . Yet the IRS agent called me again , only minutes later , to lecture me all about my conservative political views . How did an IRS agent know about my political views ? Why was he telling me my political views ? I felt like I was being stalked .\nSo here 's a question for the IRS spokesman and the official for the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration ( both quoted in the WSJ article saying no IRS audit ever begins with a phone call ) \u2026Are you sticking to your story that the IRS never calls taxpayers ? Or is the correct wording , \u201c The IRS never calls taxpayers , unless they are critics of the president ? ''\nAfter spending thousands of dollars , I won in Tax Court in 2012 . Five days later , I was targeted to be audited again . To my attorney \u2019 s knowledge , this has never happened before .\nAfter winning my case the second time , I contacted government watchdog Judicial Watch , which took my case and requested my tax files under the Freedom of Information Act . By law , the IRS had 30 days to comply . They stalled and refused for 14 months . The question is why would a government agency disobey the law for 13 months ?\nNow come the political and criminal revelations . The IRS is supposed to be totally nonpolitical , as it must be in a free and fair democratic society . Do you know what my IRS tax file says ?\nDo you know the date \u201c SENSITIVE CASE \u201d was written on my tax file ? The week Lois Lerner testified in Congress .\nThe only thing \u201c SENSITIVE \u201d about my case is that I \u2019 m a conservative political columnist and commentator often critical of the president . The only context where \u201c sensitive \u201d applies to me is \u201c POLITICALLY SENSITIVE . ''\nWhy would a citizen \u2019 s tax file be tied to his politics ? Why would the IRS know my politics ? Why would a normal random audit be classified as `` SENSITIVE ? ''\nBut we \u2019 re only getting started with the criminal implications of this case . My IRS auditor wrote into the margin of my file that he researched my political views on the Internet . He wrote on my files the names of Fox News and conservative web sites I had written for . He wrote on my files the names of conservative radio shows I had been a guest on . How chilling is that revelation ? It sounds like the KGB , Stasi or Gestapo .\nAn IRS audit that required researching my political views wasn \u2019 t a \u201c normal random audit. \u201d An IRS audit that was classified a \u201c Sensitive Case \u201d wasn \u2019 t a \u201c normal random audit. \u201d I was targeted for my political views . My civil rights were clearly violated .\nThe reason it may have taken the IRS fourteen months to turn my IRS files over to Judicial Watch is that they state a United States senator from Oregon was involved . At the time both senators from Oregon were Democrats . But only one , Ron Wyden , was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee with oversight over\u2026\nCould Ron Wyden have been the Democrat senator involved in my case ? If so , why was a U.S. senator involved in a `` normal random audit ? '' Why was an Oregon Senator involved in the audit of a Nevada small businessman ? Since when do United States Senators get involved in IRS audits ? My lawyers says it \u2019 s cut and dried- a US Senator involved in a taxpayer IRS audit is a violation of my civil rights .\nCould someone have asked the Oregon Senator to get involved ? The dots are not hard to connect . Was he asked by someone in the White House to initiate an IRS attack on Wayne Root ? Afterall I \u2019 m not just any conservative critic of President Obama . I \u2019 m the former Columbia college classmate of Obama . With about 6000 media appearances on Fox News and conservative talk radio since Obama became president , it \u2019 s not a stretch to think I caught the attention of the Obama White House .\nOn May 23rd , 2013 , my case was officially closed . Recognize that date ? It 's the exact day that IRS official Lois Lerner was suspended and the day after she testified in front of Congress ( and refused to answer questions on the grounds it might incriminate her ) .Coincidence ?\nThe IRS auditor handling my case informed my tax attorney that he was called by a top IRS official who demanded my case be closed immediately . Why would a top IRS official get involved in my case ? Who asked him to make that call ? Did he know the politically damaging details of this audit marked \u201c SENSITIVE CASE '' ? Why did it happen the very day after Lois Lerner 's testimony ?\nThere is no debate . I am living proof that there was a widespread political witch-hunt and criminal conspiracy within the IRS . It is also proof that this scandal extended beyond the IRS to high-level Democrats- including a specific Democrat U.S . Senator . It 's all in black and white in my personal IRS tax files . These are facts .\nMy files have been turned over to U.S. Senate investigators . I stand ready and eager to testify .\nNow it \u2019 s time for the mainstream media to do their job and connect the dots . Remember , I \u2019 m not just any conservative media personality . I \u2019 m President Obama \u2019 s Columbia College classmate ( Class of \u2019 83 ) who has repeatedly questioned his background and agenda . It appears my criticisms hit too close to home .\nDid someone in Obama \u2019 s White House call the IRS to target me , then ask the Oregon Senator to oversee and coordinate the attack ? Or did the Obama White House cover their own involvement by asking the Oregon Senator to initiate the IRS attack ? These are questions that either U.S. Senate investigators or a special counsel appointed by the new U.S. Attorney General need to ask . This same kind of behavior forced Richard Nixon to resign from the presidency .\nOne more question- was I merely the tip of the iceberg ? How many other conservative donors and critics of Obama have been attacked by the IRS ? Hundreds ? Thousands ? Is this how Obama and his socialist cabal stole the 2012 election ? Since I told this story in the media , I \u2019 ve received many calls and emails from other conservatives who were targeted by the IRS . There is a pattern .\nIt \u2019 s easy to find the answers . Threaten all the bullies involved with jail time and demand they give up the people who gave them the orders to avoid prison .\nI \u2019 m betting at the end of the trail\u2026at the very top\u2026are the biggest bullies of all- Obama , Valerie Jarrett and the minions of Obama White House aides carrying out his socialist agenda . Remember what Obama 's mentor Saul Alinsky said , `` The ends justify the means . ''\nOne thing is now clear : I was the victim of a politically motivated criminal attack by the IRS.It \u2019 s time to stop the bullying .\n1 . `` Sensitive Case '' is a handwritten notation on an IRS Special Handling Notice for Examination Processing found on page 949 ( the last page of the file ) . It is dated May 23 , 2013 . It 's worth noting that that 's the very day that Lois Lerner was suspended and the day after her Congressional testimony ( in which she refused to answer questions ) .\n2 . Notes regarding the IRS examiner 's research regarding Wayne 's political activities are found in an Examining Officer 's Activity Record on pages 104-105 of the documents . The notation reads in part , `` RA [ Revenue Agent ] researched the internet about TP/Wayne Root . Wayne Root is a public figure whose career includes working as a ( 1 ) columnist for the Las Vegas Review Journal and Newsmax.com ( 2 ) guest commentator on Fox News , CNBC , CNN , and MSNBC , and ( 3 ) his being a guest host on nationally syndicated radio shows ( i.e . - The G.
