ET - Rep. Diana DeGette , D-Colorado , says she gives the contractors `` the benefit of the doubt '' when they say things are improving . But she adds , `` these problems need to be fixed fast . ''\n9:23 a.m . ET - Rep. Frank Pallone , D-New Jersey , says he does n't have a good feeling about the hearing , because he thinks it 's nothing but a political ploy by Republicans to chisel away at the Affordable Care Act .\n`` The Republicans do n't have clean hands coming here , '' he said . `` Their effort is n't to make this better , but to use the website as an excuse to delay or defund Obamacare .

After a competitive bidding process that included a Request for Information and a Request for Proposal, CMS awarded a contract to Equifax Workforce Solutions in March of this year to provide real time verification of income and employment to the CMS Data Hub to facilitate the verification of eligibility for Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), as well as for eligibility for premium tax credits and reduced cost sharing,\" she says.\n\nRead her full testimony.\n\n9:45 a.m. ET - Andrew Slavitt, Group Executive Vice President of Optum/QSSI, a business unit of UnitedHealth Group.\n\n\"Simply put, the Data Services Hub is a pipeline that transfers data \u2013 routing queries and responses between a given marketplace and various trusted data sources,\" he says. \"Certain information the consumer provides to the marketplace, such as citizenship, must be verified. The Data Services Hub\n\ndirects queries to information sources, such as government databases, that can verify that information, and sends the responses back to the marketplace.\"\n\n\"After the launch, healthcare.gov was inundated by many more consumers than anticipated. Many of the critical components developed by these multiple vendors were overwhelmed,\" he adds.\n\nRead his full testimony.\n\n9:40 a.m. ET - Since CGI was awarded the contract in September 2011, it has worked \"diligently to deliver\" the website, Campbell says.

According to it's website, it's revenue is $10.4 billion.\n\n9:36 a.m. ET - Witnesses stand up and pledge to tell \"the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\"\n\n9:30 a.m. ET - Rep. John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and longest-serving U.S. lawmaker in history, says he is \"very frustrated\" about the problems facing HealthCare.Gov. But he said a slow website for a new health care law is still a better alternative than no health care law at all.\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act was passed, then-house Speaker Nancy Pelosi used the gavel that Dingell used in 1965 when Medicare passed the House.\n\n9:27 a.m. ET - Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado, says she gives the contractors \"the benefit of the doubt\" when they say things are improving.

Frank Pallone, D-New Jersey, says he doesn't have a good feeling about the hearing, because he thinks it's nothing but a political ploy by Republicans to chisel away at the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The Republicans don't have clean hands coming here,\" he said. \"Their effort isn't to make this better, but to use the website as an excuse to delay or defund Obamacare.\"\n\n\"Do you really care?

I just wish you could stop this obstruction, work with us to make this a better system,\" he adds.\n\n9:07 a.m. ET - The hearing gets underway, with Chairman Fred Upton, R-Michigan, giving opening remarks. Vice chairman Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, and Ranking Member Henry Waxman, D-California, follow.\n\nUpton's ascent to the top of the committee was not without a fight. When the GOP took control of the House in 2010, he barely beat out a more conservative Republican who was backed by the tea party.\n\nOh, and Rep. Upton is the uncle to model Kate Upton.\n\n9:03 a.m. ET - Wondering who's holding this hearing on Obcamacare website woes? Here's a list of members of The House Energy and Commerce Committee.",
