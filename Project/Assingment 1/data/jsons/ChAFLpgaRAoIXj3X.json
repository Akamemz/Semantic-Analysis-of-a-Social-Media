    "content": "A move to shift power away from the New York Federal Reserve Bank is finding some powerful friends in Congress amid lingering worries that a key part of the central bank is too cozy with Wall Street .\nTwo Republicans running the banking committees have both said they plan to explore proposals from the outspoken , former Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher that would roll back a long-standing provision that gives the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank an automatic position as vice chairman of a powerful committee and weaken New York \u2019 s oversight of Wall Street banks .\nThe politics may be ripe for chipping away at the power of the Federal Reserve , uniting liberals who want to crack down on Wall Street , Republicans who don \u2019 t like the Fed \u2019 s easy money policies and libertarians who are suspicious of the Fed altogether .\nThe move also reflects some regional rivalries within the Fed \u2014 the New York Federal Reserve Bank often overshadows other regional banks , and Fisher , known as a rabble rouser in Federal Reserve politics , has been lobbying for a change to the power structure .\nBanking Chairman Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) and House Financial Services Jeb Hensarling ( R-Texas ) say they \u2019 re open to reducing the power of the New York Fed , and the move has the potential to appeal to Democrats who have been critical of the Fed , like Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass ) .\n\u201c Mr . Fisher \u2019 s proposal dealing with the Fed and the Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 we \u2019 re going to pursue all that and that would include the role of the New York Fed , \u201d Shelby said last week .\nAnd some Democrats have also said they \u2019 re open to policies that shift power away from the New York Fed .\n\u201c The New York Fed plays an extraordinary role , and maybe it \u2019 s extraordinarily captured , but it also represents only 6 percent of the population , \u201d said Rep. Brad Sherman , ( D-Calif. ) who wants to give a permanent vote on monetary policy decisions to the San Francisco Fed , which serves nine western states and 20 percent of the population .\nSen. Mark Warner ( D-Va. ) , a moderate who said he hasn \u2019 t taken a position on the proposals yet , said , \u201c I do think there \u2019 s been some legitimate questions of the role of the New York Fed . \u201d\nFisher , who retired Thursday after 10 years at the Dallas Fed , wants to yank the New York Fed \u2019 s permanent position as vice chair of the all-powerful Federal Open Market Committee , the panel charged with making monetary policy decisions , which met Wednesday .\nWhile the New York Fed president could still participate in monetary policy discussions , he or she would no longer always get a vote . Fisher suggested the job should rotate among the regional Federal Reserve Banks every two years .\nThe move would upend the current structure , as the New York Fed has had a lock on that spot since 1936 , thanks largely to its role as the infrastructure , which supplies the trading desk that carries out the Fed \u2019 s monetary policy decisions .\nFisher is also proposing that other regional Fed banks oversee some of the Wall Street giants in a move aimed at addressing criticism the New York Fed missed warning signs of the financial crisis , is too soft on Wall Street and holds too much power and influence at the Fed .\n\u201c The greatest concern appears to be the problem of regulatory capture by the largest and most powerful institutions , \u201d Fisher said in a February speech in New York laying out his plan .\nWall Street critics have been suspicious of the New York Fed since it and its then leader , Timothy Geithner , played a key role in responding to the 2008 financial crisis and the bailouts that entailed .\nLate last year its current president , William Dudley , was hauled before the Senate Banking Committee after reports from ProPublica and NPR \u2019 s This American Life that focused on a New York Fed examiner who said her warnings about certain business practices and deals at Goldman Sachs were ignored or brushed aside by her superiors . She provided recordings of her dealings with Fed officials to back up her case .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got on tape higher-ups at the New York Fed calling off the regulators , \u201d Warren told Dudley at the November hearing . \u201c And I \u2019 m just asking the same kind of question \u2014 is there a cultural problem at the New York Fed ? I think the evidence suggests that there is . \u201d\nFormer Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher . | AP photo\nThe two most powerful lawmakers on financial policy say they are closely looking at Fisher \u2019 s proposal .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to take a very serious look at that proposal , \u201d said Hensarling . Hensarling said his panel will soon be working on another package of changes to reshape the Federal Reserve and \u201c ensure we have a predictable rules-based monetary policy that works for working Americans . But anything that Richard Fisher proposes is going to get a very serious review from our committee . \u201d\nSimilarly , Shelby told reporters last week he plans to pursue the proposal .\n\u201c This is 2015 and things have changed , \u201d said Shelby , who is quietly working on a Senate legislative package . \u201c We have a shift in population . Everything used to be in New York and a lot of it \u2019 s not . \u201d\nPart of the idea \u2019 s popularity may also be that it \u2019 s coming from Fisher , who is a strange political animal .\nHe ran for U.S. Senate as a conservative Democrat back in 1993 \u2014 which he now calls his \u201c midlife crisis \u201d moment , losing to former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R-Texas ) . He worked in the Carter and Clinton Administrations and later worked for Henry Kissinger \u2019 s consulting firm , before joining the Dallas Fed . He also spent much of the 1990s running his own investment firm .\nSome Republicans like Fisher , because he often bucked the majority on the Fed , opposing the continued expansion of economic stimulus measures , which he called \u201c monetary Ritalin \u201d for the markets .

And two years ago , he took an unprecedented step for a Fed president of attending the an annual gathering of conservatives , Conservative Political Action Conference , to make the case for breaking up Wall Street giants .\nThe big question now is whether his proposals can make it into legislative text .\nWhile Shelby likes the idea , other senators on his committee , including Republican Bob Corker and Democrats Jack Reed and Heidi Heitkamp said they \u2019 re not ready to weigh in . For his part , Reed has a different bill to require the president of the New York Fed to be presidentially appointed and confirmed by Congress rather than selected by its board .\nHowever , the ranking Democrat on the panel , Sen.
