A key reason is that businesses didn \u2019 t cut back on investment spending as much as first estimated .\nThe economy had begun the year with a sizzling 3.1 % GDP rate , fueled largely by the now-faded effects of tax cuts and increased government spending .\nMany analysts worry that GDP growth is slipping in the current October-December quarter to a 1.4 % annual rate or less as business investment weakens further . But most say the slowdown won \u2019 t likely be as severe as it might have been because consumers , who drive about 70 percent of the economy , are signaling that they will likely keep spending through the holiday shopping season and into next year . That spending is being supported by rising incomes and an unemployment rate that is near the lowest levels in a half century .\nConsumer spending gained some momentum entering the final three months of the year , with spending rising by a 0.3 % annual rate in October , the fastest monthly pace in three months .\nAnd in the U.S. manufacturing sector , which has been struggling with global economic weakness and damage from the Trump administration \u2019 s trade conflicts , orders for high-cost items rebounded in October by a 0.6 % annual rate after having declined in September .\nEconomists said the flurry of reports depict an economy that is regaining its footing after absorbing threats this year , from the global slowdown to the intensifying trade war with China , which has perpetuated uncertainties for businesses .

Analysts attribute that rebound in part to falling mortgage rates .\nFor the full year , economists think GDP will expand 2.3 % , down sharply from a 2.9 % GDP gain in 2018 .
