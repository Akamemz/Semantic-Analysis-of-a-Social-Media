''\nLavrov was addressing reporters at the U.N. in New York Thursday , on the second day of airstrikes by Russian warplanes in Syria .\nMoscow , which supports the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , has been accused of using the strikes to target anti-Assad groups including the U.S.-backed opposition group the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) .\nBut Lavrov said Russia does not consider the FSA a terrorist group . `` We believe that Free Syrian Army should be part of the political process , '' he said .\n`` The goal of our operation -- in response to the request of President Assad and on the basis of the decision granted by the Russian parliament to the Russian President in accordance with the Russian constitution -- the goal is terrorism and we are not supporting anyone against their own people . We fight terrorism , '' Lavrov said .\nLavrov questioned the U.S.-led coalition 's legitimacy , given the mission had not received the consent of the U.N. Security Council or any `` request of one of the countries on whose territories they operate . ''\n`` You can not avoid the impression that the legal basis of the coalition activities in Syria is really flawed , '' he said .\n`` As far as I understand , the coalition announced ISIL and other associated groups as the enemy and the coalition does the same as Russia [ does ] . Somehow some people try to present the coalition action as leading to a political settlement and Russia fighting the same people is being perceived or presented like defending the regime . It 's absolutely unfair , '' he said .\nThe foreign minister also questioned the logic of trying to topple al-Assad to further the fight against ISIS , asking whether the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya had made those countries better places .\nRussia 's Defense Ministry issued a statement earlier Thursday saying that it had carried out new airstrikes .\n`` Russian Aerospace Forces engaged another four # ISIS facilities in # Syria this night , '' the Ministry announced on Twitter along with gun camera video showing large explosions .\nThe strikes were carried out by eight Russian SU-24 and SU-25 jets , which claimed to hit ISIS `` terrorist staff '' and an ammunition dump near Idlib and another headquarters in Hama .\nBut 24 hours into the military campaign , there were concerns it was targeting those who oppose al-Assad , including more moderate factions that are supported by the United States and others in the West .\nThe Syrian Ambassador to Russia , Riad Haddad , told CNN 's Matthew Chance that Russians were fighting alongside the Syrians , to destroy not just ISIS but all of the other rebel groups in Syria .\nHaddad said all of the rebel groups , including ISIS , have a common goal : `` to spread terror . ''\nHe told CNN that the impact of the Russian airstrikes over the past few days has been more effective than all of the coalition airstrikes so far combined and that the Syrian army and the Russian army are working side by side , sharing intelligence and data and working very closely together .\nWednesday 's strikes were centered around the city of Homs , in western Syria near the border with Lebanon .\nA Syrian opposition activist living north of Homs near one of the villages targeted -- Talbiseh -- told CNN that ISIS had no presence in the area .\n`` Russian warplanes were targeting civilians and innocent people only , Putin is lying about targeting Daesh militants , '' Khdaier Khushfa said via Skype .
