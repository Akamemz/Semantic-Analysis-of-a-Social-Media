Then , again in the role of a presumed federal attorney , he seemed to reverse that judgment by reopening his investigation . Then he appeared to re-reverse that decision \u2014 all at the height of a heated presidential campaign .\nThroughout such a bizarre sequence , Comey stuck to a ( flawed ) exegesis about the nature of federal statutes in question ( intent is not a mitigating circumstance in the felonious insecure transmission of classified federal documents ) .\nComey de facto had assumed yet another new role in addition to his newfound claims to be both an investigator and a prosecuting federal attorney \u2014 that of legislator and judge .\nLast summer , the many-headed Comey apparently believed that he would face no consequences for his moth-to-the flame desire for public showmanship \u2014 given the widely shared belief that Hillary Clinton was going to be president and that Loretta Lynch would probably continue on as attorney general . ( Lynch met privately with Bill Clinton on the tarmac five days before Hillary Clinton \u2019 s FBI interview , and , around the same time , Clinton allies said that Hillary was considering retaining Lynch as the attorney general . )\nIn Comey \u2019 s case , in his public and congressional statements , he repeatedly emphasized that he was conducting an ongoing investigation of possible \u201c collusion \u201d between Putin and those who surrounded Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign .\nYet at the same time , Director of National Intelligence James Clapper had casually exonerated Trump from just those charges of collaborating with the Russians . Comey may have confirmed that in private to some senators .\nIn contrast , in the past , Comey had foolishly put some currency in an unsourced and unverified but tawdry and soon-leaked Fusion GPS dossier of supposed Trump sexual antics in Moscow \u2014 fake news stories generated , as Comey should have known , by opposition researchers funded first by Republican Never Trump operatives and then by the hit teams of the Clinton campaign .\nYet Comey was uncharacteristically quiet about ongoing disclosures that members of the Obama administration had unmasked names of people surveilled by intelligence agencies . At best , if true , the administration unduly revealed identities and then leaked them to the press ; and at worst , it deliberately reverse-targeted political opponents , on the pretext that normal monitoring of Russian officials had , mirabile dictu , caught up Trump associates . Either way , it illegally leaked classified material .\nComey probably understood that keeping silent about FBI inquiries into alleged collusion with the Russians could earn bad enough press to endanger his career . And in the opposite fashion , he seemed to think it was wiser to remain mute about FBI investigations into why and how the administration had surveilled American citizens and then leaked their names to pet reporters .\nIn the end , Comey \u2019 s gymnastics were too clever by half , and he strategized himself out of a job . One of his legacies will be that Hillary Clinton broke the law in using an unsecured server , illegally passed on classified materials , destroyed a great deal of evidence , and participated in Clinton Foundation payola through the cheapening of her position as secretary of state \u2014 and got off not just scot-free but outraged that anyone would suggest she should face any consequences whatsoever .\nThe larger problem with modern government is not that high federal and state officials like the megalomaniac James Comey are sometimes fired ( they rarely willingly resign in the fashion of the British or Japanese ) , but they are almost never let go .\nWe live in a private-guilt rather than a public-shame culture .
