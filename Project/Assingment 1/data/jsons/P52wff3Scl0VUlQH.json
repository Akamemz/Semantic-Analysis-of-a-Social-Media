    "content": "Michael Hirsh was national editor for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine from 2014\u20132016 .\nBarack Obama , whom Donald Trump earlier in the day called \u201c the most ignorant president in our history \u201d on foreign policy , returned the favor Wednesday night , suggesting that the Republican nominee had no clue what he was talking about\u2014especially in comparison to Hillary Clinton . \u201c Until you \u2019 ve sat at that desk , you don \u2019 t know what it \u2019 s like to manage a global crisis or send young people to war , \u201d Obama said . \u201c But Hillary \u2019 s been in the room ; she \u2019 s been part of those decisions . ... And that 's why I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman \u2014 not me , not Bill , nobody \u2014 more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America. \u201d By contrast , \u201c the Donald is not really a plans guy . Not really a facts guy , either , \u201d the president said .\nVice President Joe Biden , who earned a reputation as a foreign policy expert over nearly four decades in the Senate , was far more blunt , saying flatly earlier in the night : \u201c No major party nominee in the history of this nation has ever known less or has been less prepared to deal with our national security \u201d than Trump .\nSet aside the truthfulness of these claims for a moment . Wednesday night confirmed a dramatic shift , perhaps even a reversal , of the roles the two major parties have been identified with for several decades . For the first time , perhaps , since Vietnam , the Democratic Party is now the party of national security expertise\u2014not just in its own rhetoric , but in the eyes of national-security specialists on both sides . One of the most striking facts about the election of 2016 is that a sizable majority of Republican foreign-policy professionals appear to agree with Obama and Biden . They believe that Trump is a far greater danger to U.S. national security than Clinton is\u2014and many of them say they will even vote for her . And it \u2019 s the Democrats who are selling themselves as stronger , tougher and smarter than the Republicans when it comes to securing America \u2019 s place in the world .\nSo pronounced is this shift that some national-security experts say Trump , if elected , may have a lot of trouble filling top posts in his administration with qualified Republican officials . \u201c I don \u2019 t know any prominent national security person who \u2019 s signed up with Trump since he started , \u201d says Eliot Cohen , who served as counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in the George W. Bush administration . \u201c It \u2019 s the same cast of oddballs and has-beens and kooks he \u2019 s had before. \u201d Earlier this year Cohen co-authored a letter signed by 121 GOP national-security elites , saying Trump \u2019 s foreign policy \u201c is wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle . He swings from isolationism to military adventurism within the space of one sentence. \u201d Cohen says the number of defectors has only grown since then . \u201c A week doesn \u2019 t go by without more people wanting to sign on . \u201d\nFormer Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns , who has served in both Republican and Democratic administrations for decades , seconds that viewpoint . \u201c I served in every administration from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush , including all the Republican ones . I know tons of people at senior levels . I don \u2019 t know a single person who is working for him and is supporting him . There is deep , deep anguish among a lot of senior Republicans . Many are silently rooting for Hillary and will quietly vote for her , \u201d says Burns , who is now advising the Democratic candidate . \u201c This is not a reversal by the party , \u201d he says , \u201c but by one person , Trump . \u201d\nBurns says that the controversial news conference Trump gave earlier Wednesday\u2014when he said he might simply let Russia keep annexed Crimea , and even appeared to call on Moscow to launch another cyber-invasion of the U.S. to find Hillary Clinton \u2019 s \u201c 30,000 emails that are missing \u201d \u2014only confirmed the experts \u2019 worst expectations . \u201c He is contradicting major American strategy since Truman , the view held by every president of both parties , in particular the Republicans , that we are going to protect our power , we \u2019 re going to be the guardian at the gate . The Crimea quote today ! He \u2019 s turning Ronald Reagan on his head . This guy comes along with no experience , no historical memory , no understanding of the stakes involved , and he carelessly just gives it all up . Shameful . Shameful . \u201d\nDan Senor , a key foreign policy adviser to Mitt Romney in 2012 , says he also doesn \u2019 t \u201c know anyone who \u2019 s been in a serious position in a Republican administration in a national security role who \u2019 s comfortable saying , at least now , that they could work in his administration . \u2026 It \u2019 s never been like this before\u2014people saying , \u2018 Oh my gosh , this guy is inflammatory , he \u2019 s volatile , I have real questions about his temperament to the point that he shouldn \u2019 t ever be allowed to set foot in the Situation Room. \u2019 I \u2019 ve never heard that . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s views on foreign policy are eclectic , to say the least : He has called into question the post-World War II consensus on American global power ; he has forthrightly advocated torture ; and he has sometimes made statements that are provably false . \u201c NATO changed their whole program because of me , \u201d he said at his news conference on Wednesday , suggesting that NATO was coming around to his view that the alliance needs to focus on counterterrorism . But the shift he was referring to , the creation of a new post of assistant secretary general for intelligence , was in place before he came along , a NATO official told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in June . Trump has also called for upgrading \u201c NATO \u2019 s outdated mission and structure\u2014grown out of the Cold War\u2014to confront our shared challenges , including migration and Islamic terrorism , \u201d without acknowledging that NATO has been engaged in that very enterprise for at least a decade , especially in Afghanistan .\nAmong Trump \u2019 s odd-duck collection of foreign policy advisers is Joseph Schmitz , a former Pentagon inspector general who was once accused by Republican Sen. Charles Grassley , then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , of blocking investigations of Bush administration officials tied to Iraq and Afghanistan war contracts ; George Papadopoulos , a 2009 college graduate and an international energy lawyer ; and Carter Page , a former investment banker and global energy consultant with ties to Russian business . Asked on MSNBC \u2019 s \u201c Morning Joe \u201d in March who he talks with regularly about foreign policy , Trump responded , \u201c I \u2019 m speaking with myself , number one , because I have a very good brain and I \u2019 ve said a lot of things . \u201d\nSince June the GOP defectors have included former George H.W . Bush National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Richard Armitage , who has served in senior positions since the Reagan administration . They also include retired Navy Rear Admiral , John Hutson , who spoke at the Democratic convention on Wednesday and declared that Trump \u201c is not fit to polish John McCain \u2019 s boots , \u201d in a pointed riposte to Trump \u2019 s earlier insult to McCain for being a prisoner of war in Vietnam .\nSome Republican opponents of Trump see him , oddly enough , as a follow-on to the president the GOP candidate says he despises for his weakness , Barack Obama , whom they also consider weak . `` America 's allies have already been shaken and stirred by the Obama administration \u2019 s lack of constancy and confidence , \u201d says one prominent former GOP national security expert . \u201c A President Trump would shake these alliances to their foundation and Trump would likely be the worst foreign-policy president since Carter . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s somewhat ironic that if Hillary Clinton does indeed become America \u2019 s first female president , then \u201c the best mother in the whole world \u201d \u2014as Bill Clinton , in his paean to his wife Tuesday night , called her\u2014 will no longer be representing what political wags have long called the \u201c mommy party , \u201d at least when it comes to national security .
