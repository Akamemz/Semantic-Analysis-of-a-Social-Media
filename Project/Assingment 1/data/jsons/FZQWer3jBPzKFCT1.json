Gore raised questions about the accuracy and fairness of American election results .\nStory Hinckley/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Deborah West and her husband , Doug , were elated last night when their candidate , former Mayor Pete Buttigieg , won their local precinct 's caucus . But overnight , it became clear that state party leaders weren \u2019 t nearly so sure about the results . \u201c I woke up this morning thinking , \u2018 Oh dear , Iowa . What have you done ? \u2019 \u201d sighs Ms. West , who has been caucusing here for decades .\nAt issue is not only which candidate won , but how the nation will react to yet another high-profile challenge to the civic trust that is a pillar of any democratic society . But Iowa \u2019 s botched caucuses can also be seen as an opportunity , galvanizing everyone from local officials to the federal government to urgently address election vulnerabilities .\n\u201c This is a preview of the kind of things that could go wrong in November when the stakes will be higher and emotions will be hotter , \u201d says Richard Hasen , author of \u201c Election Meltdown : Dirty Tricks , Distrust , and the Threat to American Democracy , \u201d which is out today . \u201c What happened yesterday was a wake-up call . We have nine months to make things better . \u201d\nAt 5 p.m. Tuesday , the Iowa Democratic party chair apologized and said officials \u201c were going to take the time we need to verify the results. \u201d With 62 % of the precinct results , Mr. Buttigieg had a narrow lead with 27 % of state delegate equivalents , with Sen.

Amy Klobuchar came in fifth .\nTo be sure , many aspects of the Iowa caucus were run flawlessly , and officials are cautioning against impatience and overreaction . But a decentralized electoral system is only as strong as its weakest link .\nExperts say there are reforms states can make to ensure greater accuracy and security .

It needs attention and it \u2019 s under attack . \u201d\nTo Democratic leaders on the ground in Ankeny , a fast-growing suburb of Des Moines , last night \u2019 s caucus went better than ever in terms of organization .\nMary McAdams , chair of the Ankeny Area Democrats , says they ran 23 flawless precincts . \u201c The only fly in the soup is this app , \u201d she says , referring to the state Democratic Party \u2019 s new tool for tallying caucus results . \u201c We did our job on the ground ! \u201d\nDespite having nearly 50 % more people turn out than in 2016 , the check-in process was so seamless that many of the Ankeny caucuses were able to start right at 7 p.m. , instead of taking up to an hour to register participants as usual . That was thanks in part to having more volunteers and better training .\nSo the caucus chairs of Ankeny \u2019 s 13th precinct , Kelsie Goodman and Megan Albaugh , both employees at the local high school , woke up surprised by this morning \u2019 s news trumpeting Iowa \u2019 s failure .\nStory Hinckley/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 In her first caucus since moving back to Iowa , Holly Fettinger ( left ) entered Ankeny 's 13th precinct on Feb. 3 , 2020 , undecided about which candidate to back . After spending some time talking to different candidates ' supporters , she settled on Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar , whom she says she had a \u201c good feeling '' about all along .\nMs. Albaugh said the app worked well and helped her do the math easily . Yes , she had a difficult time loading a photo of the spreadsheet they work on , but it was faster than doing it all by hand \u2013 especially given the two-inch-high stack of new registrants .\n\u201c We want to make sure all of our T \u2019 s are crossed and I \u2019 s are dotted , \u201d says Ms. Albaugh . \u201c Do you want accurate results or fast results ? \u201d\nThe Iowa Democratic Party revised its caucus rules and procedures this year as a result of complaints from people from the Bernie Sanders camp , who were angered by the lack of transparency in 2016 . The app was supposed to help with the new way of tallying three different categories of results , but many people on the ground are frustrated that it was rolled out without adequate training and testing . Many local chairs reported having trouble using the app , and when they tried to call their results in , they were put on hold \u2013 sometimes for hours .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t understand why an untested app was introduced when we should have been more focused on building credibility and building faith in our process , \u201d says Angie Hagerty , a Sanders ambassador for Ankeny \u2019 s 13th precinct .\nShe is especially concerned about how this has marred the caucuses in the eyes of young people and other first-time participants . Her college-aged daughter who caucused for Senator Sanders in Iowa City texted her asking , \u201c Does my vote even count ? The world is laughing at us . \u201d\n\u201c I said , \u2018 Honey , you stood up for what you believed in , and you went and caucused . That \u2019 s what \u2019 s important . \u2019 \u201d\nEven before the delay and malfunction , many Democrats were up in arms about Iowa \u2019 s outsize influence on the election . Though it has a growing minority population , Iowa \u2019 s 91 % white population is not reflective enough of the party \u2019 s diversity to warrant the weighty role it plays in winnowing the presidential field , critics contend .\nSupporters counter that the state provides small , intimate spaces for the candidates to connect with voters and hone their message through retail politics .
