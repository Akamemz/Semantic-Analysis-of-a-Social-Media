There were more than 13,000 gun homicides in the US in 2015 , across nearly 3,500 cities and towns . But the toll of this gun violence was not distributed equally . Half of America 's gun homicides in 2015 were clustered in just 127 cities and towns , according to a new geographic analysis by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , even though they contain less than a quarter of the nation \u2019 s population .\nIn 2015 , there were more than 13,000 gun homicides throughout the US \u2026 New York Chicago Oakland Baltimore St Louis New Orleans \u2026 but half of those deaths were in just 127 cities , which contain almost a quarter of the population New York Chicago Oakland Baltimore St Louis New Orleans\nEven within those cities , violence is further concentrated in the tiny neighborhood areas that saw two or more gun homicide incidents in a single year . Four and a half million Americans live in areas of these cities with the highest numbers of gun homicide , which are marked by intense poverty , low levels of education , and racial segregation . Geographically , these neighborhood areas are small : a total of about 1,200 neighborhood census tracts , which , laid side by side , would fit into an area just 42 miles wide by 42 miles long . The problem they face is devastating . Though these neighborhood areas contain just 1.5 % of the country \u2019 s population , they saw 26 % of America \u2019 s total gun homicides . Gun control advocates say it is unacceptable that Americans overall are `` 25 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than people in other developed countries '' . People who live in these neighborhood areas face an average gun homicide rate about 400 times higher than the rate across those high-income countries . Understanding this dramatic clustering of America \u2019 s of gun violence is crucial for the effort to save more lives . \u201c We can \u2019 t do much about crime prevention of homicide if we try to attack it as a broad , global problem , throwing money at it in a sort of broad , global way , \u201d said David Weisburd , a leading researcher on the geographic distribution of crime at George Mason University . America \u2019 s gun policy debate is usually driven by high-profile mass shootings that seem to strike at random , and it focuses on sweeping federal gun control or mental health policies . But much of America \u2019 s gun homicide problem happens in a relatively small number of predictable places , often driven by predictable groups of high-risk people , and its burden is anything but random . The concentration of gun homicides in certain census tracts mirrors what criminologists have discovered when they look at crime patterns within individual cities : roughly 1.5 % of street segments in cities see about 25 % of crime incidents , a trend dubbed \u201c the law of crime concentration \u201d . \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s new geographic analysis is the first time that gun homicides nationwide have been mapped down to the census tract level , researchers said . This new approach was made possible with the geocoded data collected since 2014 by the not-for-profit Gun Violence Archive , which tracks shootings and gun deaths using media reports . The FBI \u2019 s national crime data only provides gun murder statistics down to the city level , which masks the clustering of violence within neighborhoods .\nCase study : St Louis Let 's take a look at St Louis , which has the highest gun murder rate of any large city in the country . continue scrolling\nIf every 2015 gun homicide in St Louis were distributed randomly , it would look something like this . But if you live in St Louis , you know that \u2019 s wrong . This is what the pattern of gun homicides in the city actually looks like . Homicides are concentrated in areas of high poverty . And the lowest educational attainment . And the neighborhoods forged out of decades of racial segregation .\nThe clear dividing line you see between areas with many gun homicides and few gun homicides is Delmar Boulevard , which has developed over time into a rigid racial boundary that carves the city in two . For the greater part of the 20th century , racial housing covenants , discriminatory lending practices and \u201c white flight \u201d imposed de facto segregation as pronounced as any ever achieved by Jim Crow on St Louis \u2019 black residents . Even today , some residents treat Delmar Boulevard as a line they do not want to cross . In May , a group of parents canceled a kindergarten Little League game held in a park north of Delmar Boulevard , telling the opposing team that they were \u201c uncomfortable with the location \u201d of their home field , a decision a home team parent called \u201c racist \u201d .\nGun violence is a regressive tax that falls heaviest on neighborhoods already struggling with poverty , unemployment , and failing schools . The unequal burden of violence is also marked by intense racial disparities . \u201c It \u2019 s not about race , per se , it \u2019 s about how other conditions are racialized , are racially inequitable , \u201d said Lauren Krivo , a Rutgers University sociologist who studies the geography of race and crime . Most people don \u2019 t understand \u201c how few predominantly white communities have conditions that are anywhere near the levels of disadvantage that are common in non-white communities , and particularly black communities , \u201d she said .\nNew York , New York 2015 gun homicide incident Percent below 100 % poverty line 80 40 0 Percent without high school degree 80 40 0 Percent black 100 50 0 In New York , a city of eight million people , only 1.5 % of census tracts saw two or more gun homicide incidents in 2015 . That \u2019 s a much lower percentage than St Louis , where a shocking 44 % of census tracts saw multiple gun homicides in 2015 . Compared with St Louis , New York also has much broader swathes of the city that saw no gun homicides at all . New York City \u2019 s murder rate of about four murders per 100,000 people is neatly in line with the national average . Baltimore , Maryland 2015 gun homicide incident Percent below 100 % poverty line 80 40 0 Percent without high school degree 80 40 0 Percent black 100 50 0 Gun homicides spiked in Baltimore in 2015 , leaving the city with its highest-ever recorded murder rate . But the increased homicides remained concentrated , with largely white neighborhoods almost completely exempt from the rising violence . 92 % of Baltimore \u2019 s gun murder victims in 2015 were black men , according to local police department statistics . Chicago , Illinois 2015 gun homicide incident Percent below 100 % poverty line 80 40 0 Percent without high school degree 80 40 0 Percent black 100 50 0 In 2015 , Chicago had the highest total number of gun homicides of any city in America . But the city 's gun homicide rate per person was much lower than St Louis . Just 13 % of census tracts in Chicago saw multiple gun murders in 2015 , and these tracts were responsible for 65 % of the city \u2019 s gun homicides . Oakland , California 2015 gun homicide incident Percent below 100 % poverty line 80 40 0 Percent without high school degree 80 40 0 Percent black 100 50 0 The most concentrated gun homicide areas in Oakland cluster far from the city center , in the long stretch of East Oakland known as the flatlands . Though Chicago \u2019 s population is nearly seven times larger than Oakland \u2019 s , the two cities showed similar levels of gun homicide concentration . In both cities , nearly 70 % of all census tracts saw no gun homicides , and the 13 % of census tracts that saw multiple gun homicides were responsible for the majority of the city \u2019 s fatal gun violence . New Orleans , Louisiana 2015 gun homicide incident Percent below 100 % poverty line 80 40 0 Percent without high school degree 80 40 0 Percent black 100 50 0 22 % of New Orleans census tracts saw multiple gun homicides , and these areas were responsible for more than 75 % of the murders . The concentration of violence in New Orleans is closest to the concentration in Baltimore .\nWithin most high-gun homicide cities , victims of gun murder are overwhelmingly black men . This dramatic disparity has persisted for decades , even as cities have seen sharp increases and decreases in murder rates , according to FBI gun murder data .
