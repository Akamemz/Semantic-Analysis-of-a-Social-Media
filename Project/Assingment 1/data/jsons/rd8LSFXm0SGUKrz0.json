    "content": "Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said Sunday there was no danger in sending children back to school amid the coronavirus pandemic and stood by a threat to withhold federal funds from schools that do not resume in-person classes .\n`` There 's nothing in the data that suggests that kids being in school is in any way dangerous , '' DeVos told `` Fox News Sunday '' host Chris Wallace . `` We know that children contract and have the virus at far lower incidence than any other part of the population , and we know that other countries around the world have reopened their schools and have done so successfully and safely . ''\nPresident Donald Trump has also pointed to other countries that had successfully reopened their schools , specifically citing Germany , Denmark , Norway and Sweden in a tweet last week .\nWallace pointed out that those countries have far fewer daily cases of COVID-19 than the U.S .\n`` Is it really fair , is it reasonable to compare the situation in countries that have 20 new cases in a day with a country that has 68,000 new cases in a day ? '' he asked .\n`` Well , we 're talking about schools and other countries ' experiences with reopening schools . And it has been shown to be very successful , '' DeVos said .\n`` But schools happen in an environment , '' Wallace replied . `` If there 's 30 cases in a country , that 's very different than a place where it 's out of control and there are 70,000 new cases in a day . ''\nThough cases are on the rise in nearly every state , DeVos said the places that are `` out of control '' were `` the exception . '' She said that when hot spots do appear , they have to be `` dealt with differently . ''\nSchools that do not reopen should not be eligible for federal assistance , she said .\n`` Under what authority are you and the president going to unilaterally cut off funding , funding that 's been approved from Congress and most of the money goes to disadvantaged students or students with disabilities ? '' Wallace asked , adding it would make more sense for the funds to be used to make the schools safer .\n`` Look , American investment in education is a promise to students and their families . If schools are n't going to reopen and not fulfill that promise , they should n't get the funds , and give it to the families to decide to go to a school that is going to meet that promise , '' DeVos replied .\nTrump said that the guidelines on reopening schools that were issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were `` very tough , '' `` expensive '' and `` impractical . ''\nCan Trump do that ? : FAQ on CDC guidelines , federal funding for schools during coronavirus\nDeVos said the guidelines were only recommendations that were meant to be `` helpful '' for educators determining how to reopen .\n`` We know that schools across the country look very different and that there 's not going to be a one-size-fits-all approach to everything , '' she said .\nDeVos argued the mental health consequences children might suffer from missing school outweighed the concern about the virus , since children are infected at a lower rate , do n't tend to suffer from serious complications and `` a lot of data that suggests that kids are not spreaders .
