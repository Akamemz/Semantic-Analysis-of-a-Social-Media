    "content": "On Super Tuesday , Joe Biden broke the narrative that had defined the Democratic primary race . The surprise wasn \u2019 t that he won , though that was unexpected . It \u2019 s that he won new voters in a high-turnout election \u2014 almost every state saw a turnout surge , and a Washington Post analysis suggests Biden won 60 percent of voters who didn \u2019 t cast a ballot in 2016 .\n\u201c We increased turnout , \u201d Biden said in his victory speech . \u201c The turnout turned out for us ! \u201d\nThis is a result that requires some rethinking . Before Super Tuesday , the conventional wisdom was simple . Bernie Sanders was the turnout candidate , and Biden the uninspiring generic Democrat . You could see this in Sanders \u2019 s packed rallies , his die-hard social media brigades , his army of individual donors \u2014 and in Biden \u2019 s inability to match those markers of enthusiasm . If new voters flooded the primary , it would be proof that Sanders \u2019 s political revolution was brewing . But if the political revolution failed and turnout stagnated , Biden might slip through . What virtually no one predicted was Biden winning a high-turnout contest . But he did .\nSo what did the narrative get wrong ? As someone who believed that narrative , what did I get wrong ?\nIn conversations over the past week , I \u2019 ve heard a few theories . I am not saying I fully believe these arguments , but given that some of them directly implicate my own blind spots , they \u2019 re worth considering .\nBiden \u2019 s speech patterns offend the media . Voters don \u2019 t really care .\nBiden has lost a step rhetorically . In debates , his answers have , to put it gently , a meandering quality . He loses his place , says the wrong thing , mixes up words , free associates . Without engaging the question of whether this reflects a lifelong stutter or a more worrying decline , the simple fact is that Biden performs worst on the metric that media professionals judge most harshly , and most confidently : clarity of communication .\nBut over and over again , we \u2019 ve seen that voters just don \u2019 t care that much about malapropisms and meandering rhetorical styles . Books \u2014 yes , plural ! \u2014 were published mocking George W. Bush \u2019 s garbled sentences . And Bush looks like Cicero compared to Donald Trump \u2019 s word salad . This , for instance , is a direct transcription from a 2015 Trump rally :\nLook , having nuclear \u2014 my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer , Dr. John Trump at MIT ; good genes , very good genes , okay , very smart , the Wharton School of Finance , very good , very smart \u2014 you know , if you \u2019 re a conservative Republican , if I were a liberal , if , like , okay , if I ran as a liberal Democrat , they would say I \u2019 m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world \u2014 it \u2019 s true ! \u2014 but when you \u2019 re a conservative Republican they try \u2014 oh , do they do a number \u2014 that \u2019 s why I always start off : Went to Wharton , was a good student , went there , went there , did this , built a fortune \u2014 you know I have to give my like credentials all the time , because we \u2019 re a little disadvantaged \u2014 but you look at the nuclear deal , the thing that really bothers me \u2014 it would have been so easy , and it \u2019 s not as important as these lives are ( nuclear is powerful ; my uncle explained that to me many , many years ago , the power and that was 35 years ago ; he would explain the power of what \u2019 s going to happen and he was right \u2014 who would have thought ? ) , but when you look at what \u2019 s going on with the four prisoners \u2014 now it used to be three , now it \u2019 s four \u2014 but when it was three and even now , I would have said it \u2019 s all in the messenger ; fellas , and it is fellas because , you know , they don \u2019 t , they haven \u2019 t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men , so , you know , it \u2019 s gon na take them about another 150 years \u2014 but the Persians are great negotiators , the Iranians are great negotiators , so , and they , they just killed , they just killed us .\nJournalists who \u2019 ve based their professional lives on clear , crisp , stylish communication find it shocking when candidates get lost in rhetorical mazes of their own construction . But both Bush and Trump won the presidency . And Ronald Reagan won reelection in a landslide , even though he couldn \u2019 t recall what city he was in during the first presidential debate and admitted to being \u201c confused . \u201d\nBiden \u2019 s most visible weakness in day-to-day campaigning , in other words , is a weakness the media consistently overrates , at least when it comes to election outcomes .\nLurking beneath the theory that high turnout would disadvantage Joe Biden is what we might call the \u201c disappointed nonvoter thesis. \u201d Scratch a political devotee and you \u2019 ll almost always find the same theory of turnout underpinning their plans : If only a candidate would say what I already think but louder . This reflects the disappointment that the very engaged have with their leaders : Practicing politicians have to appeal to mixed constituencies to win reelection or pass anything in Congress , and so they compromise their beliefs , sand down their edges , trim their ambitions .\nThe politically engaged perennially argue that the way to mobilize the nonvoters is to offer a clearer choice , rather than a muddled echo . Under this theory , Bernie Sanders is the clear turnout candidate , as his sharper and more ambitious agenda can mobilize nonvoters who don \u2019 t think either party speaks for them . Conversely , Biden is the business-as-usual choice .\nIn general , this strategy disappoints . The most famous \u201c choice , not an echo \u201d candidate , Barry Goldwater , lost in a landslide . And he \u2019 s the rule , not the exception . Political scientists have long found that more ideologically extreme candidates face an electoral penalty . There \u2019 s some evidence that the penalty is weakening , but as Matt Yglesias documents , it has not disappeared .\nA 2018 paper by Andrew Hall and Daniel Thompson looked at US House elections between 2006 and 2014 and concluded that moderates performed better . The mechanism here is interesting : The study finds that more extreme candidates do drive turnout , but \u201c extremists appear to activate the opposing party \u2019 s base more than their own. \u201d In other words , they drive more countermobilization than mobilization .\nA possible explanation is that the politically engaged are relying too heavily on introspection when thinking about the politically disengaged . The Knight Foundation just conducted a huge survey of \u201c chronic nonvoters \u201d and found , as many studies have before , that chronic nonvoters aren \u2019 t more liberal or conservative than voters in general \u2014 they were more mixed in their political beliefs and simply less interested in politics . Nonvoters were , for instance , a bit more conservative on immigration than voters :\nThey were somewhat less likely to say the 2020 election is unusually consequential :\nImportantly , for those who believe nonvoters want a more transformational and disruptive agenda , they were somewhat less likely to say the country is on the wrong track :\nBigger differences could be found in their political information habits . Nonvoters were a lot likelier to say they didn \u2019 t follow political news closely :\nAnd they were likelier to grow up in households that didn \u2019 t follow political news closely :\nOne of the easiest and most common fallacies in politics is to imagine that one \u2019 s own political reactions are generalizable . But there \u2019 s no evidence that a more sharply ideological agenda and a more conflict-driven theory of politics will turn out nonvoters . That \u2019 s often what the most politically active voters find mobilizing , but the most politically engaged are , by definition , quite different than the least politically engaged , and so there \u2019 s no reason to believe that what the two groups want are the same .\nThe misperceptions here are likely compounded by Twitter , which has an outsize role in shaping how both media and political elites perceive politics but misrepresent the electorate . A February Pew study found that Democrats on Twitter were significantly more conflict-oriented than Democrats off Twitter , and perhaps for that reason , Democrats on Twitter were significantly more likely to support Sanders or Elizabeth Warren over Biden than Democrats off Twitter . This held true even when looking at Americans who leaned Democratic but weren \u2019 t registered to vote .\nThis is not to say that Biden is likely to turn out scores of chronic nonvoters . I don \u2019 t think he is . But it helps explain why the turnout he did generate among normal Democrats wasn \u2019 t swamped by nonvoters activated by Sanders \u2019 s message .\n2020 is a referendum on Trump , not on the Democratic agenda\nIn his new book Un-Trumping America , Pod Save America \u2019 s Dan Pfeiffer writes that \u201c The biggest divide in the Democratic Party is not between left and center . It \u2019 s between those who believe once Trump is gone things will go back to normal and those who believe that our democracy is under a threat that goes beyond Trump . \u201d\nThe Democratic debates have , for obvious reasons , featured Democratic candidates arguing with each other . Differentiating from each other means going beyond their shared differences with Trump . At almost every debate , the various candidates say that it \u2019 s not enough to simply beat Trump \u2014 you need a bigger agenda , a more inspiring vision . \u201c We \u2019 re trying to transform this country , not win an election , not just beat Trump , \u201d Sanders told Rachel Maddow .\nBiden is the closest thing to a candidate who disagrees . His tagline is that he \u2019 ll \u201c beat Trump like a drum. \u201d He routinely gets criticized by liberals for saying things like \u201c History will treat this administration \u2019 s time as an aberration , \u201d or \u201c This is not the Republican Party. \u201d His answers trade heavily on nostalgia for the Obama administration , which is to say , for the pre-Trump status quo . It \u2019 s basically as close to the Democrats \u2019 2018 congressional strategy as a presidential campaign can run .\nThis annoys leftists who think the Obama administration was characterized by neoliberal half-measures and liberal analysts who think , like Pfeiffer does , that Trump is a symptom , not the cause , of America \u2019 s political crisis . If you read my profile of Biden , you \u2019 ll know I side with the critics on this one . But most Democrats seem to agree with Biden . As CNN noted , \u201c Majorities of Democratic voters in every Super Tuesday state said they would prefer a nominee who can beat Trump over one with whom they agree on the issues . \u201d\nBiden has run almost as a generic Democrat , framing the election as a choice between Donald Trump and Barack Obama . As I \u2019 ve written before , I find this frustrating , as Obama is not on the ticket , but it has a certain political logic . The single scariest fact for Democrats in 2020 is that economic confidence is higher than it \u2019 s been since 2000 :\nLiberals can give you chapter and verse on how the economy is actually worse than it seems , and I think a lot of those arguments are correct . In particular , surveys that measure the strength of the economy may miss the pressures of the affordability crisis . Still , Democrats have to face the fact that there are a lot of voters who are happy with the economy and just don \u2019 t like Trump . Biden \u2019 s pitch to them , basically , is that he \u2019 ll remove Trump from office but not do anything drastic to alter economic trends . That may be a better strategy than much of the left believes .\nDemocrats have a difficult task in 2020 . Trump is the incumbent amid , for now , a growing economy . Presidents almost never lose under those conditions . Moreover , Trump has a significant advantage given the country \u2019 s electoral geography : It \u2019 s entirely possible the Democrat could once again win more votes and lose the Electoral College .\nAnd Democrats are not , in my view , playing it safe . The field has winnowed down to a 77-year-old icon of the Democratic establishment who has trouble expressing himself and a 78-year-old democratic socialist who just had a heart attack . And both of them are crisscrossing the country holding public events amid the outbreak of a virus that \u2019 s particularly dangerous for older Americans . There were , in my view , a number of less risky choices in the Democratic field , but voters rejected them .\nOf course , Trump is a risky choice for Republicans . Despite the strong economy , he has never broken 50 percent in polling averages . He lost the popular vote in 2016 , led Republicans to electoral wipeout in 2018 , and got himself impeached in 2019 . His White House has been chaotic , he is more rhetorically reckless than Biden , and he is also a septuagenarian in middling physical health .\nOn Super Tuesday , Biden showed that a campaign that has been singularly uninspiring to the most engaged sliver of the electorate was able to turn out the most voters . Those of us who didn \u2019 t see it coming need to rethink our priors .\nSuper Tuesday winnowed the 2020 Democratic primary race down to two candidates : Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders .
