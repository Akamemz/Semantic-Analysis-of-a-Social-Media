Ending the war was the top priority for progressives .\nAt that time , a centrist senior Democratic aide pulled me aside and told me that my lefty friends and I were being irrational . Democrats could not push to end the war in Iraq or , in fact , take any steps to roll back the ever-burgeoning Pentagon budget .

Despite the calls to oppose the president on every front , the overwhelming majority of Democrats voted to massively increase the Pentagon \u2019 s budget , this time by more than $ 80 billion annually , fulfilling one of Trump \u2019 s campaign promises . Only four Democrats \u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand , Patrick Leahy , Jeff Merkley , and Ron Wyden \u2014 voted , along with Bernie Sanders , against the bill . They were joined by three Republicans : Bob Corker , Mike Lee , and Rand Paul .

In a country with millions of people still lacking basic social welfare , the budget is a bloated disgrace . Nearly half of this public money feeds the bottom lines of defense contractors .\nMany of these corporations have been fined for defrauding the government , yet they still get to line up every year , hat in hand , and walk away with billions of dollars . The Poor People \u2019 s Campaign noted in their Moral Budget that \u201c one contractor alone , Lockheed Martin , took in more than $ 35 billion in Pentagon contracts in 2018 \u2014 nearly as much as the entire $ 40 billion budget for the State Department and USAID combined. \u201d The Project on Government Oversight has tracked at least eighty-eight instances of misconduct by Lockheed Martin , resulting in nearly $ 768 million in penalties since 1995 .\nEveryone in Washington knows this .

Bernie Sanders offered an amendment before the Senate went on break that would cut the Pentagon \u2019 s budget by 10 percent in order to \u201c create a federal grant program to fund health care , housing , childcare and educational opportunities for cities and towns experiencing a poverty rate of 25 % or more . \u201d\nWhile the federal government could \u2014 and obviously should \u2014 create this program without cutting funds to anything , this amendment puts into stark view the policy choices Congress is making .\nThe likelihood of this amendment receiving the required sixty votes is infinitesimal , but the coalition emerging behind it demonstrates Sanders \u2019 s continued influence . Even though they voted for Trump \u2019 s defense increase in 2017 , Massachusetts senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey signed on as cosponsors of this amendment .\nA greater sign of the mainstreaming of this position took place on Friday afternoon when Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer took to Twitter to proclaim his support for the Sanders \u2019 s amendment , writing , \u201c Proud I fought alongside @ SenSanders to ensure we vote in July on his amendment to cut $ 740B defense budget by 10 % and put $ $ into priorities like health care , housing , childcare in communities with 25 % + poverty \u2014 including many communities of color . . .
