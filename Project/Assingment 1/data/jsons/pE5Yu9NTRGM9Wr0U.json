    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) For the last week , America has been told that its President is a `` dope '' and `` a child , '' an `` idiot '' and a man whose decaying mental faculties and refusal to read makes him dangerously unfit for the Oval Office .\nThe uproar sowed by Michael Wolff 's bestseller `` Fire and Fury '' left Donald Trump needing a counter-narrative and to project an image of control , authority and an even temperament .\nOn Tuesday , he largely pulled it off in a freewheeling meeting on immigration with Republican and Democratic leaders that he conducted for 55 minutes before the cameras .\nThe President took a victory lap on Wednesday at a Cabinet meeting , welcoming reporters `` back to the studio . ''\n`` Actually it was reported as incredibly good and my performance -- some of it called it a performance , I consider it work -- but , it got great reviews by everybody other than two networks who were phenomenal for about two hours , '' Trump said .\nThe President also claimed news anchors sent the White House congratulatory letters about the meeting but then were told to cool their praise by their bosses .\nThe next step in Trump 's image repair strategy will come later Wednesday , when he takes questions alongside the Norwegian prime minister .\nTrump is likely to face questioning about a court decision Tuesday night that added urgency to the immigration issue : a federal judge 's decision to temporarily block his administration 's efforts to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program .\nInviting cameras into the Cabinet Room of the White House , Trump held court for 55 fascinating and politically charged minutes as a freewheeling debate unfolded among key Republican and Democratic leaders on immigration .\nTuesday 's unexpected encounter that showcased Trump 's flair for drama and his capacity to create a unexpected , reality show-style look behind the scenes of Washington bargaining . And it was perhaps Trump 's most effective effort yet to harness the theatrics and symbolism of the presidency to position himself as the dominant player at a key political moment -- a skill he was slow to master in a tumultuous first year in office when his erratic behavior alienated many voters .\nA senior administration official told CNN 's Jeff Zeleny that conducting the meeting on camera helped Trump to `` seize the megaphone '' and to show engagement in policy and was designed partly to lay to rest the `` hyperventilation about him . ''\nYet the compelling back-and-forth also exposed some of the President 's liabilities , notably a hazy command of policy details , a tendency to adopt multiple , contradicting positions on key issues at the same time as well as his habit of misrepresenting the facts in service of his political views .\nFor instance , Trump said he would sign a `` clean '' immigration bill , but at one point said it had to include a border wall , and then said a wall would n't have to be along the full border .\nStill , Trump , seated between top Democrats Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland , projected a picture of confidence and flexibility , posing as the epitome of bipartisanship and civility while living up to his self-image as someone who is always on the lookout for a deal .\nHe was clearly able to follow the debate , and mount a defense of his own controversial positions -- on a border wall , for example -- without causing obvious offense , and appeared magnanimously open to other viewpoints .\nFor sure , it 's a low bar for a president . Those who reach the White House have often been among the cream of their generation , lauded for wisdom , steely dispositions and possessing the presence to redirect the political winds .\nTrump 's capacity to avoid playing into Wolff 's portrayal of his character will be tested when he faces questions alongside the leader of Norway .
