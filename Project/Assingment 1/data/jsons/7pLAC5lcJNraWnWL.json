Even though he threw in some jokes , Clinton consistently told the Democratic delegates and the television viewers to `` listen . ''\n`` You all are having fun , '' he said at one point . `` But this is serious . I want you to listen . ''\nHe talked about the need for compromise and how Obama is committed to `` constructive cooperation . '' He talked about Obama 's record \u2014 at length and with many numbers . He offered a rebuttal of Republican attacks and a detailed discussion of Republican policies . Finally , he gave Obama an unflinching endorsement , and he received an equally unequivocal endorsement from the crowd .\nThat said , the speech was delivered with typical Clinton charm . Everything was explained with a folksy disposition that kept the crowd engaged .\nIsrael Is A Touchy Subject For Democrats : The party platform became a distraction today for Democrats . On orders from the president , delegates voted to amend the platform to include both a reference to God and to declare that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel .\nIt took three voice votes to get those changes approved , and it was met with many delegates shouting `` no ! '' and with loud boos when the motion was deemed to have passed .\nExpect to hear more on this story in the upcoming days .\nWomen Are Democrats ' First Health Care Defense : The Obama campaign is relying on women to try to one-up Republicans on the health care debate . At every turn they have used women to defend Obamacare and at every turn they have tied women to health care .\nTonight , a diverse group of women \u2014 from Sandra Fluke , the woman whom Rush Limbaugh called a `` slut '' in a debate over contraception , to Sister Simone Campbell , the nun on the bus who took on Paul Ryan 's budget , to Cristina Saralegui , the so-called Hispanic Oprah \u2014 all provided defenses for Obamacare .\nBecause of Obama , we heard over and over , `` being a woman is no longer a pre-existing condition . ''\nBank of America Stadium Was Too Exposed : Whether it was because of the chance of rain or because of the chance of a less-than-packed stadium , Democratic National Convention officials decided that Thursday 's acceptance speech by President Obama would move indoors to the much smaller Time Warner Cable Arena , which has hosted the first two nights of the convention .\nRepublicans immediately said Democrats were changing the venue because they could n't fill it . Democrats said it was because of the chance of thunderstorms and that like the `` 65,000 people who signed up for community credentials , '' they were disappointed .\nWeather.com says Charlotte can expect scattered showers on Thursday with a 40 percent chance of rain .\nA Surprise Appearance By The President Is Always Effective : Aside from Clinton and a softly delivered , but fiercely populist speech from senatorial candidate Elizabeth Warren , Wednesday was a sleepy night .\nBut as soon as word that President Obama was going to make a surprise appearance spread through the hall , the energy changed .
