FedEx , Nike , Pepsi and Bank of America all lined up against the name , which was given to the franchise in 1933 when the team was still based in Boston .\nThe team said it is \u201c retiring \u201d the name and logo and that Snyder and coach Ron Rivera are working closely to develop a new moniker and design .
