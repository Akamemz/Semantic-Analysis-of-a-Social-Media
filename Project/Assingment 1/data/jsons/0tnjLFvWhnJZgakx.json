But a Government Accountability Office report released Monday detailed not only the secretary 's involvement but that of a White House adviser .\nAccording to the report , though HHS officials said they were `` not aware '' of any federal government officials outside the agency soliciting funds for Enroll America , a representative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation told GAO `` about a discussion '' in 2012 between one of their staffers and the `` Deputy Assistant to the President for Health Policy . ''\nThough not named in the report , this would have been Jeanne Lambrew . The GAO said they were told the official nudged the foundation to give a `` significant '' contribution .\nThe report said : `` According to RWJF , this official estimated that Enroll America or other similar national enrollment organizations would likely need about $ 30 million to finance a national outreach effort . RWJF told us that the official also indicated a hope that RWJF would provide a significant financial contribution to support such efforts , but did not make a specific funding request on behalf of Enroll America or any other outside entity .
