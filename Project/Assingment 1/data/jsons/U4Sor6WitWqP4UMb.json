    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Robert Mueller 's career has put him at the center of some of the biggest events of the past several decades .\nBefore investigating President Donald Trump , he headed the FBI for longer than any director other than J. Edgar Hoover , whose name adorns the bureau 's headquarters in the nation 's capital . He headed the agency during the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , the start of the Iraq War and the leaking of NSA documents that revealed how the government was conducting widespread surveillance of Americans .\nBut that legacy could very likely be overshadowed by his work heading the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election links between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign , a job that kept him in a uniquely intense political spotlight for nearly two years .\nMueller announced Wednesday that he was resigning from the Justice Department , bringing an end to two years of secretive work that led to indictments against dozens , including several members of Trump 's inner circle .\nWhat comes next for Mueller , who until Wednesday had stayed silent during the investigation , remains unknown .\nEditorial : Robert Mueller speaks , but this should n't be his last word on Donald Trump\nThe special counsel 's office declined to say what Mueller would do next or whether he would go back to working for the WilmerHale law firm , where he was a partner before he was selected to run the Russia investigation . Mueller said Wednesday that he is `` resigning from the Department of Justice and returning to private life . ''\nBut Mueller is far from the only individual tapped to head a high-stakes investigation into a sitting president and his administration . A look at past investigators shows nearly all produced a behind-the-scenes look at their work in books and memoirs and many continued their legal career , going on to work high-profile cases and win awards . This examination offers a possible road map for what Mueller could do next .\nHere 's a look at others who have been designated to investigate presidents throughout modern history and what they did after their work was completed :\nThe Watergate scandal generally refers to the all-encompassing series of scandals that engulfed President Richard Nixon starting with the June 17 , 1972 , failed break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington 's Watergate office complex . Five men , including four Cuban exiles affiliated with the CIA and James McCord , the security director of Nixon 's 1972 re-election committee , were caught inside the DNC offices with bugging equipment and photographs .\nMore : Donald Trump , Richard Nixon and Watergate : What 's the same and what 's different ?\nBy the time Nixon resigned and left office on Aug. 9 , 1974 , the scandal had become a catalog of many of Nixon 's abuses of power , including FBI wiretaps of 17 government officials and journalists , a 1970 plan to relax internal security procedures to track suspected subversives , the existence of a secret White House special investigations unit called the Plumbers , the secret bombing of Cambodia and a wide-ranging dirty tricks program run by the Nixon 1972 campaign team against potential Democratic opponents .\nIn May 1973 , Archibald Cox was appointed special prosecutor by Attorney General Elliot Richardson to investigate potential crimes stemming from the Watergate break-in and the subsequent White House cover-up of its involvement .\nCox quickly angered the Nixon White House with demands for documents and secret tapes of Nixon 's conversations in the White House , the existence of which was revealed in July 1973 . At the time , no one knew just how damning the tapes were or that they included proof Nixon tried to cover up the Watergate burglary and halt the investigation .\nOn Oct. 20 , 1973 , Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Cox .\nRichardson refused and resigned . Nixon then asked Richardson 's deputy , William Ruckelshaus , to fire Cox . He , too , refused and resigned . Solicitor General Robert Bork , the No . 3 official in the Justice Department , agreed to fire Cox , reasoning that Nixon would just roll through the entire department until he found someone willing to get rid of Cox .\nThose firings , called the Saturday Night Massacre , increased calls for Nixon 's impeachment .\nWhat resulted : Cox was only on the job for five months . After he was dismissed , calls intensified for Nixon 's impeachment and led to the president appointing a second special prosecutor .\nWhat he did after : After the investigation , Cox taught at both Harvard and Cambridge universities . He authored several books on law and the Constitution but notably did not write a book about his time heading the Watergate probe .\nHe was also asked to help the state of Massachusetts in 1976 to restructure its judicial system and help deal with a backlog of criminal cases . He also argued several cases before the Supreme Court .\nHe later went on to head the government watchdog group Common Cause , which pushes for accountability and transparency in politics . Cox held the position until 1992 .\nWhere he is now : Cox died of natural causes in 2004 at the age of 92 .\nAfter Cox was dismissed , Leon Jaworski was appointed on Nov. 1 , 1973 . Jaworski continued the investigation and the hunt for audio tapes of Nixon 's conversations . He oversaw the indictments of dozens of individuals , including top aides to the president .\nWhat resulted : The impasse between the White House and Jaworski over the tapes made its way to the Supreme Court , which ruled in July 1974 that Nixon must hand them over .\nThe tapes included the so-called `` smoking gun '' recording of Nixon telling administration officials to ask the heads of the CIA and FBI to stop investigating the Watergate break-in . The release of the tapes was followed by Republicans abandoning the president and Nixon 's resignation in August 1974 .\nBy the end of the investigation , dozens had been charged and Jaworski named Nixon an `` unindicted co-conspirator . ''\nWhat he did after : Jaworski came back to Washington in 1977 to help Congress in its investigation of `` Koreagate , '' an investigation into whether members of the House had been bribed by Korean officials wanting to influence Congress .\nHe also authored three books , including one released shortly after Watergate that chronicled his time investigating Nixon .\nJaworski went back to work for the law firm Fulbright & Jaworski , where he was made a partner well before Watergate . He never stood foot in a courtroom following his successful Supreme Court argument for Nixon 's tapes , according to The Washington Post .\nWhere he is now : Jaworski died in 1982 at the age of 77 .\nThe Iran-Contra affair put a cloud over the tail end of Ronald Reagan 's presidency . The plan spanned throughout the 1980s and included the Reagan administration secretly selling arms to Iran , despite a congressional ban on such activity .\nThe administration then illegally used proceeds to fund anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua , known as the Contras , during Nicaragua \u2019 s civil war .\nThe covert operation burst into public view toward the end of 1986 after a CIA plane was shot down in Nicaragua . An independent counsel was appointed to investigate the scandal .\nWalsh , a Republican and early supporter of Reagan , was named independent counsel in 1986 to investigate the administration 's role in the covert arms deals and participation in the Nicaraguan war .\nOver his seven-year investigation , which also stretched into the presidencies of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton , Walsh found `` regardless of criminality , President Reagan , the secretary of state , the secretary of defense , and the director of central intelligence and their necessary assistants committed themselves , however reluctantly , to two programs contrary to congressional policy and contrary to national policy . They skirted the law , some of them broke the law , and almost all of them tried to cover up the President 's willful activities , '' Walsh wrote in the 1993 report .\nWhat resulted : Walsh 's investigation led to criminal charges against 14 people , mostly within the Reagan administration and CIA , and led to 11 convictions , many of which were either overturned or led to pardons by President Bush , which angered Walsh and his team .\nThose charges included Reagan 's secretary of defense and national security adviser but Reagan was never charged as Walsh did not find proof of a crime or that the president was fully aware of the sales .\nWhat he did after : In 1998 , five years after he issued his report on the investigation , Walsh published a book , Firewall : The Iran-Contra Conspiracy and Cover-Up , chronicling the investigation and the lengths officials , including Reagan , went to cover up the scandal .\nLater , in 2003 , Walsh authored an autobiography that detailed how a `` C student from a middle-class background used his self-doubts to great advantage , '' the summary reads .\nWhere he is now : Walsh died in 2014 at the age of 102 .\nBill Clinton 's legal issues started well before the election that made him president . In 1978 , when Clinton was Arkansas ' attorney general , he joined with others , including his wife , Hillary , under the Whitewater Development Corp. to purchase about 220 acres in the Ozark Mountains hoping to build and sell vacation homes .\nThe deal went sour and some of those surrounding it were accused of illegal activity and charged with crimes . The Clintons were accused of benefiting financially and thus , in January 1994 , one year into Clinton 's presidency , Robert Fiske Jr. was named special prosecutor to investigate the deal .\nBut as the probe continued and Fiske was replaced with Ken Starr , the investigation expanded into Clinton 's private sex life and an affair he 'd had with White House intern Monica Lewinsky .\nFiske , a Republican , was appointed as special prosecutor in January 1994 to investigate the Whitewater land deal and the death of White House Counsel Vincent Foster , who was a longtime friend of the Clintons and wrapped up in the Whitewater deal .\nWhat resulted : Fiske issued an interim report in June of 1994 concluding that Foster 's death was a suicide and clearing the Clintons of accusations they tried to influence an investigation related to the Whitewater deal .\nTwo years before Fiske was appointed , a law concerning independent counsels had lapsed . The lapse allowed Fiske to be named a special prosecutor and appointed by Clinton 's attorney general , Janet Reno , instead of by a panel of three judges as the independent counsel law called for . In 1994 , Congress revived the independent counsel law .\nA panel of judges reexamined Fiske 's appointment in August 1994 and instead named Ken Starr as independent counsel\nWhat he did after : Fiske returned to practicing law at the Davis Polk law firm , where he was a partner . He worked on a series of high profile cases , including representing the NFL in an antitrust lawsuit and Exxon after the 1990 Arthur Kill oil spill that allowed more than 500,000 gallons of oil into the water in New York and New Jersey .\nHe has received various awards over the years , including an Award for Professionalism and Ethics by the American Inns of Court in 2016 .\nFiske authored a memoir , `` Prosecutor Defender Counselor '' in 2014 where , for the first time , he discussed the Clinton investigation in extensive detail .\nWhere he is now : Fiske retired as a partner at Davis Polk law firm but continues to serve as a senior counsel in the firm 's litigation department . In May , Fiske spoke on a panel about special counsel investigations .\nStarr was given broad authority to investigate not only Whitewater but other controversies , including a lawsuit filed by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones alleging Clinton , Arkansas ' former governor , had sexually harassed her .\nThe lawsuit led investigators to Clinton 's sex life and Monica Lewinsky . As part of the suit , Clinton was deposed and said under oath that he never had sexual relations with Lewinsky .\nMore : Clinton 's impeachment : 20 years later , where are the key figures from the historic battle ?\nClinton claimed his testimony was accurate based on the definition of sexual relations given during his testimony . Lewinsky , who cooperated with investigators , provided physical evidence of the affair and investigators were given secretly recorded tapes of Lewinsky discussing the affair .\nClinton 's claim that his testimony was correct opened the door for Starr 's team to explain in graphic detail why it was not . The report , which was released to Congress and the public in 1998 , included embarrassing and lewd details of his sexual escapades with Lewinsky .\nWhat resulted : Along with graphic details of Clinton 's sex life , the Starr report also included 11 impeachable offenses , grounds that Starr said could be used to oust Clinton from office .\nImpeachment proceedings were approved by the House in December of 1998 but in February 1999 , the Senate acquitted Clinton of the charges after it failed to reach a majority vote . Starr 's investigation and the details in his report were criticized in the aftermath of the probe .\nWhat he did after : After the investigation , Starr went back to practicing law and has worked for several firms . He worked on a number of high-profile cases , including representing Blackwater , a private military contractor , and Jeffrey Epstein , a billionaire accused of rape and molestation .\nStarr was appointed president of Baylor University in 2010 , but was fired in 2016 amid allegations the school ignored reports of sexual assault on campus . He then resigned as chancellor .\nWhere he is now : In 2018 \u2014 20 years after releasing the Starr report \u2014 Starr released a memoir , `` Contempt : A Memoir of the Clinton Investigation , '' chronicling his work investigating Clinton .\nHe frequently appears on Fox News , where he has offered his insights on the Mueller investigation .\nPresident George W. Bush 's presidency was also clouded by the work of a special counsel after someone within the administration leaked the name of a CIA agent .\nIt started in 2002 when CIA officer Valerie Plame wrote a memo discussing her husband , a former diplomat , going to Niger to investigate whether Iraq had been attempting to purchase uranium from the country .\nHer husband , Joseph Wilson , authored an opinion piece in the New York Times saying the Bush administration was exaggerating the threat by Iraq , which the U.S. invaded after the 9/11 attacks .\nAfter the piece , syndicated columnist Robert Novak authored a story in 2003 about Wilson and was leaked Plame 's name , writing that she suggested sending Wilson , her husband , to Niger for the story . The story included Plame 's name and work within the CIA , quoting administration officials , and appeared to be an effort to discredit Wilson 's criticisms of the Bush administration .\nVarious officials have been blamed for leaking Plame 's name to the media , including White House political adviser Karl Rove and Vice President Dick Cheney . The investigation led to subpoenaing journalists and even the jailing of reporters who would not identify who leaked Plame 's name to them .\nThen-attorney general John Ashcroft recused himself from heading an investigation into the leak and Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed special counsel in December 2003 .\nWhat resulted : Only one person was indicted in the inquiry : Lewis `` Scooter '' Libby .\nLibby worked as Cheney 's chief of staff and was charged in 2005 with lying to investigators and obstructing justice by making false statements to take the investigation off course .
