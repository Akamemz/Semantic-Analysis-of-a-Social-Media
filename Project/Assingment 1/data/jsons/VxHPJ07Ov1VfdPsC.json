Klausutis asked that the company remove a tweet by the president \u2018 alluding to the repeatedly debunked falsehood that my wife was murdered by her boss , former U.S. Rep. Joe Scarborough. \u2019 ... Later in the day , Twitter for the first time prompted readers to check the facts in tweets sent by Trump , warning readers his claims about mail-in ballots were false and had been debunked by fact checkers. \u201d Reuters\n\u201c Mr . Trump always hits back at critics , and Mr. Scarborough has called the President mentally ill , among other things . But suggesting that the talk-show host is implicated in the woman \u2019 s death isn \u2019 t political hardball . It \u2019 s a smear . Mr. Trump rightly denounces the lies spread about him in the Steele dossier , yet here he is trafficking in the same sort of trash . Rep.

This is the tragic death of a young woman , and a family that is being further traumatized by a President too selfish and too cruel to see what he is doing\u2026\n\u201c At root , this is about human decency . Do we want to live in a world in which a powerful person can use the death of a private individual to score political points ? Is that the sort of thing that we now are willing to say is OK , roll our eyes and chalk it up to \u2018 politics ? \u2019 Not me . There 's a line that we as citizens of this country and the world -- and not of any political party -- need to draw . Always .

The president maintains he doesn \u2019 t watch , although this is plainly untrue . The collateral damage is the family of Lori Klausutis , who had to endure her sudden loss and now watch helplessly as the president pushes a deception about her death for his own petty purposes . It \u2019 s unworthy of a partisan blogger , let alone the president of the United States . \u201d\n\u201c Trump is sending out tweets promoting a false conspiracy theory and also retweeting misogynistic content while the US is in the middle of a pandemic . His goal is to \u2018 punish \u2019 Joe Scarborough , incite his base , and to distract the public\u2026 Count how many tweets he has denigrating others ( including falsely accusing them of murder ) , and how many tweets he has disseminating helpful information to the public about the pandemic .
