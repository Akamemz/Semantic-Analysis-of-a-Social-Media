Stanton Evans that \u201c We have two parties here\u2026 . One is the evil party and the other is the stupid party. \u201d Evans , who passed away in 2015 , added \u201c I \u2019 m very proud to be a member of the stupid party . \u201d\nThanks to CNN , college professors , union leaders , New York Times columnists , and people named Streisand , Colbert , De Niro , and Dunham ( Lena , not Jeff ) you \u2019 d be forgiven for believing that the GOP is extremely stupid while the Democrats are barely evil at all .\nThe truth is the reverse : the evil perpetrated on the American electorate by Democrats is truly enormous . Indeed it is so omnipresent that many Americans have become inured to it , the evil as much a part of everyday life as the sun rising in the east .\nIn the economic sphere , the unexpected election of Donald Trump has already allowed us to understand just how evil Democratic policies truly are .\nWhen the law is one man using \u201c a pen and a phone , \u201d there is no foundation on which to build or expand a business . Instead entrepreneurs sit on a thin crust atop a pool of quicksand , afraid to move for fear of upsetting their precarious positions .\nWho would start a new bank , or make a loan to a small business , in the age of Dodd-Frank empowering hyperactive regulators to create and enforce any rule they like ? Thanks to Democrats , the only people who can get loans in 2016 are those who don \u2019 t really need them .\nWho would buy and develop land that has a semi-permanent puddle on it , knowing that Obama \u2019 s EPA might classify it as a wetland to be protected at a greater cost than the homes you were thinking of building ?\nWho , other than already-enormous companies , can navigate the FDA quagmire to gain the approval of a new life-saving drug \u2014 a drug which must then carry an exorbitant price tag to recover the regulatory costs of bringing it to market ? ( This is one example of why very large corporations don \u2019 t object to regulation as much as small companies do . )\nAs if the regulatory evil isn \u2019 t bad enough , the Democrats also crush economic growth through fiscal sins :\nWhen health care and higher education and food and housing are \u201c free \u201d for so many , the cost borne by those who have the misfortune to be productive members of society ( or , even more immorally , by our children ) , the economy struggles along with little growth or opportunity . Indeed , Barack Obama will likely be the first president since the Great Depression not to preside over a single year with at least 3 percent GDP growth .\nSadly , many Americans have become partially numb to the Democrats \u2019 economic evil through repeated exposure to revisionist terminology such as \u201c the new normal. \u201d The left \u2019 s apologists tell us that we can never go back to economic freedom and the opportunities that come with it . They tell us that without regulating every aspect of our economic lives , humans will destroy the planet and each other because we are inherently bad ( and stupid ) people . They tell you that \u201c inequality \u201d and \u201c social justice \u201d require that you sacrifice your productive life , your entrepreneurial aspirations , your desire to improve your situation and that of your children , to their financially and spiritually impoverishing ideology .\nFar too many have come to believe the left \u2019 s lies and manipulations , but the election of Donald Trump may be a once-in-a-generation wake-up call to throw off the shackles of economic evil .\nIt \u2019 s generally not easy to measure the impact of terrible economic policies . After all , there is no parallel universe of the same economy operating under better policies to compare with . Or at least there hasn \u2019 t been until now .\nBut the 2016 election has given us a glimpse into such a universe based on the reaction of financial markets to an election result that almost nobody expected . The latter point is crucial : The fact that markets saw a Trump victory as extremely unlikely means that one can reasonably attribute almost all of the change in the prices of stocks and yields of bonds since the election to market participants \u2019 assessments of what Trump \u2019 s policies portend for economic growth ( in excess of the dismal expectations under the likely-until-Election-Day continuation of Obamanomics by Hillary \u201c Lurking in the Woods \u201d Clinton . )\nSince the election , the yield on the US Government \u2019 s 10-year note has spiked upwards from about 1.86 % to 2.48 % as the market screams to investors \u201c You \u2019 ll finally have better things to do with your capital than loan it to the government for a decade at less than 2 percent interest per year ! \u201d\nTypically , a sharp jump in long-term rates is accompanied by serious pain in the stock market .

That is nearly two trillion dollars more in the retirement accounts and investment accounts and college savings accounts of tens of millions of Americans , from the multi-millionaire demonized by Democrats to the pensions and 401 ( k ) s of teachers and auto workers and political columnists .\nAnd this is all before our next president has even taken office .\nDonald Trump , due no doubt to his background in business rather than politics , has demonstrated a greater understanding than any other politician in memory of the devastation caused by over-regulation and internationally non-competitive corporate tax rates .\nIt was remarkable to hear a presidential candidate campaign against regulation with more passion than even the most free-market-oriented Tea Party candidate for Congress .
