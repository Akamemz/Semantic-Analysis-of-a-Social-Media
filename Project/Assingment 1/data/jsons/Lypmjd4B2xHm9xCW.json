    "content": "The University of Missouri paid a price for its activists \u2019 radicalism\nIn the maelstrom of the 2018 news cycles , a short report out of the State of Missouri attracted virtually no national attention . For the first time since 2015 , the University of Missouri posted an actual increase in freshman enrollment \u2014 4,696 students started their college life at Mizzou , up from 4,134 the year before . To be sure , total enrollment was still down by 5 percent since 2015 , but for the first time in three years , the state \u2019 s flagship university could make the case that it was primed for a comeback .\nMost readers probably think : A comeback from what ? After all , given the speed of the Trump-driven news cycle , 2015 feels like ancient history . When pressed , even the most politically obsessed might remember only the most basic details about a controversy at Mizzou \u2014 something about a football boycott . Oh , yes , and a viral video .\nThe world has moved on , but the University of Missouri has not .\nIt \u2019 s worth returning for a moment to the fall of 2015 . It \u2019 s worth pondering the lessons of arguably the most consequential campus protests since the Vietnam era . A flagship public university of a red state capitulated to unreasonable , far-left demands , and it paid a terrible price . When the social-justice warriors of Mizzou inflicted that pain , they did more to limit their influence in red America than the combined efforts of a generation of conservative writers sounding the alarm over campus intolerance .\nThe Mizzou controversy began like most campus controversies , with a level of anger that was incommensurate to the stakes of the dispute . A political battle that dominated headlines across the United States began with a cut to health benefits for graduate-student employees , a Facebook report from the student-association president that unknown individuals riding in a pickup truck had shouted racial slurs at him , and another shouted slur from a drunken man heckling an anti-racism rally .\nTaken together , the incidents were minor . In fact , the pickup-truck episode couldn \u2019 t even be tied to on-campus wrongdoers . But as so often happens , the incidents served as the spark that landed on dry kindling . A new generation of students brought up in the language of microaggressions and trained to believe that universities should serve as idyllic \u201c safe spaces \u201d decided that they were going to confront the administration and that they were going to win .\nThey started with the common tactics . There was a sit-in on October 6 . The university responded with a common capitulation : It expanded mandatory freshman diversity training to include all students , faculty , and staff .\nBut diversity training wasn \u2019 t enough . Unsatisfied , protesters interrupted the homecoming parade and were incensed when university-system president Tim Wolfe wouldn \u2019 t get out of his car to \u201c dialogue \u201d with angry students .\nThe university capitulated again . Wolfe apologized , and four days later he re\u00adstored the lost health benefits .\nIt still wasn \u2019 t enough . Students pressed their advantage . This time they demanded Wolfe \u2019 s resignation . The system president had to go .\nWhat happened next was bizarre . The campus was roiled by an utterly inexplicable and still-unsolved \u201c hate \u201d incident : Someone scrawled a swastika in feces on a dorm-bathroom wall . This was proof positive of the hostile racial climate , a climate that Wolfe could not fix .\nSo it was time for the age-old tactic of oppressed dissidents everywhere . On November 2 , a graduate student named Jonathan Butler launched a hunger strike . But even a hunger strike only raises an eyebrow . After all , did anyone really believe Butler would commit suicide over an obscure campus controversy ?\nFar more consequential was a decision made by the Missouri football team . On November 7 , its black players announced that they would boycott a pivotal game with Brigham Young University if Wolfe didn \u2019 t resign . By the next day , the rest of the team had joined them . No resignation , no game .\nIt \u2019 s difficult to adequately describe the ecstasy of sports media at that moment . ESPN dedicated enormous resources to covering the story . This was heroism . This was the perfect example of athletes \u2019 \u201c using their platform \u201d to push for social change . And the athletes got results . On November 9 , Wolfe resigned . Soon after , Mizzou chancellor Bowen Loftin resigned as well . The victory was complete . The student activists had won .\nBut something else happened on November 9 . At the same time that football fans across the United States were wondering why the SEC was held hostage to complaints about a \u201c poop swastika , \u201d they also became acquainted with a Mizzou professor named Melissa Click . In a viral video , she was shown aiding and abetting radical students in physically pushing journalists away from the student protests . \u201c I need some muscle over here , \u201d she famously said .\nTwo things happened at once . On the one hand , the Missouri protests galvanized a national movement . On campuses across the United States , student protesters were energized . They issued demands , collected scalps , and introduced the new lingo of \u201c woke \u201d protests to a country that was just beginning to understand the depth of leftist commitment to intersectionality and identity politics .\nOn the other hand , students began to vote with their feet , and they stampeded away from the University of Missouri . The 2015 freshman class at Mizzou was immense : Almost 6,200 first-year students flocked to the campus .
