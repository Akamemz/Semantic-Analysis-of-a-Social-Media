    "content": "President Obama 's nominee for the No . 2 spot at the Homeland Security Department on Thursday `` unequivocally '' denied allegations that he improperly helped a company run by Hillary Clinton 's brother obtain a visa , as Republicans boycotted his confirmation hearing over the matter .\nAlejandro Mayorkas , the director of U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , is under investigation by the department 's inspector general . Despite calls by Republicans to postpone it , he testified at his confirmation hearing Thursday morning before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .\nHe said he `` made no orders '' in these cases , and that he only offers guidance based on the `` facts '' and `` the law . ''\n`` I have never , ever in my career exercised undue influence to influence the outcome of a case , '' he said . He said he had `` no idea '' he was under investigation and `` quite frankly , I still do n't understand it . ''\nMayorkas encountered a largely friendly audience , as he dealt with questions from Senate Democrats .

Tom Coburn , R-Okla. , said in a statement .\nRepublicans , in a letter Wednesday to committee Chairman Sen. Tom Carper , D-Del. , claimed the news of the investigation took them by surprise . They said neither the White House nor Mayorkas had disclosed the existence of the probe to them before -- the investigation was first reported on Tuesday .\n`` We believe it is neither appropriate nor fair to consider the nomination of an individual under investigation , '' the lawmakers wrote . The letter was signed by Sens . John McCain , R-Ariz. ; Rob Portman , R-Ohio ; Ron Johnson , R-Wis. ; and Coburn . They said lawmakers would be hamstrung in asking about an ongoing investigation during the hearing , yet would need to know those details in order to fairly consider the nomination .\nSen. Charles Grassley , R-Iowa , also wrote committee leaders asking for a postponement `` until the facts are more fully developed . ''\nThe White House is doubling down on the pick , who if confirmed could temporarily lead the department . In a brief letter to Carper on Wednesday , White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler assured that the nominee underwent a `` thorough '' FBI background check before the nomination and `` we have no concerns about his suitability for this important position .

But as the probe progressed , `` subsequent allegations have been identified involving alleged conflicts of interest , misuse of position , mismanagement of the EB-5 program , and an appearance of impropriety by Mayorkas and other USCIS management officials .
