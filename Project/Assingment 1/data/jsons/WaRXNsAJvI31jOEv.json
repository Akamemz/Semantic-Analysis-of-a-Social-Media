    "content": "Harvey Weinstein Found Guilty Of Rape , Sexual Abuse In Mixed Verdict\nA Manhattan jury has found Harvey Weinstein guilty of rape and sexual abuse but acquitted him of the most serious charges , capping one of the most closely watched trials of the # MeToo era . The mixed verdict means the former Hollywood producer will likely spend time in prison .\nIt also is some measure of vindication for the six women who testified that Weinstein attacked and sought to intimidate them . Although he was acquitted of the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape , which might have put him in a cell for the rest of his life \u2014 the jury convicted him of third-degree rape and first-degree criminal sexual act .\nThe convictions stem from allegations by Miriam Haley , whose account was the basis of the criminal sex act charge , and Jessica Mann , whom the jury found had been raped by Weinstein .\nThe jury reached its decision after about 30 hours of deliberations over five days .\nWeinstein did not visibly react as the verdict was read Monday . But defense lawyer Arthur Aidala said that Weinstein turned to him and that `` all he kept saying is , 'But I 'm innocent . ... I did n't rape anyone . ' ``\nThe disgraced movie mogul was led from the court in handcuffs and was ordered to jail . Instead , he was taken to Bellevue Hospital for reasons that were n't immediately clear .\nHe could face decades in prison . It will be up to New York Judge James Burke to determine just how long the 67-year-old will be behind bars . Sentencing is set for March 11 .\nIn court , defense attorney Donna Rotunno asked Burke to grant bail on the condition that Weinstein continue to wear an ankle monitor , as he has done throughout the trial .\nCiting his `` significant medical issues , '' Rotunno said that Weinstein is `` receiving shots in his eyes so he does not go blind '' and that he is still recovering from an unsuccessful back surgery . Burke was n't swayed , though he did agree to request that Weinstein be housed in an infirmary unit .\nFollowing the verdict , Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. thanked the women involved in the case for pulling `` our justice system into the 21st century '' by demanding that Weinstein be held accountable for his actions , no matter how long ago .\n`` It 's rape despite the complicated dynamics of power and consent after an assault . It 's rape even if there is no physical evidence and even if it happened a long time ago , '' said Vance , who also called Weinstein a `` vicious serial sexual predator . ''\nWeinstein 's legal team says it intends to file an appeal and request bail as quickly as possible , according to Aidala . He said defense attorneys are confident that a slew of what he called `` appellate problems '' will ultimately overturn the jury 's verdict .\n`` There 's not a doubt in my mind that if his name was Harvey Jones or Harold Jones , he would not have even been charged on this evidence , '' Aidala said . `` The evidence here was just not that strong .
