    "content": "Jon Stewart has been on the interview circuit to promote his new film , \u201c Rosewater , \u201d but many of his comments have turned to partisan politics and the pundits who encourage them . Interviewers have not been able to resist the urge to talk about Stewart \u2019 s thoughts on the midterm elections , on immigration , and on the legacy of Obama . But what has been really interesting to watch is Stewart \u2019 s comments on Fox News and on commentators like Sean Hannity and Bill O \u2019 Reilly .\nIn a recent interview with Rolling Stone , Stewart explained that most of Fox News is about fear . Fox News viewers , he explained , operate in a world where they have a high sense of being persecuted , and this is why , for instance , we will soon see pieces on the \u201c War on Christmas \u201d with commentators standing next to 60-foot-tall Christmas trees . But not all Fox News commentators are equal in Stewart \u2019 s eyes . He considers O \u2019 Reilly to be more like a \u201c Kennedy Democrat \u201d who comes by his views honestly . Not so with Hannity , whom Stewart describes as \u201c probably the most loathsome dude over there. \u201d He describes Hannity as espousing \u201c pure cynicism \u201d : \u201c Everything is presented in as devious a manner as it could possibly be presented . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth remembering that from the moment that Fox News was founded in 1996 the goal was to offer a partisan view of the news . David Brock and Ari Rabin-Havt in `` The Fox Effect '' explain in detail how Roger Ailes turned the cable channel into a propaganda machine . And once the channel launched , all other cable news responded . Few recall that Ann Coulter used to work for MSNBC before Fox was founded . It \u2019 s hard to imagine it in the blue versus red world we live in now .\nThree years after Fox News used the slogan \u201c fair and balanced \u201d to promote a channel that had no intention of being either , Jon Stewart took over \u201c The Daily Show \u201d and he has been using satire news as a foil for Fox News ever since .\nStewart has the crazy idea that we should treat the citizens of our nation with respect and that we should offer accurate and informed news to help educate an active and engaged democracy . Meanwhile on Fox News it is common to see pundits attack major segments of our society while misinforming their viewers .\nEvidence of these tactics was in place in the Nov. 14 interview between Stewart and O \u2019 Reilly on \u201c The O \u2019 Reilly Factor. \u201d O \u2019 Reilly began the interview introducing Stewart as a \u201c big-time liberal commentator \u201d and focusing on the midterm elections . He asked Stewart to explain why the Democrats lost and Stewart responded with a very non-partisan answer : \u201c Because they curled up in a little ball and tried to make sure that nobody hit them . I have no idea what they even ran on. \u201d But Stewart \u2019 s answer wasn \u2019 t what O \u2019 Reilly wanted to hear . So he offered his own analysis : The Democrats lost \u201c because the callow youth that watches your program didn \u2019 t show up , \u201d he said to Stewart .\nCallow youth ? First of all , all the data suggests that the millennials , the main demographic for Stewart 's show , did show up . At 21.3 percent they voted at the same percentage as last midterm . And this despite the very real challenges they have to actually casting votes . These young people juggle jobs and classes that make finding the time to get to the voting booths a real challenge . Add to that the voter ID regulations and lack of early voting options designed to suppress their vote .\nSecond of all , it is hard to understand how O \u2019 Reilly can refer to Stewart \u2019 s young viewers as callow stoners when they also volunteer at a higher rate than boomers . And they score higher in knowledge of political issues than viewers of Fox News . So if they are all stoned , it isn \u2019 t affecting their ability to keep track of the facts and give back to their country .\nThis sort of misrepresentation is legion on Fox News and makes its viewers the most misinformed in our nation . A fact-checking site found that Fox News only tells the truth 18 percent of the time . In contrast , the satirical comedians like Stewart , Stephen Colbert and John Oliver have been proven to accurately inform their audiences even though they are not news shows .\nAnd despite the hype , it is not Stewart , Colbert and Oliver who are stirring up the partisan spin . Sure they attack Fox News , sure they call out the outrageous positions of many Republicans , but they go after the Democrats too . Stewart \u2019 s post midterm election coverage included a bit called \u201c Obama and the Pussycrats. \u201d That \u2019 s far from subtle .\nIn contrast , Hannity paid $ 300,000 for a portrait of Obama burning the Constitution . And when he was asked to respond to Stewart \u2019 s comments about him from Rolling Stone for Politico Hannity was quick to attack : `` Jon 's problem is he has his head so far up Obama 's ass he can not see clearly , he is obviously better suited to reading his joke writers material , and making his clapping seal audience happy. \u201d No wonder Stewart said he had no interest in having Hannity ever appear on his show .\nThese exchanges have shown that Fox News propaganda is hitting new highs . The parallel between these interviews and the subject of a free press covered in \u201c Rosewater \u201d should not escape us . Iran may have put Maziar Bahari in prison for his reporting , and Stewart may be free to critique Fox News , and yet we have much in common . If Stewart started his interviews explaining that his film was about fundamentalist ideologues pretending to be sources of news , but instead spouting propaganda and misinforming the public , you might think he made a movie based right here on our home turf .",
