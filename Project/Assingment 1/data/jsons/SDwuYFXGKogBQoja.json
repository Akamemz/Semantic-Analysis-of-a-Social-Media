    "content": "Democratic lawmakers , operatives , and commentators are calling for the defunding or abolition of America 's police departments in the wake of officer Derek Chauvin 's killing of unarmed black man George Floyd .\nWhile the proposal is popular among the party 's progressive activist wing and on Twitter , it faces a hard wall of resistance among the wider public . A recent YouGov poll showed that fewer than 20 percent of Americans of all parties supported any cutting of police funding\u2014a finding consistent with decades of polling .\nPolice defunding or abolition has long been a key idea of the radical left , with advocates arguing that the use of state force should be replaced with more equitable redistribution and investment , to target `` root causes '' of crime rather than responding to it after the fact . That view appears to have risen to the upper echelons of the Democratic power structure\u2014without , however , growing notably more popular among voters .\nNational leadership , meanwhile , has sought to either distance itself from defunding\u2014as in the case of presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2014or define the idea away as simply shuffling funding , as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) did Monday . Those moves reflect a lack of consensus between leadership and the base , and within the progressive activist coalition itself , as to what defunding actually entails .\nSuch caution from party leadership suggests that while it is popular in the streets , defunding the police is unlikely to have staying power at the federal level . Rather , it is more likely to go the way of other radical proposals like the abolition of ICE , which was quietly memory-holed when polling revealed its electoral unviability .\nPolice abolition 's unpopularity is bipartisan : The YouGov poll found that just 16 percent of Americans favor cutting police funds , including 16 percent of Democrats , 14 percent of Clinton voters , and only 33 percent of black people . Data from the General Social Survey stretching back to 1984 find that fewer than 20 percent of white , black , and Hispanic respondents believe that police should be given less money , never mind defunded altogether .\nThat 's consonant with broad support for police generally . As of 2017 , 9 in 10 black , white , and Hispanic Americans opposed reducing the number of police officers in their community . More recent data indicate that police continue to maintain majority support among Americans and are widely considered among the most trustworthy institutions in the country .\nThese figures are surprisingly out of sync with both the words and actions of prominent Democrats\u2014part of a broader shift among those in the party looking to signal their distance from or hostility to cops and prove their progressive credentials .\nA number of prominent figures have explicitly called for defunding or abolition of police . Rep. Rashida Tlaib ( D. , Mich. ) emphasized on Twitter the need to `` # DefundPolice , '' while Brian Fallon\u2014former national press secretary for Hillary Clinton and former public affairs director for Attorney General Eric Holder\u2014took to Twitter to write `` defund the police . ''\nAlongside Fallon and Tlaib , those joining the `` defund '' drumbeat include Women 's March cofounder and prominent anti-Semite Linda Sarsour , leftist organizations like the Sunrise Movement and Working Families Party , and even leading progressive prosecutors like San Francisco 's Chesa Boudin .\nAt the state and local level , Democrats are taking concrete steps . A majority of members of the City Council of Minneapolis\u2014where Floyd lived\u2014announced over the weekend their plans to `` begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department . '' Council members have made the media rounds to defend their plans\u2014with council president Lisa Bender calling fears about public safety a product of `` privilege '' \u2014while Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey was booed at a Minneapolis protest when he refused to back the same proposal .\nLos Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti , meanwhile , has promised to slash $ 150 million from the LAPD 's budget ; New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed to do the same . And some Democratic state legislators in New York , California , and Minnesota have returned donations from police and corrections officers , rejecting what they call a `` vested interest in continuing the incarceration of Black and brown people . ''\nRepublicans are eager for Democrats to voice their views on the issue .\n`` Every single Democrat in the country must answer to whether he or she agrees with this radical idea to rid communities of the women and men in blue who put their lives on the line to keep Americans safe , '' Dave Abrams , deputy executive director for the Republican State Leadership Committee , told the \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` Silence is part of the problem , isn \u2019 t it ? Time for Democrats to speak up . ''\nSome less-radical Democrats have sought to distance themselves from calls for defunding . Biden , through a spokesman on Tuesday , emphasized that he `` does not believe that police should be defunded , '' instead focusing on the `` urgent need for reform . '' Pelosi , asked about the idea during an appearance on MSNBC , said that defunding the police really means `` spend [ ing ] the resources we have in a way that gives the most protection to the American people '' \u2014effectively avoiding any commitment to budget cuts .\nTheir reticence may be because both represent the more moderate wing of the Democratic party , the one which primary voters handed an overwhelming mandate in their selection of Biden over Sen.
