With the global case toll rising steeply , face masks flying off store shelves , borders around the world closing , and meetings , cruise itineraries , and the global economy upended by the virus , it \u2019 s no wonder questions and fears are swirling about Covid-19 , as the disease is known .\nOn March 11 , the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic , a new disease that has spread around the world . Many countries have seen reported cases of the virus rise within their borders \u2014 and that includes the US .\n\u201c We will see more cases , and things will get worse , \u201d Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told members of the House Oversight Committee on March 11 . \u201c How much worse \u2026 will depend on our ability to do two things : to contain the influx in people who are infected coming from the outside and the ability to contain and mitigate within our own country . \u201d\nSpread of the virus and the slow rollout of testing mean reported case numbers are changing quickly . Meanwhile , outbreaks have been surging in South Korea , Italy , and Iran . With the new virus continuing its tour around the world , here are answers to your most burning questions .\n1 ) What is this new coronavirus , and where did it come from ?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that typically attack the respiratory system . The name comes from the Latin word corona , for crown , and the ancient Greek kor\u014dn\u00e8 , meaning garland or wreath , because of the spiky fringe encircling these viruses . Most coronaviruses infect animals , such as bats , cats , and birds . Only seven , including Covid-19 , SARS , and MERS , are known to infect humans .\nSARS is thought to have evolved from infecting bats to civet cats to humans in China ; MERS evolved from bats to camels to humans in the Middle East . No one knows precisely where Covid-19 came from , though a leading hypothesis is that bats were once again the original source : They spread the virus to another animal species , possibly a pangolin , where it jumped to humans .\nTwo of the seven coronaviruses that infect humans , SARS and MERS , can cause severe pneumonia and even death in 10 and more than 30 percent of cases , respectively . But others lead to milder symptoms , like a common cold . The most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever and dry cough .\nNo one knows the precise incubation period for the virus , but symptoms can show up anywhere from one day to two weeks after exposure , according to a WHO report on China \u2019 s response .\nAt the moment , we know Covid-19 can cause pneumonia and that it too can kill \u2014 but while it seems to be less deadly than SARS and MERS , it \u2019 s not yet clear by precisely how much .\nSome of the best evidence on the question comes from a February 16 China Center for Disease Control report looking at the outcomes of the first 72,314 patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 in mainland China . It \u2019 s the largest such analysis to date , and it found an overall case fatality rate of 2.3 percent \u2014 lower than both SARS and MERS . ( The case fatality rate , or CFR , is the proportion of deaths a disease causes within a group of people who have the disease . )\nThe researchers also discovered a huge variation in the case fatality rate by age group . In short , the virus appears to be deadlier in people with each passing decade . You can see the trend in this graph :\nOverall , the researchers characterized 81 percent of the cases as mild and 19 percent as severe or critical .\nOne major caveat , though : This data comes from mainland China . And the case fatality rate has been different outside of China .\nAt the same time , there \u2019 s also evidence of asymptomatic cases . And it \u2019 s possible that as we discover more of these cases , Covid-19 will look less deadly . That \u2019 s because infectious diseases typically look more severe when they \u2019 re first discovered since the people showing up in hospitals tend to be the sickest . Disease modelers who account for this under-counting of cases currently estimate an overall case fatality rate of just over 1 percent .\nAs for symptoms : Fever , dry cough , and fatigue are most common , while thick mucus from coughs , shortness of breath , sore throat , and headache are less common , according to China \u2019 s data .\nBut the picture might change as data on symptoms emerge from other countries . For example , a yet-to-be published German paper looked at some of the country \u2019 s earliest confirmed Covid-19 patients . Researchers found symptoms in this small sample often resembled a cold . So only two of the nine patients had a fever , and seven had a cough , but just as common were symptoms like stuffy nose , runny nose , and sneezing .\n3 ) What should I do if I think I have Covid-19 ?\nIf you \u2019 re in a high-risk group \u2014 over the age of 60 with an underlying health condition \u2014 seek medical treatment immediately , and let your hospital or health care provider know you suspect Covid-19 before showing up .\nOtherwise , stay at home and call a health professional , \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Umair Irfan explained : \u201c They will work with your local health department and figure out whether you need to get tested or get treatment . Doctors and health officials advise not to go to the emergency room if your symptoms do not appear to be life-threatening. \u201d There \u2019 s a good chance you \u2019 ll recover with nothing more than rest and fluids . But you will need to self-isolate while sick to avoid spreading the disease to others , including any people in your home . Here \u2019 s how to do it .\nThe CDC and the WHO recommend several basic measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 : Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds .\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue , then throw the tissue in the trash .\nContact a health worker if you have symptoms ; fever and a dry cough are most common .\ntouch your face . DON \u2019 T travel if you have a fever and cough .\ntravel if you have a fever and cough . DON \u2019 T wear a face mask if you are well . Guidance may change . Stay informed , and stay safe , with \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s guide to Covid-19 .\nAnd if you are healthy , here are some ways you can help vulnerable people in your community .\nWe don \u2019 t yet know exactly how SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease \u2014 spreads , but we do have a lot of data on how MERS , SARS , and other respiratory viruses move from person to person . And that \u2019 s mainly through exposure to droplets from coughing or sneezing .\nSo when an infected person coughs or sneezes , they let out a spray , and if these droplets reach the nose , eyes , or mouth of another person , they can pass on the virus , said Jennifer Nuzzo , an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security . In rarer cases , a person might catch a respiratory disease indirectly , \u201c via touching droplets on surfaces \u2014 and then touching mucosal membranes \u201d in the mouth , eyes , and nose , she added .\nThere \u2019 s also emerging evidence showing that SARS-CoV-2 may spread through poop \u2014 known as the \u201c fecal-oral \u201d route of disease transmission . Researchers are on the lookout for potential airborne transmission , too , and there \u2019 s a lot of speculation about whether inanimate objects \u2014 like door handles \u2014 can pass on the virus .\nIn the case of airborne transmission , a person would get infected by directly inhaling droplets suspended in the air from an infected individual . With \u201c fomites \u201d \u2014 objects that can transmit infections \u2014 droplets from an infected person would end up on surfaces another person touches . \u201c So far , there is no conclusive evidence of that , \u201d wrote Megan Murray , a Harvard Infectious Disease specialist , in a coronavirus explainer , \u201c although that is challenging to prove one way or the other . \u201d\nWhat we do know : More and more research is piling up to suggest people who have only mild symptoms , or no symptoms at all , can test positive for Covid-19 disease . The virus also appears to be present in the body at very high levels early on in an illness , when people are still going to work or traveling .\n\u201c We still don \u2019 t know to what extent people without symptoms can infect , \u201d Nuzzo cautioned . And Isaac Bogoch , a professor at the University of Toronto told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c even if there have been cases of asymptomatic transmission of this infection , those will be typically rare cases , and with just about every other respiratory tract infection known to humankind , those are not the people who are driving an epidemic . \u201d\nEven so , if this virus can spread from people with no or mild symptoms , it might help explain why it \u2019 s so contagious . Researchers currently believe one person with Covid-19 generally infects two to more than three others , which would make the new coronavirus more transmissible than seasonal flu , SARS , and MERS . That \u2019 s why social distancing measures are so important .\n5 ) What should I do to protect myself ? Buy a face mask ?\nIn the US , just about every health expert \u2588\u2588\u2588 has spoken to has said there \u2019 s little evidence to support the use of face masks for preventing disease in the general population .\nMasks are only useful if you have a respiratory infection already and want to minimize the risk of spread to others , or if you \u2019 re caring for someone who is sick or working in a hospital in direct contact with people who have respiratory illnesses . ( Plus , there are reports of runs on masks and other supplies that health workers need to stay safe . If they can \u2019 t get them and start walking off the job , we \u2019 re all in trouble . )\nThat \u2019 s why the CDC advises against the use of masks for regular Americans . The best thing you can do to prevent all sorts of illnesses , CDC \u2019 s Nancy Messonnier said , is \u201c wash your hands , cover your cough , take care of yourself , and keep alert to the information that we \u2019 re providing . \u201d\nIndividuals at a higher risk of developing severe disease \u2014 the elderly , people with underlying health conditions \u2014 should take additional precautions : avoiding crowds and contact with people who are sick , and stocking up on medicines and groceries , Messonnier said .\nThe WHO has officially declared the outbreak a pandemic , with the disease in more than 100 countries and major epidemics in several regions of the world .\nThat means containing the virus \u2014 fully halting its spread \u2014 is no longer the goal but rather mitigation of fast spread and harm reduction .\nKeep in mind , the p-word doesn \u2019 t say anything about the severity of Covid-19 . A disease can spread widely and become a pandemic without being particularly severe . And no one knows yet what the ultimate effects of this pandemic will look like \u2014 mostly because we don \u2019 t yet know precisely how lethal the disease is .\nThere was a time when it seemed possible that China might contain the virus and the outbreaks outside of China would fizzle out , spelling the end of this public health emergency .\nBut there are now so many around the world , and the very real possibility that the virus is circulating , undetected , in even more countries \u2014 especially those with weak health systems \u2014 that containment appears out of reach .\nThis means we \u2019 re likely to see more sickness and death in many countries as cases grow from one-off travelers or small clusters to full-blown outbreaks .\nIn this scenario , the NIH \u2019 s Fauci said , \u201c you don \u2019 t try to control [ the virus ] because it \u2019 s already everywhere . \u201d\nHealth officials are now in the mitigation phase of the response strategy . This involves a focus on social distancing to slow the speed of the outbreak and avoid overwhelming health systems . It also involves ramping up public health communications to inform the public about the disease , testing of potential cases to find sick people and their contacts , and capacity in hospitals .\nSo hospitals need to be ready with Covid-19 protocols so the disease doesn \u2019 t spread from them , and health care workers need to be protected with access to protective equipment such as face masks so they can keep doing their jobs . Countries also need plans in place for maintaining supply chains and carrying on with travel and trade .\nThe slow rollout of testing in the US , in particular , has made slowing the spread of the virus more difficult .\nAn investigation led by the Atlantic and independent researchers found that a little more than 7,000 people in the US had been tested as of March 11 \u2014 putting the US far behind other developed countries . ( The Covid Tracking Project team is now gathering test counts daily . )\nSlowing epidemics is critical in preventing more deaths , as it reduces stress on hospitals and health centers , which can only treat a certain number of patients at a time . That \u2019 s why \u201c flattening the curve \u201d of the pandemic through social distancing measures is so important .\nAs Eliza Barclay and Dylan Scott wrote for \u2588\u2588\u2588 : \u201c A disastrous inundation of hospitals can likely be averted with protective measures we \u2019 re now seeing more of \u2014 closing schools , canceling mass gatherings , working from home , self-quarantine , self-isolation , avoiding crowds \u2014 to keep the virus from spreading fast . \u201d\nIn the best-case scenario , which has become less likely , this outbreak might look more like H1N1 swine flu . When H1N1 was first recognized in 2009 and spread around the world , there were major concerns about its lethality . US schools closed , people from North America were quarantined when they arrived in other countries , flights were canceled . Not only did those measures fail to contain the virus , Nuzzo said , but it also turned out H1N1 wasn \u2019 t all that deadly .\n\u201c Now we \u2019 re still living with that virus \u2014 it \u2019 s one that circulates with every flu season , \u201d Nuzzo explained .\n7 ) Are there any places I shouldn \u2019 t go during this outbreak ?\nThe CDC has issued its highest-level travel alerts for Italy , Iran , South Korea , and China , advising Americans to avoid traveling in these places for the moment . These are the countries with the largest known coronavirus outbreaks . On March 11 , President Donald Trump issued a ban on travel from most of Europe for 30 days .\nBut just because a country you plan to visit isn \u2019 t on the list right now doesn \u2019 t mean it won \u2019 t be there tomorrow . The outbreak is evolving rapidly , and these advisories are likely to change in the coming days , so keep checking in with the CDC . This map and list of travel restrictions from the Council on Foreign Relations is another good resource .\nAs Nuzzo told \u2588\u2588\u2588 : \u201c I \u2019 m more concerned about the unpredictability of the [ outbreak ] response at this point . It would not be fun to go to China and get stuck there somehow . And coming back , you \u2019 ll be subject to additional screening \u201d or quarantines .\nWhat if you decide to travel and you \u2019 re seated near someone who is coughing or sneezing ? That \u2019 s not very reassuring , but it \u2019 s not time to panic , either . \u201c The risk of acquiring a respiratory infection through air travel is still extraordinarily low , \u201d Bogoch , who studies how air travel influences the dynamics of outbreaks \u2014 including the new coronavirus infection .\nThe risk does go up if you happen to be seated within six feet of a person with a respiratory infection . But even there , simple proximity doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean you \u2019 ll catch anything . Instead , the more infectious the person is , and the longer you sit near them , the higher your risk . If you \u2019 re not near the person for very long or they \u2019 re not very infectious , the risk is lower .\nAlso keep in mind : The travel warnings are not entirely driven by the risk of catching this new virus . Airlines have been canceling or scaling back flights , trains have been halted , and countries have been imposing quarantines on travelers and citizens .\nOn January 30 , the WHO declared the outbreak a global public health emergency , and about a month later said it had become a pandemic .\nA dramatic \u2014 and unprecedented \u2014 response played out in China , the country with the most Covid-19 cases . \u201c China has implemented the most extensive cordon sanitaire [ or quarantine ] in the history of humankind , \u201d Gostin told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c They \u2019 ve restricted movements , caused fear and panic . They \u2019 ve violated human rights. \u201d But they also managed to get more control over the outbreak , and cases are now declining .\nItaly has adopted quarantine measures that are similar to China \u2014 first locking down some 16 million people in the country \u2019 s north , where the virus has been spreading , and then extending restrictions on movement to the entire country .\nSome governments have so far been able to halt the spread of coronavirus within their borders , seemingly through quick action . In Taiwan , a small island close to mainland China , testing for Covid-19 began in late December , even as China was just beginning to discover cases and ramp up its response . The Taiwanese government also emphasized public education about curbing the disease \u2019 s spread . Taiwan has only reported one death from the virus , as of March 11 .\nIn recent weeks , the US government dramatically escalated its response : issuing its highest-level travel advisories , quarantining citizens evacuated from China , and banning foreign nationals who have recently been to China from coming in , as well as travelers from Iran . On March 11 , Trump announced a 30-day travel ban from most of Europe to the US ( excluding the UK ) .\nThe CDC warned , on February 25 , there may be a lot more to come ; \u201c disruption to everyday life might be severe. \u201d This means Americans can expect more cancellations , quarantines , and social distancing efforts . ( To read more about those , see this explainer . )\nThe severe measures can be explained by the fact that there \u2019 s still a lot we don \u2019 t know about this new virus and health officials are taking drastic actions . There \u2019 s also no enforceable international law governing outbreak responses , so countries can basically do what they want in response to pandemic threats without getting penalized , even if those actions are proportional or science-based , and the WHO is advising against them .\nThere are a few ways this outbreak could end , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Brian Resnick explained . Perhaps public health measures \u2014 identifying cases fast , putting infected people in isolation \u2014 will slow the spread of this coronavirus . ( That \u2019 s what stopped the spread of SARS in 2003 . )\n\u201c If we slow it so that infections happen over 10 or 12 months instead of over one month , that \u2019 s going to make a big difference as far as how many people seriously infected , how many people may end up hospitalized , and how many they end up dying , \u201d said Tara Smith , a Kent State University epidemiologist . \u201c We talk about it as \u2018 flattening the epidemic curve \u2019 \u2014 so that it \u2019 s not a big , sudden peak in cases , but it \u2019 s a more moderate plateau over time . \u201d\nBecause this is a zoonotic disease , meaning it came from an animal , finding and eliminating that source would also help .\nOr maybe a vaccine or antiviral will be invented quickly to curb a broader epidemic ( though a vaccine is expected to take at least a year ) .\nRelated A simple guide to the vaccines and drugs that could fight coronavirus\nThe coming seasons of warmer weather could also play a role in at least slowing down the virus . \u201c Coronaviruses are winter viruses , \u201d Fauci said . \u201c When the weather is warm and moist , these viruses don \u2019 t spread as well as when the weather is cold and dry . \u201d\nCovid-19 could also keep spreading at a high rate and become endemic \u2014 regularly infecting humans , like the common cold .\nEither way , \u201c it \u2019 s going to have tremendous \u2014 really negative and lasting effects \u2014 for the most vulnerable people who are either medically or economically vulnerable in our society , \u201d Angela Rasmussen , a Columbia virologist , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nCorrection March 3 : A graphic in this piece previously misstated the percentage of cases in China that were not linked back to the Wuhan area . The graphic has been updated with the correct figure , 14 percent .\nWhat else do you want to know about the coronavirus outbreak and the surrounding news ?

With the global case toll rising steeply, face masks flying off store shelves, borders around the world closing, and meetings, cruise itineraries, and the global economy upended by the virus, it\u2019s no wonder questions and fears are swirling about Covid-19, as the disease is known.\n\nOn March 11, the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic, a new disease that has spread around the world.

Doctors and health officials advise not to go to the emergency room if your symptoms do not appear to be life-threatening.\u201d There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll recover with nothing more than rest and fluids.

Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox\u2019s guide to Covid-19.\n\nAnd if you are healthy, here are some ways you can help vulnerable people in your community.\n\n4) How do coronaviruses spread?\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know exactly how SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease \u2014 spreads, but we do have a lot of data on how MERS, SARS, and other respiratory viruses move from person to person. And that\u2019s mainly through exposure to droplets from coughing or sneezing.\n\nSo when an infected person coughs or sneezes, they let out a spray, and if these droplets reach the nose, eyes, or mouth of another person, they can pass on the virus, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. In rarer cases, a person might catch a respiratory disease indirectly, \u201cvia touching droplets on surfaces \u2014 and then touching mucosal membranes\u201d in the mouth, eyes, and nose, she added.\n\nThere\u2019s also emerging evidence showing that SARS-CoV-2 may spread through poop \u2014 known as the \u201cfecal-oral\u201d route of disease transmission. Researchers are on the lookout for potential airborne transmission, too, and there\u2019s a lot of speculation about whether inanimate objects \u2014 like door handles \u2014 can pass on the virus.\n\nIn the case of airborne transmission, a person would get infected by directly inhaling droplets suspended in the air from an infected individual. With \u201cfomites\u201d \u2014 objects that can transmit infections \u2014 droplets from an infected person would end up on surfaces another person touches. \u201cSo far, there is no conclusive evidence of that,\u201d wrote Megan Murray, a Harvard Infectious Disease specialist, in a coronavirus explainer, \u201calthough that is challenging to prove one way or the other.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know: More and more research is piling up to suggest people who have only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all, can test positive for Covid-19 disease. The virus also appears to be present in the body at very high levels early on in an illness, when people are still going to work or traveling.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t know to what extent people without symptoms can infect,\u201d Nuzzo cautioned. And Isaac Bogoch, a professor at the University of Toronto told Vox, \u201ceven if there have been cases of asymptomatic transmission of this infection, those will be typically rare cases, and with just about every other respiratory tract infection known to humankind, those are not the people who are driving an epidemic.\u201d\n\nEven so, if this virus can spread from people with no or mild symptoms, it might help explain why it\u2019s so contagious. Researchers currently believe one person with Covid-19 generally infects two to more than three others, which would make the new coronavirus more transmissible than seasonal flu, SARS, and MERS. That\u2019s why social distancing measures are so important.\n\n5) What should I do to protect myself?

(Plus, there are reports of runs on masks and other supplies that health workers need to stay safe. If they can\u2019t get them and start walking off the job, we\u2019re all in trouble.)\n\nRelated How soap absolutely annihilates the coronavirus\n\nThat\u2019s why the CDC advises against the use of masks for regular Americans. The best thing you can do to prevent all sorts of illnesses, CDC\u2019s Nancy Messonnier said, is \u201cwash your hands, cover your cough, take care of yourself, and keep alert to the information that we\u2019re providing.\u201d\n\nIndividuals at a higher risk of developing severe disease \u2014 the elderly, people with underlying health conditions \u2014 should take additional precautions: avoiding crowds and contact with people who are sick, and stocking up on medicines and groceries, Messonnier said.\n\n6) Is this a deadly pandemic?\n\nThe WHO has officially declared the outbreak a pandemic, with the disease in more than 100 countries and major epidemics in several regions of the world.\n\nThat means containing the virus \u2014 fully halting its spread \u2014 is no longer the goal but rather mitigation of fast spread and harm reduction.\n\nKeep in mind, the p-word doesn\u2019t say anything about the severity of Covid-19. A disease can spread widely and become a pandemic without being particularly severe. And no one knows yet what the ultimate effects of this pandemic will look like \u2014 mostly because we don\u2019t yet know precisely how lethal the disease is.\n\nThere was a time when it seemed possible that China might contain the virus and the outbreaks outside of China would fizzle out, spelling the end of this public health emergency.\n\nBut there are now so many around the world, and the very real possibility that the virus is circulating, undetected, in even more countries \u2014 especially those with weak health systems \u2014 that containment appears out of reach.\n\nThis means we\u2019re likely to see more sickness and death in many countries as cases grow from one-off travelers or small clusters to full-blown outbreaks.\n\nIn this scenario, the NIH\u2019s Fauci said, \u201cyou don\u2019t try to control [the virus] because it\u2019s already everywhere.\u201d\n\nHealth officials are now in the mitigation phase of the response strategy. This involves a focus on social distancing to slow the speed of the outbreak and avoid overwhelming health systems. It also involves ramping up public health communications to inform the public about the disease, testing of potential cases to find sick people and their contacts, and capacity in hospitals.\n\nSo hospitals need to be ready with Covid-19 protocols so the disease doesn\u2019t spread from them, and health care workers need to be protected with access to protective equipment such as face masks so they can keep doing their jobs. Countries also need plans in place for maintaining supply chains and carrying on with travel and trade.\n\nThe slow rollout of testing in the US, in particular, has made slowing the spread of the virus more difficult.\n\nAn investigation led by the Atlantic and independent researchers found that a little more than 7,000 people in the US had been tested as of March 11 \u2014 putting the US far behind other developed countries. (The Covid Tracking Project team is now gathering test counts daily.)\n\nSlowing epidemics is critical in preventing more deaths, as it reduces stress on hospitals and health centers, which can only treat a certain number of patients at a time. That\u2019s why \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of the pandemic through social distancing measures is so important.\n\nAs Eliza Barclay and Dylan Scott wrote for Vox: \u201cA disastrous inundation of hospitals can likely be averted with protective measures we\u2019re now seeing more of \u2014 closing schools, canceling mass gatherings, working from home, self-quarantine, self-isolation, avoiding crowds \u2014 to keep the virus from spreading fast.\u201d\n\nIn the best-case scenario, which has become less likely, this outbreak might look more like H1N1 swine flu. When H1N1 was first recognized in 2009 and spread around the world, there were major concerns about its lethality. US schools closed, people from North America were quarantined when they arrived in other countries, flights were canceled. Not only did those measures fail to contain the virus, Nuzzo said, but it also turned out H1N1 wasn\u2019t all that deadly.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re still living with that virus \u2014 it\u2019s one that circulates with every flu season,\u201d Nuzzo explained.\n\n7) Are there any places I shouldn\u2019t go during this outbreak?\n\nThe CDC has issued its highest-level travel alerts for Italy, Iran, South Korea, and China, advising Americans to avoid traveling in these places for the moment. These are the countries with the largest known coronavirus outbreaks. On March 11, President Donald Trump issued a ban on travel from most of Europe for 30 days.\n\nBut just because a country you plan to visit isn\u2019t on the list right now doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be there tomorrow. The outbreak is evolving rapidly, and these advisories are likely to change in the coming days, so keep checking in with the CDC. This map and list of travel restrictions from the Council on Foreign Relations is another good resource.\n\nAs Nuzzo told Vox: \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about the unpredictability of the [outbreak] response at this point. It would not be fun to go to China and get stuck there somehow. And coming back, you\u2019ll be subject to additional screening\u201d or quarantines.\n\nWhat if you decide to travel and you\u2019re seated near someone who is coughing or sneezing? That\u2019s not very reassuring, but it\u2019s not time to panic, either. \u201cThe risk of acquiring a respiratory infection through air travel is still extraordinarily low,\u201d Bogoch, who studies how air travel influences the dynamics of outbreaks \u2014 including the new coronavirus infection.\n\nThe risk does go up if you happen to be seated within six feet of a person with a respiratory infection. But even there, simple proximity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll catch anything. Instead, the more infectious the person is, and the longer you sit near them, the higher your risk. If you\u2019re not near the person for very long or they\u2019re not very infectious, the risk is lower.\n\nAlso keep in mind: The travel warnings are not entirely driven by the risk of catching this new virus. Airlines have been canceling or scaling back flights, trains have been halted, and countries have been imposing quarantines on travelers and citizens.\n\n8) How is the world responding to this crisis?\n\nOn January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global public health emergency, and about a month later said it had become a pandemic.\n\nA dramatic \u2014 and unprecedented \u2014 response played out in China, the country with the most Covid-19 cases. \u201cChina has implemented the most extensive cordon sanitaire [or quarantine] in the history of humankind,\u201d Gostin told Vox. \u201cThey\u2019ve restricted movements, caused fear and panic. They\u2019ve violated human rights.\u201d But they also managed to get more control over the outbreak, and cases are now declining.\n\nItaly has adopted quarantine measures that are similar to China \u2014 first locking down some 16 million people in the country\u2019s north, where the virus has been spreading, and then extending restrictions on movement to the entire country.\n\nSome governments have so far been able to halt the spread of coronavirus within their borders, seemingly through quick action. In Taiwan, a small island close to mainland China, testing for Covid-19 began in late December, even as China was just beginning to discover cases and ramp up its response. The Taiwanese government also emphasized public education about curbing the disease\u2019s spread. Taiwan has only reported one death from the virus, as of March 11.\n\nIn recent weeks, the US government dramatically escalated its response: issuing its highest-level travel advisories, quarantining citizens evacuated from China, and banning foreign nationals who have recently been to China from coming in, as well as travelers from Iran. On March 11, Trump announced a 30-day travel ban from most of Europe to the US (excluding the UK).\n\nThe CDC warned, on February 25, there may be a lot more to come; \u201cdisruption to everyday life might be severe.\u201d This means Americans can expect more cancellations, quarantines, and social distancing efforts. (To read more about those, see this explainer.)\n\nThe severe measures can be explained by the fact that there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about this new virus and health officials are taking drastic actions. There\u2019s also no enforceable international law governing outbreak responses, so countries can basically do what they want in response to pandemic threats without getting penalized, even if those actions are proportional or science-based, and the WHO is advising against them.\n\n9) How might this end?\n\nThere are a few ways this outbreak could end, as Vox\u2019s Brian Resnick explained. Perhaps public health measures \u2014 identifying cases fast, putting infected people in isolation \u2014 will slow the spread of this coronavirus. (That\u2019s what stopped the spread of SARS in 2003.)\n\n\u201cIf we slow it so that infections happen over 10 or 12 months instead of over one month, that\u2019s going to make a big difference as far as how many people seriously infected, how many people may end up hospitalized, and how many they end up dying,\u201d said Tara Smith, a Kent State University epidemiologist. \u201cWe talk about it as \u2018flattening the epidemic curve\u2019 \u2014 so that it\u2019s not a big, sudden peak in cases, but it\u2019s a more moderate plateau over time.\u201d\n\nBecause this is a zoonotic disease, meaning it came from an animal, finding and eliminating that source would also help.\n\nOr maybe a vaccine or antiviral will be invented quickly to curb a broader epidemic (though a vaccine is expected to take at least a year).\n\nRelated A simple guide to the vaccines and drugs that could fight coronavirus\n\nThe coming seasons of warmer weather could also play a role in at least slowing down the virus. \u201cCoronaviruses are winter viruses,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWhen the weather is warm and moist, these viruses don\u2019t spread as well as when the weather is cold and dry.\u201d\n\nCovid-19 could also keep spreading at a high rate and become endemic \u2014 regularly infecting humans, like the common cold.\n\nEither way, \u201cit\u2019s going to have tremendous \u2014 really negative and lasting effects \u2014 for the most vulnerable people who are either medically or economically vulnerable in our society,\u201d Angela Rasmussen, a Columbia virologist, told Vox.\n\nCorrection March 3: A graphic in this piece previously misstated the percentage of cases in China that were not linked back to the Wuhan area.
