That 's why the donors are so important and provide much-needed insight into a possible candidate 's views , according to Hilton .\n`` In terms of its accuracy , it 's pretty much the same as a voting record , '' said Hilton .\nCrowdpac uses campaign finance data to chart how conservative or liberal a candidate is .\nPerhaps the most counterintuitive find suggests that Sen. Rand Paul , known as a vocal champion of non-interventionist policies , earned a slightly more conservative rating on defense and foreign policy than Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio , who supports a robust American action abroad .\nCrowdpac advisers pointed to Paul 's donor base and his Senate record . In particular , they cited four votes that they said push him to the `` right '' of Rubio : A 2014 vote to provide loan guarantees to Ukraine in which Paul opposed and Rubio supported ; a 2012 Paul-proposed bill to restrict foreign aid that Rubio abstained from voting ; another to renew import restrictions which Paul supported and Rubio opposed ; and Paul 's opposition to the 2014 defense authorization bill .\nOf course , any ideological rating system that seeks to apply to a wide range of complicated issues is imperfect -- and defining a `` conservative foreign policy '' is especially difficult .\nThe algorithm pulls politicians further to the extreme end of the spectrum the more they vote with their own party , said Mike Polyakov , Crowdpac 's head of data . That helps explain Paul 's placement furthest to the right .\n`` It looks at who tends to vote with whom , '' Polyakov said . `` In simple terms , Republicans who tend to vote only with other Republicans in Congress get a more extreme score than those who frequently cross party lines . There 's some theoretical tension in assigning scores on certain issues , like foreign policy . After all , 'conservative ' can at times mean either aggressive or isolationist . ''\nOverall , Paul took the award for Crowdpac 's most conservative presidential contender although he 's considered the `` most liberal '' on issues of government intelligence and surveillance . Of the potential Democrats , Vermont independent Sen.
