It \u2019 s such an ugly en\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment out there . It makes polit\u00adics a blood sport . \u201d\nThat en\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment poses a real chal\u00adlenge to the can\u00addid\u00adates ap\u00adpeal\u00ading to the 2016 elect\u00ador\u00adate . It has al\u00adways been a giv\u00aden of Amer\u00adic\u00adan polit\u00adics that a new pres\u00adid\u00adent seeks to do what Ab\u00adra\u00adham Lin\u00adcoln prom\u00adised in his second in\u00adaug\u00adur\u00adal ad\u00address : to \u201c bind up the na\u00adtion \u2019 s wounds \u201d and show no malice to\u00adward foes . When Nix\u00adon won after a di\u00advis\u00adive 1968 cam\u00adpaign , he pledged on Elec\u00adtion Night to \u201c bring us to\u00adgeth\u00ader. \u201d Twenty years later , a tri\u00adumphant George H.W . Bush prom\u00adised a \u201c kinder and gentler \u201d ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion . In 2000 , his son , George W. Bush , prom\u00adised to be \u201c a uniter , not a di\u00advider \u201d after a bit\u00adter re\u00adcount of the vote in Flor\u00adida .\nMore re\u00adcently , Barack Obama burst onto the na\u00adtion\u00adal scene with a ringing de\u00adnun\u00adci\u00adation of \u201c those pre\u00adpar\u00ading to di\u00advide us , the spin mas\u00adters and neg\u00adat\u00adive ad ped\u00addlers who em\u00adbrace the polit\u00adics of any\u00adthing goes. \u201d To rising ap\u00adplause at the 2004 Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Na\u00adtion\u00adal Con\u00adven\u00adtion , Obama de\u00adclared , \u201c I say to them to\u00adnight , there \u2019 s not a lib\u00ader\u00adal Amer\u00adica and a con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive Amer\u00adica ; there \u2019 s the United States of Amer\u00adica . \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s clear that there is a lib\u00ader\u00adal Amer\u00adica and a con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive Amer\u00adica . \u201c We \u2019 ve now had four pres\u00adid\u00adents in a row who prom\u00adised to bring the coun\u00adtry to\u00adgeth\u00ader , to unite the coun\u00adtry , \u201d said Schneider . \u201c They all failed. \u201d It was the prom\u00adise that made Obama so ap\u00adpeal\u00ading in 2008 , even to many skep\u00adtic\u00adal Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans . \u201c He was sup\u00adposed to be bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan and biracial , \u201d said Schneider . \u201c But he also failed . \u201d\nNow , the res\u00adults of these fail\u00adures can be seen in de\u00adbates about en\u00ademies and the in\u00adcreas\u00adingly dys\u00adpeptic mood of the pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial cam\u00adpaign . And while op\u00adtim\u00adism is an en\u00addur\u00ading Amer\u00adic\u00adan trait , it is dif\u00adfi\u00adcult to be op\u00adtim\u00adist\u00adic that the even\u00adtu\u00adal win\u00adner will be able to suc\u00adceed where the last four pres\u00adid\u00adents have fallen so short in unit\u00ading a coun\u00adtry that doesn \u2019 t seem to want to come to\u00adgeth\u00ader with fel\u00adlow cit\u00adizens they view as en\u00ademies .",

When Nix\u00adon won after a di\u00advis\u00adive 1968 cam\u00adpaign, he pledged on Elec\u00adtion Night to \u201cbring us to\u00adgeth\u00ader.\u201d Twenty years later, a tri\u00adumphant George H.W. Bush prom\u00adised a \u201ckinder and gentler\u201d ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion. In 2000, his son, George W. Bush, prom\u00adised to be \u201ca uniter, not a di\u00advider\u201d after a bit\u00adter re\u00adcount of the vote in Flor\u00adida.\n\nMore re\u00adcently, Barack Obama burst onto the na\u00adtion\u00adal scene with a ringing de\u00adnun\u00adci\u00adation of \u201cthose pre\u00adpar\u00ading to di\u00advide us, the spin mas\u00adters and neg\u00adat\u00adive ad ped\u00addlers who em\u00adbrace the polit\u00adics of any\u00adthing goes.\u201d To rising ap\u00adplause at the 2004 Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Na\u00adtion\u00adal Con\u00adven\u00adtion, Obama de\u00adclared, \u201cI say to them to\u00adnight, there\u2019s not a lib\u00ader\u00adal Amer\u00adica and a con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive Amer\u00adica; there\u2019s the United States of Amer\u00adica.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that there is a lib\u00ader\u00adal Amer\u00adica and a con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive Amer\u00adica. \u201cWe\u2019ve now had four pres\u00adid\u00adents in a row who prom\u00adised to bring the coun\u00adtry to\u00adgeth\u00ader, to unite the coun\u00adtry,\u201d said Schneider. \u201cThey all failed.\u201d It was the prom\u00adise that made Obama so ap\u00adpeal\u00ading in 2008, even to many skep\u00adtic\u00adal Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans. \u201cHe was sup\u00adposed to be bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan and biracial,\u201d said Schneider. \u201cBut he also failed.\u201d\n\nNow, the res\u00adults of these fail\u00adures can be seen in de\u00adbates about en\u00ademies and the in\u00adcreas\u00adingly dys\u00adpeptic mood of the pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial cam\u00adpaign. And while op\u00adtim\u00adism is an en\u00addur\u00ading Amer\u00adic\u00adan trait, it is dif\u00adfi\u00adcult to be op\u00adtim\u00adist\u00adic that the even\u00adtu\u00adal win\u00adner will be able to suc\u00adceed where the last four pres\u00adid\u00adents have fallen so short in unit\u00ading a coun\u00adtry that doesn\u2019t seem to want to come to\u00adgeth\u00ader with fel\u00adlow cit\u00adizens they view as en\u00ademies.",
