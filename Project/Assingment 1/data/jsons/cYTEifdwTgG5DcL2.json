They say it could leave millions wrestling with debilitating psychological disorders while dashing hopes for a swift economic recovery . The COVID-19 crisis has combined mental health stressors that have been studied before in other disasters , but which have never been seen consolidated in one global crisis , experts in trauma psychology said . It has left millions without jobs , sent billions into isolation and forced nearly everyone on earth to grapple with the feeling that they or those they love are suddenly physically vulnerable .
