Aside from being funny about Trump\u2019s penchant for insults, Cruz paid plain deference to the demanding caucus-goers of Iowa.\n\nIn Cruz\u2019s bid to be the consensus conservative choice nationally, his performance was uneven. Aside from overusing his debate device of complaining about the questions, Cruz also found himself too much on the defensive. It was hardly dire, but it was clear evidence of how much harder life is for Cruz outside of Trump\u2019s shadow.\n\nAs it is every four years, Iowa is proving unpredictable in the closing days before the caucuses. Polls show plenty of entropy in the GOP electorate in Iowa.\n\nThat\u2019s cause for both hope and concern for Cruz.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision not only to skip the lone Iowa debate but also to leave the state for New Hampshire immediately after doing so will hurt him with Iowa voters who take pride in their place at the front of the line.\n\nThat means Trump\u2019s voters may decide to rally to Cruz\u2019s cause, and he certainly made his case to them on Thursday.\n\nHowever, it also means that third place Marco Rubio has a chance to move up.\n\nThere are a lot more voters up for grabs in Iowa than the parroting parrots of the press would have you think. And while Cruz has been Steady Teddy when it comes to Iowa, the chaos of the race here at this moment will test his status as the early choice of many in the Hawkeye State.\n\nRubio did not have his best debate performance in Des Moines, especially because his eternal antagonist, Jeb Bush, found a new energy with his own nemesis Trump off the stage. Bush took his pep pills for the debate and managed hit Rubio harder than before.\n\nBut Rubio also did himself well. As a young senator, Rubio faces one major obstacle: proving he is ready to be commander in chief. He showed several moments of presidential-level command Thursday.\n\nObviously, Rubio has plenty of work to do in convincing supporters of Bush, Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., and other lower tier candidates that the is the man for the job. Rubio\u2019s range is expanding as the stakes go up.
