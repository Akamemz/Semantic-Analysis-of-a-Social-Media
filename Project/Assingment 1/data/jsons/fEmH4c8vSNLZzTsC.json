On Monday , he attacked the Trump immigration plan , which centers on building a Great Wall of Mexico and forcing millions of people to the other side of it . \u201c It would cost hundreds of billions of dollars , \u201d Mr. Bush said , as well as \u201c violate people \u2019 s civil liberties \u201d and \u201c create friction with our third-largest trading partner. \u201d That is a fair reading of what Mr. Trump wants .
