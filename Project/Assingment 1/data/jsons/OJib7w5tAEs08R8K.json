Purdum is senior writer at \u2588\u2588\u2588 and contributing editor for Vanity Fair , as well as author of An Idea Whose Time Has Come : Two Presidents , Two Parties and the Battle for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .\nNo one is ever really ready for the chaos and confusion of a New York primary\u2014the way everything can change in a New York minute . I certainly wasn \u2019 t . As a 28-year-old greenhorn reporter for The New York Times , I was there the moment Ed Koch uttered the words that would help destroy Al Gore \u2019 s candidacy in 1988\u2014and I missed the story .\nAt noon on April 1\u2014which just happened to be both April Fool 's Day and Good Friday\u2014the mayor was rushing down the steps of City Hall on his way to lunch when The New York Post 's intrepid City Hall reporter , Doug Feiden , asked Koch how New York 's large Jewish community should react to the Rev . Jesse Jackson 's surprising successes in primary and caucus contests that year . Among many Jews , Jackson \u2019 s reputation had never recovered from his \u201c Hymietown \u201d comment four years earlier .\nJews , Koch said , `` got ta be crazy '' to vote for Jackson , and drove off . But I didn \u2019 t write it . After all , this was New York , the city of tough talk and over-the-top rhetoric ( Donald Trump , born in Queens , didn \u2019 t come from just anywhere ) . Koch `` says things like that all the time , '' I told my editors when they asked me , after the city 's tabloids splashed Koch 's broadside across their front pages , how I could have blown it so badly . Two weeks later , when the mayor endorsed Gore , his embrace became the kiss of death . Koch took an ashen-faced Gore\u2014who had made his own sharp criticisms of Jackson\u2014to campaign at his old lucky subway stop on the Upper East Side , proclaiming , \u201c Al Gore has a touch of greatness ! \u201d Gore \u2019 s campaign never recovered .\nIt would be too easy to say that the New York primary is the Bermuda Triangle of American politics\u2014the place where presidential ( or reportorial ) ambitions disappear in a swirling vortex , never to prevail again . New York has also been the scene of Sword-of-Excalibur wins , like Bill Clinton 's 1992 victory after a smart questioner elicited the confession that he had smoked marijuana but not inhaled , and after his raw wrangle with `` snotty nose '' critics\u2014the phrase he infamously used to refer to an early AIDS activist who disrupted a posh fundraising event with a cry from the heart about a disease then still too easy for politicians to ignore .\nWhat is beyond dispute is that the New York primary is an election in which anything can happen\u2014and usually does . After all , Paul Tsongas came in second there in 1992\u2014after he had dropped out of the race . Trump has a prohibitive lead over Ted Cruz , and Bernie Sanders may be trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls , but Sanders is hoping a last-minute weekend trip to the Vatican might win him enough progressive support to cause one last thrill worthy of the Coney Island Cyclone .\nIn fact , New York \u2019 s typical storminess is the perfect setting for unpredictability in this election , when three of the four front-running contenders are New Yorkers by one measure or another , and the fourth\u2014Sen . Ted Cruz\u2014is an avowed enemy of `` New York values '' and the Big Apple 's live-and-let-live-but-drop-dead-anyway ethos . Until now , the current candidates \u2019 trials in New York have actually been fairly mild , by the standards of the game . But the final weekend has a way of bringing surprises .\nNew Yorkers embrace many values\u2014including candor , tough talk and a kind of \u201c prove it ! \u201d skepticism that could make a Show-Me-State Missourian blush . Politics in the Empire State is , first last and always a contact sport , with shifting alliances and a keen eye on the mood of the marketplace .\nHillary Clinton got a taste of that earlier this campaign season when Mayor Bill de Blasio , who once managed Clinton \u2019 s campaign for the Senate , became one of the early harbingers of the Sanders insurgency by taking his time endorsing her . Then his racially tinged joke about that delay\u2014that he was \u201c running on C.P . time , \u201d or \u201c Colored People Time \u201d \u2014fell flat at the Inner Circle political roast last weekend , especially with Clinton participating in the skit . Gov . Andrew Cuomo , whose touchy rivalry with de Blasio is almost as celebrated as his father \u2019 s with Koch , invited Clinton to share the limelight when he recently signed the state \u2019 s new minimum wage law .\nCould de Blasio \u2019 s crack sour things for Hillary , who still has a double-digit lead over Bernie ? What about the awkward video of her trying to enter the subway , when her first attempts to swipe a MetroCard failed ? ( Sanders \u2019 embarrassment was greater : He thought he still needed a token to ride ) . On the GOP side , Trump is way ahead , but his children aren \u2019 t even registered to vote in the Republican primary on Tuesday . The Daily News headline on an event in the Bronx where Cruz was booed ? \u201c Take the F U Train , Ted ! \u201d So nu ? ( That \u2019 s Yiddish for \u201c Whatcha gon na do ? \u201d )\n\u201c It \u2019 s a very fast town , and the press is a great part of it , \u201d says George Arzt , a longtime reporter for the New York Post who later served as Koch \u2019 s press secretary . \u201c They \u2019 re always looking for a headline and political candidates who don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s coming are walking right into it . You have every group , everyone with a different agenda . If you don \u2019 t run afoul of someone , you \u2019 re just not running a campaign . \u201d\nIn 1992 , Bill Clinton had not yet fully developed his reputation as one of the world \u2019 s great parsers of words . But , when asked about past drug use , he had taken to saying he had never broken the laws of his country . Marcia Kramer , then as now a crack reporter for WCBS-TV , well-schooled in the legalistic sophistries of Gov . Mario Cuomo , sensed an opening . Had Clinton , she asked , ever broken the laws of another country ? Say , England , where he was Rhodes Scholar at Oxford ?\n\u201c I experimented with marijuana a time or two , \u201d Clinton confessed . \u201c And I didn \u2019 t like it , and didn \u2019 t inhale , and never tried it again. \u201d Asked later why he had never acknowledged marijuana use in response to more general questions on the topic , Clinton replied : \u201c That \u2019 s not the specific question I \u2019 ve been asked in the past . If anybody had asked the question , I \u2019 d have answered it . \u201d\nNew York clearly rattled Clinton . After he laced into Bob Rafsky , a vocal AIDS activist who repeatedly interrupted his speech at a fundraiser , the Philadelphia Inquirer asked : \u201c Is Bill Clinton cracking under the stress of the presidential campaign ? Or was his outburst at an AIDS activist last week a calculated jab to show that he \u2019 s tough , combative and not so slick after all ? \u201d\nSometimes it \u2019 s not a lack of candor but a surfeit that gets candidates in trouble in New York . In 1976 , Jimmy Carter \u2019 s aide Hamilton Jordan \u201c said something like \u2018 We don \u2019 t need New York , \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 Arzt recalls . \u201c And quickly Mario Cuomo , who was backing Carter , walked him off it , but it was too late . Carter himself compounded the problem by saying he opposed \u201c special favors \u201d for financially strapped New York City , and he came in third , behind Sen. Henry Jackson and Rep.

But as Joyce Purnick , the longtime former New York Times political reporter , notes , \u201c standard New York politics \u201d can be \u201c a nightmare for presidential candidates . \u201d\n\u201c Anything goes here , \u201d says Mitchell Moss , a professor of urban policy at New York University and a longtime watcher of the local political scene . \u201c This campaign is giving the tabloids a heart transplant . Bill de Blasio has all kinds of problems and they \u2019 re being completely subsumed by the Clinton and Trump campaigns . The Mets are off to a slow start and the Yankees are too old . The amount of time for sports on TV every night is diminished because politics is there . \u201d\n\u201c The tabloids are doing two- and three-page spreads every day , \u201d Moss adds . \u201c They \u2019 re showing every house Bernie Sanders ever lived in . \u201d\nThe candidates have made all the required pilgrimages , for ethnic food ( Clinton ordered tandoori takeout in Jackson Heights , Queens ) and neighborhood loyalties .
