With few sparks and little clarity on the immense gulf that truly separates the two men and their policies , Wednesday \u2019 s encounter provided little guidance for voters still trying to understand the choice in next month \u2019 s election .\nThe Mitt Romney who appeared on the stage at the University of Denver seemed to be fleeing from the one who won the Republican nomination on a hard-right platform of tax cuts , budget slashing and indifference to the suffering of those at the bottom of the economic ladder . And Mr. Obama \u2019 s competitive edge from 2008 clearly dulled , as he missed repeated opportunities to challenge Mr. Romney on his falsehoods and turnabouts .\nVirtually every time Mr. Romney spoke , he misrepresented the platform on which he and Paul Ryan are actually running . The most prominent example , taking up the first half-hour of the debate , was on taxes . Mr. Romney claimed , against considerable evidence , that he had no intention of cutting taxes on the rich or enacting a tax cut that would increase the deficit .\nThat simply isn \u2019 t true . Mr. Romney wants to restore the Bush-era tax cut that expires at the end of this year and largely benefits the wealthy . He wants to end the estate tax and the gift tax , providing a huge benefit only to those with multimillion-dollar estates , at a cost of more than $ 1 trillion over a decade to the deficit . He wants to preserve the generous rates on capital gains that benefit himself personally and others at his economic level . And he wants to cut everyone \u2019 s tax rates by 20 percent , which again would be a gigantic boon to the wealthy .\nNone of these would cost the Treasury a dime , he insisted , because he would reduce deductions and loopholes .
