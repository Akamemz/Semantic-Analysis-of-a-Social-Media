    "content": "Amid growing Democratic accusations of overreaching , especially on the matter of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails , Republicans on the House Benghazi Committee are now reconsidering how aggressively to pursue the email scandal that \u2019 s been dogging the Democratic front-runner .\nThe committee is also undecided about whether to call ex-Clinton campaign staffer Heather Samuelson , who helped screen Clinton \u2019 s State Department emails , according to a GOP source . Just a few weeks ago , GOP members of the panel were eager to question Samuelson , because panel sources say she was the lawyer who initially chose which of Clinton \u2019 s emails were work-related \u2014 and thus should be turned over to the State Department \u2014 and which would ultimately get deleted .\nNow , however , Republicans are debating whether to bring her in .\n\u201c The question becomes : Is it worth the hassle and the drama ? \u201d the GOP source said .\nThe reevaluation follows a Thursday hearing which was widely seen as a success for Clinton , while Republicans failed to strike any decisive blows . Meanwhile , Democrats amped up their claims that the entire investigation was a partisan witch hunt .\nThe panel \u2019 s mandate was to investigate the circumstances surrounding the killing of four Americans outside the U.S. consulate in Benghazi , Libya , in 2012 , in the waning months of Clinton \u2019 s tenure as secretary of state .
