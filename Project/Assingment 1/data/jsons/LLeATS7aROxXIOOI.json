So his appearance alongside White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus Thursday was hotly anticipated and closely watched .\nThe men performed a buddy schtick of sorts , portraying the yin and yang that bring the White House together and keep it running not in chaos as some media reports have claimed , but like the `` fine-tuned '' machine President Donald Trump bragged about during a news conference last week . Priebus keeps the trains running , according to Bannon , and Bannon does the big ideas , according to Priebus .\nThe fact that Bannon does n't talk much in public has created an aura in Washington for him .

He came off as rumpled and overworked , but passionate about his boss , even if he admittedly `` runs a little hot . ''\nBut he did cram a lot of those big ideas Priebus mentioned into what was billed as a short and informal Q & A . One could infer a lot about Trump 's goals for the next four years from what Bannon said . Here are some of the most interesting passages and some of his more interesting word choices :\nTrump is going to do exactly what he said during the campaign\n`` This is the main thing that the mainstream media -- or the opposition party -- never caught , is that if you want to see the Trump agenda it 's very simple . It was all in the speeches . He went around to those rallies and the speeches had an enormous amount of content in them ...

''\n`` All of those promises are going to be implemented , '' he said .\n`` I kind of break it up into three verticals of three buckets , '' Bannon said . `` The first is kind of national security and sovereignty and that 's your intelligence , the Defense Department , Homeland Security .\n`` The second line of work is what I refer to as 'economic nationalism ' and that is Wilbur Ross at Commerce , Steven Mnuchin at Treasury , ( Robert ) Lighthizer at Trade , ( National Trade Council head ) Peter Navarro , ( adviser ) Stephen Miller , these people that are rethinking how we 're gon na reconstruct our trade arrangements around the world .\n`` The third , broadly , line of work is what is 'deconstruction ' of the administrative state .
