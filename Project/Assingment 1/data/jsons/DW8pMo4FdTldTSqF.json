He is the author of All Eyes Are Upon Us : Race and Politics from Boston to Brooklyn .\nForty years ago , a contentious battle over racial justice gripped Capitol Hill , pitting the nation \u2019 s lone African American senator against the man who would one day become Barack Obama \u2019 s vice president . The issue was school busing , a plan to transport white and black students out of their neighborhoods to better integrate schools\u2014and at the time the most explosive issue on the national agenda .\nEd Brooke , a Massachusetts Republican , was the first black senator ever to be popularly elected ; Joe Biden was a freshman Democratic senator from Delaware . By 1975 , both had compiled liberal voting records . But that year , Biden sided with conservatives and sponsored a major anti-busing amendment . The fierce debate that followed not only fractured the Senate \u2019 s bloc of liberals , it also signified a more wide-ranging political phenomenon : As white voters around the country\u2014especially in the North\u2014objected to sweeping desegregation plans then coming into practice , liberal leaders retreated from robust integration policies .\nBiden was at the forefront of this retreat : He had expressed support for integration and\u2014more specifically\u2014busing during his Senate campaign in 1972 , but once elected , he discovered just how bitterly his white constituents opposed the method . In 1973 and 1974 , Biden began voting for many of the Senate \u2019 s anti-busing bills , claiming that he favored school desegregation , but just objected to \u201c forced busing . \u201d\nThen , as a court-ordered integration plan loomed over Wilmington , Delaware , in 1974 , Biden \u2019 s constituents transformed their resistance to busing into an organized\u2014and angry\u2014opposition . So Biden transformed , too . That year , Joe Biden morphed into a leading anti-busing crusader\u2014all the while continuing to insist that he supported the goal of school desegregation , he only opposed busing as the means to achieve that end .\nThis stance , which many of Biden \u2019 s liberal and moderate colleagues also held , was clever but disingenuous . It enabled Biden to choose votes over principles , while acting as if he was not doing so .\nHistory has not been kind to the defenders of school busing . Indeed , busing was problematic\u2014as it transported children long distances away from nearby schools . But to say most whites objected to busing because it was inconvenient would be wrong . The truth is that many of them were not comfortable with the racial change that busing brought .\nBy the dawn of the 1970s , Southern schools were finally beginning to integrate . Though the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision had outlawed \u201c separate but equal \u201d schools , it wasn \u2019 t until the court \u2019 s lesser-known 1969 ruling in Alexander v. Holmes County that many Southern school districts actually implemented desegregation plans . In response to these legal mandates , judges started to order busing plans in some Southern cities .\nMeanwhile , Northern schools still remained thoroughly segregated . Housing segregation frequently produced segregated schools , and many urban school boards enacted transfer and redistricting policies to keep them that way . Throughout the 1960s and \u2019 70s , African American parents in the North filed lawsuits in protest . They alleged that their children had been denied equal educational opportunity , forced to attend schools that were underfunded and racially segregated . The result of these legal actions in both the North and the South was a truly nationwide debate\u2014spanning from Denver and Detroit to Charlotte and Boston\u2014in which federal district courts often held that busing was the only surefire way to integrate schools .\nThe first busing case to reach the Supreme Court was Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg County . A district court had ordered busing in Charlotte , North Carolina , and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the plan in April 1971 , on the grounds that the Constitution required \u201c the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation. \u201d The court admitted that the remedies for segregation might be \u201c awkward , inconvenient , and even bizarre in some situations and may impose burdens on some. \u201d But the Constitution clearly required such impositions . The Swann decision gave lower court judges wide latitude to devise plans for integration , including the use of busing as a tool . In California , Michigan and Colorado , judges promptly ordered citywide busing plans , concluding that in cities shaped by housing segregation it was impossible to disentangle busing from integration .\nEven the supporters of busing allowed that such plans were imperfect , and that cities ought to try other integration measures before resorting to busing . Busing was indeed \u201c awkward \u201d and \u201c inconvenient \u201d for students . Today , the anti-busing arguments guide our policies . In many cities , the \u201c neighborhood school \u201d \u2014itself a product of redlining , housing segregation and discriminatory school transfer policies\u2014remains sacrosanct . But we forget that through the 1960s and 1970s , local school boards and urban whites often resisted every other attempt at school and housing integration . With their resistance , they narrowed the options down to two : busing or segregation .\nThe Swann ruling and the court orders that followed triggered a swift backlash . White parents trembled with rage as they envisioned scenarios in which their children would be bused into African American neighborhoods . Elected officials came out against busing , while still insisting they supported integration . Yet few ever offered an alternative for how to achieve it .\nNowhere did the busing wars play out more dramatically than in Boston . Massachusetts had passed a 1965 law that banned segregated schools . But Boston leaders never attempted to comply with the law . Instead , the Boston School Committee continued to pursue policies designed to preserve segregated schools . Black parents filed a lawsuit in 1972 , and the NAACP argued their case . On June 21 , 1974 , federal Judge W. Arthur Garrity found that local officials had deliberately kept Boston \u2019 s schools segregated , and that the city must integrate at once . He drew up a busing plan . Black students from Roxbury would attend South Boston High School , while Irish Americans from Southie would board buses to Roxbury .\nPolice escort a black student off a school bus outside South Boston High School on Sept. 12 , 1974 , the first day of school busing . | Getty\nThe first buses rolled through Boston in September 1974\u2014and racial violence engulfed the city . White mobs hurled bricks at school buses with terrified black children inside . Then , on October 7 , a Haitian immigrant was beaten savagely by a white mob in South Boston . In the coming months , the list of casualties would grow . The city became a cauldron of racial hatred .\nThe Boston busing crisis shocked white Northerners . Many had long ignored the segregation and racism that marked their cities , clinging to the notion that their region was a beacon to the nation\u2014that it led the way for racial justice . After all , it was Northern senators who banded together to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act , defeating a record-long Southern filibuster . Northern activists had trooped to the deepest reaches of the South , risking their lives for black equality . When Massachusetts passed the Racial Imbalance Act in 1965 , residents believed they were making good on their own lofty reputation . And in 1966 , Ed Brooke \u2019 s election to the U.S. Senate stood as further proof of Northern enlightenment .\nBut the bloody events in Boston illustrated that in many ways white Northerners were more committed to pretense than progress .\nA few months before white mobs milled in the streets of South Boston , the busing controversy also seized Capitol Hill . Each year from 1966 to 1977 , the U.S. House of Representatives passed at least one new law designed to restrain school integration\u2014often in the guise of anti-busing legislation . Until 1974 , the Senate rejected those bills . But as white resistance to busing escalated in many cities across the country , the House \u2019 s anti-busing majority began to pull more senators to their side .\nEd Brooke found himself in a unique predicament . His home state of Massachusetts had become the center of the anti-busing movement . Yet Brooke retained a deep commitment to integrated education , and to busing .\nBrooke \u2019 s anti-busing constituents challenged him many times . Over and over , he emphatically explained the moral and legal arguments for busing . He pointed out that the Bay State \u2019 s Racial Imbalance Act had been on the books since 1965 . Yet white Bostonians had opposed all attempts to integrate the schools . In fact , segregation in Boston \u2019 s schools had deepened with each passing year . To do nothing would have been to isolate black children in inferior and segregated schools . This was why , he noted , a federal judge had finally ordered a widespread busing plan .\nFor Brooke , integration was an absolute imperative . Segregated schools denied black children equal opportunity . \u201c We had all-black schools and all-white schools , \u201d he recalled later . Busing \u201c was the best thing that we had to at least desegregate the schools at that time in our history . And I thought we didn \u2019 t have anything better . \u201d\nIn May 1974 , the Senate debated the Gurney Amendment to an omnibus education bill ; Sen. Edward Gurney \u2019 s provision combined a number of restrictions on busing . The most controversial of the anti-busing clauses allowed locales that had maintained Jim Crow schools\u2014even ones that were under explicit desegregation orders\u2014to reopen their cases and to potentially have those desegregation orders nullified .\nOn May 15 , two days before the 20th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision , Brooke delivered an emotional address on the Senate floor . Gurney \u2019 s amendment would \u201c put us back decades , \u201d he thundered . \u201c For two decades , the course has been sure but slow . And now we ask to hastily and drastically alter it . Why ? Because many Americans have become confused by the rhetoric on busing. \u201d Brooke boiled it down for them : \u201c The issue is simple . Shall we or shall we not permit necessary remedies to a constitutional violation ? ... The fact is that in many cases , busing is necessary to uphold the law. \u201d Brooke called the amendment \u201c unconscionable and unconstitutional , \u201d and moved to table it . The Senate did so , by a single vote .\nOn May 16 , Republican Sen. Robert Griffin of Michigan attempted to revive the anti-busing amendment\u2014without the clause that allowed for the reopening of court orders . Liberals tried to table this proposal , but they failed by one vote . Minority Leader Hugh Scott ( R-Pa. ) and Majority Leader Mike Mansfield ( D-Mont . ) then offered a compromise : They \u2019 d leave intact the text of Griffin \u2019 s amendment\u2014which included various anti-busing restrictions but excised the section about the court orders\u2014and added the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary \u2019 s power to enforce the Fifth and 14th Amendments .\nAnti-busing leaders denounced the Scott-Mansfield compromise , which passed 47 to 46 . Brooke voted for the compromise , satisfied that the language about the Fifth and 14th Amendments was a sufficient safeguard of minority students \u2019 rights . The larger omnibus bill , which Brooke also supported , then gained passage by a wide majority .\nIn the coming months , as busing beset Boston , the ranks of pro-busing senators would shrink even more . But Ed Brooke remained a vocal defender of busing , even as he was vanquished by a young senator who hitched his rising star to the anti-busing movement .\nAt 32 years old , and sporting long sideburns , Joe Biden was the youngest member of the Senate . During his initial 1972 campaign , Biden advocated racial equality . He questioned the motives of anti-busing leaders and charged that Republicans had exploited the busing issue in order to win white votes . He also supported the Swann decision , and opposed a constitutional amendment banning busing\u2014as did the Republican incumbent he defeated , J. Caleb Boggs .\nBut during the campaign , Biden had begun to develop a convoluted position in which he supported busing as a remedy for \u201c de jure segregation \u201d ( as in the Jim Crow South ) , while he opposed busing in cases of \u201c de facto segregation \u201d ( as in Northern cities ) . Through his first two years in the Senate , he supported most\u2014but not all\u2014of the anti-busing legislation . In two crucial exceptions , he voted to table the Gurney Amendment in May 1974\u2014and he also voted in favor of the Scott-Mansfield compromise . He sided with Brooke on both votes , and on both occasions their side prevailed by a single vote .\nFor these few votes , Biden attracted the fury of his white constituents . Delaware residents had formed the New Castle County Neighborhood Schools Association in order to resist desegregation . In June 1974 , the group organized an event at the Krebs School in Newport , Delaware\u2014as Brett Gadsden details in Between North and South . The event \u2019 s coordinator had recently declared , \u201c We \u2019 re going to hound Biden for the next four years if he doesn \u2019 t vote our position. \u201d Standing before a Krebs School auditorium packed with angry white parents , Biden explained that he supported busing only as a remedy for \u201c de jure \u201d segregation . He assured the crowd that any segregation in Delaware was \u201c de facto , \u201d and therefore\u2014he claimed\u2014beyond the authority of the courts . The crowd jeered him anyway until he departed . The ugly incident clearly left its mark on the senator .\nA year later , in the summer of 1975 , Boston erupted in more racial violence and braced for its second year of busing . Meanwhile , Brooke and Biden steeled themselves for a showdown on Capitol Hill .\nSen. Jesse Helms , a Republican from North Carolina , was the first to strike . On September 17 , 1975 , when a larger education bill came up for debate , Helms offered a crippling anti-integration amendment . It would prevent the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare from collecting any data about the race of students or teachers . In addition , HEW could not \u201c require any school \u2026 to classify teachers or students by race. \u201d Thus , HEW could not withhold funding from school districts that refused to integrate . \u201c This is an antibusing amendment , \u201d Helms explained . \u201c This is an amendment to stop the current regiments of faceless , federal bureaucrats from destroying our schools . \u201d\nBiden rose to support Helms \u2019 amendment . \u201c I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues \u2026 that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports [ the Helms amendment ] . \u201d Helms replied that he was happy to welcome Biden \u201c to the ranks of the enlightened. \u201d After the laughter died down , Biden launched an anti-busing screed . \u201c I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept. \u201d The Senate should declare busing a failure and focus instead on \u201c whether or not we are really going to provide a better educational opportunity for blacks and minority groups in this country. \u201d He praised Ed Brooke \u2019 s initiatives on housing , job opportunities and voting rights . In one breath , Biden seemed to reject busing in the North and the South , and claimed that he was committed to equal opportunity for African Americans .\nSen. Brooke campaigning for Richard Nixon in 1968 . | Getty\nA few other senators spoke briefly about the amendment , then Brooke sprung to action . The Helms amendment would eviscerate Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , Brooke said , which enabled HEW to cut off funding to school districts that refused to integrate . Brooke asserted that the federal government should attempt other integration remedies before resorting to busing . \u201c But if compliance with the law can not be achieved without busing , then busing must be one of the available desegregation remedies. \u201d Brooke introduced a motion to table Helms \u2019 amendment . Brooke \u2019 s motion passed , 48-43 . Biden wouldn \u2019 t budge , and voted with Jesse Helms and the anti-bussers .\nBrooke had fought this fight before , but he would face a more formidable adversary in Joe Biden . When a Southern conservative like Helms led the anti-busing forces , Ed Brooke could still rally his troops . But it would be tougher to combat the anti-busing faction when its messenger was a young liberal from a border state .\nImmediately after the Helms amendment was tabled , Biden proposed his own amendment to the $ 36 billion education bill , stipulating that none of those federal funds could be used by school systems \u201c to assign teachers or students to schools \u2026 for reasons of race. \u201d His amendment would prevent \u201c some faceless bureaucrat \u201d from \u201c deciding that any child , black or white , should fit in some predetermined ratio. \u201d He explained , \u201c All the amendment says is that some bureaucrat sitting down there in HEW can not tell a school district whether it is properly segregated or desegregated , or whether it should or should not have funds. \u201d Finally , Biden called busing \u201c an asinine policy . \u201d\nBrooke pointed out that the amendment would do much more than Biden claimed . Like the Helms gambit , it would still gut Title VI of the Civil Rights Act . But this time , a number of liberal senators that had opposed Helms \u2019 amendment now supported Biden : Warren Magnuson and Scoop Jackson of Washington , where Seattle faced impending integration orders ; and Thomas Eagleton and Stuart Symington of Missouri , where Kansas City confronted a similar fate . Mike Mansfield , the majority leader from Montana , also jumped on board . Watching his liberal colleagues defect , Republican Jacob Javits of New York mused , \u201c They \u2019 re scared to death on busing. \u201d The Senate approved Biden \u2019 s amendment . Biden had managed to turn a 48-43 loss for the anti-busing forces into a 50-43 victory .\nIn a seminal moment , the Senate thus turned against desegregation . The Senate had supported the 1964 Civil Rights Act , 1965 Voting Rights Act and 1968 Fair Housing Act . In the early 1970s , as President Richard Nixon and the House of Representatives encouraged the anti-busing movement , the Senate remained the last bastion for those who supported strong integration policies . Biden stormed that bastion , and it seemed to be falling . On September 23 , another border-state Democrat moved against busing . Robert Byrd , the West Virginian who had since repudiated his Klan past , offered a perfecting amendment . It would prohibit busing beyond a student \u2019 s nearest school . It passed the Senate by a vote of 51-45 .\nBrooke was outraged . He called the vote on Biden \u2019 s amendment \u201c the greatest symbolic defeat for civil rights since 1964. \u201d He argued that Biden \u2019 s amendment would eliminate virtually every remedy for segregation , as school systems would be prohibited from assigning students on the basis of race no matter what the method . Brooke accused Biden of effectively leading an assault on integration .\nBrooke attempted one last maneuver . He tried to nullify the Biden and Byrd riders , but failed to force a vote on the matter . Biden then proposed another amendment , a concession to his liberal critics . It barred HEW from ordering busing , while leaving other integration measures intact . Defending his own civil rights record , Biden explained that his original aim had been only to stop busing , not to hamstring every other attempt at desegregation . This measure , \u201c Biden II , \u201d sailed through the Senate . On September 26 , the Senate passed the larger education bill\u2014with Byrd \u2019 s rider as well as Biden II\u2014by a margin of 60-18 .\nPerhaps Brooke foresaw the new political consensus that would take shape in the ensuing decades : Liberals would pay homage to the civil rights movement and its dream of integration , but refrain from championing the legislation that would make that dream a reality . \u201c It is just a matter of time before we wipe out the civil rights progress of the last decade , \u201d Brooke lamented after the passage of the education bill . The clock was turning back .\nFrom the beginning , a certain set of circumstances had to exist in order for America \u2019 s white majority to stomach forceful measures for integration . Public support depended upon the perception of a fight between good and evil . White Americans had to see desegregation as morally right and segregation as morally wrong . With the onset of busing in Northern cities , the situation started to appear ambiguous . Few white Northerners viewed busing as a way to provide equal opportunity for black children . In fact , by the mid-1970s , whites viewed themselves as the aggrieved party when it came to busing . They believed that African Americans had already won their rights with the civil rights bills of the previous decade . With little regard or care for whether African American children would be confined to segregated schools , whites thought their rights were violated if their children couldn \u2019 t attend \u201c neighborhood schools . \u201d\nAfrican Americans viewed it differently . As Boston NAACP leader Tom Atkins put it in March 1975 , \u201c An anti-busing amendment is an anti-desegregation amendment , and an anti-desegregation amendment is an anti-black amendment . \u201d\nIn October 1975 , U.S. News and World Report published a special feature on busing , in which they interviewed a political leader from each side of the issue . Ed Brooke was the face of the pro-busing side . Joe Biden represented anti-busing .\nThe article read like a tale of the tape . A photo of a youthful Biden topped the left column . If the courts and HEW \u201c continue to handle busing in the manner in which it has been handled , \u201d said Biden , \u201c I would eliminate forced busing under any circumstances. \u201d When asked whether busing caused more harm than good , Biden answered : \u201c Absolutely. \u201d Biden explained that he had examined the arguments used to justify busing . They \u201c seem to me to be profoundly racist. \u201d He claimed that busing reinforced the idea of black inferiority . Busing implied that African Americans could \u201c cut it educationally \u201d only if they sat next to white students . \u201c It implies that blacks have no reason to be proud of their inheritance and their own culture . \u201d\nBiden \u2019 s logic\u2014that anti-busing was the way to respect African American culture\u2014 allowed the political center-left to coalesce around this brand of opposition to busing . Further , Biden insisted that the majority of white Americans had no objection \u201c to their child sitting with a black child , eating lunch with a black child\u2014all the things that were the basis for the racist movement in the past. \u201d Biden thus divorced the anti-busing position from the racial hatred that occasioned it . To clinch his case , Biden expressed pride in the fact that several Senate liberals had supported his amendment . The anti-busing position was \u201c becoming more respectable , \u201d a development for which he happily took credit .\nBrooke offered a nuanced defense of busing . \u201c It is not necessarily the best way , \u201d he said , \u201c but in certain instances busing is the only way to achieve desegregation. \u201d Brooke favored the building of new schools and the consolidation of old ones , for example , if such measures could bring integration . \u201c But when these fail or are inappropriate , busing is a constitutional tool that should be used , and is being used , but only as a last resort. \u201d Brooke realized that the voters disagreed with him on the busing issue . \u201c It \u2019 s not popular\u2014certainly among my constituents . I know that . But , you know , I \u2019 ve always believed that those of us who serve in public life have a responsibility to inform and provide leadership for our constituents. \u201d The rights of a minority were on the line . Brooke could not bend ; he had to lead .\nHe paid for it . Brooke and Biden were like ships passing in the night . From that point forward , their political careers followed opposite trajectories . In 1978 , Brooke ran for a third term . In the six years since his previous reelection campaign , Boston had become not only the center of the anti-busing movement but also a hotbed of anti-abortion activity . Brooke clung to his pro-busing and pro-choice convictions nonetheless . To complicate matters , he endured a messy divorce and was accused of improper financial dealings . Democrat Paul Tsongas defeated Brooke in 1978 . Brooke never returned to public office .\nJoe Biden was just beginning his political ascent . While he campaigned for reelection in 1978 , a busing plan was finally being implemented in Wilmington . Biden \u2019 s most rabid anti-busing constituents still perceived him as too liberal on the issue , though Biden denounced the busing plan in Delaware . In the end , Biden \u2019 s anti-busing crusades in the Senate had convinced the majority of white voters . He won reelection by a sizable margin .\nAs Biden settled in for a long Senate career , that body was fast losing its liberal lions . Progressives like Brooke , Hubert Humphrey , George McGovern , Philip Hart and Jacob Javits had retired , been defeated or passed away . With the Reagan Revolution in the offing , their absence both reflected and enabled the larger conservative trend . The Reagan administration relaxed enforcement of civil rights laws , and few leaders advocated increased spending or legislation on behalf of racial minorities .\nGradually , busing plans would peter out . Busing had brought a measure of integration to many urban school systems . But without the strong support of leading liberals , and amid whites \u2019 accelerating retreat to the suburbs , many locales soon ditched their busing plans . Conservatives succeeded in writing the first draft of history , in which busing is cited as the exemplar of social engineering run amok .\nBiden agreed , and he still does . In his 2007 memoir ( titled Promises to Keep ) , Biden called busing \u201c a liberal train wreck. \u201d Alas , Biden was a product\u2014and a symbol\u2014of his times . He was a liberal in the age of the white backlash and the Reagan Democrats . In order to sustain a long political career , it was often necessary to avoid difficult stands\u2014especially when it came to issues of racial equality .\nElected officials drew an important lesson from the busing ordeal of the 1970s : Bold pushes for racial change entailed political death . It was better to abandon them .",

In many cities, the \u201cneighborhood school\u201d\u2014itself a product of redlining, housing segregation and discriminatory school transfer policies\u2014remains sacrosanct. But we forget that through the 1960s and 1970s, local school boards and urban whites often resisted every other attempt at school and housing integration. With their resistance, they narrowed the options down to two: busing or segregation.\n\nThe Swann ruling and the court orders that followed triggered a swift backlash. White parents trembled with rage as they envisioned scenarios in which their children would be bused into African American neighborhoods. Elected officials came out against busing, while still insisting they supported integration. Yet few ever offered an alternative for how to achieve it.\n\nNowhere did the busing wars play out more dramatically than in Boston. Massachusetts had passed a 1965 law that banned segregated schools. But Boston leaders never attempted to comply with the law. Instead, the Boston School Committee continued to pursue policies designed to preserve segregated schools. Black parents filed a lawsuit in 1972, and the NAACP argued their case. On June 21, 1974, federal Judge W. Arthur Garrity found that local officials had deliberately kept Boston\u2019s schools segregated, and that the city must integrate at once. He drew up a busing plan. Black students from Roxbury would attend South Boston High School, while Irish Americans from Southie would board buses to Roxbury.\n\nPolice escort a black student off a school bus outside South Boston High School on Sept. 12, 1974, the first day of school busing. | Getty\n\nThe first buses rolled through Boston in September 1974\u2014and racial violence engulfed the city. White mobs hurled bricks at school buses with terrified black children inside. Then, on October 7, a Haitian immigrant was beaten savagely by a white mob in South Boston. In the coming months, the list of casualties would grow. The city became a cauldron of racial hatred.\n\nThe Boston busing crisis shocked white Northerners. Many had long ignored the segregation and racism that marked their cities, clinging to the notion that their region was a beacon to the nation\u2014that it led the way for racial justice. After all, it was Northern senators who banded together to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, defeating a record-long Southern filibuster. Northern activists had trooped to the deepest reaches of the South, risking their lives for black equality. When Massachusetts passed the Racial Imbalance Act in 1965, residents believed they were making good on their own lofty reputation. And in 1966, Ed Brooke\u2019s election to the U.S. Senate stood as further proof of Northern enlightenment.\n\nBut the bloody events in Boston illustrated that in many ways white Northerners were more committed to pretense than progress.\n\n\n\n***\n\nA few months before white mobs milled in the streets of South Boston, the busing controversy also seized Capitol Hill. Each year from 1966 to 1977, the U.S. House of Representatives passed at least one new law designed to restrain school integration\u2014often in the guise of anti-busing legislation. Until 1974, the Senate rejected those bills. But as white resistance to busing escalated in many cities across the country, the House\u2019s anti-busing majority began to pull more senators to their side.\n\nEd Brooke found himself in a unique predicament. His home state of Massachusetts had become the center of the anti-busing movement. Yet Brooke retained a deep commitment to integrated education, and to busing.\n\nBrooke\u2019s anti-busing constituents challenged him many times. Over and over, he emphatically explained the moral and legal arguments for busing. He pointed out that the Bay State\u2019s Racial Imbalance Act had been on the books since 1965. Yet white Bostonians had opposed all attempts to integrate the schools. In fact, segregation in Boston\u2019s schools had deepened with each passing year. To do nothing would have been to isolate black children in inferior and segregated schools. This was why, he noted, a federal judge had finally ordered a widespread busing plan.\n\nFor Brooke, integration was an absolute imperative. Segregated schools denied black children equal opportunity. \u201cWe had all-black schools and all-white schools,\u201d he recalled later. Busing \u201cwas the best thing that we had to at least desegregate the schools at that time in our history. And I thought we didn\u2019t have anything better.\u201d\n\nIn May 1974, the Senate debated the Gurney Amendment to an omnibus education bill; Sen. Edward Gurney\u2019s provision combined a number of restrictions on busing. The most controversial of the anti-busing clauses allowed locales that had maintained Jim Crow schools\u2014even ones that were under explicit desegregation orders\u2014to reopen their cases and to potentially have those desegregation orders nullified.\n\nOn May 15, two days before the 20th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, Brooke delivered an emotional address on the Senate floor. Gurney\u2019s amendment would \u201cput us back decades,\u201d he thundered. \u201cFor two decades, the course has been sure but slow. And now we ask to hastily and drastically alter it. Why? Because many Americans have become confused by the rhetoric on busing.\u201d Brooke boiled it down for them: \u201cThe issue is simple. Shall we or shall we not permit necessary remedies to a constitutional violation? ... The fact is that in many cases, busing is necessary to uphold the law.\u201d Brooke called the amendment \u201cunconscionable and unconstitutional,\u201d and moved to table it. The Senate did so, by a single vote.\n\nOn May 16, Republican Sen. Robert Griffin of Michigan attempted to revive the anti-busing amendment\u2014without the clause that allowed for the reopening of court orders. Liberals tried to table this proposal, but they failed by one vote. Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-Pa.) and Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) then offered a compromise: They\u2019d leave intact the text of Griffin\u2019s amendment\u2014which included various anti-busing restrictions but excised the section about the court orders\u2014and added the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary\u2019s power to enforce the Fifth and 14th Amendments.\n\nAnti-busing leaders denounced the Scott-Mansfield compromise, which passed 47 to 46. Brooke voted for the compromise, satisfied that the language about the Fifth and 14th Amendments was a sufficient safeguard of minority students\u2019 rights. The larger omnibus bill, which Brooke also supported, then gained passage by a wide majority.\n\nIn the coming months, as busing beset Boston, the ranks of pro-busing senators would shrink even more. But Ed Brooke remained a vocal defender of busing, even as he was vanquished by a young senator who hitched his rising star to the anti-busing movement.\n\n\n\n***\n\nAt 32 years old, and sporting long sideburns, Joe Biden was the youngest member of the Senate. During his initial 1972 campaign, Biden advocated racial equality. He questioned the motives of anti-busing leaders and charged that Republicans had exploited the busing issue in order to win white votes. He also supported the Swann decision, and opposed a constitutional amendment banning busing\u2014as did the Republican incumbent he defeated, J. Caleb Boggs.\n\nBut during the campaign, Biden had begun to develop a convoluted position in which he supported busing as a remedy for \u201cde jure segregation\u201d (as in the Jim Crow South), while he opposed busing in cases of \u201cde facto segregation\u201d (as in Northern cities). Through his first two years in the Senate, he supported most\u2014but not all\u2014of the anti-busing legislation. In two crucial exceptions, he voted to table the Gurney Amendment in May 1974\u2014and he also voted in favor of the Scott-Mansfield compromise. He sided with Brooke on both votes, and on both occasions their side prevailed by a single vote.\n\nFor these few votes, Biden attracted the fury of his white constituents. Delaware residents had formed the New Castle County Neighborhood Schools Association in order to resist desegregation. In June 1974, the group organized an event at the Krebs School in Newport, Delaware\u2014as Brett Gadsden details in Between North and South. The event\u2019s coordinator had recently declared, \u201cWe\u2019re going to hound Biden for the next four years if he doesn\u2019t vote our position.\u201d Standing before a Krebs School auditorium packed with angry white parents, Biden explained that he supported busing only as a remedy for \u201cde jure\u201d segregation. He assured the crowd that any segregation in Delaware was \u201cde facto,\u201d and therefore\u2014he claimed\u2014beyond the authority of the courts. The crowd jeered him anyway until he departed. The ugly incident clearly left its mark on the senator.\n\nA year later, in the summer of 1975, Boston erupted in more racial violence and braced for its second year of busing. Meanwhile, Brooke and Biden steeled themselves for a showdown on Capitol Hill.\n\nSen. Jesse Helms, a Republican from North Carolina, was the first to strike. On September 17, 1975, when a larger education bill came up for debate, Helms offered a crippling anti-integration amendment. It would prevent the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from collecting any data about the race of students or teachers. In addition, HEW could not \u201crequire any school \u2026 to classify teachers or students by race.\u201d Thus, HEW could not withhold funding from school districts that refused to integrate. \u201cThis is an antibusing amendment,\u201d Helms explained. \u201cThis is an amendment to stop the current regiments of faceless, federal bureaucrats from destroying our schools.\u201d\n\nBiden rose to support Helms\u2019 amendment. \u201cI am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues \u2026 that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports [the Helms amendment].\u201d Helms replied that he was happy to welcome Biden \u201cto the ranks of the enlightened.\u201d After the laughter died down, Biden launched an anti-busing screed. \u201cI have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept.\u201d The Senate should declare busing a failure and focus instead on \u201cwhether or not we are really going to provide a better educational opportunity for blacks and minority groups in this country.\u201d He praised Ed Brooke\u2019s initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights. In one breath, Biden seemed to reject busing in the North and the South, and claimed that he was committed to equal opportunity for African Americans.\n\nSen. Brooke campaigning for Richard Nixon in 1968. | Getty\n\nA few other senators spoke briefly about the amendment, then Brooke sprung to action. The Helms amendment would eviscerate Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Brooke said, which enabled HEW to cut off funding to school districts that refused to integrate. Brooke asserted that the federal government should attempt other integration remedies before resorting to busing. \u201cBut if compliance with the law cannot be achieved without busing, then busing must be one of the available desegregation remedies.\u201d Brooke introduced a motion to table Helms\u2019 amendment. Brooke\u2019s motion passed, 48-43. Biden wouldn\u2019t budge, and voted with Jesse Helms and the anti-bussers.\n\nBrooke had fought this fight before, but he would face a more formidable adversary in Joe Biden. When a Southern conservative like Helms led the anti-busing forces, Ed Brooke could still rally his troops. But it would be tougher to combat the anti-busing faction when its messenger was a young liberal from a border state.\n\n\n\n***\n\nImmediately after the Helms amendment was tabled, Biden proposed his own amendment to the $36 billion education bill, stipulating that none of those federal funds could be used by school systems \u201cto assign teachers or students to schools \u2026 for reasons of race.\u201d His amendment would prevent \u201csome faceless bureaucrat\u201d from \u201cdeciding that any child, black or white, should fit in some predetermined ratio.\u201d He explained, \u201cAll the amendment says is that some bureaucrat sitting down there in HEW cannot tell a school district whether it is properly segregated or desegregated, or whether it should or should not have funds.\u201d Finally, Biden called busing \u201can asinine policy.\u201d\n\nBrooke pointed out that the amendment would do much more than Biden claimed. Like the Helms gambit, it would still gut Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. But this time, a number of liberal senators that had opposed Helms\u2019 amendment now supported Biden: Warren Magnuson and Scoop Jackson of Washington, where Seattle faced impending integration orders; and Thomas Eagleton and Stuart Symington of Missouri, where Kansas City confronted a similar fate. Mike Mansfield, the majority leader from Montana, also jumped on board. Watching his liberal colleagues defect, Republican Jacob Javits of New York mused, \u201cThey\u2019re scared to death on busing.\u201d The Senate approved Biden\u2019s amendment. Biden had managed to turn a 48-43 loss for the anti-busing forces into a 50-43 victory.\n\nIn a seminal moment, the Senate thus turned against desegregation. The Senate had supported the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 1965 Voting Rights Act and 1968 Fair Housing Act. In the early 1970s, as President Richard Nixon and the House of Representatives encouraged the anti-busing movement, the Senate remained the last bastion for those who supported strong integration policies. Biden stormed that bastion, and it seemed to be falling. On September 23, another border-state Democrat moved against busing. Robert Byrd, the West Virginian who had since repudiated his Klan past, offered a perfecting amendment. It would prohibit busing beyond a student\u2019s nearest school. It passed the Senate by a vote of 51-45.\n\nBrooke was outraged. He called the vote on Biden\u2019s amendment \u201cthe greatest symbolic defeat for civil rights since 1964.\u201d He argued that Biden\u2019s amendment would eliminate virtually every remedy for segregation, as school systems would be prohibited from assigning students on the basis of race no matter what the method. Brooke accused Biden of effectively leading an assault on integration.\n\nBrooke attempted one last maneuver. He tried to nullify the Biden and Byrd riders, but failed to force a vote on the matter. Biden then proposed another amendment, a concession to his liberal critics. It barred HEW from ordering busing, while leaving other integration measures intact. Defending his own civil rights record, Biden explained that his original aim had been only to stop busing, not to hamstring every other attempt at desegregation. This measure, \u201cBiden II,\u201d sailed through the Senate. On September 26, the Senate passed the larger education bill\u2014with Byrd\u2019s rider as well as Biden II\u2014by a margin of 60-18.\n\nPerhaps Brooke foresaw the new political consensus that would take shape in the ensuing decades: Liberals would pay homage to the civil rights movement and its dream of integration, but refrain from championing the legislation that would make that dream a reality. \u201cIt is just a matter of time before we wipe out the civil rights progress of the last decade,\u201d Brooke lamented after the passage of the education bill. The clock was turning back.\n\n\n\n***\n\nFrom the beginning, a certain set of circumstances had to exist in order for America\u2019s white majority to stomach forceful measures for integration. Public support depended upon the perception of a fight between good and evil. White Americans had to see desegregation as morally right and segregation as morally wrong. With the onset of busing in Northern cities, the situation started to appear ambiguous. Few white Northerners viewed busing as a way to provide equal opportunity for black children. In fact, by the mid-1970s, whites viewed themselves as the aggrieved party when it came to busing. They believed that African Americans had already won their rights with the civil rights bills of the previous decade. With little regard or care for whether African American children would be confined to segregated schools, whites thought their rights were violated if their children couldn\u2019t attend \u201cneighborhood schools.\u201d\n\nAfrican Americans viewed it differently. As Boston NAACP leader Tom Atkins put it in March 1975, \u201cAn anti-busing amendment is an anti-desegregation amendment, and an anti-desegregation amendment is an anti-black amendment.\u201d\n\nIn October 1975, U.S. News and World Report published a special feature on busing, in which they interviewed a political leader from each side of the issue. Ed Brooke was the face of the pro-busing side. Joe Biden represented anti-busing.\n\nThe article read like a tale of the tape. A photo of a youthful Biden topped the left column. If the courts and HEW \u201ccontinue to handle busing in the manner in which it has been handled,\u201d said Biden, \u201cI would eliminate forced busing under any circumstances.\u201d When asked whether busing caused more harm than good, Biden answered: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Biden explained that he had examined the arguments used to justify busing. They \u201cseem to me to be profoundly racist.\u201d He claimed that busing reinforced the idea of black inferiority. Busing implied that African Americans could \u201ccut it educationally\u201d only if they sat next to white students. \u201cIt implies that blacks have no reason to be proud of their inheritance and their own culture.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s logic\u2014that anti-busing was the way to respect African American culture\u2014 allowed the political center-left to coalesce around this brand of opposition to busing. Further, Biden insisted that the majority of white Americans had no objection \u201cto their child sitting with a black child, eating lunch with a black child\u2014all the things that were the basis for the racist movement in the past.\u201d Biden thus divorced the anti-busing position from the racial hatred that occasioned it. To clinch his case, Biden expressed pride in the fact that several Senate liberals had supported his amendment. The anti-busing position was \u201cbecoming more respectable,\u201d a development for which he happily took credit.\n\nBrooke offered a nuanced defense of busing. \u201cIt is not necessarily the best way,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in certain instances busing is the only way to achieve desegregation.\u201d Brooke favored the building of new schools and the consolidation of old ones, for example, if such measures could bring integration. \u201cBut when these fail or are inappropriate, busing is a constitutional tool that should be used, and is being used, but only as a last resort.\u201d Brooke realized that the voters disagreed with him on the busing issue. \u201cIt\u2019s not popular\u2014certainly among my constituents. I know that. But, you know, I\u2019ve always believed that those of us who serve in public life have a responsibility to inform and provide leadership for our constituents.\u201d The rights of a minority were on the line. Brooke could not bend; he had to lead.\n\nHe paid for it. Brooke and Biden were like ships passing in the night. From that point forward, their political careers followed opposite trajectories. In 1978, Brooke ran for a third term. In the six years since his previous reelection campaign, Boston had become not only the center of the anti-busing movement but also a hotbed of anti-abortion activity. Brooke clung to his pro-busing and pro-choice convictions nonetheless. To complicate matters, he endured a messy divorce and was accused of improper financial dealings. Democrat Paul Tsongas defeated Brooke in 1978. Brooke never returned to public office.\n\nJoe Biden was just beginning his political ascent. While he campaigned for reelection in 1978, a busing plan was finally being implemented in Wilmington. Biden\u2019s most rabid anti-busing constituents still perceived him as too liberal on the issue, though Biden denounced the busing plan in Delaware. In the end, Biden\u2019s anti-busing crusades in the Senate had convinced the majority of white voters. He won reelection by a sizable margin.\n\nAs Biden settled in for a long Senate career, that body was fast losing its liberal lions. Progressives like Brooke, Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, Philip Hart and Jacob Javits had retired, been defeated or passed away. With the Reagan Revolution in the offing, their absence both reflected and enabled the larger conservative trend. The Reagan administration relaxed enforcement of civil rights laws, and few leaders advocated increased spending or legislation on behalf of racial minorities.\n\nGradually, busing plans would peter out. Busing had brought a measure of integration to many urban school systems. But without the strong support of leading liberals, and amid whites\u2019 accelerating retreat to the suburbs, many locales soon ditched their busing plans. Conservatives succeeded in writing the first draft of history, in which busing is cited as the exemplar of social engineering run amok.\n\nBiden agreed, and he still does. In his 2007 memoir (titled Promises to Keep), Biden called busing \u201ca liberal train wreck.\u201d Alas, Biden was a product\u2014and a symbol\u2014of his times. He was a liberal in the age of the white backlash and the Reagan Democrats. In order to sustain a long political career, it was often necessary to avoid difficult stands\u2014especially when it came to issues of racial equality.\n\nElected officials drew an important lesson from the busing ordeal of the 1970s: Bold pushes for racial change entailed political death. It was better to abandon them.",
