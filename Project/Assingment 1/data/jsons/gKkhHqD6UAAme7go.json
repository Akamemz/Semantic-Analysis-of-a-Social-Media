    "content": "Democrats have mounted a full-scale partisan attack against the release of a congressional memo that reportedly accuses the FBI of surveillance abuses and political bias in actions that led to the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election .\nAccording to the Washington Post , the memo \u201c suggests that the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller III \u2019 s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election were tainted by political bias . It alleges that the FBI , when obtaining a surveillance warrant , relied in some part on a dossier of allegations against then-candidate Donald Trump that was underwritten by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee . \u201d\nPresident Trump is expected to approve public release of the memo Friday , according to multiple media reports . In a Friday morning tweet he wrote : \u201c The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans \u2013 something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago . \u201d\nThe memo comes from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee , headed by Rep. Devin Nunes , R-Calif. , and has been dubbed the Nunes memo .\nThe FBI has joined Democrats in attempting to proactively undermine the Nunes memo and urged President Trump not to release it on national security grounds .\nSo at what point did we decide that the bureaucracy was divorced from congressional oversight and accountability ?\nAll the ins and outs of this issue are hard for the average American who doesn \u2019 t spend all day keeping up with this very complicated story to follow . So now maybe it \u2019 s time for the American people to step back and consider some fundamental questions about what is taking place in this entire situation .\nThere are many in the left and the media decrying Republicans for attacking the institution of the FBI . To which I ask : at what point did institutions , full of imperfect human beings , become infallible ?\nAt what point did we somehow decide that protecting institutions is better than protecting the Constitution and the civil liberties of the American people ? We should be asking ourselves very basic , fundamental questions , such as who rules who ?\nThe very foundations of our institutions are the constitutional ideals of rule of law and the belief that the law is king , in addition to all the rights given to Americans by our Constitution and Declaration of Independence .\nIn a republic , there is no one , no institution , above \u201c We , the People. \u201d The Founders believed that power flows from the people . We elect our representatives , who then in turn represent us and then , with the power given by the people , fund and manage the various governmental agencies .\nSo at what point did we decide that the bureaucracy was divorced from congressional oversight and accountability ?\nIt was not so long ago that many civil libertarians were screaming from the ramparts about National Security Agency abuses of almost limitless FISA ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) warrants to collect anonymous data from U.S. citizens ' landline communications . They warned us about the abuses such data collection might engender with federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies .\nThe current questions \u2013 about the quality and accuracy of the information used to gain a sweeping FISA warrant against the Trump presidential campaign , and how that warrant was used \u2013 should be of great import to any and all who claim to support our nation 's fundamental rights .\nBecause that is what this entire issue of the Nunes memo is about : demanding accountability and transparency from our Justice Department and FBI as to their actions over the last several years .\nDid the FBI and Justice Department in fact use a piece of partisan propaganda , infused with information from Russian intelligence operatives , to secure a FISA warrant to spy on U.S. citizens ?\nDid they in fact turn the awesome power of the surveillance state against U.S. citizens , not necessarily for national security reasons , but for political ones ?\nIn the tradition of every banana republic around the globe , did the U.S. government become weaponized against an opposing political party ?\nI believe all of these things , and likely more , took place . Add to it that the mainstream media , wittingly or unwittingly , helped inject Russian misinformation into the American bloodstream .\nSo there should absolutely be a crisis of faith and trust in our institutions .\nPerhaps we are coming to the ultimate realization of what the end result of a massive Administrative State looks like . Over the last 100 years there has been a dramatic shift away from our Founders \u2019 form of government .\nProgressives envisioned the Administrative State as a massive bureaucracy of the educated elite that would accelerate \u201c progress. \u201d This today is comprised of millions of federal employees and over 430 departments , agencies and sub-agencies .\nWhile some are under the illusion that we are experiencing the ideals of the Founders , we are in fact living the Administrative State dreams of the progressives .\nSo what if some in the Administrative State , resistant to oversight , shirking off the idea that they somehow work for the people and their representatives , actually became heavily politicized and struck back ?
