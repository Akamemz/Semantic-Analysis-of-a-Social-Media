Trump may have famously claimed he could shoot someone and still not lose voters , but have the woes which beset him on all sides begun to challenge his most extravagant declaration ?\nIt \u2019 s plain sabotage , Trump backers said on Thursday , echoing a line put out by the president \u2019 s campaign machine earlier this week .\n\u201c They \u2019 re gon na pick on him because he won , \u201d said Sandy Emrich , manager of the Trolley Shop restaurant in East Bangor . \u201c The Democrats are making it that way .

Show me something . Show me the proof . Or get off his case . \u201d\n\u201c This Russian thing , I think that \u2019 s stupid , \u201d said Joan Hallett , who owns the place with her husband . \u201c We didn \u2019 t vote because the Russians tried to change our opinions . They don \u2019 t realize that the people were tired of Obama . And they wanted a change . \u201d\n\u201c If they \u2019 d leave him alone and quit contriving stuff against him , he \u2019 d do a hell of a job , \u201d said John Griffin , a retired elevator technician . \u201c If they get rid of this contrived stuff , he \u2019 d be a hell of a president . \u201d\n\u201c I mean if he goes to the bathroom , he did it the wrong way , \u201d said Anthony DeFranco , a general contractor . \u201c If he has two scoops of ice cream , they say he \u2019 s a pig . \u201d\nIt was above 90F and a day to look for shade . Russell Frantz , who said he was tired of politics , cooled his heels on a friend \u2019 s porch in Ackermanville . At at an estate auction in Bethlehem , about 40 people congregated under ash and fruit trees to bid a dollar or two apiece on old furniture , tools , baskets and scrap metal .\n\u201c I predict that Trump will be going down , \u201d said Sam Richie , 69 , a retired government worker , carrying a carton of motor oil back to his truck . \u201c He will be leaving office , literally in probably weeks or months . \u201d\nNorthampton voted for Trump by four points despite decades of voting for Democrats at every level of the ballot , thanks to the powerful steel union and the predominance of blue-collar industry . Those who went for Trump may be staunch , but this area has a tradition of Democratic support .\nIn his \u201c young and foolish \u201d days , Richie said , he had been a Republican , but his opinion of his neighbors who voted for Trump was low .\n\u201c Now they got what they bought , \u201d Richie said . \u201c The guy \u2019 s been nothing but a disaster from day one . He \u2019 s done everything that is repulsive in our society , and people are standing by him .\n\u201c He \u2019 s nothing but an orangutan .
