    "content": "At the White House and in a series of conference calls Monday , Democrats wrestled with the one question that preoccupies the party after Donald Trump \u2019 s stunning victory : What to do about the Obama coalition ?\nNeither President Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton explicitly framed it that way in their private and public conversations with party members Monday . But the looming question colored their remarks to shell-shocked operatives and activists , and it serves as the backdrop for the brewing battle over the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee \u2014 a fight that some Democrats are terrified will devolve into a three-month factional war over the party \u2019 s identity , rather than a difference of opinion over party tactics .\nSpeaking in terms of a Democratic Party at a crossroads during his news conference Monday , Obama said he would try not to \u201c big-foot \u201d the party \u2019 s conversation about the future . Later , in a conference call with Democratic activists , he didn \u2019 t address any second-guessing of his or Clinton \u2019 s strategy and again stopped short of dictating the path forward . The recently defeated Clinton took much the same approach in her own private discussion with House Democrats on Monday , speaking vaguely of the road ahead but stopping short of offering specific directions .\n\u201c Two things we can \u2019 t afford to be is discouraged or divided , \u201d she said , according to a Democrat on the call . \u201c We can \u2019 t be distracted or diverted in the fights ahead . \u201d\nYet the issue of whether to re-engage the young voters and minorities who elected Obama to two terms but didn \u2019 t turn out for Clinton , or reach out to the disaffected white working-class voters who swung to Trump , is too pressing to be avoided .\nIn the wake of Clinton \u2019 s shocking defeat , there is widespread skepticism among Democrats about whether the voters who elected Obama will be enough to carry the White House for any future Democrat after an election in which Clinton lost by wide margins among white voters and in rural areas where Trump proved devastatingly popular .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve started to lose touch with white voters . They \u2019 re still the majority out there , and we can \u2019 t claim to be a big-tent party if we lose touch with working-class voters , whether they \u2019 re black , white , blue or red , \u201d said DNC member Boyd Brown of South Carolina . \u201c When you have Nancy Pelosi , Hillary Clinton , Chuck Schumer making the sale for you , that dog don \u2019 t hunt . It \u2019 s time to reshuffle the deck and get some younger folks in there with some more diverse backgrounds . It \u2019 s time for a leadership shakeup . \u201d\nAfter party members are done surveying Democrats \u2019 hollowed-out down-ballot landscape , and with the national party on the precipice of an all-out brawl for the central committee \u2019 s chairmanship , everything is suddenly on the table as Democrats try to determine whether the party chose the wrong messenger , the wrong message or the wrong audience .\nSome are convinced that a tighter focus on a simple economic message would be an important start .\n\u201c Everything is so fresh ; it \u2019 s been less than a week to analyze what we have here . I just know [ zeroing in on jobs ] is what the people of my state expect from me , \u201d said Rhode Island Gov . Gina Raimondo , a Democrat serving in her first term . \u201c When I \u2019 m out and about talking to people , asking , \u2018 What \u2019 s on your mind , what are you concerned about , what can we do to make your life better ? \u2019 That \u2019 s the No . 1 , No . 2 , No . 3 thing . A good job with some security , and the confidence that my kids will be able to get a great job . \u201d\nOther top Democrats have zeroed in on the party \u2019 s narrow-casting approach to voters and an overreliance on modeled targeting of potential supporters .\n\u201c In this election , every key element of the Democratic coalition underperformed , and we need to do better , \u201d said former Maryland Gov . Martin O \u2019 Malley , who is considering a run for DNC chairman after he fell short in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination . \u201c The strategy of narrowly defining the base and then microtargeting it and texting it until it doesn \u2019 t turn out isn \u2019 t a winning strategy for the future . \u201d\n\u201c We have to stop trying to microtarget very different messages for every demographic , and recognize that voters can disagree with you on specific issues as long as they genuinely believe that you want to do the best for every American , \u201d added Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander , who narrowly lost his race for the U.S. Senate last week . \u201c It \u2019 s not about any specific type of voter or demographic . It \u2019 s about making sure we are being unapologetic and honest about what we believe . Voters are smart , and they know the difference . They know when you \u2019 re saying one thing to one group and another thing to another group . \u201d\nAlready , such divisions are on display in the race for the DNC chairmanship \u2014 a proxy for the fight over the party \u2019 s general direction \u2014 with each candidate prescribing a different potential antidote to the party \u2019 s ills .\nMinnesota Rep.
