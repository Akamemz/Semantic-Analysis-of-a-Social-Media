He also harshly criticized the treatment of U.S. sailors briefly seized by Iranian forces in January .\nBut he also has suggested that he would not tear up the deal , as Republican rivals such as Ted Cruz have promised , but to enforce it so strictly that it would constrain any Iranian misbehavior .\nSaeed Kamali Dehghan , who blogs on Iranian affairs for The Guardian , said recently that Mr. Trump is \u201c viewed with much amusement in Iran , \u201d if only because his \u201c rhetoric and inflammatory statements remind many of their former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . \u201d\nWhile Iranians struggle to take measure of Mr. Trump , the president of Russia has given him a major nod of approval \u2014 even before the candidate \u2019 s proclamation in March that NATO is essentially obsolete .\nIt was in December when Mr. Putin told reporters after an annual press conference that he saw Mr. Trump as \u201c a very colorful and talented man. \u201d The billionaire developer had said he admired Mr. Putin \u2019 s decisiveness and predicted that he could develop a better personal relationship with the Russian president than Mr. Obama has .\nMr. Trump \u201c says that he wants to move to another level of relations , to a deeper level of relations with Russia . How can we not welcome that ? \u201d Mr. Putin said at one point .\nMr. Trump seemed eager to polish his position on Russia during his major foreign policy speech last month by saying that \u201c an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia \u201d are possible , but only from \u201c a position of strength . \u201d\n\u201c If we can \u2019 t make a good deal for America , \u201d Mr. Trump said , \u201c we will quickly walk away from the table . \u201d\nThe previous day , a top Russian official said Mr. Trump appeared more pragmatic than either Mr. Obama or former President George W. Bush in his approach to Russia .\n\u201c He expresses readiness to come to terms with the Russian president instead of making conflicts with us , the way today \u2019 s administration is doing , \u201d Alexey Pushkov , chairman of the Russian State Duma \u2019 s foreign policy committee , told the Izvestia newspaper .\n\u201c Trump looks less ideology-stricken in general than Obama , \u201d Mr. Pushkov said . \u201c He is a businessman , and he views everything as a succession of transactions . That \u2019 s far from a bad approach if you compare it with the ideologized , fundamentalist approach of the Bush and Obama administrations that can ruin the life of whole regions and many peoples for the sake of liberalistic chimeras and faked values . \u201d\nFrom the onset of his rise toward the Republican nomination , Mr. Trump has made something of a sport out of hurling insults and criticism at Beijing , claiming that America has been \u201c ripped off \u201d by the flight of U.S. manufacturing to a China that continues to pursue unfair trade practices to steal jobs from working-class Americans .\nU.S. leaders , he said , are too stupid to recognize how Beijing \u2019 s wily masters are exploiting them . For good measure , Mr. Trump has publicly mused on letting Japan , China \u2019 s historical rival for supremacy in East Asia , procure a nuclear bomb .\nChina , it would seem , has no use for Mr. Trump . Or does it ?\nFor all his vitriol on the campaign trail , Mr. Trump is apparently far from hated in China , where government officials and ordinary people vacillate between outrage and entertainment from the billionaire \u2019 s success and his ability to confound the American foreign policy establishment .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s theatrical posturing toward China and Asia first made headlines last summer , when he said Chinese President Xi Jinping deserved a McDonald \u2019 s hamburger rather than a White House state dinner . During a campaign rally , he faked an East Asian accent , barking , \u201c We wan deal , \u201d as he mocked how Chinese and Japanese businesses view the U.S .\nMore recently , Mr. Trump has peppered his comments with what might be read as actual policy proposals .\nHe told The New York Times in January that he would favor a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S. , a proposal that many American economists warn would violate international rules and likely trigger a trade war between the world \u2019 s two largest economies .\nC. Fred Bergsten , a senior fellow and director emeritus of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , told a panel discussion recently that U.S. law would prevent Mr. Trump from raising tariffs by more than 15 percent for five months without declaring a national security emergency .\n\u201c All right , he might do that , \u201d Mr. Bergsten said , adding that whatever Mr. Trump does , the Chinese would find ways to retaliate beyond lodging a case against Washington through the World Trade Organization .\nMr. Trump has heightened his anti-China rhetoric in recent weeks . At a May 3 campaign rally in Indiana , he said \u201c we can \u2019 t allow China to rape our country \u201d through \u201c the greatest theft in the history of the world. \u201d Mr. Trump handily won the state \u2019 s primary .\nHis comments also struck a nerve in China , where they became the fourth most discussed topic on the Chinese Twitter equivalent Weibo , Politico reported .\nIt \u2019 s not clear whether ordinary Chinese people , who have grown used to the antics of outsized billionaires as the country \u2019 s economy has exploded in recent decades , are angered by Mr. Trump \u2019 s claims .\nPolitico cited a late March poll of 3,330 readers of China \u2019 s state-run Global Times newspaper that found 54 percent of respondents support a Trump presidency .\n\u201c Many Chinese , \u201d Politico said , \u201c believe [ Mr. Trump \u2018 s ] business acumen would translate into political pragmatism on matters of national security and foreign policy \u2014 which would play to China \u2019 s advantage . \u201d\nDingding Chen , an instructor at the University of Macau and founder of the Intellisia Institute , a new independent China-based foreign policy think tank , said Mr. Trump also benefits among China \u2019 s vast Web user community from the contrast with likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton , who has a long record of criticizing China \u2019 s human rights record and its treatment of women in particular .\n\u201c For many Chinese netizens , a President Trump , if elected , would be soft on China \u2019 s human rights issues , which is just fine for U.S.-China relations , \u201d Mr. Chen wrote recently in The Diplomat .\nThe popular view stands in contrast to official statements , with the Chinese government , which is clearly unnerved about Mr. Trump \u2019 s comments on trade and tariffs .\nForeign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters after Mr. Trump clinched enough Indiana delegates for the nomination that Chinese officials have \u201c no comment on what is happening now with the election . \u201d\nBut , Mr. Hong said , it is \u201c worth pointing out that mutual benefit and win-win results are defining features of economic cooperation and trade between China and the U.S. , and meet the common interests of both .
