Here's a look at other recent attempts for peace: Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: Defining moments in Middle East peace talks 2010 | Obama \u2013 President Barack Obama walks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, left, and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, at the White House on September 1, 2010.

The peace conference was attended by 16 Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Syria, Israel and the Palestinians. A joint statement was the only thing agreed upon under heavy American pressure and by avoiding specific reference to any of the core issues.

The Summit ended without an agreement.
