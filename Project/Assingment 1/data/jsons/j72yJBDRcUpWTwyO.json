Things aren \u2019 t looking great for the GOP right now .\nThe poll numbers are bad , with only 24 percent approving of the party in a WSJ/NBC survey , lowest in the poll \u2019 s history . The buzz is bad , with lots of downbeat headlines . The reviews from Republican pols who thought the defunding-ObamaCare strategy was nuts are bad , with John McCain telling Fox it was \u201c a fool \u2019 s errand that we were not going to accomplish . \u201d\nBut for all the media pronouncements about how the party has ruined its brand , I think the GOP death watch is way premature .\nWhy do I say that ?
