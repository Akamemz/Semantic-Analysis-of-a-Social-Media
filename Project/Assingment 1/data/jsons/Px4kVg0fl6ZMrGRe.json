    "content": "Good news for control freaks and nanny-staters across the U.S. : Americans ' support for a bigger , more active government is edging up , potentially creating an opening for politicians and activists who want their countrymen to snuggle in the warm bosom of a nurturing state that provides an ever-greater variety of goods , services , and rules for people 's lives . There 's just one catch : Americans do n't want to pay for it . Support for a big , muscular government falls off a cliff if it comes with a price tag .\n`` Since 2010 , the percentage of Americans saying government should do more to solve the country 's problems has increased 11 percentage points , to 47 % , and the percentage wanting government to take active steps to improve people 's lives is up eight points , to 42 % , '' Gallup reported last week . Forty-nine percent think the government is doing too much , and 29 percent prefer a government that provides just basic services .\nHere 's the opportunity politicians\u2014especially Democrats\u2014have been looking for as they promise `` Medicare for All , '' student loan forgiveness , universal basic income , government-supported housing , subsidized child care , and more . Progressive standard-bearers Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) have made particular waves with their plans for government largesse , but Pete Buttigieg and others have their own schemes for turning the federal government into Santa Claus with a bottomless bag of gifts .\nBut a government that provides everything to everybody is going to run up some bills . Oh , you can cut some existing programs and transfer the funds to other programs , but that 's hardly going to satisfy the demands of `` Americans saying government should do more . '' More programs and spending will require more resources that have to come from somewhere . And since bake sales usually fall a bit short when you 're talking about funding government takeovers of large segments of the economy and extensive new programs , that 's going to mean turning tax collectors into busy beavers .\n`` A more active government would almost certainly result in higher taxes , '' Gallup adds . `` However , relatively few Americans favor that approach\u2026 In the latest poll , 25 % would opt for increased taxes and services , 32 % want no change and 42 % prefer smaller government . ''\nSupport for higher taxes to pay for expanded government is up a bit in the survey from years past , but it remains a distinctly minority taste .\nThat means Americans are growing increasingly enthusiastic about placing orders for health care , higher education , housing , and more from the government\u2014for free . But when they see prices on the menu , they balk , big time .\nIt 's not just survey questions about an abstract activist government that give Americans second thoughts\u2014specific examples do the same . Medicare for All gains overwhelming support\u2014as high as 71 percent in a Kaiser Family Foundation survey\u2014from Americans so long as they think it 's entirely cost-free and devoid of tradeoffs . But throw in some real-world qualifiers , and that support erodes .\n`` Net favorability drops as low as -44 percentage points when people hear the argument that this would lead to delays in some people getting some medical tests and treatments , '' the Kaiser survey adds . `` Net favorability is also negative if people hear it would threaten the current Medicare program ( -28 percentage points ) , require most Americans to pay more in taxes ( -23 percentage points ) , or eliminate private health insurance companies ( -21 percentage points ) . ''\nCosts for these plans are unavoidable . Warren 's spending schemes would run to at least $ 26 trillion in new taxes , although she likes to pretend that her scheme would be paid for by a wealth tax that would simultaneously extract funds from successful people while punishing them for their success .

Capitalism\u2014the free market\u2014remains the preferred choice of 60 percent of respondents , with 39 percent having a positive view of socialism , according to Gallup . As with everything in this country , the division is increasingly partisan : Positive views of socialism have risen to 65 percent among Democrats and declined to 9 percent among Republicans . Fifty-two percent of Democrats have a positive view of capitalism vs. 78 percent of Republicans .\nBut , do you know what almost everybody likes ? Eighty-seven percent of the population has a positive view of free enterprise , including 92 percent of Republicans , 88 percent of Independents , and 83 percent of Democrats .
