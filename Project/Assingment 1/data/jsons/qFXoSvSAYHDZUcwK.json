Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : The battle between Donald Trump and the press escalated on Thursday after one of Trump \u2019 s top advisers called the media \u201c the opposition party. \u201d In a rare interview with The New York Times , Trump \u2019 s chief strategist , Steve Bannon , said , quote , \u201c The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut. \u201d Bannon added , \u201c I want you to quote this . The media here is the opposition party . They don \u2019 t understand this country . They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States , \u201d unquote .\nBannon is the former head of right-wing Breitbart Media , which frequently publishes racist , sexist , anti-immigrant and xenophobic news . While he rarely speaks to the media , Breitbart is now playing a key role in the new administration . According to reports , Bannon wrote part of Trump \u2019 s inuaugural speech and penned Trump \u2019 s executive orders on everything from expanding the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico to weakening the Affordable Care Act . Bannon also recently tapped Breitbart \u2019 s national security editor , Sebastian Gorka , and immigration reporter , Julia Hahn , to join the Trump administration . Meanwhile , the president himself was interviewed by Fox News \u2019 Sean Hannity last night and described much of the media as \u201c fake news . \u201d\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : The media\u2014much of the media , not all of it\u2014is very , very dishonest . Honestly , it \u2019 s fake news . It \u2019 s fake . They make things up .\nSEAN HANNITY : So , then , here \u2019 s my question . Between Twitter , Instagram , Facebook , I think\u2014I think you reach 50 million people .\nSEAN HANNITY : But if\u2014we know now , through WikiLeaks , some of these networks were colluding\u2014\nSEAN HANNITY : I \u2019 ve seen major newspapers , two cable networks that used the word \u201c liar. \u201d And my question to you is : Does that make you want to rethink , entirely , how this in administration will deal with the media ?\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Well , they \u2019 re the liars . Let me give you an example . When Sean got up , he talked about the audience . And he talked about I had the largest audience or\u2014I did . I had the largest audience , if you add the television , you add all the sources , the largest audience in the history of inaugurations . I did . They try and demean it . \u2026 They are so demeaning , and they are so dishonest and , in many cases , not smart . But when you bring up\u2014\nSEAN HANNITY : But I don \u2019 t remember them treating Barack Obama this way .\nAMY GOODMAN : Joining us right now is Sarah Posner , Investigative Fund reporter with The Nation Institute . In August , she wrote a headline-grabbing article for Mother Jones about Steve Bannon titled \u201c How Donald Trump \u2019 s New Campaign Chief Created an Online Haven for White Nationalists. \u201d Her most recent piece in Rolling Stone is headlined \u201c Trump Makes Good on His Nativist Campaign Promises . \u201d\nSarah , welcome back to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! First , comment on Stephen Bannon \u2019 s statements to The New York Times that the press is \u201c the opposition party \u201d and \u201c should keep its mouth shut . \u201d\nSARAH POSNER : Well , this is an effort by the Trump administration to intimidate the media , first . And second , the comments are directed not just at the media , which I would predict is going to be not intimidated by Bannon , but it \u2019 s also directed at Bannon \u2019 s own audience at Breitbart News and the entire constellation of the \u201c alt-right , \u201d for which Bannon claimed that Breitbart is the platform . He told me in July that Breitbart is the platform for the \u201c alt-right. \u201d So , this is an effort to delegitimize the media in the eyes of the Breitbart audience\u2014the Trump base , more broadly\u2014by suggesting that the media has dishonestly covered Donald Trump , when , in fact , the chief complaint that has been lodged against the media by the Trump administration , and amplified on by President Trump last night in that clip that you just played , is based on hard facts about numbers that Donald Trump doesn \u2019 t like .\nNow , ironically , the \u201c alt-right \u201d spends much of its time deriding colleges and universities across the United States as havens for weak and hysterical people who need safe spaces and trigger warnings ; meanwhile , the president of the United States can not accept the cold hard facts of how many people were at his inauguration , and sent his press secretary out to complain that the staff has been demoralized by the coverage , which was just based on those facts .\nAMY GOODMAN : So , Sarah , if you can talk more about Breitbart \u2019 s Steve Bannon , you know , the top aide to President Trump , telling the media to shut up . Breitbart News , talk about this institution , also bringing in two more Breitbart News reporters to the inner circle of the White House .\nSARAH POSNER : Well , I would suggest to your viewers to take a look at Breitbart News . I know that a lot of people don \u2019 t want to look at it . They consider it to be fake news , rightfully so . It \u2019 s basically just propaganda . But looking at it and reading some of the coverage there and reading the headlines will give someone a lot of insight into how the Trump administration is functioning , because Bannon has the president \u2019 s ear .\nBreitbart News was founded by the conservative activist Andrew Breitbart , and Bannon took over after Breitbart died suddenly about four or five years ago . Under Bannon \u2019 s leadership , even former reporters and editors at Breitbart have said that it became a haven for the \u201c alt-right , \u201d for white nationalists , for racists . The coverage\u2014the so-called coverage on the site , that was written by\u2014that \u2019 s written by its reporters , feeds into these racist and xenophobic themes . It portrays refugees and immigrants as criminals . It has derided the Black Lives Matter movement . And the coverage is not news . It \u2019 s definitely from a very far-right perspective . And if you read it , it will cause you to question your sense of reality , which is exactly what they \u2019 re looking for . You read it , and you think , \u201c Wow ! This is not what I \u2019 ve seen with my own eyes. \u201d And that \u2019 s exactly what the Trump administration wants the public to start questioning .\nSo , Bannon , when I interviewed him at the Republican National Convention in July , like I said , he told me that Breitbart is the platform for the \u201c alt-right. \u201d He denied that the \u201c alt-right \u201d is a white nationalist movement , but he basically admitted that it \u2019 s an ethnonationalist movement , and he pointed to these far-right , authoritarian , populist movements in Europe that were the model for the \u201c alt-right. \u201d And he said that these nationalist movements were alive and well in the United States before President Trump became a candidate for president , that he did not create this movement . And Bannon actually credited somebody else with really spurring this movement , and that \u2019 s Jeff Sessions , who \u2019 s about to become Trump \u2019 s attorney general .\nAMY GOODMAN : Let \u2019 s go to Steve Bannon speaking in 2013 at the Future of Conservatism conference . At the time , Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart News .\nSTEPHEN BANNON : I think anger is a good thing . I think if you \u2019 re fighting\u2014this country is in a crisis . And if you \u2019 re fighting to save this country , if you \u2019 re fighting to take this country back , it \u2019 s\u2014you know , it \u2019 s not going to be sunshine and patriots . It \u2019 s going to be people who want to fight . I mean , Andrew Breitbart was all about the fight . In fact , we call ourselves , internally , the fight club . Right ? And our watchword is kind of \u201c fights that matter. \u201d \u2026 I am not in agreement , at all , that we need to be the party of empathy\u2014and by that , I mean false empathy\u2014because that is just the slow walk to statism . There is a certain point in time that you have to explain that these programs have not worked and they \u2019 ve enslaved people .\nSARAH POSNER : Well , this is part of the ideology that has fueled the \u201c alt-right \u201d and has fueled Trump \u2019 s rise , the idea that the civil rights movement or the women \u2019 s rights movement have altered American society in terrible ways , that it has changed life for white Americans in ways that have been detrimental to them . And this is\u2014this is a fight , in Bannon \u2019 s own words , over the soul of what America is . Is America a pluralistic democracy , or is America an authoritarian , nationalist , populist society ? And this is the battle that Steve Bannon is waging from within the White House and drawing the media into it by portraying the media as something\u2014as an institution that \u2019 s not\u2014not an institution that is protected by the First Amendment of our Constitution . You notice in those comments that he made , that you just played , he doesn \u2019 t talk about the Constitution at all or how the Constitution protects a free press or the free speech rights and many other rights of Americans . He portrays all of that as having run amok , basically . And this is\u2014this is one of the chief advisers to President Trump right now , chief strategist to President Trump .\nAMY GOODMAN : Now , Stephen Bannon has faced questions about domestic abuse and anti-Semitic comments . He was charged in 1996 with misdemeanor domestic violence , battery and dissuading a witness . A Santa Monica , California , police report said Bannon grabbed his wife at the time , Mary Louise Piccard , quote , \u201c by the throat and arm \u201d and threatened to leave with the couple \u2019 s twin daughters . Bannon pleaded not guilty to the charges , which were later dropped that year when Piccard didn \u2019 t appear in court . She claimed in divorce proceedings Bannon pressured her not to testify . Piccard also said in a sworn 2007 court filing that Bannon made anti-Semitic comments when the two argued over whether to send their daughters to a private school . According to one document , Piccard said , \u201c He said [ that ] he doesn \u2019 t like the way they raise their kids to be 'whiny brats ' and that he didn \u2019 t want the girls going to school with Jews , \u201d unquote . So , this report of him grabbing his wife by the throat , now this whole idea of really trying to choke the press by telling them to shut up .\nSARAH POSNER : Well , I think it \u2019 s fairly obvious , even without those allegations in the domestic cases , which Bannon has denied\u2014I think it \u2019 s obvious that he \u2019 s behaving like a bully . And if you \u2019 ve seen the reaction of the press\u2014I mean , there was a clip that was going around last night of Jake Tapper reading back the quote from Bannon and then basically\u2014you know , saying that the press should shut up\u2014and Tapper just says , \u201c No. \u201d This is going to be the reaction of the press . The press is not going to listen or be bullied by Steve Bannon to , quote-unquote , \u201c shut up. \u201d I think you and I both know that .\nBut I would like to point out something about the anti-Semitism charge . Something that really struck me when I interviewed Bannon back in July was that I asked him about what had happened to one of his former employees at Breitbart , a reporter and editor by the name of Ben Shapiro . After Shapiro left Breitbart in the wake of Breitbart not standing by its reporter , Michelle Fields , after she was grabbed at a Trump press conference by then Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , he was subjected to a barrage of anti-Semitic abuse\u2014Shapiro was subjected to a barrage of anti-Semitic abuse on Twitter and other social media , email and so on . One prime example of it was , after he had announced on Twitter the birth of his and his wife \u2019 s second child , someone tweeted back at him , \u201c To the ovens with all of you. \u201d I asked Bannon about that at the convention , and he cut me off before I could even finish the sentence , and said , \u201c Ben Shapiro is a whiner. \u201d So , rather\u2014I was surprised , because I would have thought that most people would have said something more along the lines of \u201c I \u2019 m very sorry that that happened to my former employee , and I do not condone that kind of behavior , \u201d but instead , he just said that Shapiro was a whiner . So I thought that that was very telling of what Bannon thinks about that kind of harassment and abuse online and how seriously he takes the charges of anti-Semitism .\nAMY GOODMAN : Sarah Posner , I want to thank you for being with us , with the Investigative Fund with The Nation Institute , most recent piece , we \u2019 ll link to , in Rolling Stone , \u201c Trump Makes Good on His Nativist Campaign Promises. \u201d Also , Sarah Posner is author of God \u2019 s Profits : Faith , Fraud , and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters .\nWhen we come back , the Mexican president cancels his trip to Washington , D.C. , saying Mexico will not pay for the wall .
