Others, who put their faith in limited government, think blowing the whistle on this surveillance does the country a service.\n\nIn an interview with Glenn Greenwald of the London Guardian, Mr. Snowden describes how the National Security Agency collects everyone\u2019s communications \u2014 from the innocent and the criminal alike. \u201cIt ingests them by default,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt collects them in its system, filters them, analyzes them, measures them, and it stores them for periods of time simply because that\u2019s the easiest, most efficient and most valuable way to achieve these ends.\u201d\n\nIn a democracy, matters of widespread public interest are meant to be discussed and decided on by our elected representatives, and done in the open.
