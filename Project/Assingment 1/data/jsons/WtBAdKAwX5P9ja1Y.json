On Saturday , Donald Trump tripled down .\nAfter refusing to back off during weeks of fierce backlash for his comments about the alleged criminality of undocumented Mexican immigrants , Trump met on Friday in Beverly Hills with the families of people killed by such immigrants . A day later , he came to Arizona and said , \u201c We have to stop illegal immigration . We have to . We have to , \u201d to the cheers of 4,000 supporters .\nOn Monday , RNC Chairman Reince Preibus called Trump to congratulate him on his success and reportedly ask him to \u201c tone it down . \u201d\nBut Donald Trump only tones it in one direction : up .\n\u201c I love the Mexican people \u2026 I respect Mexico \u2026 but the problem we have is that their leaders are much sharper , smarter and more cunning than our leaders , and they \u2019 re killing us at the border , \u201d said Trump , in front of a giant American flag at the Saturday afternoon rally at the Phoenix convention center . He added , \u201c They \u2019 re taking our jobs . They \u2019 re taking our manufacturing jobs . They \u2019 re taking our money . They \u2019 re killing us . \u201d\nAt one point , Trump brought a man named Jamiel Shaw up to the podium to talk about his late son , explaining , \u201c an illegal immigrant shot him violently . \u201d\nTrump also said that he supports legal immigrants . \u201c They flow in like water , and I love legal immigration .
