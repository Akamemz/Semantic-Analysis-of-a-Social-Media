For this president, that\u2019s the price of doing business in a hyperpartisan culture. No one in Washington can really pretend the game is any longer on the level: Over the past few years, the Supreme Court stepped in to settle a presidential election by a 5-4 partisan vote, Obama\u2019s predecessor launched a reckless war in Iraq on specious grounds, and a Republican-led House held the attorney general in contempt for the first time.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nBut the truth is that Moynihan\u2019s point about the only way to make big changes work seems more than vindicated.\n\nObama tried \u2014 for far longer than most of his liberal allies wanted \u2014 to get a bipartisan health care bill.
