    "content": "Kanye West did lunch with President Trump Thursday , but pre-empted the meal with a wildly entertaining and decidedly bizarre press conference in which he covered Superman , the 13th and Second amendments , North Korea and his budding MAGA bromance with the commander in chief .\nWest began the much-anticipated sit-down by praising Trump 's efforts in North Korea saying , `` On day one you solved one of [ Obama 's ] biggest troubles . We solved one of the biggest problems . ''\nThe conversation turned to West discussing the lack of support he received from his Hollywood cohorts with regards to his support of the president .\n`` They tried to scare me to not wear this hat , '' West said , referring to his `` Make America Great Again '' hat he wore to the meeting and on a recent appearance on `` Saturday Night Live . ''\n`` When I put this hat on , it made me feel like Superman - my favorite superhero . You made a Superman cape for me . ''\nThe rapper went on to chastise the NBC sketch show and other liberal-leaning media members for their portrayal of the American president .\n`` What I need 'SNL ' and liberals to improve on is , if he do n't look good , we do n't look good . He has to be the freshest , the flyest , have the flyest planes . He has to look good ! '' West said . `` When we make everything in China and not America , we \u2019 re cheating on our country . ''\nWest discussed many topics in a rambling dialogue that included everything from bringing manufacturing to the country , his personal business deals , ending stop-and-frisk in Chicago and the 13th Amendment .\n`` There 's a lot of things that affect our mental health that put us into this trap door that is the 13th Amendment , '' West said .\nWest went on to reference his recent bipolar disorder diagnosis saying that he was misdiagnosed by a doctor and said he was merely sleep-deprived .\nThe chat was then turned over to reporters who asked West about his feelings on gun control .\n`` Illegal guns is the problem , not legal guns , we have the right to bear arms , '' he said bluntly .\nOverall , West was complimentary to the president , even at one point saying he loved him and running around the Resolute desk to hug him .\nThe rapper 's statement lasted nearly 10 minutes before the president chimed in to compliment West on his honesty .\n`` I tell you what , that was pretty impressive , '' Trump said after West seemed to run out of steam . `` That was quite something . ''\n`` It was from the soul . I just channeled it , '' West replied .\nTrump continued to compliment the rapper , who talked about spreading love through the country .\n\u201c He can speak for me any time he wants , he \u2019 s a smart cookie , \u201d Trump said . \u201c He gets it . \u201d\nWhen asked if West \u2019 s previous declarations that he \u2019 ll run for president seem reasonable to Trump , he noted that he thinks Kanye \u201c could very well be \u201d candidate material .\nFormer NFL legend and actor Jim Brown was in the meeting along with senior advisor and Trump 's son-in-law Jared Kushner .
