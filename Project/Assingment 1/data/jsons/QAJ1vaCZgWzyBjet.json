    "content": "Ted Cruz has got religion , and he \u2019 s not shy about it .\nIn every stump speech , the freshman senator asks voters to pray . He quotes from Scripture , and speaks of Judeo-Christian values . He talks about persecuted Christians in the Middle East . And he tells the story of his father , Rafael Cruz , a Cuban refugee and evangelical preacher who is a regular on the presidential campaign trail .\nSenator Cruz , a Southern Baptist from Texas , may seem out of place in the snows of New Hampshire , the second-least-church-going state in the country . But he is unabashed .\n\u201c Lift this country up in prayer , \u201d Cruz tells the crowd gathered in a hilltop lodge in Washington , N.H. , speaking in the cadence of a preacher . \u201c Say , \u2018 Father God , please continue this . Continue this revival across this country , that we can pull back from this abyss . \u2019 \u201d\nIn the past , a candidate like Cruz might have held back on the religious rhetoric in an effort to widen his appeal in New Hampshire \u2019 s first-in-the-nation primary . But times have changed . Campaign messaging has become a national enterprise , with the growth of the Internet and cable television .\nWhile many candidates are talking about their faith openly on the campaign trail , Cruz is going furthest , and his respectable showing in New Hampshire polls suggests that his style can win converts even among those who don \u2019 t share his religious fervor .\n\u201c He was still talking to Iowa caucus-goers while he was campaigning in New Hampshire , \u201d says Fergus Cullen , former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party . \u201c There was a time when candidates could run one set of ads in Iowa , and no one in New Hampshire would see them . Now you tune in to MSNBC , and you see what they \u2019 re saying in West Des Moines [ Iowa ] , and folks in Iowa see what they \u2019 re saying in Hanover [ N.H . ] \u201d\nVictory in Iowa , home to the kickoff Feb. 1 caucuses , is almost essential for Cruz to have a shot at the Republican nomination . With less than two weeks to go , he and national front-runner Donald Trump are locked in a dead heat there .\nIn New Hampshire , Cruz faces much lower expectations , but he has to make a decent showing , to keep the momentum going . By doing a multiday bus tour through the Granite State , his first extensive visit here in two months , Cruz keeps his supporters and volunteers energized .\nAnd his faith-toned message has not made him an also-ran here . He \u2019 s currently in a statistical dead-heat for third with Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida , polling at 11.3 percent according to the RealClearPolitics average of major polls .\nHe is not the only Republican candidate to carry his faith outside evangelical Iowa and the South .\nSenator Rubio has also been wooing religious voters aggressively . The senator , who is Roman Catholic but also attends a Southern Baptist church , recently released a television ad all about faith that struck political observers as unusually pointed . In the past , successful GOP candidates \u2013 including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush \u2013 have tended to be more circumspect in public about their religious beliefs .\nOhio Gov . John Kasich , a devout Episcopalian , is another candidate who makes faith references a regular part of his pitch . But his appeal in New Hampshire , where he is now polling in second place , is seen as centered on his pragmatic approach to governing \u2013 including expansion of Medicaid in his home state under the Affordable Care Act .\nThen there \u2019 s Mr. Trump , a mainstream Presbyterian whose strength among Evangelicals nationally has baffled some observers , given his three marriages , profane language , and seemingly casual knowledge of the Bible .\nBut just as \u201c God talk \u201d doesn \u2019 t always turn off non-churchgoers , it is not the only way to win the faithful , either . Many Trump supporters , including the religious , value his business success , forceful personality , and status as a nonpolitician above all else . Some say God will guide him to be a successful president .\nThe conservative Evangelical vote , for example , is currently divided into three camps : Cruz , Trump , and Rubio , according to Thomas Kidd , a history professor at Baylor University in Waco , Texas .\n\u201c Cruz represents the \u2018 Jerry Falwell \u2019 wing ( referencing the late head of the Moral Majority ) , Trump the \u2018 Jimmy Swaggart \u2019 wing ( referencing the once-popular \u201c health and wealth \u201d televangelist ) , and Rubio the \u2018 Billy Graham \u2019 wing , \u201d writes Professor Kidd in The Washington Post . Kidd notes that he is a member of Rubio \u2019 s newly announced \u201c religious freedom advisory board . \u201d\nMark Kauzlarich/Reuters Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz speaks with James Dobson ( r. ) , an evangelical Christian author , at a town hall in Winterset , Iowa , on Jan. 4 .\nBut Cruz \u2019 s faith message is seen as key to his appeal . That message has been reinforced by a Cruz super-political action committee that just launched a website highlighting his religious story .\nTo some observers , like New York Times columnist David Brooks , Cruz \u2019 s apocalyptic rhetoric seems out of joint with Christian traditions , offering no hint of \u201c compassion , gentleness , and mercy . \u201d\n\u201c In a GOP primary that has become a contest to see who could be the most anti-immigrant , a little compassion for the stranger is in order , \u201d Kidd added .\nBut he said he sees no reason to question the sincerity of Cruz \u2019 s faith .\nIndeed , to many voters , Cruz \u2019 s message fits the times , given the threat of Islamic State , a dysfunctional immigration system , and economic uncertainty .
