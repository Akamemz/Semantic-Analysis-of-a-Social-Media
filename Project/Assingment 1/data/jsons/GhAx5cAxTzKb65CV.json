    "content": "Remember how the president 's `` major address '' this afternoon was supposed to contain a significant `` reframing '' of his economic message heading into November ? White House officials hyped this speech as a meaningful shift in rhetoric and approach , even as they conceded the president 's comments would contain no new ideas . They were correct on the latter point , but astonishingly , the president did n't even follow through on the former pledge -- which was ostensibly the entire purpose of the speech . Obama essentially repackaged the exact same speech he delivered in April , but inserted the names `` Romney '' and `` Bush '' a few more times . Same tendentious arguments , same disingenuous analogies , same examples , same strawmen . Read all 6,300 words ( ! ) HERE . I could waste my time writing another detailed rebuttal to all of the distortions and inanities embedded in today 's presidential remarks , but I 've already done so . Feel free to go back and read my April piece -- it really was thorough , and took quite a long time to craft . If you do n't have the time to do so , rest assured that this president has no new ideas , nor any clue about how to effectively rebrand his stale ones . The RNC is already having a field day , rolling out a new website that needles Obama for his intellectual and leadership bankruptcy : http : //obamasnewideastofixeconomy.com/\nIn short , this address essentially tried to cast Obama as the challenger , and George W. Romney as the nefarious incumbent . He complained about the terrible Bush years ( average unemployment : 5.2 percent , average deficit : less than $ 300 Billion ) , conflated conservative economic policies with the 2008 meltdown ( the true causes of which are a ) , and said that the asserted economy is very much on the mend ( James Carville , call your office ) . He whined about Republican obstructionism ( I exploded that red herring earlier ) , and called for more `` infrastructure investments '' to fix `` crumbling roads and bridges '' as if the massive Stimulus 1.0 never happened . `` Fair shares '' and `` balanced approaches '' abounded , not to mention more dire warnings of `` draconian '' Republican cuts . ( These `` cuts '' actually increase spending , but at a slower rate ) . The only interesting twist this speech offered was the president 's suggestion that Novembers election was a chance for voters to break Washington 's `` stalemate . '' There 's some truth to this . Bush-fatigued voters elected an inexperienced , charismatic cipher in 2008 . When he and his Congressional allies exploited their huge majorities to pass the stimulus and Obamacare , the public had seen enough . They sent 68 new Republicans to Congress in 2010 . I suppose you could say 2012 might be the tiebreaker . I 'll leave you with three items :\n( 1 ) Obama spoke about paying down the national debt in a `` responsible '' and `` balanced '' manner .
