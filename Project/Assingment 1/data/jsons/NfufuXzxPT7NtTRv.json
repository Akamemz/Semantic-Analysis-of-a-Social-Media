The pro-democracy protesters were so enraged that thousands defied a government call on Monday to abandon street blockades across the city . On Tuesday morning , tens of thousands , including many new recruits angered by the police actions , had again filled the city center .\nWhen the Chinese Army entered Hong Kong in July 1997 and peacefully reclaimed the city after more than 150 years of British rule , there was reason to hope that China would fulfill its promise to maintain \u201c one country , two systems \u201d until 2047 . For one thing , both Britain and the United States offered themselves as guarantors of the transition agreement , although they now seem less interested in that responsibility . For another , Hong Kong had begun to establish itself as an economically vibrant society , which China hoped to replicate on the mainland .\nThe agreement signed by Britain and China allowed Hong Kong to retain its free-market economy , a legal system with an independent judiciary and other rights , including greater civil liberties than residents of the mainland . China also promised free elections for Hong Kong \u2019 s chief executive in 2017 , but , late last month , China \u2019 s legislature called for limiting the candidates who would be allowed to run , among other restrictions .
