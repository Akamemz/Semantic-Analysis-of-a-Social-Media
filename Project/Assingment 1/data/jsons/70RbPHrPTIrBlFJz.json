However , the releases involving individuals with more significant criminal histories were , by and large , dictated by special circumstances outside of the agency 's control , '' ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen told USA Today.The new records obtained by the newspaper from a Freedom of Information Act request outlined previously undisclosed details about the alleged crimes of specific detainees . One person in Texas was charged with aggravated kidnapping and sexual assault of a child.Another illegal immigrant from Florida was facing charges of conspiracy to commit homicide , according to USA Today.Two Massachusetts detainees had been charged with aggravated assault using a weapon , while another illegal immigrant from Colorado was being held on a sexual assault charge.The Obama administration released more than 2,200 illegal immigrants from jail between Feb. 9 and March 1 , 2013 , as part of an effort to cut the number of prisoners due to the budget-sequester funding cuts . The detainees had been awaiting deportation or immigration hearings in a court , and the administration did not give advance notice it would be freeing them.The releases triggered a furor in Congress and hearings with lawmakers who grilled then-ICE director John Morton.According to USA Today , Virginia GOP Rep. J. Randy Forbes asked Morton directly , `` No one on that list has been charged or convicted with murder , rape , or sexual abuse of a minor , were they ? `` Morton , who subsequently resigned , answered , `` They were not . `` Former White House spokesman Jay Carney had also described the criminals as `` low-risk , noncriminal detainees , '' USA Today reported.Meanwhile , Republican Sens .
