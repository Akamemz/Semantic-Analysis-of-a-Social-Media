A report by retired federal and state judges tasked by the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office to examine police practices in San Francisco found \u201cracial disparities regarding S.F.P.D. stops, searches, and arrests, particularly for Black people.\u201d The judges, working with experts from five law schools, including Stanford Law School, found that \u201cthe disparity gap in arrests was found to have been increasing in San Francisco.\u201d (Officers in San Francisco were previously revealed to have traded racist and homophobic text messages, and those working in the prison system had reportedly staged and placed bets on inmate fights.)",
