But a sizable percentage , 14 % , say they don \u2019 t know enough to have an opinion .\nAmericans on both sides of the debate say they feel strongly about their positions , and three-quarters say it \u2019 s not very likely or not at all likely that the trial will introduce new information that would change their minds .\nLinda Valenzuela , 46 , of Las Cruces , New Mexico , leans Democrat and said she is certain that Trump acted unlawfully in pressuring Ukraine \u2019 s leader , Volodymyr Zelenskiy , to investigate activities by former Vice President Joe Biden , a Trump political rival , and his son Hunter in the Eastern European nation .\nBut Valenzuela also said that it is \u201c not at all likely \u201d that she will hear anything from Trump \u2019 s defense team during the trial that would change her mind about the president .\n\u201c I know what he did was not legal , \u201d she said .\nSimilarly , Jackie Perry , 59 , a Republican from Carrollton , Georgia , said that she was certain that Trump had acted within the law . She said she could not envision her position on Trump changing because of evidence or testimony presented in the trial .\nPerry , who cast her first-ever ballot in the presidential election in 2016 for Trump , said her opinion of the president is shaped by how he \u2019 s handled the economy . The national unemployment rate is 3.5 % and has been hovering near a 50-year-low for months .\n\u201c This is a person who has helped our country , I think , more than any president has , \u201d Perry said . \u201c He \u2019 s done so much for us . Our economy is flourishing again for the first time in many years . There are \u2018 help wanted \u2019 signs everywhere you go now . Our country is getting back up again .

Overall , confidence in the Senate to conduct a fair trial of the president is limited , though Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say it will be a fair trial .\nA slim majority of Republicans think Trump has done nothing wrong in his interactions with Ukraine \u2019 s president , though that share has declined slightly from an AP-NORC poll in October \u2014 64 % then compared with 54 % now . Roughly another third now think Trump did something unethical but not illegal , while just about 1 in 10 thinks he did something illegal .\nBy comparison , roughly three-quarters of Democrats say Trump did something illegal in his interactions with Zelenskiy\nDemocrats brought articles of impeachment against Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for actions related to his decision to temporarily withhold nearly $ 400 million in military aid to Ukraine last year .

Officials in Ukraine have said they have found no wrongdoing in Hunter Biden \u2019 s service on the board .\nTo Chester Trahan , Trump has \u201c used the United States government \u2019 s mechanism for his own personal benefit as opposed to benefit of the United States of America. \u201d The 80-year-old Democrat from Palm Coast , Florida , added : \u201c He has more or less blackmailed an ally to get something he wants . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s approval rating has remained within the narrow range it has consistently occupied throughout his presidency .

He said he approves of the level of cooperation offered by the administration .\nDemocrats \u201c are on a fishing expedition , \u201d he said . \u201c It feels like they started with a guilty verdict and are in search of a crime . \u201d\nOne question there \u2019 s widespread agreement on : Trump should allow top aides to appear as witnesses at the trial . About 7 in 10 said so , including majorities of Republicans and Democrats .\nTrump repeated Wednesday that he would like to have his top advisers testify , but said it could create national security concerns . Jay Sekulow , a Trump personal attorney serving on his impeachment team , argues that Trump \u2019 s communications with his advisers are privileged information .\n\u201c The administration is not cooperating at all , \u201d said Andrew Collins , 31 , Democratic-leaning resident of Gainesville , Florida .
