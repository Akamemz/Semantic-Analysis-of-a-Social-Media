    "content": "My first college experience was failing half my classes at the University of Nevada Las Vegas in 1992 . The highlight was getting a \u201c D \u201d in English 101 . Like many small town kids , I was overwhelmed and underprepared . I dropped out of UNLV , joined the military and got married . Being a 20-year-old father and \u201c enlisted \u201d man showed me exactly how not to live , so I started a backward , fumbling and circuitous process of getting my undergraduate degree . In seven years , I attended four community colleges , a university on a military base and attended military journalism school . I pieced the whole mess into a bachelor \u2019 s degree from Excelsior College , a credit aggregator that caters to military members .\nModern conservative politics push the notion that people who flip switches , burgers or bedpans don \u2019 t need \u201c education. \u201d They instead need \u201c job training. \u201d In Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker \u2019 s budget , someone crossed out this phrase : \u201c to extend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campuses and to serve and stimulate society. \u201d And added this instead : \u201c to meet the state \u2019 s workforce needs. \u201d Walker backed down on the language change when it was exposed , claiming it was a \u201c mistake. \u201d Really it was just one more tired attack on the idea of education as a public good , one that helps people find fulfillment and meaning .\nI value education more than many people , because I struggled so hard to get it . I had a bad elementary school experience , failed the fifth grade , muddled through high school and dropped out of college . Teachers were always kind to me , saying things like , \u201c He \u2019 s clever , but lazy. \u201d They were wrong about me , just like when Republicans are always wrong about poor people being lazy or stupid . When I failed out of college the first time I was working a full-time job far above 40 hours a week , while also going to school . I was most worried about making a living , and my skill set mirrored that of so many in the working class : Work hard , day in and day out and be grateful . Educational success has little to do with innate intelligence or \u201c goodness \u201d and almost everything to do with class , upbringing and privilege .\nI also viewed education with suspicion bordering on paranoia . I came from a rural mining town in Nevada where I knew mostly blue-collar men who neither needed nor wanted a college education . Listening to adults talk they always had a favorite villain : the person who jumped ahead in line and got a job or promotion , only because he or she had a college degree .\nI have my own children now , and I know the limits of parenting . Children heed your example far more than your advice . It \u2019 s painful to watch your children struggle . It was the same for my conservative family who encouraged me to go college . They weren \u2019 t able to offer any meaningful guidance or help , and it was not their fault . First generation college students , like me , face an impossible climb . If you add in conservative hostility to education , it gets that much harder .\nAfter getting a bachelor \u2019 s at 27 , I went back to graduate school to study 18th century British literature at California State Hayward . I landed a new job in Reno and moved to the University of Nevada , Reno , finishing a master \u2019 s in English there . A few years later , I went back again , this time for a master \u2019 s of fine arts in creative writing from Antioch University Los Angeles , a school that emphasizes social justice\u2014for many conservatives , a coded phrase that means \u201c liberal. \u201d Even as a libertarian attending a liberal college , people went out of their way to be both kind and tolerant to me . My preconceived notions about the \u201c evil liberals of the ivory tower \u201d looked more ignorant and narrow by the day .\nBefore college , I voted conservative , hated gay people , loved America and served my country in the armed services . I \u2019 ve changed because of many factors , but I know that college and graduate school made a difference . I met people unlike myself and was forced to defend sometimes ugly political positions . The Tea Party thrives on blue-collar \u201c common sense \u201d that is composed of a combination of ignorance , superstition and fear . A literate and educated populace is an existential threat to the kind of thoughtless rage that has consumed the right over the past few years .\nSome people on the right are very educated . Rick Santorum holds an MBA and a JD ( with honors , no less ) , and his vehement hatred of college seems to stem from his kooky take on religion . Modern politics is drawing bizarre new battle lines between \u201c family values \u201d and a halfway decent education .

The GI Bill paid for both my master \u2019 s degrees . My background and rough start make me an unlikely champion of college education . I \u2019 ve also been socially adjusted for my whole life to feel like a pretentious asshole and a fraud every time I bring it up . But education makes a difference in people \u2019 s lives .\nThat \u2019 s why sensible people need to stand up against the vilification of education . A good start is to support Barack Obama \u2019 s free community college initiative . I earned most of the credits for my very first undergraduate degree at community colleges , and those classes kickstarted my interest in school . It \u2019 s hard to see how I would have ever overcome my own barriers without the patience of many community college instructors . Obama \u2019 s plan to fund community college will not only make our country a better place but will also improve , even slightly , the state of our shared humanity .\nAnd to acknowledge the \u201c other side , \u201d education does help people find good , fulfilling jobs . Even my \u201c slapped together \u201d bachelor \u2019 s degree helped launch me into a career in public relations . The job has more than sustained me and my family , while also allowing me to explore my own outside interests .\nSome days I wish I could use my graduate education to find a full-time academic job , but I passed up too many opportunities and wasted too many years fumbling around . Academic jobs and humanities scholarship itself are under assault , just like so many other valuable parts of America . I \u2019 m probably a coward , but I also don \u2019 t like the idea of leaving my longtime profession to start all over .
