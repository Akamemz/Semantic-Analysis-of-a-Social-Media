    "content": "On the 50th anniversary of his being shot down over Hanoi\nIn early 1982 , one of my several housemates at the time informed me that he would be leaving our place in Tempe , Ariz. , and moving into a spare room in the home of a newly married couple nearby , the husband a former POW and all-but-announced candidate for Congress . My friend had been hired as the aspiring congressman \u2019 s very first full-time political aide . And , as soon as he had settled in , he wanted to introduce his new employer to me and a few others we knew from Arizona State University . Would I like to come by and meet John McCain ?\nIf I \u2019 d had any clue then what a noted figure the man would become in political history \u2014 allowing me , far into the future , a minor part in his presidential campaign \u2014 I would have paid closer attention when the day came and we all sat down to chat in his living room on Lamplighter Street . My memory of the visit is a little sketchy now , although I do recall noticing , back when people still remarked on them , the prematurely white hair and constricted arm movements , both features courtesy of McCain \u2019 s captors in North Vietnam .\nJohn and Cindy hadn \u2019 t lived in their house very long ; moving boxes were still in sight , and the furniture had a fresh-from-the-showroom feel . Representative John Rhodes , the district \u2019 s venerable voice in Congress , had a few weeks earlier signaled his retirement , and no piece of Tempe real estate ever moved faster than this place the McCains had just bought , relocating to CD-1 from Phoenix , a 15-minute drive away .\nThe absurd backstory is that the two or three of us invited there were C. S. Lewis enthusiasts , in a small group at ASU , eight students at most , named for the day of our weekly discussions of the Oxford don \u2019 s wisdom \u2014 \u201c The Tuesday Club. \u201d Hoping to show he had useful connections , my ex-housemate had apparently been vague about our size and mission , leaving McCain to imagine he was doing business with the delegation of an influential college organization , some key piece of the district puzzle he could grab early on .\nI figured out the situation only when , wrapping things up , McCain turned to me with an earnest pitch : \u201c So , if I get into this race , I \u2019 d be honored if I could count on the support of the Tuesday Club. \u201d My friends and I nodded assurances \u2014 yes , we would certainly consider it \u2014 finished off a tray of treats Cindy had brought out , and departed leaving no suspicion that the candidate-to-be had just thrown away an afternoon .\nToday \u2019 s storied \u201c maverick \u201d of the Senate was back then a regular sight around ASU , addressing ROTC and other student groups , pressing campaign buttons on passersby in the Sun Devil Stadium parking lot , finding the people with actual influence in the district , and with a stamina and personal story impossible to match making himself , by 1986 , the obvious successor to Barry Goldwater .\nFrom there it was on to all his years as a presence in national politics , although my own next brush with his career came in 2000 as a speechwriter in the campaign of George W. Bush . And , I admit , I didn \u2019 t mind at all that some Republican voters that year didn \u2019 t care for the senator , regarding him as a media pet and creature of Washington .\nHappily , his second chance in 2008 would bring one for me , too . I didn \u2019 t really know anyone on his team but made it my business to meet them , and from late March until Election Day I got my best look at John McCain in action , as America did as well . I wasn \u2019 t anything like a close adviser , just a late-arriving addition to the staff , scarcely remembered by the candidate from our Tempe encounters in the \u2019 80s .\nAll the more in retrospect , what became the McCain-Palin enterprise was a great experience , leading to a loss that , on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 , I wouldn \u2019 t trade for other people \u2019 s victories . And before I got there , of course , the most improbable part of the effort had already unfolded \u2014 the \u201c McCain Miracle . \u201d\nReporters have lately been recalling the story with admiration , though at the time a charitable word for the candidate was hard to come by . In the months before the primaries , he had been written off , the quotable , ever-accessible straight talker of 2000 who had lost his charm , mostly because the situation in the Iraq war was desperate , he was associated with it , and he would not equivocate . His campaign was a wreck , his consultants had scattered , he was flying commercial and unaccompanied to New Hampshire . Continuing news coverage was termed a \u201c death watch . \u201d\n\u2018 We \u2019 re at 3 percent and the poll has a 5 percent margin of error , \u2019 went John McCain \u2019 s stock line early in the 2008 campaign \u2014 along with that other old favorite : \u2018 In the words of Chairman Mao , \u201c It \u2019 s always darkest before it \u2019 s totally black . \u201d \u2019\nVeterans of the 1996 presidential contest could remember a vanishing of prominent friends and supporters as November neared , leaving Bob Dole in the last hours to face his fate practically alone on the stage except for the senator from Arizona . That was the shape of McCain \u2019 s own quest by late 2007 . \u201c We \u2019 re at 3 percent and the poll has a 5 percent margin of error , \u201d went his stock line at the time \u2014 along with that other old favorite : \u201c In the words of Chairman Mao , \u2018 It \u2019 s always darkest before it \u2019 s totally black . \u2019 \u201d\nHe refused to quit and , above all , he would not abandon the cause in Iraq , saying \u2014 in surely the most enduring words of any 2008 candidate \u2014 \u201c I would rather lose an election than see my country lose a war . \u201d\nHe had been getting a dose of the same sort of counsel President Bush was hearing about the troop surge in Iraq : pointless , over , done , get out . Unlike so many others who had cast their votes to authorize that war , however , this senator had thought through the consequences before deciding , aware that enormous difficulties might come and that perseverance would be needed . He wouldn \u2019 t hedge . Tying his own fortunes to those of our troops , in what looked to some 70 percent of Americans like a futile effort , he was at that moment , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 editor Rich Lowry observed , \u201c the very picture of courageous political leadership . \u201d\nI have never understood the contempt that some conservatives direct at the senator for McCain-Feingold , the old Gang of 8 , or other matters on which he has by now , at the very least , earned the presumption of upright intention . He did not in early 2008 , in any case , look like a man of the establishment . And , never mind the success of the surge in Iraq , his reward for grit was to hear himself , as the New Hampshire winner and eventual nominee , accused of wanting \u201c a hundred-year war , \u201d a phrase endlessly repeated by Barack Obama .\nAs if our candidate , with a son in Iraq at the time , really needed reminding of the cost and risk of a military commitment . Even more galling , later in 2008 , was the impression put about by the Obama campaign and obliging reporters that the then-71-year-old senator was a little , you know , \u201c erratic. \u201d \u201c Unsteady \u201d and so oddly \u201c angry , \u201d too ( who really knew what damage all that torture and solitary confinement had left ? ) . It was an especially shabby touch , given McCain \u2019 s steadfastness on by far the hardest and most crucial security issue of that election year . And we now know that \u201c unsteady \u201d far better describes the presidential judgment that would later squander the gains of the surge to invite a wider conflict and tragedies worse than before \u2014 again , despite the warnings of Senator McCain .\nAcknowledging his opponent \u2019 s military record , Obama always used the same formulation \u2014 \u201c Of course , John McCain is an American hero , but . . . Now , John McCain is an American hero , but . . . \u201d \u2014 as if by repetition to make it seem obligatory and trite . No faulting him for that \u2014 the last thing the Obama campaign needed was thoughtful attention to what exactly their opponent \u2019 s heroism had entailed . How else , as a rival for high office , are you going to deal with a guy who spent five and a half years in extreme pain , privation , and loneliness in the hands of the enemy , at any moment of which he could have gone home by simply agreeing to be released out of turn ?\nOne would think that , having made his acquaintance long before , I would by 2008 already have troubled myself to read Faith of My Fathers , McCain \u2019 s definitive telling of the prisoner-of-war experience , timed to introduce himself as a national contender in 2000 . In truth , I didn \u2019 t get around to it until , as a McCain-Palin speechwriter , I had a practical reason for doing so . One of the senator \u2019 s many close collaborations with my 2008 colleague , the masterful Mark Salter , the book is a work of enduring beauty , a devotional to country that you \u2019 ll never forget , and I remember thinking , if we didn \u2019 t make it that year , what a loss to presidential literature .\nThough to his credit McCain never let himself become a \u201c professional POW , \u201d forever trading on that identity , of course it \u2019 s everything , a long-ago passage through the underside of life that made him who he is . Just a few weeks ago , in a 60 Minutes interview , he called his bonds with fellow POWs \u201c the joy of my life. \u201d Here \u2019 s a passage that explains why , describing an exchange , in taps on the wall , with a man in the next cell named Bob Craner :\nHe was a remarkably composed man with the courage to accept any fate with great dignity . There were times when I would start to lose my nerve . I would detect some sign that another camp purge was coming , and my dread of another beating would start to get the better of my self-control . Anticipating a beating could prove more unnerving than the beating itself . \u201c Bob , I think it \u2019 s coming again , and I don \u2019 t think they \u2019 ll miss us. \u201d \u201c If it comes , it comes , \u201d he counseled me . \u201c If it doesn \u2019 t , it doesn \u2019 t , and there isn \u2019 t a damn thing we can do about it. \u201d It may strike others as odd that such fatalism could have comforted us , but it did . It was the best attitude you could hold under the circumstances . It steeled me when I was weak , and made me feel better about myself . Worrying about a beating was pointless . There wasn \u2019 t much I could do to prevent it , save disgrace myself , and disgrace hurt more than the worst beating .\nYou don \u2019 t get many points in politics anymore for modesty , understatement , or manful reserve , and the book in that way , like McCain \u2019 s Senate speeches , echoes a different era . There is not one false note or pretentious touch . There \u2019 s a wisdom , nobility , and self-knowledge beyond anything that politics has to teach . There are stories , too , that in both of his presidential campaigns should have spoken to the hearts of religious-conservative voters \u2013 who for reasons of their own never quite took to McCain \u2013 in ways far more important than a candidate \u2019 s standing at Bob Jones University , or his failure to grovel before this or that group .\nMost impressive of all , McCain in the truly stirring parts of Faith of My Fathers extols the examples of other prisoners . ( You have to hear their own accounts , as I have in person , to learn how much those fellow captives admired and counted on him . ) In one well-known scene , later included in a movie , McCain recalls seeing a young sailor named Mike Christian fashioning an American flag from scraps of cloth , having just received merciless punishment for the same offense :\nWith his eyes nearly swollen shut from the beating , he had quietly picked up his needle and thread and begun sewing a new flag . I witnessed many acts of heroism in prison , but none braver than that . As I watched him , I felt a surge of pride at serving with him , and an equal measure of humility for lacking that extra ration of courage that distinguished Mike Christian from other men .\n\u201c Old news , \u201d as many voters dismissed reminders of our candidate \u2019 s service . Not enough of them rated his life experiences \u201c relevant to people like me , \u201d as the pollsters put it . And so in November 2008 we ended up with the author of Dreams from My Father , a self-involved narrative with made-up characters , and not the author of Faith of My Fathers , the story of actual men who served and suffered for their country .\nThis was not , after all , some flash of glory in combat but the prolonged endurance of fear , despair , humiliation , brokenness , and the overcoming of evil by love and solidarity . When all that won \u2019 t cut it for people craving an \u201c inspirational \u201d figure , it is not the candidate who \u2019 s missing something .\nWe were spared a What Happened\u2013type meditation after 2008 , an agonizing over all of the loser \u2019 s bad breaks , but none was needed anyway . What happened was that when the market began to collapse in mid September , the good judgment of millions of voters went with it . Nor has the national political press corps ever been more hopelessly in the thrall of one candidate than it was that year , forgetting any respectable standard of journalism .\nSo often in politics we hear ringing or tough words offered as strength that are really , to borrow a phrase from Eric Hoffer , just \u2018 the weak man \u2019 s imitation of strength . \u2019\nNot even its partiality to Hillary Clinton in 2016 , fear-driven , came anywhere near the obsequious pampering accorded to Obama , lest any disclosure , misstep , or hint of criticism be allowed to threaten his historic ascent . In a debate with McCain , Obama shared a moving autobiographical story of his own about how the health-care issue was \u201c personal to me , \u201d and stopped telling the story only when the election was safely behind him and some reporter with time on his hands finally bothered to look into it , establishing that no such thing had ever happened . Obama casually broke a repeated pledge to accept public financing in the general election ( while McCain kept his word ) , but who cared , or even presumed to solicit an explanation ?\nI used to say in that campaign that Team Obama was obviously very sharp and talented but that it must be nice to wake up every morning with half your work already done for you by the media . It fell to an editor at Politico to finally say outright what everyone knew : \u201c In the closing weeks of this election , John McCain and Sarah Palin are getting hosed in the press . \u201d\nPalin , of course , was her own story , highlighted by the panic she caused to Democrats with her sparkling debut , within days turning a deficit of 6.4 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics polling average into a lead of 2.4 . President Bush is said to have remarked , after her morale-boosting arrival on the scene , \u201c That little lady has no idea what \u2019 s about to come her way , \u201d and we all soon learned in the media savaging that followed .\nA lesser man , when things got rough for his running mate , might have directed his frustration outward . Instead , as I saw a few times myself , he had only encouragement and kindness to offer , accepting the responsibility as his own . \u201c On the upswing and the down , \u201d as the authors of Game Change put it , \u201c through the nastiest moments . . . , not an ill word escaped his lips about Palin . . . . . He treated Palin chivalrously , inquiring regularly about her well-being and that of her family . We asked a lot of her , McCain said , and he meant it . \u201d\nTo complete the picture in 2008 , we needed only the accusations of racial animus , provided as usual by the tiresome Georgia congressman John Lewis . Weeks before the Election Day , he warned that McCain was \u201c sowing the seeds of hatred and division , \u201d in such a \u201c vicious \u201d manner that it reminded Lewis , as every Republican nominee does sooner or later , of George Wallace . This from a decades-long \u201c friend \u201d of McCain \u2019 s who knew much better , libeling a candidate who had declined to exploit \u2014 to note but one example \u2014 the pastoral exhortations of Obama \u2019 s outlandish spiritual guide , saying simply of Rev . Wright : \u201c I think that when people support you , it doesn \u2019 t mean that you support everything they say . Obviously , those words and those statements are statements that none of us would associate ourselves with , and I don \u2019 t believe that Senator Obama would support any of those , as well . \u201d\nIt was a point of honor that I doubt would have restrained the Obama campaign in any comparable circumstances , and there were other such moments . If you \u2019 re feeling nostalgic sometime , have a look at videos from the fall of that year showing McCain at a town hall repeatedly calming and correcting people who called his opponent dangerous , or \u201c an Arab , \u201d or someone to be \u201c scared of \u201d : \u201c No , ma \u2019 am . He \u2019 s a decent family man [ and ] citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with . . . . I have to tell you , Senator Obama is a decent person and a person you don \u2019 t have to be scared of as president of the United States . . . . We want to fight , and I will fight . But I will be respectful . \u201d\nAnd so on , these and similar answers actually earning him jeers and a shout of \u201c Liar ! \u201d from the crowd . As in his bearing in delivering the concession speech ( \u201c And though we fell short , the failure is mine , not yours \u201d ) , or setting the gold standard of grace at the Alfred E. Smith Dinner in the closing days , it was our \u2019 08 standard-bearer in form , his own man , refusing to play to the crowd , and handling himself with more class on the way to a bitter defeat than many others have managed on the way to victory .\nSo often in politics we hear ringing or tough words offered as strength that are really , to borrow a phrase from Eric Hoffer , just \u201c the weak man \u2019 s imitation of strength. \u201d A lot depends on enough voters \u2019 discerning the difference , and the 2008 verdict , for all of the winner \u2019 s own finer points , was a big miss . For our part in that campaign , we owe the also-ran the wonderful recollection of working for someone who merited our affection and also commanded our complete respect . I have never cast a vote for president with greater confidence in the worthiness of a candidate , nor felt so fortunate to have shared in failure . As Charles Krauthammer reflected at the time , \u201c McCain ran a valiant race against impossible odds . He will be \u2014 he should be \u2014 remembered as the most worthy presidential nominee ever to be denied the prize . \u201d\nNot one to let disappointment linger , McCain long ago moved on . He continues as our stoical , self-deprecating , \u201c imperfect servant , \u201d insisting on bygone customs such as \u201c regular order \u201d in the Senate , wondering why debates in Congress can not more often be \u201c an argument among friends , \u201d reminding us of \u201c causes greater than self-interest , \u201d attending to security threats others notice only in crises \u2014 and in general , whatever the rough edges , acting and speaking the way mature men and women were once expected to in conducting the affairs of their country .\nWhen he wasn \u2019 t giving that suspenseful thumbs-down to the last-ditch Obamacare repeal last month , indifferent to pressure one way or the other , you could find him on Face the Nation discoursing on military readiness , guiding Senate approval of the Defense Reauthorization Act , chairing an Armed Services Committee hearing on the recent fatal collisions of four naval ships , and personally calling each of the families of the ten sailors lost on one of those ships \u2014 the USS John S. McCain , named for both his father and grandfather . I happened to catch a C-SPAN clip of that hearing , after which the senator could be seen comforting the families in attendance , at one point holding the father of a sailor killed on the USS Fitzgerald in a long , sorrowful embrace .\nAlways onward \u2014 so relentlessly that we could be excused for at times forgetting his own most recent misfortune . The subject of the cancer comes up with interviewers , and they get spare replies along the lines of what he told CNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper , who inquired about his prospects : \u201c Every life has to end one way or another. \u201d He \u2019 s giving it his all , while trying to be \u201c joyful. \u201d After all he \u2019 s had \u201c a wonderful life , and I will be grateful for additional time that I have. \u201d How , Tapper wondered , would McCain wish to be remembered ? \u201c He served his country . And not always right , made a lot of mistakes . . . . But served his country . And I hope we can add \u2014 honorably . \u201d\nThat would certainly be the shorthand version of a tribute not due , one prays , anytime soon . His eulogists have had to bide their time since October 1967 , exactly half a century ago when he was shot down over Hanoi , and may it be years more before they are needed to sum up a career of thoroughly honorable service that , if less than perfect by John McCain \u2019 s own measure , to most of us looks pretty damn close . As that heartbroken father of the Fitzgerald sailor might well have thought to himself , this is a great man , once more the very picture of personal courage . And an example like that is never old news .\nSenator John McCain Faces One More Fight , and Everyone \u2019 s in His Corner",

My friend had been hired as the aspiring congressman\u2019s very first full-time political aide.

And we now know that \u201cunsteady\u201d far better describes the presidential judgment that would later squander the gains of the surge to invite a wider conflict and tragedies worse than before \u2014 again, despite the warnings of Senator McCain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcknowledging his opponent\u2019s military record, Obama always used the same formulation \u2014 \u201cOf course, John McCain is an American hero, but . . . Now, John McCain is an American hero, but . . . \u201d \u2014 as if by repetition to make it seem obligatory and trite. No faulting him for that \u2014 the last thing the Obama campaign needed was thoughtful attention to what exactly their opponent\u2019s heroism had entailed. How else, as a rival for high office, are you going to deal with a guy who spent five and a half years in extreme pain, privation, and loneliness in the hands of the enemy, at any moment of which he could have gone home by simply agreeing to be released out of turn?\n\nOne would think that, having made his acquaintance long before, I would by 2008 already have troubled myself to read Faith of My Fathers, McCain\u2019s definitive telling of the prisoner-of-war experience, timed to introduce himself as a national contender in 2000. In truth, I didn\u2019t get around to it until, as a McCain-Palin speechwriter, I had a practical reason for doing so. One of the senator\u2019s many close collaborations with my 2008 colleague, the masterful Mark Salter, the book is a work of enduring beauty, a devotional to country that you\u2019ll never forget, and I remember thinking, if we didn\u2019t make it that year, what a loss to presidential literature.\n\nThough to his credit McCain never let himself become a \u201cprofessional POW,\u201d forever trading on that identity, of course it\u2019s everything, a long-ago passage through the underside of life that made him who he is. Just a few weeks ago, in a 60 Minutes interview, he called his bonds with fellow POWs \u201cthe joy of my life.\u201d Here\u2019s a passage that explains why, describing an exchange, in taps on the wall, with a man in the next cell named Bob Craner:\n\nHe was a remarkably composed man with the courage to accept any fate with great dignity. There were times when I would start to lose my nerve. I would detect some sign that another camp purge was coming, and my dread of another beating would start to get the better of my self-control. Anticipating a beating could prove more unnerving than the beating itself. \u201cBob, I think it\u2019s coming again, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll miss us.\u201d \u201cIf it comes, it comes,\u201d he counseled me. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t, and there isn\u2019t a damn thing we can do about it.\u201d It may strike others as odd that such fatalism could have comforted us, but it did. It was the best attitude you could hold under the circumstances. It steeled me when I was weak, and made me feel better about myself. Worrying about a beating was pointless. There wasn\u2019t much I could do to prevent it, save disgrace myself, and disgrace hurt more than the worst beating.\n\nYou don\u2019t get many points in politics anymore for modesty, understatement, or manful reserve, and the book in that way, like McCain\u2019s Senate speeches, echoes a different era. There is not one false note or pretentious touch. There\u2019s a wisdom, nobility, and self-knowledge beyond anything that politics has to teach. There are stories, too, that in both of his presidential campaigns should have spoken to the hearts of religious-conservative voters \u2013 who for reasons of their own never quite took to McCain \u2013 in ways far more important than a candidate\u2019s standing at Bob Jones University, or his failure to grovel before this or that group.\n\nMost impressive of all, McCain in the truly stirring parts of Faith of My Fathers extols the examples of other prisoners. (You have to hear their own accounts, as I have in person, to learn how much those fellow captives admired and counted on him.) In one well-known scene, later included in a movie, McCain recalls seeing a young sailor named Mike Christian fashioning an American flag from scraps of cloth, having just received merciless punishment for the same offense:\n\nWith his eyes nearly swollen shut from the beating, he had quietly picked up his needle and thread and begun sewing a new flag. I witnessed many acts of heroism in prison, but none braver than that. As I watched him, I felt a surge of pride at serving with him, and an equal measure of humility for lacking that extra ration of courage that distinguished Mike Christian from other men.\n\n\u201cOld news,\u201d as many voters dismissed reminders of our candidate\u2019s service. Not enough of them rated his life experiences \u201crelevant to people like me,\u201d as the pollsters put it. And so in November 2008 we ended up with the author of Dreams from My Father, a self-involved narrative with made-up characters, and not the author of Faith of My Fathers, the story of actual men who served and suffered for their country.\n\nThis was not, after all, some flash of glory in combat but the prolonged endurance of fear, despair, humiliation, brokenness, and the overcoming of evil by love and solidarity. When all that won\u2019t cut it for people craving an \u201cinspirational\u201d figure, it is not the candidate who\u2019s missing something.\n\nWe were spared a What Happened\u2013type meditation after 2008, an agonizing over all of the loser\u2019s bad breaks, but none was needed anyway. What happened was that when the market began to collapse in mid September, the good judgment of millions of voters went with it. Nor has the national political press corps ever been more hopelessly in the thrall of one candidate than it was that year, forgetting any respectable standard of journalism.\n\nSo often in politics we hear ringing or tough words offered as strength that are really, to borrow a phrase from Eric Hoffer, just \u2018the weak man\u2019s imitation of strength.\u2019\n\nNot even its partiality to Hillary Clinton in 2016, fear-driven, came anywhere near the obsequious pampering accorded to Obama, lest any disclosure, misstep, or hint of criticism be allowed to threaten his historic ascent. In a debate with McCain, Obama shared a moving autobiographical story of his own about how the health-care issue was \u201cpersonal to me,\u201d and stopped telling the story only when the election was safely behind him and some reporter with time on his hands finally bothered to look into it, establishing that no such thing had ever happened. Obama casually broke a repeated pledge to accept public financing in the general election (while McCain kept his word), but who cared, or even presumed to solicit an explanation?\n\nI used to say in that campaign that Team Obama was obviously very sharp and talented but that it must be nice to wake up every morning with half your work already done for you by the media. It fell to an editor at Politico to finally say outright what everyone knew: \u201cIn the closing weeks of this election, John McCain and Sarah Palin are getting hosed in the press.\u201d\n\nPalin, of course, was her own story, highlighted by the panic she caused to Democrats with her sparkling debut, within days turning a deficit of 6.4 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics polling average into a lead of 2.4. President Bush is said to have remarked, after her morale-boosting arrival on the scene, \u201cThat little lady has no idea what\u2019s about to come her way,\u201d and we all soon learned in the media savaging that followed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lesser man, when things got rough for his running mate, might have directed his frustration outward. Instead, as I saw a few times myself, he had only encouragement and kindness to offer, accepting the responsibility as his own. \u201cOn the upswing and the down,\u201d as the authors of Game Change put it, \u201cthrough the nastiest moments . . . , not an ill word escaped his lips about Palin. . . . . He treated Palin chivalrously, inquiring regularly about her well-being and that of her family. We asked a lot of her, McCain said, and he meant it.\u201d\n\nTo complete the picture in 2008, we needed only the accusations of racial animus, provided as usual by the tiresome Georgia congressman John Lewis. Weeks before the Election Day, he warned that McCain was \u201csowing the seeds of hatred and division,\u201d in such a \u201cvicious\u201d manner that it reminded Lewis, as every Republican nominee does sooner or later, of George Wallace. This from a decades-long \u201cfriend\u201d of McCain\u2019s who knew much better, libeling a candidate who had declined to exploit \u2014 to note but one example \u2014 the pastoral exhortations of Obama\u2019s outlandish spiritual guide, saying simply of Rev. Wright: \u201cI think that when people support you, it doesn\u2019t mean that you support everything they say. Obviously, those words and those statements are statements that none of us would associate ourselves with, and I don\u2019t believe that Senator Obama would support any of those, as well.\u201d\n\nIt was a point of honor that I doubt would have restrained the Obama campaign in any comparable circumstances, and there were other such moments. If you\u2019re feeling nostalgic sometime, have a look at videos from the fall of that year showing McCain at a town hall repeatedly calming and correcting people who called his opponent dangerous, or \u201can Arab,\u201d or someone to be \u201cscared of\u201d: \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. He\u2019s a decent family man [and] citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with. . . . I have to tell you, Senator Obama is a decent person and a person you don\u2019t have to be scared of as president of the United States. . . . We want to fight, and I will fight. But I will be respectful.\u201d\n\nAnd so on, these and similar answers actually earning him jeers and a shout of \u201cLiar!\u201d from the crowd. As in his bearing in delivering the concession speech (\u201cAnd though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours\u201d), or setting the gold standard of grace at the Alfred E. Smith Dinner in the closing days, it was our \u201908 standard-bearer in form, his own man, refusing to play to the crowd, and handling himself with more class on the way to a bitter defeat than many others have managed on the way to victory.\n\nSo often in politics we hear ringing or tough words offered as strength that are really, to borrow a phrase from Eric Hoffer, just \u201cthe weak man\u2019s imitation of strength.\u201d A lot depends on enough voters\u2019 discerning the difference, and the 2008 verdict, for all of the winner\u2019s own finer points, was a big miss. For our part in that campaign, we owe the also-ran the wonderful recollection of working for someone who merited our affection and also commanded our complete respect. I have never cast a vote for president with greater confidence in the worthiness of a candidate, nor felt so fortunate to have shared in failure. As Charles Krauthammer reflected at the time, \u201cMcCain ran a valiant race against impossible odds. He will be \u2014 he should be \u2014 remembered as the most worthy presidential nominee ever to be denied the prize.\u201d\n\nNot one to let disappointment linger, McCain long ago moved on. He continues as our stoical, self-deprecating, \u201cimperfect servant,\u201d insisting on bygone customs such as \u201cregular order\u201d in the Senate, wondering why debates in Congress cannot more often be \u201can argument among friends,\u201d reminding us of \u201ccauses greater than self-interest,\u201d attending to security threats others notice only in crises \u2014 and in general, whatever the rough edges, acting and speaking the way mature men and women were once expected to in conducting the affairs of their country.\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t giving that suspenseful thumbs-down to the last-ditch Obamacare repeal last month, indifferent to pressure one way or the other, you could find him on Face the Nation discoursing on military readiness, guiding Senate approval of the Defense Reauthorization Act, chairing an Armed Services Committee hearing on the recent fatal collisions of four naval ships, and personally calling each of the families of the ten sailors lost on one of those ships \u2014 the USS John S. McCain, named for both his father and grandfather. I happened to catch a C-SPAN clip of that hearing, after which the senator could be seen comforting the families in attendance, at one point holding the father of a sailor killed on the USS Fitzgerald in a long, sorrowful embrace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlways onward \u2014 so relentlessly that we could be excused for at times forgetting his own most recent misfortune. The subject of the cancer comes up with interviewers, and they get spare replies along the lines of what he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, who inquired about his prospects: \u201cEvery life has to end one way or another.\u201d He\u2019s giving it his all, while trying to be \u201cjoyful.\u201d After all he\u2019s had \u201ca wonderful life, and I will be grateful for additional time that I have.\u201d How, Tapper wondered, would McCain wish to be remembered? \u201cHe served his country. And not always right, made a lot of mistakes. . . . But served his country. And I hope we can add \u2014 honorably.\u201d\n\nThat would certainly be the shorthand version of a tribute not due, one prays, anytime soon. His eulogists have had to bide their time since October 1967, exactly half a century ago when he was shot down over Hanoi, and may it be years more before they are needed to sum up a career of thoroughly honorable service that, if less than perfect by John McCain\u2019s own measure, to most of us looks pretty damn close. As that heartbroken father of the Fitzgerald sailor might well have thought to himself, this is a great man, once more the very picture of personal courage. And an example like that is never old news.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nAppreciating John McCain\n\nJohn McCain: American Hero\n\nSenator John McCain Faces One More Fight, and Everyone\u2019s in His Corner",
