Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) was censured Monday night by Republicans in Charleston County who do n't believe he 's conservative enough . According to The Post and Courier of Charleston , South Carolina , the vote to censure Graham was 39-32 , `` done by secret ballot and with limited discussion . '' `` I want my politicians to be more conservative , '' said Tom Sheridan , one of the supporters of the resolution . The censure document covered about 30 points , including disapproval of Graham 's support for President Barack Obama 's Supreme Court nominees and of his cooperation with Democrats .\nThe Graham campaign issued a feisty rebuttal insisting that they were going to take their campaign to all 20,000 Republicans in Charleston County and then see who comes out on top .

If he gets through the primary he has a a rival on his hands who could turn the race into a circus : former Republican Thomas Ravenel , millionaire scion of a famous political family , ex-state treasurer , drug felon -- and reality TV star . He 'll be running as a libertarian , naturally . ( What else could a drug felon ex-Republican do ? ) So , to the extent that Lindsey Graham will be depending on the kindness of `` moderate '' Republicans ( and to the extent they even exist ) he may have a run for his money .\nRavenel is a very familiar name in South Carolina -- - the Arthur Ravenel Jr. bridge that crosses the Cooper River is named for his father . And if voters are worried that the younger Ravenel does n't represent the proper South Carolina values , they may be soothed by the father 's deep South bona fides : Ex-congressman Arthur Ravenel is best known for his quip calling the NAACP the `` national association for retarded people .
