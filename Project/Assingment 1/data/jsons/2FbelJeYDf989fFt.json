    "content": "The announcement by House Speaker John Boehner that he is retiring at the end of October stunned Washington where life is all about grabbing power and holding on to it , often until death they do part .\nAt a meeting with reporters , Boehner said , \u201c My first job as speaker is to protect the institution . \u201d\nReally ? Is that why Ohio voters sent him to Washington in 16 elections and his Republican colleagues elected and re-elected him speaker ? Did he take an oath to preserve , protect and defend the institution of the House or the Constitution , which , if followed , offers protection enough ?\nIn 2010 , I interviewed Boehner when he was minority leader and I asked him to cite the most important lesson he learned when Republicans lost their hard-won House majority in 2006 . He replied , \u201c Our team failed to live up to our own principles . \u201d\nFailing to live up to GOP principles , indeed , failing to articulate what those principles are , was largely the reason for the increase in conservative members who then demanded either action or the speaker \u2019 s head . They got his head . Whether that means his successor will do a better job is open to question .\nOn July 28 , Rep. Mark Meadows ( R-N.C. ) expressed the frustration of many conservatives by filing a \u201c motion to vacate the chair , \u201d for the purpose of ousting Boehner from the speakership . Meadows \u2019 resolution charged Boehner with using \u201c the power of the office to punish Members who vote according to their conscience instead of the will of the speaker , \u201d providing for \u201c voice votes on consequential and controversial legislation to be taken without notice and with few Members present , \u201d using \u201c the legislative calendar to create crises for the American People , in order to compel Members to vote for legislation \u201d and failing to comply with \u201c the spirit of the rules of the House of Representatives , which provide that Members shall have three days to review legislation before voting. \u201d That last one had been a promise made by Republicans , should voters return them to a congressional majority .\nMost conservatives understand that with a Democrat in the White House and an insufficient GOP congressional majority to override presidential vetoes they can \u2019 t always , or maybe even mostly , have their way . But they would like to see Republicans at least employ some of the tactics Democrats shamelessly use when they hold the majority , such as the \u201c nuclear option \u201d employed in the Senate in 2013 , which allowed a majority vote instead of a \u201c supermajority \u201d to advance confirmation votes on judicial nominees and executive branch appointments .\nAt a minimum , conservative members want to see their convictions articulated by the leadership and to fight the left with conviction in hopes that getting their positions heard will influence voters . Instead , in too many instances , conservatives have seen their views ignored and the Republican leadership in both houses knuckle under to Democrats out of fear of being called names or getting blamed for a government shutdown .\nFormer Speaker Newt Gingrich notes that previous government shutdowns over matters of principle worked in Republicans \u2019 favor , notwithstanding how they were portrayed by the media . In an email to me , he writes : \u201c We closed the government twice in 1995 and \u2019 96 and became the first re-elected House Republican majority since 1928 . Our supporters realized we were serious and rewarded us for the effort . The Republicans closed the government in 2013 and won a big election in 2014 . \u201d\nIn my 2010 interview , Boehner bemoaned the size and cost of big government , saying , \u201c I came here for a smaller , less costly and more accountable government and that has not been what \u2019 s happening . We don \u2019 t need any more programs ; we need to undo a lot of programs . \u201d\nOn Boehner \u2019 s watch , the debt has increased nearly $ 4 trillion , according to figures published by the U.S. Treasury .\nIt is one of many reasons conservative voters are increasingly fed-up with Congress and for the rise of \u201c outside \u201d presidential candidates .
