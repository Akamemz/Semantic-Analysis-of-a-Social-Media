Follow him @ joshuamzeitz .\nIn October 1972 , the New York Times published a provocative article whose headline read \u201c GOP Intensifies Drive to Attract Jews to Nixon. \u201d Seeking to exploit Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern \u2019 s imprecise position on the Arab-Israeli conflict and his growing association with extreme elements in the Democratic Party , some of which identified Zionism as a neocolonial and racist political creed , the Republican machine worked in overdrive that year to peel off large numbers of American Jewish voters .\n\u201c After months of working through the so-called establishment in the Jewish community , \u201d explained the Old Gray Lady , \u201c the men running President Nixon \u2019 s reelection effort have taken their vigorous effort to increase his share of the normally Democratic Jewish vote into the neighborhoods and the streets of the cities . \u201d\nIt didn \u2019 t work . The following month , McGovern won roughly two-thirds of the Jewish vote , according to exit polls . To be sure , the results suggested a sharp drop-off from the high levels of support\u201480 percent and more\u2014that FDR ( 1932 , 1936 , 1940 , 1944 ) , Harry Truman ( 1948 ) , JFK ( 1960 ) , LBJ ( 1964 ) and Hubert Humphrey ( 1968 ) had enjoyed among American Jews , but they were on par with Jewish support for Adlai Stevenson ( 1952 , 1956 ) , Jimmy Carter ( 1976 ) , Walter Mondale ( 1984 ) and Michael Dukakis ( 1988 ) . In a year when McGovern carried just 31 percent of the white vote , Jews\u2014a small but important portion of \u201c white ethnic \u201d America\u2014stood out as an anomaly .\nThe example of 1972 is instructive today .
