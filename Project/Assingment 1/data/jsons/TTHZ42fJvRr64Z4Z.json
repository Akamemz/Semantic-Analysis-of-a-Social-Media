    "content": "President Obama \u2019 s relationship with blue-collar unions has hit an all-time low , with several powerful labor groups ripping into the administration \u2014 and the Democratic Party as a whole \u2014 for its rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and its promotion of the highly controversial trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s decision to reject Keystone on environmental grounds , which he announced Friday after a review process that lasted nearly seven years , deeply angered the president \u2019 s traditional supporters in the labor movement .\nIn addition to unprecedented verbal criticism of Mr. Obama \u2014 including from the Laborers \u2019 International Union or North America , which branded the president \u201c cowardly \u201d and his actions \u201c shameful \u201d \u2014 other unions hinted that they may rethink their support for Democrats in 2016 .\n\u201c President Obama has chosen to place politics over substantive policy that only serves to advance the agenda of well-funded radical environmentalists , \u201d Sean McGarvey , president of the North America \u2019 s Building Trades Unions , said in a statement Friday . \u201c All of which begs the question : Where does this leave the Democratic Party \u2019 s historical core constituency of working Americans ? We won \u2019 t know the answer to that question until November 2016 . But , to paraphrase Senator Ted Kennedy , for all those whose jobs have been our concern , the work goes on , the cause endures , and the dream shall never die , and hope springs again in January of 2017 . \u201d\nMr. Obama , who has tried to cultivate close ties with labor leaders throughout his time in the White House , now finds himself in a situation where his relationship with some major unions is tense at best and fatally wounded at worst . In addition to the lambasting the administration has taken over Keystone , it is enduring equal criticism on the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , a major trade deal involving the U.S. and 12 Pacific Rim nations .\nThe full text of the deal , which is opposed by many key figures in the Democratic Party , including 2016 presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton , finally was released last week .\n\u201c Officials have talked about side deals and special arrangements that they say will improve the agreement , \u201d Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa said in a statement . \u201c But they are unenforceable and won \u2019 t help protect the jobs of hardworking Americans . That \u2019 s why there is only one right answer for lawmakers when it comes to TPP . Just say no . \u201d\nTeamsters also launched a # TPPWorseThanWeThought campaign on Twitter seeking to rally opposition to the deal within the Democratic Party .\nWhile the administration flat out rejects many criticisms of TPP \u2014 including that the deal \u2019 s labor standards aren \u2019 t strong enough \u2014 Mr. Obama took a slightly different tack when explaining why he blocked the Keystone pipeline .\nThe project \u2014 which would have crossed the U.S.-Canada boundary , connected with existing pipeline infrastructure and transported more than 800,000 barrels of Canadian oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast \u2014 would have created more than 40,000 jobs , according to State Department research . Supporters argue it would have greatly enhanced North American energy security and potentially would have lowered U.S. gas prices .\nBut the president , while also casting doubt on the true job-creation potential of Keystone , made clear that his chief motivation for killing the project is to prove to the world that America will voluntarily lessen its reliance on fossil fuels and lead the world in the fight against climate change .\n\u201c Today we \u2019 re continuing to lead by example , \u201d Mr. Obama said in a White House speech Friday , flanked by Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Secretary of State John F. Kerry . \u201c Because , ultimately , if we \u2019 re going to prevent large parts of this earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes , we \u2019 re going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them and release more dangerous pollution into the sky . \u201d\nFrom the perspective of some unions , the president \u2019 s decision proves he \u2019 s more interested in securing an environmental legacy than he is in creating jobs and boosting the economy .\n\u201c After a seven-year circus of cowardly delay , the president \u2019 s decision to kill the Keystone XL pipeline is just one more indication of an utter disdain and disregard for salt-of-the-earth , middle-class working Americans , \u201d said Terry O \u2019 Sullivan , general president of the Laborers \u2019 International Union of North America .\n\u201c The politics he has played with their lives and livelihoods is far dirtier than oil carried by any pipeline in the world , and the cynical manipulation of the approval process has made a mockery of regulatory institutions and government itself . We are dismayed and disgusted that the president has once again thrown the members of LIUNA and other hard-working , blue-collar workers under the bus of his vaunted \u2018 legacy , \u2019 while doing little or nothing to make a real difference in global climate change .
