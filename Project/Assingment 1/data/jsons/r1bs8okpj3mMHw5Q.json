    "content": "On Dec. 29 , 2016 , the Obama administration announced that it was giving nearly three dozen Russian diplomats just 72 hours to leave the United States and was seizing two rural East Coast estates owned by the Russian government . As the Russians burned papers and scrambled to pack their bags , the Kremlin protested the treatment of its diplomats , and denied that those compounds \u2014 sometimes known as the \u201c dachas \u201d \u2014 were anything more than vacation spots for their personnel .\nThe Obama administration \u2019 s public rationale for the expulsions and closures \u2014 the harshest U.S. diplomatic reprisals taken against Russia in several decades \u2014 was to retaliate for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election . But there was another critical , and secret , reason why those locations and diplomats were targeted .\nBoth compounds , and at least some of the expelled diplomats , played key roles in a brazen Russian counterintelligence operation that stretched from the Bay Area to the heart of the nation \u2019 s capital , according to former U.S. officials . The operation , which targeted FBI communications , hampered the bureau \u2019 s ability to track Russian spies on U.S. soil at a time of increasing tension with Moscow , forced the FBI and CIA to cease contact with some of their Russian assets , and prompted tighter security procedures at key U.S. national security facilities in the Washington area and elsewhere , according to former U.S. officials . It even raised concerns among some U.S. officials about a Russian mole within the U.S. intelligence community .\n\u201c It was a very broad effort to try and penetrate our most sensitive operations , \u201d said a former senior CIA official .\nAmerican officials discovered that the Russians had dramatically improved their ability to decrypt certain types of secure communications and had successfully tracked devices used by elite FBI surveillance teams . Officials also feared that the Russians may have devised other ways to monitor U.S. intelligence communications , including hacking into computers not connected to the internet . Senior FBI and CIA officials briefed congressional leaders on these issues as part of a wide-ranging examination on Capitol Hill of U.S. counterintelligence vulnerabilities .\nThese compromises , the full gravity of which became clear to U.S. officials in 2012 , gave Russian spies in American cities including Washington , New York and San Francisco key insights into the location of undercover FBI surveillance teams , and likely the actual substance of FBI communications , according to former officials . They provided the Russians opportunities to potentially shake off FBI surveillance and communicate with sensitive human sources , check on remote recording devices and even gather intelligence on their FBI pursuers , the former officials said .\n\u201c When we found out about this , the light bulb went on \u2014 that this could be why we haven \u2019 t seen [ certain types of ] activity \u201d from known Russian spies in the United States , said a former senior intelligence official .\nThe compromise of FBI systems occurred not long after the White House \u2019 s 2010 decision to arrest and expose a group of \u201c illegals \u201d \u2013 Russian operatives embedded in American society under deep non-official cover \u2013 and reflected a resurgence of Russian espionage . Just a few months after the illegals pleaded guilty in July 2010 , the FBI opened a new investigation into a group of New York-based undercover Russian intelligence officers . These Russian spies , the FBI discovered , were attempting to recruit a ring of U.S. assets \u2014 including Carter Page , an American businessman who would later act as an unpaid foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump \u2019 s 2016 presidential campaign .\nThe breaches also spoke to larger challenges faced by U.S. intelligence agencies in guarding the nation \u2019 s secrets , an issue highlighted by recent revelations , first published by CNN , that the CIA was forced to extract a key Russian asset and bring him to the U.S. in 2017 . The asset was reportedly critical to the U.S. intelligence community \u2019 s conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally directed the interference in the 2016 presidential election in support of Donald Trump .\nYahoo spoke about these previously unreported technical breaches and the larger government debates surrounding U.S. policies toward Russia with more than 50 current and former intelligence and national security officials , most of whom requested anonymity to discuss sensitive operations and internal discussions . While the officials expressed a variety of views on what went wrong with U.S.-Russian relations , some said the United States at times neglected to appreciate the espionage challenge from Moscow , and paid a significant price for a failure to prioritize technical threats .\n\u201c When I was in office , the counterintelligence business was \u2026 focused entirely on its core concern , which is insider threats , and in particular mole hunting , \u201d said Joel Brenner , the head of U.S. counterintelligence and strategy from 2006 to 2009 . \u201c This is , in fact , the core risk and it \u2019 s right that it should be the focus . But we were neither organized nor resourced to deal with counterintelligence in networks , technical networks , electronic networks . \u201d\nThe discovery of Russia \u2019 s newfound capacity to crack certain types of encryption was particularly unnerving , according to former U.S. officials .\n\u201c Anytime you find out that an adversary has these capabilities , it sets off a ripple effect , \u201d said a former senior national security official . \u201c The Russians are able to extract every capability from any given technology . ... They are singularly dangerous in this area . \u201d\nThe FBI \u2019 s discovery of these compromises took place on the heels of what many hoped would be a breakthrough between Washington and Moscow \u2014 the Obama administration \u2019 s 2009 \u201c reset \u201d initiative , which sought to improve U.S.-Russia relations . Despite what seemed to be some initial progress , the reset soon went awry .\nIn September 2011 , Vladimir Putin announced the launch of his third presidential campaign , only to be confronted during the following months by tens of thousands of protesters accusing him of electoral fraud . Putin , a former intelligence officer , publicly accused then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of fomenting the unrest .\nIt was around this time that Putin \u2019 s spies in the United States , operating under diplomatic cover , achieved what a former senior intelligence official called a \u201c stunning \u201d technical breakthrough , demonstrating their relentless focus on the country they \u2019 ve long considered their primary adversary .\nThat effort compromised the encrypted radio systems used by the FBI \u2019 s mobile surveillance teams , which track the movements of Russian spies on American soil , according to more than half a dozen former senior intelligence and national security officials . Around the same time , Russian spies also compromised the FBI teams \u2019 backup communications systems \u2014 cellphones outfitted with \u201c push-to-talk \u201d walkie-talkie capabilities . \u201c This was something we took extremely seriously , \u201d said a former senior counterintelligence official .\nThe Russian operation went beyond tracking the communications devices used by FBI surveillance teams , according to four former senior officials . Working out of secret \u201c listening posts \u201d housed in Russian diplomatic and other government-controlled facilities , the Russians were able to intercept , record and eventually crack the codes to FBI radio communications .\nSome of the clandestine eavesdropping annexes were staffed by the wives of Russian intelligence officers , said a former senior intelligence official . That operation was part of a larger sustained , deliberate Russian campaign targeting secret U.S. government communications throughout the United States , according to former officials .\nThe two Russian government compounds in Maryland and New York closed in 2016 played a role in the operation , according to three former officials . They were \u201c basically being used as signals intelligence facilities , \u201d said one former senior national security official .\nRussian spies also deployed \u201c mobile listening posts. \u201d Some Russian intelligence officers , carrying signals intelligence gear , would walk near FBI surveillance teams . Others drove vans full of listening equipment aimed at intercepting FBI teams \u2019 communications . For the Russians , the operation was \u201c amazingly low risk in an angering way , \u201d said a former senior intelligence official .\nThe FBI teams were using relatively lightweight radios with limited range , according to former officials . These low-tech devices allowed the teams to move quickly and discreetly while tracking their targets , which would have been more difficult with clunkier but more secure technology , a former official said . But the outdated radios left the teams \u2019 communications vulnerable to the Russians . \u201c The amount of security you employ is the inverse of being able to do things with flexibility , agility and at scale , \u201d said the former official .\nA former senior counterintelligence official blamed the compromises on a \u201c hodgepodge of systems \u201d ineffective beyond the line of sight . \u201c The infrastructure that was supposed to be built , they never followed up , or gave us the money for it , \u201d said the former official . \u201c The intelligence community has never gotten an integrated system . \u201d\nThe limitations of the radio technology , said the former senior officials , led the FBI \u2019 s surveillance personnel to communicate on the backup systems .\n\u201c Eventually they switched to push-to-talk cellphones , \u201d said a former counterintelligence executive . \u201c The tech guys would get upset by that , because if they could intercept radio , they might be able to intercept telephones . \u201d\nThat is indeed what happened . Those devices were then identified and compromised by Russian intelligence operatives . ( A number of other countries \u2019 surveillance teams \u2014 including those from hostile services \u2014 also transitioned from using radios to cellphones during this time , noted another former official . )\nU.S. intelligence officials were uncertain whether the Russians were able to unscramble the FBI conversations in real time . But even the ability to decrypt them later would have given the Russians critical insights into FBI surveillance practices , including \u201c call signs and locations , team composition and tactics , \u201d said a former intelligence official .\nU.S. officials were also unsure about how long the Russians had been able to decipher FBI communications before the bureau realized what was happening . \u201c There was a gap between when they were really onto us , and when we got onto them , \u201d said a former senior intelligence official .\nEven after they understood that the Russians had compromised the FBI teams \u2019 radios , U.S. counterintelligence officials could not agree on how they had done it . \u201c The intel reporting was they did break our codes or got their hands on a radio and figured it out , \u201d said a former senior intelligence official . \u201c Either way , they decrypted our comms . \u201d\nOfficials also cautioned , however , that the Russians could only crack moderately encrypted communications , not the strongest types of encryption used by the U.S. government for its most sensitive transmissions . It was nonetheless \u201c an incredible intelligence success \u201d for the Russians , said the former senior official .\nWhile the Russians may have developed this capability by themselves , senior counterintelligence officials also feared that someone from within the U.S. government \u2014 a Russian mole \u2014 may have helped them , said former officials . \u201c You \u2019 re wondering , \u2018 If this is true , and they can do this , is this because someone on the inside has given them that information ? \u2019 \u2019 said another former senior intelligence official .\nRussia has a clear interest in concealing how it gets its information , further muddying the waters . According to a former senior CIA officer who served in Moscow , the Russians would often try to disguise a human source as a technical penetration . Ultimately , officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how the Russians pulled off the compromise of the FBI \u2019 s systems .\nMark Kelton , who served as the chief of counterintelligence at the CIA until he retired in 2015 , declined to discuss specific Russian operations , but he told Yahoo News that \u201c the Russians are a professionally proficient adversary who have historically penetrated every American institution worth penetrating . \u201d\nThis remains a core worry for U.S. spy hunters . The number of ongoing espionage investigations into U.S. government personnel \u2014 at the CIA , the FBI and elsewhere \u2014 including those potentially recruited by Russia , \u201c is not a little , it \u2019 s a lot , \u201d said another former senior counterintelligence official .\nOnce the compromises of FBI communications devices were confirmed , U.S. officials scrambled to minimize the exposure of mobile surveillance team operations , quickly putting countermeasures in place , according to former senior officials . There was a \u201c huge concern \u201d about protecting the identities of the individuals on the teams \u2014 an elite , secret group \u2014 said the former senior counterintelligence official . U.S. officials also conducted a damage assessment and repeatedly briefed select White House officials and members of Congress about the compromise .\nAfter the FBI discovered that its surveillance teams \u2019 cellphones had been compromised , they were forced to switch back to encrypted radios , purchasing different models , according to two former officials . \u201c It was an expensive venture , \u201d said one former counterintelligence official .\nBut the spying successes went both ways . The U.S. intelligence community collected its own inside information to conclude that the damage from the compromises had been limited , partly due to the Russians \u2019 efforts to keep their intelligence coup secret , according to a former senior intelligence official . \u201c The Russians were reticent to take steps [ that might reveal ] that they \u2019 d figured it out , \u201d the former senior official said .\nEven so , the costs to U.S. intelligence were significant . Spooked by the discovery that its surveillance teams \u2019 communications had been compromised , the FBI worried that some of its assets had been blown , said two former senior intelligence officials . The bureau consequently cut off contact with some of its Russian sources , according to one of those officials .\nAt the time of the compromise , some of the FBI \u2019 s other Russian assets stopped cooperating with their American handlers . \u201c There were a couple instances where a recruited person had said , \u2018 I can \u2019 t meet you anymore , \u2019 \u201d said a former senior intelligence official . In a damage assessment conducted around 2012 , U.S. intelligence officials concluded the events may have been linked .\nThe impact was not limited to the FBI . Alerted by the bureau to concerns surrounding Russia \u2019 s enhanced interception capabilities , the CIA also ceased certain types of communications with sources abroad , according to a former senior CIA official . The agency \u201c had to resort to a whole series of steps \u201d to ensure the Russians weren \u2019 t able to eavesdrop on CIA communications , the former senior official said . There was a \u201c strong hint \u201d that these newly discovered code-breaking capabilities by Russia were also being used abroad , said another former senior intelligence official .\nThe CIA has long been wary of Russian spies \u2019 eavesdropping efforts outside of the United States , especially near U.S. diplomatic facilities . U.S. officials have observed Russian technical officers repeatedly walking close to those compounds with packages in their hands , or wearing backpacks , or pushing strollers , or driving by in vehicles \u2014 all attempts , U.S. officials believe , to collect information on the different signals emanating from the facilities . While the tools used by the Russians for these activities were \u201c a bit antiquated , \u201d said a former senior CIA official , they were still a \u201c constant concern . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not unusual for intelligence officers operating from diplomatic facilities , including the United States \u2019 s own operatives , to try and intercept the communications of the host nation . \u201c You had to find ways to attack their surveillance , \u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen , former head of counterintelligence at the Department of Energy and a former CIA officer who first served in Moscow in the 1980s . \u201c The Russians do everything in the U.S. that we did in Moscow . \u201d\nIndeed , the focus on cracking radio communications was no different .\n\u201c We put extraordinary effort into intercepting and monitoring the FSB surveillance radio networks for the purpose of understanding whether our officers were under surveillance or not , \u201d said another former senior CIA officer who also served in Moscow .\nThe discovery of the Russians \u2019 new code-breaking capabilities came at a time when gathering intelligence on Russia and its leaders \u2019 intentions was of particular importance to the U.S. government . U.S. national security officials working on Russia at the time received rigorous security training on how to keep their digital devices secure , according to two former senior officials . One former U.S. official recalled how during the negotiations surrounding the reset , NSC officials , partially tongue in cheek , \u201c would sometimes say things on the phone hoping [ they ] were communicating things to the Russians . \u201d\nAccording to a former CIA official and a former national security official , the CIA \u2019 s analysts often disagreed about how committed Russia was to negotiations during the attempted reset and how far Putin would go to achieve his strategic aims , divergences that confused the White House and senior policy makers .\n\u201c It caused a really big rift within the [ National Security Council ] on how seriously they took analysis from the agency , \u201d said the former CIA official . Senior administration leaders \u201c went along with \u201d some of the more optimistic analysis on the future of U.S.-Russia relations \u201c in the hopes that this would work out , \u201d the official continued .\nThose disagreements were part of a \u201c reset hangover \u201d that persisted , at least for some inside the administration , until the 2016 election meddling , according to a former senior national security official . Those officials clung to the hope that Washington and Moscow could cooperate on key issues , despite aggressive Russian actions ranging from the invasion of Ukraine to its spying efforts .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t understand that they were at political war with us already in the second term once Putin was reelected and Obama himself was reelected , \u201d said Evelyn Farkas , the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia , Ukraine , and Eurasia during the Obama administration .\nAs high-level hopes for the U.S.-Russia \u201c reset \u201d withered , concerns about the threat of Russian spying made their way to Capitol Hill . Top officials at the FBI and CIA briefed key members of Congress on counterintelligence issues related to Russia , according to current and former U.S. officials . These included briefings on the radio compromises , said two former senior officials .\nMike Rogers , a former Republican lawmaker from Michigan who chaired the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from 2011 to 2015 , alluded to counterintelligence concerns at a conference earlier this year in Washington , D.C .\nOne of those concerns was a massive intelligence failure related to the secret internet-based communications system the CIA used to communicate with agents . The extent of that failure , first reported publicly by Yahoo News in 2018 , got the attention of Congress earlier .\nBut the problems were broader than that issue , according to Rogers .\n\u201c Our counterintelligence operations needed some adjustments , \u201d said Rogers , adding that he and his Democratic counterpart from Maryland , Dutch Ruppersberger , requested regular briefings on the subject from agency representatives . \u201c We started out monthly until we just wore them out , then we did it quarterly to try to make sure that we had the right resources and the right focus for the entire community on counter [ intelligence ] . \u201d\nRogers later told Yahoo News that his request for the briefings had been prompted by \u201c suspected penetrations , both physical and technical , which is the role of those [ Russian and Chinese ] intelligence services , \u201d but declined to be more specific .\nThe former committee chairman said he wanted the intelligence community to make counterintelligence a higher priority . \u201c Counterintelligence was always looked at as the crazy uncle at the party , \u201d he said . \u201c I wanted to raise it up and give it a robust importance . \u201d\nThe briefings , which primarily involved counterintelligence officials from the FBI and CIA and were limited to the committee leadership and staff directors , led to \u201c some useful inquiries to help focus the intelligence community , \u201d Rogers said . The leaders of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence were also included in some of the inquiries , according to Rogers and a current U.S. government official .\nSpokespeople for the current House and Senate intelligence committees did not respond to a request for comment . The FBI and CIA declined to comment . The Russian Embassy in Washington , D.C. did not respond to a request for comment .\nThe briefings were designed to \u201c get the counterintelligence house in order , \u201d said Jamil Jaffer , senior counsel at the House intelligence committee from 2011 to 2013 , and to ensure that Congress and the intelligence agencies were \u201c on the same page \u201d when it came to such matters . \u201c There were some concerns about what the agencies were doing , there were some concerns about what Congress knew , and all of these issues , of course , had China-Russia implications . \u201d\nRogers and Jaffer declined to provide further details about what specific counterintelligence issues the committee was addressing , but other former officials indicated that worries weren \u2019 t limited to the compromise of FBI radio systems . Senior U.S. officials were contemplating an even more disturbing possibility : that the Russians had found a way to penetrate the communications of the U.S. intelligence community \u2019 s most sensitive buildings in and around Washington , D.C .\nSuspected Russian intelligence officers were seen conspicuously loitering along the road that runs alongside the CIA \u2019 s headquarters , according to former senior intelligence officials . \u201c Russian diplomats would be sitting on Route 123 , sometimes in cars with diplomatic plates , other times not , \u201d a former senior intelligence executive said . \u201c We thought , they \u2019 re out doing something . It \u2019 s not just taking down license plates ; those guys are interrogating the system . \u201d\nThough this behavior dated back at least to the mid-2000s , former officials said those activities persisted simultaneously with the compromise of the FBI \u2019 s communication system . And these were not the only instances of Russian intelligence operatives staking out locations with a line of sight to CIA headquarters . They were \u201c fixated on being in neighborhoods \u201d that gave them exposure to Langley , said a former senior official .\nOver time , U.S. intelligence officials became increasingly concerned that Russian spies might be attempting to intercept communications from key U.S. intelligence facilities , including the CIA and FBI headquarters . No one knew if the Russians had actually succeeded .\n\u201c The question was whether they had capabilities to penetrate our comms at Langley , \u201d said a former senior CIA official . In the absence of any proof that that was the case , the working theory was that the Russian activities were provocations designed to sow uncertainty within the CIA . \u201c We came to the conclusion that they were trying to get into our heads , \u201d the former senior official said .\nA major concern was that Russian spies with physical proximity to sensitive U.S. buildings might be exfiltrating pilfered data that had \u201c jumped the air gap , \u201d i.e. , that the Russians were collecting information from a breach of computers not connected to the Internet , said former officials .\nOne factor behind U.S. intelligence officials \u2019 fears was simple : The CIA had already figured out how to perform similar operations themselves , according to a former senior CIA officer directly familiar with the matter . \u201c We felt it was pretty revolutionary stuff at the time , \u201d the former CIA officer said . \u201c It allowed us to do some extraordinary things . \u201d\nWhile no one definitively concluded that the Russians had actually succeeded in penetrating Langley \u2019 s communications , those fears , combined in part with the breach of the bureau \u2019 s encrypted radio system , drove an effort by U.S. intelligence officials around 2012 to fortify sensitive Washington-area government buildings against potential Russian snooping , according to four former officials .\nAt key government facilities in the Washington area , entire floors were converted to sensitive compartmented information facilities , or SCIFs . These are specially protected areas designed to be impenetrable to hostile signals intelligence gathering .\nThe normal assumption was that work done in a SCIF would be secure , but doubts arose about the safety of even those rooms . \u201c The security guys would say , your windows are \u2018 tempested \u2019 \u201d \u2014that is , protected against the interception of emissions radiating from electronic equipment in the building \u2014 \u201c you \u2019 re in a SCIF , it \u2019 s fine , \u201d a former senior counterintelligence executive recalled . \u201c The question was , \u2018 Is it true ? \u2019 \u201d\nNew security practices were instituted in sensitive government facilities like the FBI and CIA headquarters , according to former officials . \u201c It required many procedural changes on our part to make sure we were not susceptible to penetrations , \u201d said a former senior CIA official . These included basic steps such as moving communication away from windows and changing encryption codes more frequently , as well as more expensive adjustments , said four former officials .\nRevelations about the Russian compromise of the radio systems , recalled a former senior intelligence official , \u201c kick-started the money flowing \u201d to upgrade security .\nWhile the breaches of the FBI communications systems appeared to finally spur Congress and the intelligence agencies to adopt steps to counter increasingly sophisticated Russian eavesdropping , it took the Putin-directed interference in the 2016 election to get the White House to expel at least some of those officials deemed responsible for the breaches , and to shut down the facilities that enabled them .\nEven then , the decision was controversial . Some in Washington worried about retribution by the Russians and exposure of American intelligence operations , according to a former senior U.S. national security official directly involved in the discussions . The FBI consistently supported expulsions , said another former national security official .\nMore than two years later , the Russian diplomatic compounds used in the FBI communications compromises remain shuttered . The U.S. government has prevented many of the Russian spies expelled by the United States from returning , according to national security experts and senior foreign intelligence officials . \u201c They are slowly creeping back in , but [ the ] FBI makes it hard , \u201d said a senior foreign intelligence official . \u201c The old guard is basically screwed . They need to bring in a whole new generation . \u201d\nIn the meantime , those familiar with Russian operations warn that the threat from Moscow is far from over . \u201c Make no mistake , we \u2019 re in an intelligence war with the Russians , every bit as dangerous as the Cold War , \u201d said a former senior intelligence officer . \u201c They \u2019 re trying all the time ... and we caught them from time to time , \u201d he said . Of course , he added , \u201c you don \u2019 t know what you don \u2019 t know . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s the same message that special counsel Robert Mueller tried to convey during the highly contentious hearings to discuss his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election . \u201c They are doing it as we sit here , and they expect to do it during the next campaign , \u201d Mueller told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee about covert Russian involvement in U.S. politics .\nBut a number of observers believe Mueller \u2019 s message about the threat from Russia was largely lost amid a partisan battle on Capitol Hill over President Trump .\nDuring his Washington conference appearance earlier this year , Rogers , the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee , also lamented that the current politicized state of the intelligence committees would make spy agencies more hesitant to admit their failures .\n\u201c They 're not going to call you to say , ' I screwed up . ' They 're going to say , 'God , I hope they do n't find that , \u2019 \u201d he said . \u201c That 's what 's going to happen . I 'll guarantee it 's happening today . \u201d",
    "content_original": "On Dec. 29, 2016, the Obama administration announced that it was giving nearly three dozen Russian diplomats just 72 hours to leave the United States and was seizing two rural East Coast estates owned by the Russian government. As the Russians burned papers and scrambled to pack their bags, the Kremlin protested the treatment of its diplomats, and denied that those compounds \u2014 sometimes known as the \u201cdachas\u201d \u2014 were anything more than vacation spots for their personnel.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s public rationale for the expulsions and closures \u2014 the harshest U.S. diplomatic reprisals taken against Russia in several decades \u2014 was to retaliate for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

The operation, which targeted FBI communications, hampered the bureau\u2019s ability to track Russian spies on U.S. soil at a time of increasing tension with Moscow, forced the FBI and CIA to cease contact with some of their Russian assets, and prompted tighter security procedures at key U.S. national security facilities in the Washington area and elsewhere, according to former U.S. officials. It even raised concerns among some U.S. officials about a Russian mole within the U.S. intelligence community.\n\n\u201cIt was a very broad effort to try and penetrate our most sensitive operations,\u201d said a former senior CIA official.\n\nAmerican officials discovered that the Russians had dramatically improved their ability to decrypt certain types of secure communications and had successfully tracked devices used by elite FBI surveillance teams. Officials also feared that the Russians may have devised other ways to monitor U.S. intelligence communications, including hacking into computers not connected to the internet. Senior FBI and CIA officials briefed congressional leaders on these issues as part of a wide-ranging examination on Capitol Hill of U.S. counterintelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThese compromises, the full gravity of which became clear to U.S. officials in 2012, gave Russian spies in American cities including Washington, New York and San Francisco key insights into the location of undercover FBI surveillance teams, and likely the actual substance of FBI communications, according to former officials. They provided the Russians opportunities to potentially shake off FBI surveillance and communicate with sensitive human sources, check on remote recording devices and even gather intelligence on their FBI pursuers, the former officials said.\n\n\u201cWhen we found out about this, the light bulb went on \u2014 that this could be why we haven\u2019t seen [certain types of] activity\u201d from known Russian spies in the United States, said a former senior intelligence official.\n\nThe compromise of FBI systems occurred not long after the White House\u2019s 2010 decision to arrest and expose a group of \u201cillegals\u201d \u2013 Russian operatives embedded in American society under deep non-official cover \u2013 and reflected a resurgence of Russian espionage. Just a few months after the illegals pleaded guilty in July 2010, the FBI opened a new investigation into a group of New York-based undercover Russian intelligence officers. These Russian spies, the FBI discovered, were attempting to recruit a ring of U.S. assets \u2014 including Carter Page, an American businessman who would later act as an unpaid foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe breaches also spoke to larger challenges faced by U.S. intelligence agencies in guarding the nation\u2019s secrets, an issue highlighted by recent revelations, first published by CNN, that the CIA was forced to extract a key Russian asset and bring him to the U.S. in 2017. The asset was reportedly critical to the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally directed the interference in the 2016 presidential election in support of Donald Trump.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump speaks, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence by his side, on Nov. 9, 2016.

While the officials expressed a variety of views on what went wrong with U.S.-Russian relations, some said the United States at times neglected to appreciate the espionage challenge from Moscow, and paid a significant price for a failure to prioritize technical threats.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in office, the counterintelligence business was \u2026 focused entirely on its core concern, which is insider threats, and in particular mole hunting,\u201d said Joel Brenner, the head of U.S. counterintelligence and strategy from 2006 to 2009. \u201cThis is, in fact, the core risk and it\u2019s right that it should be the focus. But we were neither organized nor resourced to deal with counterintelligence in networks, technical networks, electronic networks.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of Russia\u2019s newfound capacity to crack certain types of encryption was particularly unnerving, according to former U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cAnytime you find out that an adversary has these capabilities, it sets off a ripple effect,\u201d said a former senior national security official. \u201cThe Russians are able to extract every capability from any given technology. ... They are singularly dangerous in this area.\u201d\n\nMore\n\nThe FBI\u2019s discovery of these compromises took place on the heels of what many hoped would be a breakthrough between Washington and Moscow \u2014 the Obama administration\u2019s 2009 \u201creset\u201d initiative, which sought to improve U.S.-Russia relations. Despite what seemed to be some initial progress, the reset soon went awry.\n\nIn September 2011, Vladimir Putin announced the launch of his third presidential campaign, only to be confronted during the following months by tens of thousands of protesters accusing him of electoral fraud. Putin, a former intelligence officer, publicly accused then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of fomenting the unrest.\n\nIt was around this time that Putin\u2019s spies in the United States, operating under diplomatic cover, achieved what a former senior intelligence official called a \u201cstunning\u201d technical breakthrough, demonstrating their relentless focus on the country they\u2019ve long considered their primary adversary.\n\nA December 2011 protest in Moscow against the alleged rigging of parliamentary polls.

Around the same time, Russian spies also compromised the FBI teams\u2019 backup communications systems \u2014 cellphones outfitted with \u201cpush-to-talk\u201d walkie-talkie capabilities. \u201cThis was something we took extremely seriously,\u201d said a former senior counterintelligence official.\n\nThe Russian operation went beyond tracking the communications devices used by FBI surveillance teams, according to four former senior officials. Working out of secret \u201clistening posts\u201d housed in Russian diplomatic and other government-controlled facilities, the Russians were able to intercept, record and eventually crack the codes to FBI radio communications.\n\nSome of the clandestine eavesdropping annexes were staffed by the wives of Russian intelligence officers, said a former senior intelligence official. That operation was part of a larger sustained, deliberate Russian campaign targeting secret U.S. government communications throughout the United States, according to former officials.\n\nThe two Russian government compounds in Maryland and New York closed in 2016 played a role in the operation, according to three former officials. They were \u201cbasically being used as signals intelligence facilities,\u201d said one former senior national security official.\n\nAn estate in Oyster Bay, N.Y., one of two Russian diplomatic compounds seized by the Obama administration in late 2016 as punishment for Moscow\u2019s alleged interference in the U.S. election.

Yuan/AP) More\n\nRussian spies also deployed \u201cmobile listening posts.\u201d Some Russian intelligence officers, carrying signals intelligence gear, would walk near FBI surveillance teams. Others drove vans full of listening equipment aimed at intercepting FBI teams\u2019 communications. For the Russians, the operation was \u201camazingly low risk in an angering way,\u201d said a former senior intelligence official.\n\nThe FBI teams were using relatively lightweight radios with limited range, according to former officials. These low-tech devices allowed the teams to move quickly and discreetly while tracking their targets, which would have been more difficult with clunkier but more secure technology, a former official said. But the outdated radios left the teams\u2019 communications vulnerable to the Russians. \u201cThe amount of security you employ is the inverse of being able to do things with flexibility, agility and at scale,\u201d said the former official.\n\nA former senior counterintelligence official blamed the compromises on a \u201chodgepodge of systems\u201d ineffective beyond the line of sight. \u201cThe infrastructure that was supposed to be built, they never followed up, or gave us the money for it,\u201d said the former official. \u201cThe intelligence community has never gotten an integrated system.\u201d\n\nThe limitations of the radio technology, said the former senior officials, led the FBI\u2019s surveillance personnel to communicate on the backup systems.\n\n\u201cEventually they switched to push-to-talk cellphones,\u201d said a former counterintelligence executive. \u201cThe tech guys would get upset by that, because if they could intercept radio, they might be able to intercept telephones.\u201d\n\nThat is indeed what happened. Those devices were then identified and compromised by Russian intelligence operatives. (A number of other countries\u2019 surveillance teams \u2014 including those from hostile services \u2014 also transitioned from using radios to cellphones during this time, noted another former official.)\n\nThe FBI seal outside the bureau's headquarters in Washington. (Photo: Yuri Gripas/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nU.S. intelligence officials were uncertain whether the Russians were able to unscramble the FBI conversations in real time. But even the ability to decrypt them later would have given the Russians critical insights into FBI surveillance practices, including \u201ccall signs and locations, team composition and tactics,\u201d said a former intelligence official.\n\nU.S. officials were also unsure about how long the Russians had been able to decipher FBI communications before the bureau realized what was happening. \u201cThere was a gap between when they were really onto us, and when we got onto them,\u201d said a former senior intelligence official.\n\nEven after they understood that the Russians had compromised the FBI teams\u2019 radios, U.S. counterintelligence officials could not agree on how they had done it. \u201cThe intel reporting was they did break our codes or got their hands on a radio and figured it out,\u201d said a former senior intelligence official. \u201cEither way, they decrypted our comms.\u201d\n\nOfficials also cautioned, however, that the Russians could only crack moderately encrypted communications, not the strongest types of encryption used by the U.S. government for its most sensitive transmissions. It was nonetheless \u201can incredible intelligence success\u201d for the Russians, said the former senior official.\n\nWhile the Russians may have developed this capability by themselves, senior counterintelligence officials also feared that someone from within the U.S. government \u2014 a Russian mole \u2014 may have helped them, said former officials. \u201cYou\u2019re wondering, \u2018If this is true, and they can do this, is this because someone on the inside has given them that information?\u2019\u2019 said another former senior intelligence official.\n\nVladimir Putin, then Russia's prime minister, in September 2011, around the time he announced he would stand for president in 2012. (Photo: Yana Lapikova/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nRussia has a clear interest in concealing how it gets its information, further muddying the waters. According to a former senior CIA officer who served in Moscow, the Russians would often try to disguise a human source as a technical penetration. Ultimately, officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how the Russians pulled off the compromise of the FBI\u2019s systems.\n\nMark Kelton, who served as the chief of counterintelligence at the CIA until he retired in 2015, declined to discuss specific Russian operations, but he told Yahoo News that \u201cthe Russians are a professionally proficient adversary who have historically penetrated every American institution worth penetrating.\u201d\n\nThis remains a core worry for U.S. spy hunters. The number of ongoing espionage investigations into U.S. government personnel \u2014 at the CIA, the FBI and elsewhere \u2014 including those potentially recruited by Russia, \u201cis not a little, it\u2019s a lot,\u201d said another former senior counterintelligence official.\n\nOnce the compromises of FBI communications devices were confirmed, U.S. officials scrambled to minimize the exposure of mobile surveillance team operations, quickly putting countermeasures in place, according to former senior officials. There was a \u201chuge concern\u201d about protecting the identities of the individuals on the teams \u2014 an elite, secret group \u2014 said the former senior counterintelligence official. U.S. officials also conducted a damage assessment and repeatedly briefed select White House officials and members of Congress about the compromise.\n\nAfter the FBI discovered that its surveillance teams\u2019 cellphones had been compromised, they were forced to switch back to encrypted radios, purchasing different models, according to two former officials. \u201cIt was an expensive venture,\u201d said one former counterintelligence official.\n\nBut the spying successes went both ways. The U.S. intelligence community collected its own inside information to conclude that the damage from the compromises had been limited, partly due to the Russians\u2019 efforts to keep their intelligence coup secret, according to a former senior intelligence official. \u201cThe Russians were reticent to take steps [that might reveal] that they\u2019d figured it out,\u201d the former senior official said.\n\nMore\n\nEven so, the costs to U.S. intelligence were significant. Spooked by the discovery that its surveillance teams\u2019 communications had been compromised, the FBI worried that some of its assets had been blown, said two former senior intelligence officials. The bureau consequently cut off contact with some of its Russian sources, according to one of those officials.\n\nAt the time of the compromise, some of the FBI\u2019s other Russian assets stopped cooperating with their American handlers. \u201cThere were a couple instances where a recruited person had said, \u2018I can\u2019t meet you anymore,\u2019\u201d said a former senior intelligence official. In a damage assessment conducted around 2012, U.S. intelligence officials concluded the events may have been linked.\n\nThe impact was not limited to the FBI. Alerted by the bureau to concerns surrounding Russia\u2019s enhanced interception capabilities, the CIA also ceased certain types of communications with sources abroad, according to a former senior CIA official. The agency \u201chad to resort to a whole series of steps\u201d to ensure the Russians weren\u2019t able to eavesdrop on CIA communications, the former senior official said. There was a \u201cstrong hint\u201d that these newly discovered code-breaking capabilities by Russia were also being used abroad, said another former senior intelligence official.\n\nThe CIA has long been wary of Russian spies\u2019 eavesdropping efforts outside of the United States, especially near U.S. diplomatic facilities. U.S. officials have observed Russian technical officers repeatedly walking close to those compounds with packages in their hands, or wearing backpacks, or pushing strollers, or driving by in vehicles \u2014 all attempts, U.S. officials believe, to collect information on the different signals emanating from the facilities. While the tools used by the Russians for these activities were \u201ca bit antiquated,\u201d said a former senior CIA official, they were still a \u201cconstant concern.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for intelligence officers operating from diplomatic facilities, including the United States\u2019s own operatives, to try and intercept the communications of the host nation. \u201cYou had to find ways to attack their surveillance,\u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, former head of counterintelligence at the Department of Energy and a former CIA officer who first served in Moscow in the 1980s. \u201cThe Russians do everything in the U.S. that we did in Moscow.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the focus on cracking radio communications was no different.\n\n\u201cWe put extraordinary effort into intercepting and monitoring the FSB surveillance radio networks for the purpose of understanding whether our officers were under surveillance or not,\u201d said another former senior CIA officer who also served in Moscow.\n\nEntrance to a Russian diplomatic compound in Maryland that was shuttered in late 2016 in retaliation for alleged election hacking. (Photo: Brian Witt/AP) More\n\nThe discovery of the Russians\u2019 new code-breaking capabilities came at a time when gathering intelligence on Russia and its leaders\u2019 intentions was of particular importance to the U.S. government. U.S. national security officials working on Russia at the time received rigorous security training on how to keep their digital devices secure, according to two former senior officials. One former U.S. official recalled how during the negotiations surrounding the reset, NSC officials, partially tongue in cheek, \u201cwould sometimes say things on the phone hoping [they] were communicating things to the Russians.\u201d\n\nAccording to a former CIA official and a former national security official, the CIA\u2019s analysts often disagreed about how committed Russia was to negotiations during the attempted reset and how far Putin would go to achieve his strategic aims, divergences that confused the White House and senior policy makers.\n\n\u201cIt caused a really big rift within the [National Security Council] on how seriously they took analysis from the agency,\u201d said the former CIA official. Senior administration leaders \u201cwent along with\u201d some of the more optimistic analysis on the future of U.S.-Russia relations \u201cin the hopes that this would work out,\u201d the official continued.\n\nThose disagreements were part of a \u201creset hangover\u201d that persisted, at least for some inside the administration, until the 2016 election meddling, according to a former senior national security official. Those officials clung to the hope that Washington and Moscow could cooperate on key issues, despite aggressive Russian actions ranging from the invasion of Ukraine to its spying efforts.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t understand that they were at political war with us already in the second term once Putin was reelected and Obama himself was reelected,\u201d said Evelyn Farkas, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia during the Obama administration.\n\nMore\n\nAs high-level hopes for the U.S.-Russia \u201creset\u201d withered, concerns about the threat of Russian spying made their way to Capitol Hill. Top officials at the FBI and CIA briefed key members of Congress on counterintelligence issues related to Russia, according to current and former U.S. officials. These included briefings on the radio compromises, said two former senior officials.\n\nMike Rogers, a former Republican lawmaker from Michigan who chaired the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from 2011 to 2015, alluded to counterintelligence concerns at a conference earlier this year in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne of those concerns was a massive intelligence failure related to the secret internet-based communications system the CIA used to communicate with agents. The extent of that failure, first reported publicly by Yahoo News in 2018, got the attention of Congress earlier.\n\nBut the problems were broader than that issue, according to Rogers.\n\n\u201cOur counterintelligence operations needed some adjustments,\u201d said Rogers, adding that he and his Democratic counterpart from Maryland, Dutch Ruppersberger, requested regular briefings on the subject from agency representatives. \u201cWe started out monthly until we just wore them out, then we did it quarterly to try to make sure that we had the right resources and the right focus for the entire community on counter[intelligence].\u201d\n\nRogers later told Yahoo News that his request for the briefings had been prompted by \u201csuspected penetrations, both physical and technical, which is the role of those [Russian and Chinese] intelligence services,\u201d but declined to be more specific.\n\nThe former committee chairman said he wanted the intelligence community to make counterintelligence a higher priority. \u201cCounterintelligence was always looked at as the crazy uncle at the party,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to raise it up and give it a robust importance.\u201d\n\nMore\n\nThe briefings, which primarily involved counterintelligence officials from the FBI and CIA and were limited to the committee leadership and staff directors, led to \u201csome useful inquiries to help focus the intelligence community,\u201d Rogers said. The leaders of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence were also included in some of the inquiries, according to Rogers and a current U.S. government official.\n\nSpokespeople for the current House and Senate intelligence committees did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI and CIA declined to comment. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe briefings were designed to \u201cget the counterintelligence house in order,\u201d said Jamil Jaffer, senior counsel at the House intelligence committee from 2011 to 2013, and to ensure that Congress and the intelligence agencies were \u201con the same page\u201d when it came to such matters. \u201cThere were some concerns about what the agencies were doing, there were some concerns about what Congress knew, and all of these issues, of course, had China-Russia implications.\u201d\n\nRogers and Jaffer declined to provide further details about what specific counterintelligence issues the committee was addressing, but other former officials indicated that worries weren\u2019t limited to the compromise of FBI radio systems. Senior U.S. officials were contemplating an even more disturbing possibility: that the Russians had found a way to penetrate the communications of the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s most sensitive buildings in and around Washington, D.C.\n\nSuspected Russian intelligence officers were seen conspicuously loitering along the road that runs alongside the CIA\u2019s headquarters, according to former senior intelligence officials. \u201cRussian diplomats would be sitting on Route 123, sometimes in cars with diplomatic plates, other times not,\u201d a former senior intelligence executive said. \u201cWe thought, they\u2019re out doing something. It\u2019s not just taking down license plates; those guys are interrogating the system.\u201d\n\nThough this behavior dated back at least to the mid-2000s, former officials said those activities persisted simultaneously with the compromise of the FBI\u2019s communication system. And these were not the only instances of Russian intelligence operatives staking out locations with a line of sight to CIA headquarters. They were \u201cfixated on being in neighborhoods\u201d that gave them exposure to Langley, said a former senior official.\n\nFBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Getty Images) More\n\nOver time, U.S. intelligence officials became increasingly concerned that Russian spies might be attempting to intercept communications from key U.S. intelligence facilities, including the CIA and FBI headquarters. No one knew if the Russians had actually succeeded.\n\n\u201cThe question was whether they had capabilities to penetrate our comms at Langley,\u201d said a former senior CIA official. In the absence of any proof that that was the case, the working theory was that the Russian activities were provocations designed to sow uncertainty within the CIA. \u201cWe came to the conclusion that they were trying to get into our heads,\u201d the former senior official said.\n\nA major concern was that Russian spies with physical proximity to sensitive U.S. buildings might be exfiltrating pilfered data that had \u201cjumped the air gap,\u201d i.e., that the Russians were collecting information from a breach of computers not connected to the Internet, said former officials.\n\nOne factor behind U.S. intelligence officials\u2019 fears was simple: The CIA had already figured out how to perform similar operations themselves, according to a former senior CIA officer directly familiar with the matter. \u201cWe felt it was pretty revolutionary stuff at the time,\u201d the former CIA officer said. \u201cIt allowed us to do some extraordinary things.\u201d\n\nWhile no one definitively concluded that the Russians had actually succeeded in penetrating Langley\u2019s communications, those fears, combined in part with the breach of the bureau\u2019s encrypted radio system, drove an effort by U.S. intelligence officials around 2012 to fortify sensitive Washington-area government buildings against potential Russian snooping, according to four former officials.\n\nAt key government facilities in the Washington area, entire floors were converted to sensitive compartmented information facilities, or SCIFs. These are specially protected areas designed to be impenetrable to hostile signals intelligence gathering.\n\nThe normal assumption was that work done in a SCIF would be secure, but doubts arose about the safety of even those rooms. \u201cThe security guys would say, your windows are \u2018tempested\u2019\u201d\u2014that is, protected against the interception of emissions radiating from electronic equipment in the building \u2014\u201cyou\u2019re in a SCIF, it\u2019s fine,\u201d a former senior counterintelligence executive recalled. \u201cThe question was, \u2018Is it true?\u2019\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, U.S. officials began to fear it was not.\n\nNew security practices were instituted in sensitive government facilities like the FBI and CIA headquarters, according to former officials. \u201cIt required many procedural changes on our part to make sure we were not susceptible to penetrations,\u201d said a former senior CIA official. These included basic steps such as moving communication away from windows and changing encryption codes more frequently, as well as more expensive adjustments, said four former officials.\n\nRevelations about the Russian compromise of the radio systems, recalled a former senior intelligence official, \u201ckick-started the money flowing\u201d to upgrade security.\n\nMore\n\nWhile the breaches of the FBI communications systems appeared to finally spur Congress and the intelligence agencies to adopt steps to counter increasingly sophisticated Russian eavesdropping, it took the Putin-directed interference in the 2016 election to get the White House to expel at least some of those officials deemed responsible for the breaches, and to shut down the facilities that enabled them.\n\nEven then, the decision was controversial. Some in Washington worried about retribution by the Russians and exposure of American intelligence operations, according to a former senior U.S. national security official directly involved in the discussions. The FBI consistently supported expulsions, said another former national security official.\n\nMore than two years later, the Russian diplomatic compounds used in the FBI communications compromises remain shuttered. The U.S. government has prevented many of the Russian spies expelled by the United States from returning, according to national security experts and senior foreign intelligence officials. \u201cThey are slowly creeping back in, but [the] FBI makes it hard,\u201d said a senior foreign intelligence official. \u201cThe old guard is basically screwed. They need to bring in a whole new generation.\u201d\n\nFormer FBI Director Robert Mueller leaves a meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 2017. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) More\n\nIn the meantime, those familiar with Russian operations warn that the threat from Moscow is far from over. \u201cMake no mistake, we\u2019re in an intelligence war with the Russians, every bit as dangerous as the Cold War,\u201d said a former senior intelligence officer. \u201cThey\u2019re trying all the time ... and we caught them from time to time,\u201d he said. Of course, he added, \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the same message that special counsel Robert Mueller tried to convey during the highly contentious hearings to discuss his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cThey are doing it as we sit here, and they expect to do it during the next campaign,\u201d Mueller told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee about covert Russian involvement in U.S. politics.\n\nBut a number of observers believe Mueller\u2019s message about the threat from Russia was largely lost amid a partisan battle on Capitol Hill over President Trump.\n\nDuring his Washington conference appearance earlier this year, Rogers, the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, also lamented that the current politicized state of the intelligence committees would make spy agencies more hesitant to admit their failures.\n\n\u201cThey're not going to call you to say, 'I screwed up.' They're going to say, 'God, I hope they don't find that,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat's what's going to happen. I'll guarantee it's happening today.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:",
