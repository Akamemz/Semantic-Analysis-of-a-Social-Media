    "content": "In his meeting with controversial county clerk Kim Davis last Thursday , Pope Francis reportedly told Ms. Davis to \u201c stand strong \u201d as she stands up for her religious beliefs in rural Kentucky .\nThe meeting between the pontiff and a woman who went to jail for five days for defying a Supreme Court order to allow same-sex couples to marry came before Francis made comments about \u201c conscientious objection \u201d as a human right , even for government officials .\nIn some ways , the meeting fit with the pope \u2019 s focus on the \u201c spirit of encounter \u201d as well as his unorthodox meetings with people he calls on the \u201c peripheries. \u201d And it also came days after he met with nuns fighting an Obamacare mandate on contraceptives , another front in the American cultural wars .\nBut the 15-minute t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate at the Vatican Embassy in Washington also jarred a number of narratives from the pope \u2019 s historic visit , suggesting to some critics that the pontiff condoned Davis \u2019 actions \u2013 which critics say amount to imposing her personal religious beliefs , in violation of the Constitution , on same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses .\nThe decision by the pope to give his personal blessing \u2013 and a rosary \u2013 to Davis thrust the pontiff into one of America \u2019 s most volatile cultural battles .\nIn other ways , however , Francis focused Rome \u2019 s gaze on the changing dynamics of religious freedom in the progressive era , offering a moment of pause for many Americans to consider growing questions about how the United States handles religious objections to same-sex unions .\n\u201c I think both sides have either tried to vilify or champion Kim Davis in one way or another , but what they \u2019 re forgetting is that the central issue here is of religious freedom in the US , and how we treat it . What does it mean , and what are its boundaries ? \u201d says Joe Valenzano , an expert on religious rhetoric at the University of Dayton in Ohio . \u201c The fact is , both sides have made just a colossal mess out of this to further their own perspective , rather than focusing on what could be a productive conversation for society . \u201d\nThe Vatican confirmed the meeting , but gave no further commentary , potentially suggesting that it didn \u2019 t want to get into the political details of the struggle over same-sex marriage in Rowan County , Ky. For some Vatican observers , it wasn \u2019 t surprising that the pope , a religious figure , met with someone who has become a lightning rod for her religious beliefs .\nThe pope \u201c took somebody on the front of the newspapers for faith-related concerns and met with her , \u201d says Professor Valenzano . \u201c [ The pope told Davis that ] you don \u2019 t lose faith because you lose a battle . That \u2019 s not the pope weighing in on the culture wars or endorsing Kim Davis \u2019 s position . That \u2019 s the pope endorsing the idea that religion is important to people . \u201d\nYet for all the pope \u2019 s focus on moral values , the meeting with Davis and the nuns could have a political impact , writes John Allen Jr. , on Crux , a Catholic news site . For one , he writes , the meeting \u201c means that Francis has significantly strengthened the hand of the US bishops and other voices in American debates defending religious freedom . \u201d\nThe meeting also could give more direct encouragement to other US officials who have declined to offer marriage licenses to same-sex couples . A number of clerks and other government officials have followed Davis \u2019 s lead , refusing to abide by the Supreme Court \u2019 s June ruling declaring same-sex marriage a constitutional right .\nThe problem with that strategy , however , is that Davis , for one , represents what Doug Laycock calls a poor example of a religious martyr . He points out that Davis didn \u2019 t just want an opt-out from signing marriage licenses for same-sex couples . Instead , after her release from jail , she changed the Rowan County license form to take the name of the county off the form \u2013 a change the plaintiffs argue violates the judge \u2019 s order .\n\u201c Kim Davis gives religious liberty a bad name , and endangers it for everybody , \u201d says Professor Laycock , a religious liberty expert at the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville . \u201c She does not have to issue marriage licenses . But the county is not entitled to exemption , because the county does not have a religion . That \u2019 s the fundamental distinction . \u201d\nThose nuances may have been lost on the pope , Mr. Laycock suggests .\n\u201c If you come here from Rome , if you \u2019 re not closely following this , you don \u2019 t have any sort of deep understanding of US law , \u201d he says .\nThe pontiff made waves in the US during his visit for his attempt to expand the Catholic church \u2019 s influence beyond the culture wars . He weighed in on climate change and the death penalty , bolstering his bona fides among US liberals . But he also buckled down on church doctrine on abortion and threats to the sanctity of marriage , to the applause of conservatives .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t have in mind all the cases that can exist about conscientious objection , \u201d the pope said on the papal plane last week , \u201c but yes , I can say that conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right . It is a right . \u201d\n\u201c And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector , he denies a right , \u201d he said , adding , in what may have been a reference to Davis , \u201c It is a human right , and if a government official is a human person , he has that right . \u201d\nFor American political operatives , the pope \u2019 s message may ultimately be frustrating for its nuance .
