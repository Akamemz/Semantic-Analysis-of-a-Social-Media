Some are worried about the rising influence of top White House aide Stephen Miller . And after November elections in which suburban voters rejected Trump \u2019 s hard-line immigration agenda , the president is once again making it the centerpiece of the GOP \u2019 s platform .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a mess , \u201d Sen. John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) said , summing up the dynamic on the border and in Washington .\nRepublicans note that the president has the right to fire whoever he wants , but few offered an explicit defense of his decisions to oust DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen , pull the top Immigration and Customs Enforcement pick , remove the Secret Service director and threaten more terminations .\n\u201c Strikes me as just a frustration of not being able to solve a problem . Honestly , it wasn \u2019 t Secretary Nielsen \u2019 s fault . It wasn \u2019 t for lack of effort on her part . I don \u2019 t know if there \u2019 s anybody who \u2019 s going to be able to do more , \u201d said Cornyn , who spoke to Nielsen on Monday and planned to speak to her interim replacement , Kevin McAleenan , later in the day .\nCornyn said he has no idea what Miller \u2019 s \u201c agenda \u201d is in determining immigration policy because he isn \u2019 t Senate-confirmed and doesn \u2019 t correspond with the Hill .\n\u201c I thought that Nielsen was doing a fantastic job , \u201d added Joni Ernst of Iowa , the No . 5 Senate GOP leader . \u201c I would love to see some continuity . I think that \u2019 s important . \u201d\nChuck Grassley of Iowa , the most senior GOP senator , is trying to head off even more dismissals as Trump tries to reshape DHS into a \u201c tougher \u201d mold .\nIn an interview , Grassley expressed concern that Trump may soon boot U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Lee Francis Cissna and Kathy Nuebel Kovarik , who heads the office of policy and strategy at USCIS .\n\u201c I heard that they are on the list to be fired , \u201d Grassley said . \u201c They are doing in an intellectual-like way what the president wants to accomplish . So no , they should not go . \u201d\nRepublicans empathize with Trump \u2019 s frustrations over the border and Congress \u2019 languid pace at changing immigration laws . They mostly backed him on his 35-day government shutdown over the border wall , buckling only as the standoff dragged into its second month .\nMost of them hated his emergency declaration on the southern border , but only 25 GOP lawmakers between the two chambers ended up bucking him . And when Trump and Miller sought to tank an immigration compromise last year , Senate Republicans overwhelmingly sided with the president and left Democrats holding the bag on the legislative collapse .\nBut on immigration , the party is not in lockstep with Trump . So even as the president pursues more aggressive strategies on the border , the GOP might not stick with him ahead of an election cycle that has the Senate up for grabs and with Republicans eager to take back the House .\n\u201c He thinks it \u2019 s a winning issue , \u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota , the Republican whip . \u201c It works for him . It may not work for everybody else . \u201d\nNielsen \u2019 s ouster wasn \u2019 t a shock . Stories had emanated from the White House for months that she could be kicked off the job given Trump \u2019 s rising frustration with the growing number of border crossings .\nBut Republicans said they did not like that she was made to take the fall .\n\u201c Nielsen was doing the best she can . She can \u2019 t make Congress get off its ice-cold , lazy butt and fix the asylum laws . She can \u2019 t build a wall by herself . She can \u2019 t make the Central American countries work with us . \u2026 Only the president can do that , \u201d Sen. John N. Kennedy ( R-La . ) said . \u201c If someone resigns and then the White House staff cuts \u2018 em to pieces , I just think that \u2019 s classless . \u201d\nOn Monday , Trump found few allies in his decision to get rid of Nielsen with the exception of congressional Democrats who viewed her as the face of the administration \u2019 s family separation policy and wanted her gone .\nSenate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) admitted the obvious in a written statement : `` I am concerned with a growing leadership void '' at DHS .\nMost Republicans liked Nielsen and thought she \u2019 d been given an impossible job . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) praised her glowingly on the Senate floor for her \u201c experienced and steady leadership . \u201d\n\u201c I understand the frustration \u201d by Trump , said Rep. Tom Cole ( R-Okla. ) , who backed the president \u2019 s efforts to \u201c shake things up \u201d at DHS . \u201c Whether there \u2019 s a design behind this , I honestly don \u2019 t know . I have been told there \u2019 s going to be new policies and proposals , but I don \u2019 t know what those are yet . \u201d\nCentrist GOP Rep. Will Hurd , who narrowly won reelection in 2018 , said the turnover in the upper ranks of DHS isn \u2019 t helpful during a critical time at the southern border , though the Texan expressed confidence in Nielsen \u2019 s successor .\n\u201c When you \u2019 re dealing with something that \u2019 s the worst we \u2019 ve seen in 12 , 13 years , having to deal with that problem and having new people come in and deal with it is always tricky , \u201d said Hurd , whose district stretches along the U.S.-Mexico border .\nModerate GOP Rep. Tom Reed of New York said he would prefer to focus on issues like infrastructure , drug pricing and health care in the 2020 election cycle , saying the issue of immigration is being kept alive \u201c for political purposes . \u201d\nReed also took a veiled shot at Miller : \u201c One hard-liner is not going to dictate the outcome of this . \u201d\nBut Miller \u2019 s rise in the Trump administration is merely one more indication of how the president gravitates toward the restrictionist wing of his party .\n\u201c The president is really unhappy with the results and he \u2019 s trying to find a different formula that produces a different result , \u201d said Roy Blunt of Missouri , the No . 4 Senate GOP leader . \u201c Unless you either change the court directives or the asylum law , it \u2019 s very hard to quickly come up with a solution . And the president \u2019 s frustrated by that . \u201d\nThe problem for Trump is that that \u2019 s not going to happen anytime soon . Congress \u2019 dithering on immigration in the six years since the Senate passed its \u201c Gang of Eight \u201d comprehensive immigration bill , which died in the House , is no surprise .\nLast year \u2019 s bipartisan Senate talks sputtered . Talks between Sens . Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) and Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) on the family migration crisis went nowhere . So it \u2019 s easy for the president and his closest confidants to blame the Hill .\nThat \u2019 s what House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) did in an interview Monday .\n\u201c Congress also has a responsibility here to act . This is where legislation has to be passed , \u201d he said , echoing Trump \u2019 s call to revamp U.S. asylum laws .\n\u201c What the president is doing is seeing the crisis and trying to solve the problem , \u201d McCarthy said . \u201c He \u2019 s trying to get the right people in the right positions . \u201d",
