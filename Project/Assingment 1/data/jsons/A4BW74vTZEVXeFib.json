Why not on Romney 's radar ?\nThey say his view of 'workplace flexibility ' is for women to get home to `` second shift ''\nWriters : Comments show little understanding , serious thought on workplace equity for women\nWhen Mitt Romney asked his staff why all the applicants for cabinet positions seemed to be men , as he recounted in the presidential debate Tuesday night , he was apparently told that only men had `` the qualifications . '' That is obviously not true .\nBut this story , as well as , of course , the infamous `` binders '' comment , provide a good opportunity to talk about women 's issues beyond the two perennials , abortion and contraception . As we near the end of 2012 , our society still struggles with women 's full integration into the workforce and men 's full participation on the home front . Indeed , Romney 's comments illustrate the continued superficial treatment these issues receive , not only by many political leaders , but also by society as a whole .\nLet 's look at , for example , some basic -- yet wrong -- assumptions about women 's qualifications for high-level positions .\nWomen 's college graduation rates now surpass those of men . For the past decade , women have outnumbered men in law school admissions . More than 50 % of those in management and professional specialties are women . And similar trends are evident in secondary education , the professoriate , and college and university administrations . Many Massachusetts women held appropriate credentials .\nSo , why did n't these women appear on Romney 's radar screen until after the organizers of MassGap supplied the now-derided binders ? Perhaps the administration held the common view that women suitable for leadership positions are exceptional or rare . Maybe they thought that women have so many competing obligations that they would not be available for high-level political jobs . Maybe the Romney inner circle recruited only from its own male-dominated ranks . Whatever the reasons , women 's full integration into the workforce was an afterthought .\nThe `` binders '' comment also touched on the stickiness of traditional gender roles . Romney said he `` recognized that if you 're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible . '' His example of flexibility , however , was allowing his chief of staff to `` get home at 5 '' to make dinner for her family and be with her children . He stopped short of saying it directly , but Romney appears to hold a common belief that women can best be integrated into the workforce if they are still able to fulfill their duties as wives and mothers .\nJUST WATCHED Romney , Obama poke fun at themselves Replay More Videos ...
