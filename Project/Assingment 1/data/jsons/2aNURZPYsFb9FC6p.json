They want a fiscal cliff deal , if you do n't get it , and it 's got to be a real deal , then we will be downgraded , not just continuing under negative watch as they say . But no , we will be downgraded . We will lose our triple A rating which we have at the moment according to Moody 's . [ Fox News , America 's Newsroom , 11/13/12 ]\nFACT : Moody 's Is Not Set To Downgrade If Budget Negotiations Fail\nMoody 's Would Maintain AAA Credit Rating Even If Negotiations Failed . Reuters reported that if Congress can not reach an agreement on the debt , Moody 's will not necessarily downgrade U.S. debt :\nIf an agreement in Congress can not be reached before year-end , the automatic spending cuts would go into effect , but not necessarily lead to a downgrade , said Moody 's , highlighting that the immediate fiscal shock would improve government finances in the short-term , but are likely to result in recession and higher unemployment . Still , the ratings agency maintains that even if the government can not agree and the economy goes over the cliff \u201c we would maintain our Aaa rating with a negative outlook and await evidence that the economy could rebound from the shock before considering a return to a stable outlook. \u201d [ Reuters , 11/7/12 ]\nMoody 's : U.S . Rating Will Be Downgraded Only If Debt Reduction Is Not Addressed . Moody 's stated that a downgrade would only take effect \u201c if negotiations fail to produce policies that lead to debt stabilization and ultimately reduction. \u201d The agency further commented that a downward trend in debt to GDP ratio would affirm the U.S. ' current triple A rating .

During the November 13 edition of America 's Newsroom , host Martha MacCallum suggested the Obama administration was to blame for downgrade of U.S. debt in 2011 by Standard & Poor 's :\nMacCALLUM : This administration was the first to preside over a downgrade of U.S. debt . We hope this is n't something we are going to get used to . [ Fox News , America 's Newsroom , 11/13/12 ]\nFACT : Economists Agree That S & P Downgrade Was Due To GOP Obstruction\nChambers : Downgrade Due To Debate Over Debt Ceiling . In an August 5 , 2011 , Wall Street Journal article discussing Standard & Poor 's decision to downgrade U.S. government debt , John Chambers , the chairman of S & P 's sovereign ratings committee cited political debate as a reason for their decision to downgrade , claiming the \u201c conclusion was pretty much motivated by all of the debate about the raising of the debt ceiling ... It involved a level of brinkmanship greater than what we had expected earlier in the year. \u201d [ The Wall Street Journal , 8/5/11 ]\nPaul Krugman : Republicans Threatened To \u201c Disrupt The Essential Business Of Government. \u201d In explaining the downgrade , New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote that Republicans used the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip for policy concessions , which raised economic uncertainty :\nThe facts of the crisis over the debt ceiling are n't complicated . Republicans have , in effect , taken America hostage , threatening to undermine the economy and disrupt the essential business of government unless they get policy concessions they would never have been able to enact through legislation . And Democrats -- who would have been justified in rejecting this extortion altogether -- have , in fact , gone a long way toward meeting those Republican demands .

So when the press says neither the Democrats nor the Republicans can escape blame , it is in truth nonsense . The showdown caused the downgrade , not the nation 's financial liabilities , and Republicans deliberately caused it in pursuit of their own political and ideological goals . [ The Roosevelt Institute , 8/8/2011 ]\nStandard & Poor 's : Debt Burden Likely To Grow Due To Republican Intransigence . In its report explaining the downgrade of U.S. credit , Standard and Poor 's singled out Republicans for their unwillingness to compromise on tax cuts . From the report :\nEven assuming that at least $ 2.1 trillion of the spending reductions the act envisages are implemented , we maintain our view that the U.S. net general government debt burden ( all levels of government combined , excluding liquid financial assets ) will likely continue to grow . Under our revised base case fiscal scenario -- which we consider to be consistent with a 'AA+ ' long-term rating and a negative outlook -- we now project that net general government debt would rise from an estimated 74 % of GDP by the end of 2011 to 79 % in 2015 and 85 % by 2021 . [ ... ] Compared with previous projections , our revised base case scenario now assumes that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts , due to expire by the end of 2012 , remain in place . We have changed our assumption on this because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues , a position we believe Congress reinforced by passing the act .

From CBO :\nThe budgetary cost of extending the expiring tax provisions would be lower if certain provisions were allowed to expire that otherwise would apply to some high-income households . According to JCT and CBO 's estimates , if the AMT was indexed for inflation beginning in 2012 and all of the other expiring tax provisions were extended except for the specific provisions affecting high-income taxpayers ( and the payroll tax cut ) , revenues would be lower and outlays for refundable credits would be higher than $ 288 billion in fiscal year 2013 and by $ 382 billion in fiscal year 2014 , compared with CBO 's baseline projections . CBO estimates that such changes would increase real GDP by 1.3 percent ( by 0.3 percent to 2.3 percent under CBO 's full range of assumptions ) , and increase full-time-equivalent employment by 1.6 million ( with a range from 0.5 million to 2.8 million ) in the fourth quarter of 2013 .
