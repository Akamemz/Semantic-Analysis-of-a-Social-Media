The Ford-Firestone tire debacle in 2000 was linked to 250 deaths and 3,000 injuries . NHTSA identified the problem in May of that year . By November , tough new laws had been enacted .\nIt \u2019 s also not the first time since then that congressional response to a major consumer auto safety crisis has gotten bogged down . In 2010 , sticking accelerator pedals and floor mat problems that caused some models of Toyota to race suddenly led to the recall of nearly 8 million vehicles and forced breathless concern and multiple hearings on Capitol Hill . But comprehensive legislation that would have strengthened NHTSA \u2019 s ability to police the automobile industry ended up dying in both chambers .\nSome pieces of that legislation survived and were included in a major surface transportation law \u2014 however those provisions are a ghost of their previous incarnation . The strongest response ended up coming not from Congress , and not from the Transportation Department , but from Department of Justice , which settled a suit against Toyota for $ 1.2 billion \u2014 the biggest fine ever levied by the U.S. government against an automaker .\nBoth then and now , advocates have said Congress needs to enact stronger laws \u2014 but overall congressional gridlock has pushed the issue to the sidelines .\nLeaders \u201c didn \u2019 t see this as something they could get done , \u201d said Joan Claybrook , NHTSA \u2019 s first administrator and the former president of Public Citizen , noting opposition from the powerful auto industry would likely bog down progress .\nDespite the delay in responding to the latest crisis , advocates insist the political moment hasn \u2019 t slipped away without action beyond a series of media-friendly hearings that led the evening news .\n\u201c There may not be the TV cameras , there may not be the press of media interest , \u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( D-Conn. ) , who has emerged as a fierce critic of both the agency and General Motors , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c This issue is ever-present to anyone who buys a car . It \u2019 s still very much on the minds of everyday Americans . \u201d\nBolstering NHTSA , at least around the edges , is still possible this Congress : both Upton and Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune ( R-S.D . ) said they have ideas about how to improve the agency . A long-term surface transportation bill \u2014 which could move as soon as May \u2014 would be an ideal vehicle for any changes . But language that can win GOP support is likely to disappoint reform advocates and the administration .\nPerhaps the top item on safety advocates \u2019 wish list is raising or even eliminating the $ 35 million cap on the civil penalties NHTSA can slap automakers with for hiding individual defects . In recent budgets , President Barack Obama has proposed raising the cap from $ 35 million to $ 300 million . Blumenthal and other Democratic senators have proposed eliminating it entirely .\nSafety advocates have said eliminating the cap is crucial to making NHTSA a feared regulator . And at least one senator believes automakers essentially dismiss any threat NHTSA might pose as little more than the cost of doing business .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a sad state of affairs , \u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo . ) said during a hearing on the nomination of NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind . \u201c It says a lot about where we are in this country right now and how your agency is viewed . \u201d\n\u201c If you are not feared and respected , then you can not do a good job policing safety of automobiles in this country . And I don \u2019 t think NHTSA is either feared or respected at this point , \u201d McCaskill said .\nEven though GM has said implementing its millions of recalls will cost $ 2.5 billion , the $ 35 million NHTSA has handed out in fines amounts to less than one-hundredth of a percent of the the company \u2019 s 2013 profits of $ 3.8 billion . Upton said he doesn \u2019 t see a need to raise the cap on fines .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know if it was ever going to be big and comprehensive , \u201d Upton said . He noted that the 2000 NHTSA overhaul bill he authored , called the TREAD Act , \u201c raised the fines . They \u2019 ve been paying for it . GM , Toyota paid huge sums as the law requires . \u201d\nThune said during negotiations in the last Congress , there was a \u201c consensus spot \u201d for raising the caps , but didn \u2019 t get into specifics . \u201c It \u2019 s something we \u2019 ll take a look at . \u201d\nIn his 2015 budget , President Barack Obama proposes tripling the agency \u2019 s budget for defect investigations and increasing the overall budget by 20 percent over the next half-decade , enabling NHTSA to hire more investigators to deal with the 70,000 complaints it receives each year . Thune told reporters he expects that to be a tough sell .\n\u201c Clearly , we want to work with them but it \u2019 s going to be tough in this budgetary environment with all the constraints we \u2019 re dealing with to get significant increases in funding for any agency , \u201d he said .\nThis , longtime advocates argue , is exactly what the auto industry hopes for .\n\u201c The auto industry always wants to starve the agency to death so it can \u2019 t operate , \u201d Claybrook said . She noted NHTSA receives only one percent of the Transportation Department \u2019 s total funding pot , yet automobile accidents account for 99 percent of transportation deaths and injuries .\nBlumenthal said he and Sen. Ed Markey ( D-Mass . ) intend to introduce a number of bills that would improve the agency \u2019 s transparency and require automakers to put more information into a federal early warning reports system , a critical feature of the TREAD Act . None of Blumenthal and Markey \u2019 s bills have picked up Republican co-sponsors yet .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very much an urgent and immediate concern , \u201d the Connecticut senator said . \u201c This is a very imminent opportunity as well as an obligation for the Congress to act . Am I disappointed ? Yes , but I also understand that sometimes legislation takes time . \u201d\nOne piece of legislation is likely to move : A bill by Thune and Commerce Committee ranking member Bill Nelson ( D-Fla. ) intended to incentivize whistleblowers by offering them one-third of any fines NHTSA collects that top $ 1 million . But the agency said gathering more tips isn \u2019 t really the problem .\n\u201c We need the resources , the people and the dollars to follow up on those leads , \u201d NHTSA deputy administrator David Friedman , then the agency \u2019 s top official , said at the November hearing where Thune and Nelson first proposed the bill .\nAt one point last year , stronger action looked likely . Senators in both parties were furious with GM officials , including CEO Mary Barra , over the recall scandal . The scandal burst into public consciousness in late January , when GM ordered 2.1 million cars recalled due to an ignition switch defect that could lead to cars suddenly stopping while airbags fail to deploy . The defect has since been linked to more than 50 deaths . Some GM employees knew about the problem more than a decade earlier , and congressional investigators uncovered repeated missed opportunities for NHTSA to diagnose the problem .\nThe resulting uproar sparked what would become a record year for recalls , as the other members of the Big Three as well as foreign automakers began ordering recalls en masse to prevent scandals of their own . The record for recalls in a single year was broken in October . The final tally of 60 million was double the previous modern high .\nWith the recalls came congressional condemnation .
