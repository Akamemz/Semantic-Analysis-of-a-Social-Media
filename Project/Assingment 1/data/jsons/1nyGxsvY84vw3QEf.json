And it \u2019 s also a major increase over last year \u2019 s poll , when 28 percent of Americans believed that the nation was less secure than before 9/11.The new poll shows that , in fact , only 1 in 4 Americans , just 26 percent , think the nation is safer than before 9/11.The poll was released ahead of President Barack Obama \u2019 s planned address to the nation on prime-time TV Wednesday , revealing his strategy on dealing with the increasing threat from the Islamic State ( ISIS ) terror group.The danger from ISIS was highlighted by the beheadings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff by the jihadists , who posted a video of the decapitations . `` A very war-weary country seems to have woken up to the real threat that ISIS may present , '' says Republican pollster Bill McInturff , who conducted the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey with Democratic pollster Peter Hart of Hart Research . `` The beheadings are so chilling to the American public , '' said Hart . `` The only things I think of equal impact are the self-immolations back in Vietnam . `` According to the survey , 94 percent of Americans said they had heard about Foley \u2019 s death , which was higher than any other news event that NBC/WSJ polls have measured over the past five years.The figure surpassed the 79 percent who had heard about Syria \u2019 s alleged use of chemical weapons in 2013 , the 77 percent who knew of the 2011 debt-ceiling battle , and the 68 percent who were aware of Oklahoma \u2019 s botched execution this year , according to NBC News.The new poll also found that 6 of every 10 Americans , or 61 percent , believe that the United States must take military action against ISIS , compared to 13 percent who want the country to stay out of the conflict in Iraq and Syria , where the terror organization is attempting to create a caliphate.The figure is a significant increase over the 21 percent who said it was in the nation \u2019 s best interest to take action against the Syrian government after it had reportedly used chemical weapons.The survey also found that 2 of every 5 Americans , or 40 percent , felt that the United States should only target ISIS with airstrikes , while nearly as many people , 34 percent , want the Obama administration to employ both air power and combat troops on the ground.However , 15 percent of respondents said that no force whatsoever should be taken in the Middle East against ISIS jihadists.The NBC/WSJ poll of 1,000 registered voters was conducted Sept. 3-7 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points .",
