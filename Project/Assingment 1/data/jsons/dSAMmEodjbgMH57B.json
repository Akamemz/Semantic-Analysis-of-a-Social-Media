    "content": "Thousands of people marched in cities around the country to demand that President Trump release his tax returns on Tax Day , in a demonstration that echoed the 2009 tax rallies that launched the Tea Party movement .\nSaturday \u2019 s Tax March , which took place in nearly 200 cities around the country , was unusual for a liberal protest both in its subject matter and its specificity : rather than focus on more typically leftist issues like police brutality , climate change or reproductive rights , the Tax March was all about taxes , which is typically a rallying cry of Republicans . Specifically , the marchers had just one demand : to see Trump \u2019 s taxes .\nMost of the protests were largely conflict-free , but at least a dozen demonstrators were arrested in Berkeley after a pro-Trump demonstration resulted in a fistfight against counter-demonstrators , punctuated with pepper and smoke bombs . It did not appear to be related to the Tax March .\nThe March took place exactly eight years after the first major Tea Party rally to protest Obama policies on April 15 , 2009 , which was widely credited as the beginning of the far-right Tea Party movement . Saturday \u2019 s Tax March was superficially similar to that first Tea Party in some ways : many of the protesters were older than the millennials who flocked to earlier anti-Trump rallies , and there were more conspicuous displays of patriotism than one normally sees at liberal rallies .\nOlder people generally tend to care more about tax issues , and the Tea Party was made up mostly of older Americans : three-quarters of self-identified Tea Party members are over 45 , according to a 2012 CBS News poll , and almost a third are over 65 . Similarly , the Tax March tended to attract a slightly older set of protesters than other anti-Trump marches have . Many said they had protested against the Vietnam War and segregation in the 1960s and 1970s .\n\u201c It seems older than the Women \u2019 s March was , \u201d says Betsy Klein , 69 . \u201c Because a lot of younger people haven \u2019 t had experiences like we have , paying our taxes every year for 40 years .

I didn \u2019 t do anything until this Cheeto got into the White House , \u201d she says . But she noticed fewer younger faces than she had at the Women \u2019 s March . \u201c Most of the people here have paid taxes for 30 or 40 years. \u201d She added that the injustice might not resonate so much with younger people who are just beginning to file their own tax forms . \u201c We \u2019 re longtime taxpayers . Why break with tradition that \u2019 s been going on for decades ? It \u2019 s so unfair . \u201d\nThere was plenty of Tax March protest art , from paper \u201c pussy-hats \u201d made of tax returns , to a woman dressed in a tutu made of dollar bills , to another a sign that said \u201c You can grab my pussy if you show me your taxes. \u201d But marchers also showed more conventional displays of patriotism , like waving flags or wearing red-white-and-blue outfits .
