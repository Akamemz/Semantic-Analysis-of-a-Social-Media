William Jennings Bryan came close as the Democratic nominee in 1896 , though at least his Cross of Gold speech was eloquent .\nBut there are echoes across the generations . Trump \u2019 s speech was a cross between Richard Nixon \u2019 s \u201c law and order \u201d code words for race , Pat Buchanan \u2019 s gross distortion of immigration and trade , and Bill Clinton \u2019 s clever effort to shift the focus of the campaign from him ( a flawed candidate ) to \u201c you . \u201d\nThe ugliness at the core of the Trump candidacy\u2014perfumed by his attractive children\u2014came through in his Mussolini delivery and of course when his Banana Republican Hillary-hating audience couldn \u2019 t resist what for many onlookers became the signature line of the 2016 Republican Convention : \u201c Lock Her Up ! \u201d\nBut for me , the key line of the convention came not from Trump or his angry mob but from his wife . It was a fraudulent line\u2014in more ways than one\u2014and it symbolized everything that has happened to the GOP in this fateful political year .\nOn the first night of the convention , Melania Trump said that her husband has always believed that \u201c you treat people with dignity and respect. \u201d This was in the part of the speech that was plagiarized from Michelle Obama , but as long as they were at it , the Trump speechwriters should have stolen the whole Michelle Obama quote , which was : \u201c you treat people with dignity and respect , even if you don \u2019 t know them and even if you don \u2019 t agree with them . \u201d\nThe active toxic agent in the poison infecting our body politic is lack of basic respect for people outside his family and close friends . Even an incomplete bill of particulars is very long , from Trump telling Larry King on the air in the 1980s that \u201c you have bad breath , \u201d to offering a reward for Barack Obama \u2019 s college transcripts to \u201c prove \u201d that the president wasn \u2019 t smart , to mocking a disabled reporter , to sliming a fine Latino judge , to suggesting the Republican director of the FBI is corrupt for protecting Hillary Clinton , to insulting a billion Muslims , which is not exactly the best way to improve American intelligence in the Middle East , the only halfway specific policy proposal in Trump \u2019 s entire acceptance speech .\nThe sea of vulgarity has numbed us to the truth\u2014that the Grand Old Party under Trump has drifted far away from the party of John McCain , who in 2008 admonished a supporter that while Barack Obama was wrong on the issues , he deserved our respect . It has drifted far out of bounds , and flouted the norms of a civilized society . Today \u2019 s GOP is the Gauche Old Party , sometimes even the Gross Old Party .\nAt least the \u201c old \u201d part is consistent . As usual at a Republican convention , the delegates were overwhelmingly white and affluent . But they were also awfully long in the tooth . Only 2 percent of the delegates were under 30 . The \u201c again \u201d in \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d is all you need to know that Trump \u2019 s party is a party of the past , not the future .\nBut is it even really the party of the past ? We \u2019 ve seen surges of xenophobia going back to the Know-Nothing Party of the 1850s . And authoritarian demagogues\u2014preaching a narrow \u201c Americanism \u201d \u2014occasionally catch a wave . William Randolph Hearst , Douglas MacArthur , Ross Perot , and Buchanan were all mentioned as Republican candidates . ( Bigots like Strom Thurmond and George Wallace afflicted the Democrats before bolting for independent bids ) .\nBut none of these men managed to win a major party nomination .\nFor most of the postwar era , the GOP has resisted demagogues and helped build a bipartisan structure of civil rights , respectful debate and collective security through global alliances that Trump\u2014if his interview this week in The New York Times is to be believed\u2014would casually cast aside after 70 years of success in preventing another world war .\nThe GOP has a grander history than many liberals would admit . In 1940 , Republicans meeting in Philadelphia rejected isolationist politicians and\u2014contrary to Philip Roth \u2019 s novel , The Plot Against America\u2014weren \u2019 t tempted by Charles A. Lindbergh and his anti-Semitic \u201c America First \u201d campaign , the slogan now adopted by Trump . The nominee that year was Wendell Wilkie , a businessman , and that \u2019 s where the similarities to Trump end . Wilkie was a cultured internationalist who later wrote a book titled One World .\nThe nominee in 1944 and 1948 was Thomas E. Dewey , a former prosecutor and governor of New York who attacked Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman but left the conspiracy theories and personal nastiness to fringe elements in the party . In the 1950s , Dwight D. Eisenhower set a moderate tone and , belatedly , made sure the party steered clear of demagogues like Sen. Joseph McCarthy .
