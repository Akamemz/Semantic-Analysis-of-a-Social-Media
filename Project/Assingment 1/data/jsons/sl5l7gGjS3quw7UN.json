    "content": "Jeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author .\nDonald Trump may have eased some Republican fears Tuesday night when he declared his intention to stay inside the party . But if their angst has been temporarily eased at the prospect of what he would do if he loses , they still face a far more troubling , and increasingly plausible , question .\nWith Trump as its standard-bearer , the GOP would suddenly be asked to rally around a candidate who has been called by his once and former primary foes \u201c a cancer on conservatism , \u201d \u201c unhinged , \u201d \u201c a drunk driver \u2026 helping the enemy. \u201d A prominent conservative national security expert , Max Boot , has flatly labeled him \u201c a fascist. \u201d And the rhetoric is even stronger in private conversations I \u2019 ve had recently with Republicans of moderate and conservative stripes .\nThis is not the usual rhetoric of intraparty battles , the kind of thing that gets resolved in handshakes under the convention banners . These are stake-in-the-ground positions , strongly suggesting that a Trump nomination would create a fissure within the party as deep and indivisible as any in American political history , driven both by ideology and by questions of personal character .\nIndeed , it would be a fissure so deep that , if the operatives I talked with are right , Trump running as a Republican could well face a third-party run\u2014from the Republicans themselves .\nThat threat , in turn , would leave Republican candidates , contributors and foot soldiers with painful choices . A look at the political landscape , the election rules and the history of intraparty insurgencies suggests that it could turn 2016 , a year that offered Republicans a reasonable chance to win the White House and with it total control of the national political apparatus , into a disaster .\nWith Trump as the nominee , the Republican Party would face a threat to unity on several fronts . His victory would represent a triumph of an insurgent movement , or impulse , within the party . Historically speaking , this is exactly the kind of intraparty victory that guarantees political civil war .\nThe most striking examples of party fissure in American politics have come when a party broke with a long pattern of accommodating different factions and moved decisively toward one side . It has happened with the Democrats twice , both over civil rights . The party had long embraced the cause of civil rights in the North while welcoming segregationists\u2014and white supremacists\u2014from across the South . In 1948 , the party \u2019 s embrace of a stronger civil rights plank led Southern delegations to walk out of the convention . That year , South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond led a National States Rights Democratic Party\u2014the \u201c Dixiecrats \u201d \u2014that won four Southern states . Had President Harry Truman not ( barely ) defeated Tom Dewey in Ohio and California , the Electoral College would have been deadlocked\u2014and the choice thrown into the House of Representatives , with Southern segregationists holding the balance of power . Twenty years later , Alabama Governor George Wallace led a similar anti-civil-rights third party movement that won five Southern states . A relatively small shift of voters in California would have deadlocked that election and thrown it to the House of Representatives .\nIn two other cases , a dramatic shift in intraparty power led to significant defections on the losing side . In 1964 , when Republican conservatives succeeded in nominating a divisive champion of their cause in Barry Goldwater , liberal Republicans ( there were such things back then ) like New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller , Michigan Governor George Romney and others refused to endorse the nominee . More shockingly , the New York Herald-Tribune , the semi-official voice of the GOP establishment , endorsed Lyndon Johnson\u2014the first Democrat it had supported , ever . With his party split , Goldwater went down in flames . Eight years later , when a deeply divided Democratic Party nominated anti-war hero George McGovern , George Meany led the AFL-CIO to a position of neutrality between McGovern and Richard Nixon\u2014the first time labor had refused to back a Democrat for president . Prominent Democrats like former Texas Governor John Connally openly backed Nixon , while countless others , disempowered by the emergence of \u201c new Democrats , \u201d simply sat on their hands . The divided Democrats lost in a landslide .\nWould a Trump nomination be another example of such a power shift ? Yes , although not a shift in an ideological sense . It would represent a more radical kind of shift , with power moving from party officials and office-holders to deeply alienated voters and to their media tribunes . ( Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , Mark Levin , Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham have not exactly endorsed Trump , but they have been vocal in defending him and in assailing those who have branded Trump unacceptable . ) It would undermine the thesis of a highly influential book , \u201c The Party Decides , \u201d which argues that the preferences of party insiders is still critical to the outcome of a nomination contest . This possibility , in turn , has provoked strong feelings about Trump from some \u201c old school \u201d Republicans . Says one self-described \u201c structural , sycophantic Republican \u201d who has been involved at high levels of GOP campaigns for decades : \u201c Hillary would be bad for the country\u2014he \u2019 d be worse . \u201d\nA battle over ideology or influence , however , explains only one kind of defection from party ranks . The other\u2014one that would hold particular peril for Trump-as-Republican-nominee\u2014arises from a belief that a chosen candidate is simply unfit , by character or temperament , to hold office . And on at least one occasion , a prominent politician sacrificed his electoral chances out of that belief .\nIn 1986 , former Senator Adlai Stevenson III had every reason to believe he would be following his father 's footsteps into the Illinois governor \u2019 s mansion . Four years earlier , the Democrat had lost a race for that office by fewer than 5,000 highly disputed votes . But in 1986 , his easy primary win in March was overshadowed by what happened elsewhere on the ballot : Two followers of Lyndon LaRouche , a cultish , conspiracy-minded demagogue , won the Democratic nominations for lieutenant governor and secretary of state . Stevenson was so horrified by the thought of placing LaRouche \u2019 s acolytes in positions of political power that he bolted the party line , running instead as an independent . He lost decisively . ( Sen. Alan Dixon , who remained on the Democratic line , easily won reelection . )\nRepublicans faced a similar issue in 1991 , when former Klansman David Duke made it into the gubernatorial runoff in Louisiana . While he proclaimed himself a Republican , he was roundly rejected by the party at every level\u2014the outgoing GOP governor endorsed former Governor Edwin Edwards\u2014and Duke lost overwhelmingly to Edwards . ( It \u2019 s a campaign best remembered for the bumper sticker touting the ethically challenged Edwards : \u201c Vote for the crook\u2014it \u2019 s important . \u201d )\nIt \u2019 s this example that perhaps offers the best parallel to what Trump would face as the nominee . If you want to see the most sulfurous assaults on Trump , don \u2019 t look to the editorial pages of the New York Times or the comments of MSNBC personalities ; look instead to the most prominent media voices in the conservative world : National Review , The Weekly Standard , Commentary and the columns of George Will and others . In part , they deplore his deviations from the conservative canon ; deviations that former Reagan aide and onetime FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick summarizes this way : \u201c Many of my colleagues from the Reagan administration would have a hard time pulling the lever for Trump . We weren \u2019 t just Republicans , we were conservatives . It is very difficult to square any principled theory of conservative governance with much of what Trump says . ''\nBut it \u2019 s more , much more than policy that has stirred the ire on the right : It \u2019 s the vulgarity , the fusion of ignorance and arrogance , the narcissism , the dissembling on matters great and small . The composite portrait of Trump painted by these outlets\u2014leavened only by a grudging acknowledgment that he \u2019 s touched on legitimate concerns about immigration and terror\u2014makes the idea of handing over the nuclear codes to Trump unsettling . And it makes the idea of embracing him as the alternative to Hillary Clinton somewhere between a reach and a lunge .\nWhat a Trump nomination represents , then , is a victory that leaves significant slices of the party unwilling or unable to accept the outcome . Whether he \u2019 s seen as an ideological heretic for his views on trade , taxes and government power or as a demagogue whose clownish bluster and casual bigotry make him temperamentally unfit for office , the odds on massive defections are very high .\nBut what kind of defections ? Based on the folks I \u2019 ve talked with , it could take different forms . One is a simple , quiet step away from any work on behalf of the top of the ticket . That \u2019 s what the self-described \u201c structural , sycophantic Republican \u201d \u2014will do . While he fervently hopes Trump will meet the fate of past front-runners like [ Rudy ] Giuliani and [ Newt ] Gingrich , he says that in the event of Trump \u2019 s victory , \u201c I would put all my heart , soul and energy into saving the Senate . I \u2019 d work to turn out votes so that [ Kelly ] Ayotte and [ Pat ] Toomey and [ Ron ] Johnson survive . In the end , every Republican , every conservative , knows what a disaster it would be to have Clinton as president . So the key is to make sure the checks and balances were in place . \u201d\nOthers , however , can envision much more radical outcomes . Dan Schnur spent a lifetime in the vineyards of the Republican Party , working in the Reagan and Bush presidential campaigns and serving as communications director for the California Republican Party . He \u2019 s now an independent and heads the Unruh Institute of Politics at USC . He argues \u201c a Trump nomination would virtually guarantee a third-party campaign from a more traditional Republican candidate . \u201d\nWhy a Republican ? The short answer is to save the party over the long term . \u201c It 's impossible to conceive that Republican leaders would simply forfeit their party to him , \u201d he says . \u201c Even without the formal party apparatus , they 'd need to fly their flag behind an alternative , if only to keep the GOP brand somewhat viable for the future . Otherwise , it would be toxic for a long , long time . \u201d\nRomney strategist Stu Stevens , who still believes Trump will fade\u2014indeed , that \u201c he will not win a single primary \u201d \u2014nonetheless agrees that a Trump nomination would trigger a \u201c very strong third-party effort. \u201d And Rob Stutzman , another veteran of California Republican politics\u2014he helped spearhead the 2003 recall that put Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Governor \u2019 s Mansion\u2014foresees a third party emerging , both as a safe harbor for disaffected GOP voters and to help other Republican candidates .\n\u201c I think a third candidate would be very likely on many state ballots , \u201d he says . \u201c First of all , I think most GOP voters would want an alternative to vote for out of conscience . But Trump would also be devastating to the party and other GOP candidates . A solid conservative third candidate would give options to senators like Ayotte , Johnson and [ Mark ] Kirk to run with someone else and still be opposed to Hillary . In fact , I think it \u2019 s plausible such a candidate could beat Trump in many states . \u201d\nAny candidate attempting a third-party bid would confront serious obstacles , such as getting on state ballots late in the election calendar . As for down-ballot campaigns , most state laws prohibit candidates from running on multiple lines ; so a Senate or congressional candidate who wanted to avoid association with Trump would have to abandon the GOP line to re-run with an independent presidential contender . The Stevenson example shows that leaving a major party line is fraught with peril\u2014although the write-in triumph of Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski in 2010 suggests that it can sometimes succeed .\nThe very fact that serious political thinkers are contemplating such a possibility demonstrates that when Republicans look at the perils posed by a third-party bid from Donald Trump , they may be looking in the wrong direction . It \u2019 s not Trump the Defector that could trigger the biggest threat to the party , but Trump the Nominee .",
