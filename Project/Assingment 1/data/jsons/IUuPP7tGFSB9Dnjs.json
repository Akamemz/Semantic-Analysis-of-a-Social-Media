Bush began to smile and sway to \u201c The Battle Hymn of the Republic , \u201d holding hands with both his wife and former first lady Michelle Obama during the closing moments of a memorial service for five Dallas police officers , many of his long-time detractors could only look and mock .\nAlong with his ebullient , hand-pumping sway , many criticized the color of his suit , royal blue , in contrast with the somber black that most others , women and men , wore for the service , just days after the officers were killed .\nOn traditional and social media , Mr. Bush , making a rare public appearance at the time , was once again the president of the malaprop , seemingly lacking in seriousness and curiosity , the smirking architect of a disastrous and unnecessary war .\nEven for some on the left who once decried his character as well as his policies , the former Republican president \u2019 s reputation has been burnished during the early tumultuous weeks of fellow Republican Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency .\nMany are looking back at Bush \u2019 s full-throated defense of Islam as a religion of peace in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 , praising the 43rd president \u2019 s concern for America \u2019 s Muslim residents , as incidents of violence and prejudice today become more common .\nOthers , too , have found his current defense of the news media \u2013 a constitutionally mandated check meant \u201c to hold power to account , \u201d he recently said \u2013 as a critical conservative counterpoint to the current administration \u2019 s ongoing attacks .\nAnd with the release of his best-selling book of paintings , \u201c Portraits of Courage : A Commander in Chief \u2019 s Tribute to America \u2019 s Warriors , \u201d even highbrow critics at publications such as The New Yorker have begun to reassess the complexity and depth of Bush \u2019 s character .\nThe famous left-leaning magazine described the quality of the novice painter \u2019 s work as \u201c astonishingly high. \u201d His 98 portraits of wounded veterans from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars , wrote Peter Schjeldahl , the magazine \u2019 s long-time art critic , are \u201c honestly observed and persuasively alive . \u201d\nThis reporter , too , present at that Dallas memorial service last year , was struck by the singular emotion expressed by the swaying former president , as he nearly step-marched to the famously militaristic hymn .\nThough startling , it felt appropriate \u2013 hopeful and full of a forward-looking optimism , a war-time president moved by the organ and the choir , feeling the emotion of the moment in a way others were not :\nWith a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me , As He died to make men holy , let us die to make men free !\nCritics like Mr. Schjeldahl also have used religious terms , perhaps tellingly , to assess the former president \u2019 s work : \u201c Painted atonements , \u201d he called them .\nThe New York Times , too , titled its assessment by Mimi Swartz \u201c \u2018 W. \u2019 and the Art of Redemption . \u201d\n\u201c Mr . Bush discovered what many who paint discover : that as he worked on their portraits , he came to understand his sitters , and their pain , as well as their love for one another , \u201d wrote Ms. Swartz , also the executive editor at Texas Monthly .\nWhile Bush \u2019 s sensitive and expressive paintings of wounded veterans might invite reflections on the artist \u2019 s inner life , such terms might also reflect the posture of the critics , whose generally positive assessments seem to imply a kind of impulse to forgive .\nAt the same time , however , as the former president made the rounds to promote his book , reemerging in public life after keeping a low profile during the Obama years , he has done some forgiving of his own . He \u2019 s laughed off Will Ferrell 's mocking impression of his malapropisms , saying it never bothered him \u2013 in stark contrast with Mr. Trump , who has clearly been irked by Alec Baldwin \u2019 s impression of him .\nThough Bush admits he struggled at times with the way he was portrayed in the media , he \u2019 s been outspoken about the \u201c indispensable \u201d role of the press in American democracy \u2013 another stark contrast with Trump , though he says that is not his intention .\n\u201c I spoke about the free press and people said , \u2018 You are criticizing President Trump .
