    "content": "SANTA ROSA , Calif. -- An onslaught of relentless wildfires across a wide swath of Northern California broke out almost simultaneously and then grew exponentially , swallowing up properties from wineries to trailer parks and tearing through both tiny rural towns and urban subdivisions .\nAt least 13 people are dead , at least 100 injured and at least 1,500 homes and businesses destroyed , authorities said . All three figures are expected to surge in coming days as more information is reported . Many homes and businesses were evacuated -- some just in the nick of time as flames approached .\nVice President Mike Pence , who is visiting California , announced that President Trump approved a `` major disaster declaration '' for the state to assist in the response . Pence , who received a briefing on the wildfires , said 17 were burning in Northern California .\n`` It 's heartbreaking to think that many of the fallen represent our most vulnerable , in some cases senior citizens who simply were not able to escape the flames that overcame their homes , '' Pence said . `` They 're in our prayers . ''\nTaken as a group , the wildfires are already among the deadliest in California history .\nCBS San Francisco reports the fires have consumed nearly 107,000 acres and turned whole neighborhoods into piles of ashes .\nResidents who gathered at emergency shelters and grocery stores said they were shocked by the speed and ferocity of the flames .

They sent smoke as far south as San Francisco , about 60 miles away .\nSonoma County said it has received more than 100 missing-person reports as family and friends scramble to locate loved ones .\nThe reports have come via calls to a hotline the county set up for the missing , according to Scott Alonso , communications director for Sonoma County .\nIt 's possible that many or most of the missing are safe but simply ca n't be reached because of the widespread loss of cell service and other communications .\nAs of Monday evening , 99,000 Pacific Gas & Electric customers were without power because of the wildfires in Northern California , a majority in Napa and Sonoma counties , PG & E officials told CBS San Francisco .\nIn addition , PG & E crews had shut off gas service to about 26,000 customers as a precaution because flames can damage a gas pipe or meter , the station said .\nWorkers in the renowned Northern California wine country picked through charred debris and struggled with what to do after wildfires swept through lush vineyards , destroying at least two wineries and damaging many others .\nThe wind-driven wildfires came as Napa and Sonoma counties were finishing highly anticipated harvests of wine grapes . Monday normally would have found workers picking and processing the ripe grapes to make chardonnay and other wines .\nInstead , melted and blackened wine bottles decorated the ruined Signorello Estate winery in Napa Valley . People at Paradise Ridge Winery in Sonoma County posted photos of debris and haze , saying they were `` heartbroken to share the news '' that the winery had burned .\nMuch of the damage in Northern California was in Santa Rosa , a far larger and more developed city than usually finds itself at the mercy of a wildfire .
