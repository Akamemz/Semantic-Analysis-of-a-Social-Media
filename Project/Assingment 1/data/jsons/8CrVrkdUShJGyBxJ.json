    "content": "Last year , several women came forward publicly to say Joe Biden had kissed or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable .\nOne of them was Tara Reade , who said Biden used to \u201c put his hand on my shoulder and run his finger up my neck \u201d when she worked in his Senate office in 1993 .\nReade now says there was more to her experience with Biden . In an interview with podcast host Katie Halper , which aired Wednesday , Reade says Biden sexually assaulted her , pushing her against a wall and penetrating her with his fingers . When she pulled away , she says , he said he thought she \u201c liked \u201d him .\nThis is a story that @ ReadeAlexandra has been trying to tell since it happened in 1993 . It 's a story about sexual assault , retaliation and silencing . # meToo https : //t.co/yHz3iFi9a5 \u2014 Katie Halper ( @ kthalps ) March 25 , 2020\n\u201c It was like an earthquake , \u201d Reade told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I was so excited about this job , \u201d she said . \u201c I thought this was my future , and so when that happened I felt , it \u2019 s like someone pulling the rug out . \u201d\nBiden \u2019 s campaign on Friday denied Reade \u2019 s allegation . \u201c Women have a right to tell their story , and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims , \u201d deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement . \u201c We encourage them to do so , because these accusations are false . \u201d\nLast year , a few days after women began coming forward with reports of inappropriate touching by him , the former vice president issued a statement saying that \u201c social norms have begun to change \u201d around people \u2019 s personal space and that he would be more mindful of boundaries in the future .\nReade says she did not speak publicly about her allegation of sexual assault before in part because no one else witnessed the incident , while she says others saw Biden harassing her . She also says she faced online harassment after coming forward last year . As Ryan Grim reports at the Intercept , journalists and others questioned her credibility , pointing out favorable comments she had made about Vladimir Putin in a 2018 Medium post , perhaps implying that she was a Russian plant .\nRead this love fest for Putin by Alexandra Tara Reade .\nIs this the same person who just made an accusation against @ JoeBiden ?\nIf so \u2014 this game \u2019 s up.https : //t.co/B4CShgbiYp \u2014 Richard W. Painter ( @ RWPUSA ) April 4 , 2019\nReade \u2019 s allegation initially received little coverage outside of left-wing media ( and some media outlets on the right ) . But the hashtags # IBelieveTara and # TimesUpBiden started to pick up steam on Twitter earlier this week , as many wondered why it was not getting more attention .\nOne of the only news source to report on @ JoeBiden 's sexual assault allegations is Yahoo . If you supported the # metoo movement , yet think these allegations are false and `` Russian plants '' , you are putting women down . You 're not a feminist # IBelieveTarahttps : //t.co/minMJzqy5n \u2014 Elliott Crow ( @ crow_elliott ) March 27 , 2020\nThe allegation has also inflamed tensions between supporters of Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders . Reade told \u2588\u2588\u2588 she initially supported Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president ( and also supported Marianne Williamson ) but now supports Sanders . And her report has led to allegations by some that she or her supporters are simply trying to throw the election to Sanders \u2014 or even to President Donald Trump .\nReade acknowledges the concern that her allegation could benefit Trump in the general election , since Biden is likely to be the Democratic nominee . Trump himself has been accused of sexual harassment , assault , or other misconduct by more than 20 women , and is being sued for defamation by two of them .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want Trump to be president , \u201d Reade told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . But , she said , she won \u2019 t be voting for Biden . \u201c If he \u2019 s my president , I just can \u2019 t fathom it . \u201d\nMultiple women have said Biden touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable\nReports of \u201c creepy \u201d behavior by Biden , like standing too close to women for photo opportunities , have circulated for years , treated by some as little more than a joke . But those reports received more serious attention after Lucy Flores , a former candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada , wrote in a March 2019 essay at The Cut that Biden had kissed her on the back of the head at a campaign event in 2014 .\n\u201c I couldn \u2019 t move and I couldn \u2019 t say anything , \u201d Flores wrote . \u201c I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me . \u201d\nAfter that , other women spoke out to report similar experiences . Amy Lappos , for example , said that at a 2009 fundraiser , Biden touched her face and rubbed noses with her . And in April , Reade told the Union , a California newspaper , that Biden touched her several times in ways that made her feel uncomfortable , and that her duties in his Senate office were reduced after she refused to serve drinks at an event . She said he wanted her there because he liked her legs .\nBiden did not specifically respond to Reade \u2019 s allegation , but in a video statement in early April , he said , \u201c I shake hands , I hug people , I grab men and women by the shoulders and say , \u2018 You can do this. \u2019 \u201d However , he also said that \u201c the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset \u201d and pledged to change his behavior .\nSince then , the allegations by women have not come up much on the debate stage or campaign trail , and Biden is likely to be the Democratic nominee for president this year .\nBut on Tuesday , Reade \u2019 s allegation came to the fore again when Grim reported on its general outline in the Intercept . Then , on Wednesday , Halper released her interview on her podcast , The Katie Halper Show . In it , Reade says that in 1993 , when she was in her 20s and working for Biden , another staffer asked her to bring him a gym bag at the US Capitol .\nWhen she did , she says , he pushed her up against a wall in a secluded area , began kissing her , and reached under her skirt to penetrate her with his fingers . After she pulled away , she says he responded with something along the lines of , \u201c Come on , man , I heard you liked me. \u201d Reade said Biden also said something that sticks with her today : \u201c You \u2019 re nothing to me . \u201d\nThose words affected her \u201c almost more than the assault , \u201d she said , because she had respected him so much before .\nIn addition to Bedingfield \u2019 s statement , the Biden campaign also released a statement from Marianne Baker , an executive assistant to Biden from 1982 to 2000 . \u201c In all my years working for Senator Biden , I never once witnessed , or heard of , or received , any reports of inappropriate conduct , period \u2014 not from Ms. Reade , not from anyone , \u201d Baker said . \u201c These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades . \u201d\nReade , for her part , said she did not include the assault accusation when she spoke out last year because the harassment was easier to talk about , in part because others had witnessed it .\n\u201c I wanted to share the whole thing , but at the same time I was too scared , \u201d she said . \u201c I just wasn \u2019 t quite ready . \u201d\nSince then , Grim has contacted Reade \u2019 s friend and brother , both of whom say she told them about the alleged sexual assault by Biden in 1993 .\n\u201c Woefully , I did not encourage her to follow up , \u201d her brother told the Intercept . \u201c I wasn \u2019 t one of her better advocates . I said let it go , move on , guys are idiots . \u201d\nEarlier this year , though , Reade decided she wanted to speak publicly about the assault allegation . She reached out to Time \u2019 s Up , an anti-harassment organization launched as the Me Too movement rose to prominence , to see if she could get legal representation . However , Grim reports , the organization said it could not support her because Biden is a candidate for federal office and doing so could jeopardize its nonprofit status .\nThe Time \u2019 s Up Legal Defense Fund , which is administered by the National Women \u2019 s Law Center , has countered that it did offer some help to Reade . Uma Iyer , the center \u2019 s vice president of communications , said in a statement on Friday that \u201c we helped Ms. Reade as much as we could , within the guardrails that necessarily shape our work. \u201d The organization \u201c provided her with the information to connect to attorneys and other resources \u201d as it has done for many others , Iyer said ; however , \u201c we informed Ms. Reade of our inability to fund legal and PR fees for her due to our 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status . \u201d\n\u201c The TIME \u2019 S UP Legal Defense Fund is the first-of-its-kind entity , and above all else , we prioritize survivors and their quest to seek justice \u2013 but we can not do that if our nonprofit status is in any way threatened , \u201d Iyer said .\nUnable to get legal help , Reade told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , she decided to write about her experience on Medium in January . She did not state an allegation of sexual assault then , but said that \u201c I have not told the whole story of what occurred between Joe Biden and myself. \u201d That led to interest from some smaller media outlets and the interview with Halper , she said . \u201c I kind of feel like a weight was lifted off when I did that interview , \u201d Reade said . \u201c Now I \u2019 m ready to walk away , and now everyone wants to talk to me . \u201d\nPart of the reason Reade sought legal help , she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , was that she faced harassment when she initially came forward last year . She also faced scrutiny into her background . In particular , critics pointed to that now-deleted 2018 Medium post in which Reade called Putin \u201c a compassionate , caring , visionary leader \u201d and said , \u201c To President Putin , I say keep your eyes to the beautiful future and maybe , just maybe America will come to see Russia as I do , with eyes of love . \u201d\nIn the same post , she wrote that she left government work in her 20s in part because \u201c I love Russia with all my heart \u201d and \u201c I could not stand to watch the deception and xenophobia that came from my own American government . \u201d\nReade told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that when she wrote the praise of Putin , she had \u201c watched a bunch of Noam Chomsky \u201d and was working on a novel set in Russia . She says she no longer feels the same way about Putin since learning more about domestic violence in Russia .\nBut \u201c this conversation isn \u2019 t about Russia , \u201d she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Joe Biden wasn \u2019 t asking me about my feelings about Russia when he had his hands where they weren \u2019 t supposed to be . \u201d\nSome have dismissed Reade \u2019 s allegation because Reade is a Sanders supporter and because it was first publicized by left-wing outlets . As of Friday morning , the story had been covered by the Intercept , Halper ( a vocal Sanders supporter ) , and Refinery29 , but not by the New York Times or Washington Post .\nTo that , Reade said , \u201c Of course , if it \u2019 s a choice between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden , from my perspective , I \u2019 m going to pick Bernie Sanders , \u201d and added that Sanders supporters were kind to her when she was harassed online after coming forward last year .\nThis time , social media conversation may have helped bring attention to Reade \u2019 s story , with # IBelieveTara and # TimesUpBiden trending this week .\nStill time to vote for the non-creepy , non-harassing Presidential candidate . # TimesUpBiden https : //t.co/NSLJ6RlJr2 \u2014 Prerna Lal ( @ prernaplal ) March 27 , 2020\nThe current social media reactions to Reade \u2019 s assault allegation could be broken down into several camps : those who cite her praise of Russia and imply that she or her supporters are working on behalf of Sanders , Trump , or Putin ; and those who cite the need to believe people who come forward to report sexual misconduct .\nReade \u2019 s report comes at a time when Biden is likely to face Trump in the general election . Before Trump was elected , numerous women had accused him of sexual assault and harassment , and he was caught on tape bragging about his ability to grab women \u201c by the pussy. \u201d He was elected anyway .\nWhile Reade is no fan of Trump , she said she is disturbed by the fact that Biden is \u201c running on a platform of character . \u201d\n\u201c The Uncle Joe thing , I never saw that , \u201d she said . \u201c He was very strong , he was very powerful , and he knew it , and he used his power to get what he wanted . \u201d\nUpdate March 27 : This story has been updated to include a statement from the Biden campaign received after publication time . It has also been updated to include a statement from Uma Iyer , vice president of communications for the National Women \u2019 s Law Center .",
