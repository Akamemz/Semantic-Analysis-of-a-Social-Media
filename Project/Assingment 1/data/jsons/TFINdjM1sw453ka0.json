    "content": "On Tuesday , Hillary Clinton 's campaign revealed her plan for tackling autism . That in and of itself is n't huge news . Clinton has tons of plans : She 's got a plan to cure Alzheimer 's disease , a plan to crack down on campus sexual assault , a plan to reduce out-of-pocket health costs , and many , many more . But the nature of the plan is news . Some of the major elements of the plan include :\nWorking through Medicaid and Obamacare exchange plans to increase autism screenings at 18 and 24 months\nPushing states to require Obamacare plans to cover autism services , including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and services that teach skills for daily living to autistic children and adults ; and having the Department of Health and Human Services aggressively monitor states to make sure their Medicaid plans are paying for these services too\nPassing the Keeping All Students Safe Act , which would ban mechanical and chemical restraints , as well as physical restraints that restrict breathing ; only allow seclusion or restraint when there 's an imminent risk of a student causing physical injury to herself or others ; and otherwise limits coercive practices that are often used against autistic youth\nRequiring a post-graduation transition plan for every autistic student aging out of school services , and setting up a public-private partnership with hundreds of employers to give autistic young adults job opportunities\nFunding pilot programs to expand employment for autistic adults , funding community housing with support services for autistic youth and adults , and working with states to expand funding for caregivers\nConducting the first study of the incidence of autism among adults\nThe major throughline in each element of the agenda is a desire to help autistic individuals : to make schools and workplaces more accessible for and understanding of them , to prevent them from being mistreated , to fund housing , caregiving , and other services they need .\nPoliticians ' efforts on autism have historically focused on researching the condition 's causes and ways to prevent it . It seems obvious that a presidential campaign 's `` autism plan '' should focus on helping autistic people , but for years it has n't been obvious . That the Democratic frontrunner 's plan is about helping autistic people , rather than `` curing '' them or eliminating their condition , is actually quite a radical shift .\nIt 's helpful to contrast Clinton 's agenda with that of the Combating Autism Act , which George W. Bush signed into law in 2006 . The first problem with the act was its name , which implied that the goal of public policy should be to stamp out autism , rather than helping autists .\nThis is troublesome both because it does nothing for autistic people alive today , and because many on the autism spectrum ( myself included ) do n't view autism as wholly negative and argue that society could benefit from acknowledging and celebrating neurodiversity . We do n't want autism to be `` combated '' ; we want autistic people to be supported . That means government policy that provides services that enable people on every point in the autism spectrum to learn , work , and find acceptance in their communities .\nBut the law was also troubling because of how some $ 945 million in federal spending authorized by the act was allocated . A 2013 report from the Government Accountability Office found that of 1,206 autism research projects funded by the federal government from 2008 to 2012 ( after the Combating Autism Act was passed ) , a little under half focused on either the biology behind autism or on the condition 's causes . By contrast , only 21 percent researched treatment and interventions .\nWhat 's more , an analysis by the Autism Self-Advocacy Network found that only about 1.5 percent of the National Institutes of Health 's spending on autism research goes to the needs of autistic adults , and only 2.4 percent goes to improving services . Hillary Clinton was very much on board with this approach and language , and in the 2008 election cycle spoke of the need to face the `` rising tide '' of autism and bragged about co-sponsoring the Combating Autism Act .\nThere 's nothing wrong with learning more about the biology of autism , and there 's nothing wrong with trying to figure out how to treat or reverse its more debilitating effects ( life self-harm ) and co-morbid conditions ( autists are at elevated risk of epilepsy , for example ) . But many autism advocates have argued that this funding would be better spent researching how to help autistic people alive now . That could bring more immediate , tangible benefits to people on the autism spectrum .\n`` Have we gotten everything that we wanted ? Of course not . Is this light years ahead of where we were in the last campaign cycle ? Clearly ! ''\nClinton 's new proposal is a step toward doing that . She focuses almost exclusively on improving treatment of and services for autistic people . She highlights autistic adults , who have traditionally been neglected in public policy discussions around autism . While she calls for an increase in research funding , she emphasizes that it must fund `` a range of autism-related research , '' including `` studies that improve the quality of patient services for people with autism '' \u2014 not just biological research .\nShe also makes a point of calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to accurately measure the incidence of autism among adults , something that the UK has done but the US thus far has not .\nIn talking about treatment , the plan specifically mentions `` behavioral and developmental interventions '' ; the including of `` developmental '' is meant to indicate that Clinton does n't only want to cover applied behavioral analysis , a treatment that 's highly controversial among autistic people .
