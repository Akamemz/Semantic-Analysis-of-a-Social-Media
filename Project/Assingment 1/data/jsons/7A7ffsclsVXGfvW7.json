'' For most of the campaign so far , the criticism has fairly centered on her refusal to take positions on some core Democratic issues . Now she 's taking flak for getting too deep in the weeds in the speech she gave at her campaign 's first big rally in New York . But the truth is , Clinton pretty much nailed the vision thing on Saturday .\nShe 's generally her own worst enemy on that score , constitutionally unable to stop talking about the trees long enough to get her audience to focus on the forest . And that tendency was in full effect again on Saturday .\nIn Hillary speech , best thing : Flashes of humor , mother 's story .

And she was willing to get more specific on how to do it . So anyone who argues Clinton came up short in articulating a vision for a different version of America was n't paying attention .\nThere were more than a dozen policy proposals in Clinton 's speech \u2014 from incentives for businesses that plow profits into benefits for workers to universal preschool \u2014 and almost all of them boiled down to one basic idea : America will thrive if its economic system is fair and inclusive .\nThat 's been the standard-issue Democratic argument since the days of Franklin Roosevelt , whom Clinton quoted as she stood in a park named for his 1941 `` Four Freedoms '' speech .
