    "content": "Media have tremendous power in setting cultural guidelines and in shaping political discourse . It is essential that news media , along with other institutions , are challenged to be \u2588\u2588\u2588 and accurate . The first step in challenging biased news coverage is documenting bias . Here are some questions to ask yourself about newspaper , TV and radio news .\nBe aware of the political perspective of the sources used in a story . Media over-rely on \u201c official \u201d ( government , corporate and establishment think tank ) sources . For instance , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found that in 40 months of Nightline programming , the most frequent guests were Henry Kissinger , Alexander Haig , Elliott Abrams and Jerry Falwell . Progressive and public interest voices were grossly underrepresented .\nTo portray issues fairly and accurately , media must broaden their spectrum of sources . Otherwise , they serve merely as megaphones for those in power\nCount the number of corporate and government sources versus the number of progressive , public interest , female and minority voices . Demand mass media expand their rolodexes ; better yet , give them lists of progressive and public interest experts in the community .\nWhat is the race and gender diversity at the news outlet you watch compared to the communities it serves ? How many producers , editors or decision-makers at news outlets are women , people of color or openly gay or lesbian ? In order to fairly represent different communities , news outlets should have members of those communities in decision-making positions .\nHow many of the experts these news outlets cite are women and people of color ? \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s 40-month survey of Nightline found its U.S. guests to be 92 percent white and 89 percent male . A similar survey of PBS \u2019 s NewsHour found its guestlist was 90 percent white and 87 percent male .\nDemand that the media you consume reflect the diversity of the public they serve . Call or write media outlets every time you see an all-male or all-white panel of experts discussing issues that affect women and people of color .\nPolitical coverage often focuses on how issues affect politicians or corporate executives rather than those directly affected by the issue . For example , many stories on parental notification of abortion emphasized the \u201c tough choice \u201d confronting male politicians while quoting no women under 18\u2013those with the most at stake in the debate . Economics coverage usually looks at how events impact stockholders rather than workers or consumers .\nDemand that those affected by the issue have a voice in coverage .\nDo media hold some people to one standard while using a different standard for other groups ? Youth of color who commit crimes are referred to as \u201c superpredators , \u201d whereas adult criminals who commit white-collar crimes are often portrayed as having been tragically been led astray . Think tanks partly funded by unions are often identified as \u201c labor-backed \u201d while think tanks heavily funded by business interests are usually not identified as \u201c corporate-backed . \u201d\nExpose the double standard by coming up with a parallel example or citing similar stories that were covered differently .\nDoes coverage of the drug crisis focus almost exclusively on African Americans , despite the fact that the vast majority of drug users are white ? Does coverage of women on welfare focus overwhelmingly on African-American women , despite the fact that the majority of welfare recipients are not black ? Are lesbians portrayed as \u201c man-hating \u201d and gay men portrayed as \u201c sexual predators \u201d ( even though a child is 100 times more likely to be molested by a family member than by an unrelated gay adult\u2014Denver Post , 9/28/92 ) ?\nEducate journalists about misconceptions involved in stereotypes , and about how stereotypes characterize individuals unfairly .\nOften the most important message of a story is not explicitly stated . For instance , in coverage of women on welfare , the age at which a woman had her first child will often be reported\u2014the implication being that the woman \u2019 s sexual \u201c promiscuity , \u201d rather than institutional economic factors , are responsible for her plight .\nCoverage of rape trials will often focus on a woman \u2019 s sexual history as though it calls her credibility into question . After the arrest of William Kennedy Smith , a New York Times article ( 4/17/91 ) dredged up a host of irrelevant personal details about his accuser , including the facts that she had skipped classes in the 9th grade , had received several speeding tickets and-when on a date-had talked to other men .\nWhen media adopt loaded terminology , they help shape public opinion . For instance , media often use the right-wing buzzword \u201c racial preference \u201d to refer to affirmative action programs . Polls show that this decision makes a huge difference in how the issue is perceived : A 1992 Louis Harris poll , for example , found that 70 percent said they favored \u201c affirmative action \u201d while only 46 percent favored \u201c racial preference programs . \u201d\nChallenge the assumption directly . Often bringing assumptions to the surface will demonstrate their absurdity . Most reporters , for example , will not say directly that a woman deserved to be raped because of what she was wearing .\nDemonstrate how the language chosen gives people an inaccurate impression of the issue , program or community .\nCoverage of so-called \u201c reverse discrimination \u201d usually fails to focus on any of the institutional factors which gives power to prejudice\u2014such as larger issues of economic inequality and institutional racism .

It is essential that news media, along with other institutions, are challenged to be fair and accurate. The first step in challenging biased news coverage is documenting bias. Here are some questions to ask yourself about newspaper, TV and radio news.\n\nWho are the sources?\n\nBe aware of the political perspective of the sources used in a story. Media over-rely on \u201cofficial\u201d (government, corporate and establishment think tank) sources. For instance, FAIR found that in 40 months of Nightline programming, the most frequent guests were Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, Elliott Abrams and Jerry Falwell. Progressive and public interest voices were grossly underrepresented.\n\nTo portray issues fairly and accurately, media must broaden their spectrum of sources.

Demand mass media expand their rolodexes; better yet, give them lists of progressive and public interest experts in the community.\n\nIs there a lack of diversity?\n\nWhat is the race and gender diversity at the news outlet you watch compared to the communities it serves? How many producers, editors or decision-makers at news outlets are women, people of color or openly gay or lesbian? In order to fairly represent different communities, news outlets should have members of those communities in decision-making positions.\n\nHow many of the experts these news outlets cite are women and people of color? FAIR\u2019s 40-month survey of Nightline found its U.S. guests to be 92 percent white and 89 percent male.

Call or write media outlets every time you see an all-male or all-white panel of experts discussing issues that affect women and people of color.\n\nFrom whose point of view is the news reported?\n\nPolitical coverage often focuses on how issues affect politicians or corporate executives rather than those directly affected by the issue. For example, many stories on parental notification of abortion emphasized the \u201ctough choice\u201d confronting male politicians while quoting no women under 18\u2013those with the most at stake in the debate. Economics coverage usually looks at how events impact stockholders rather than workers or consumers.\n\nDemand that those affected by the issue have a voice in coverage.\n\nAre there double standards?\n\nDo media hold some people to one standard while using a different standard for other groups? Youth of color who commit crimes are referred to as \u201csuperpredators,\u201d whereas adult criminals who commit white-collar crimes are often portrayed as having been tragically been led astray. Think tanks partly funded by unions are often identified as \u201clabor-backed\u201d while think tanks heavily funded by business interests are usually not identified as \u201ccorporate-backed.\u201d\n\nExpose the double standard by coming up with a parallel example or citing similar stories that were covered differently.\n\nDo stereotypes skew coverage?\n\nDoes coverage of the drug crisis focus almost exclusively on African Americans, despite the fact that the vast majority of drug users are white? Does coverage of women on welfare focus overwhelmingly on African-American women, despite the fact that the majority of welfare recipients are not black? Are lesbians portrayed as \u201cman-hating\u201d and gay men portrayed as \u201csexual predators\u201d (even though a child is 100 times more likely to be molested by a family member than by an unrelated gay adult\u2014Denver Post, 9/28/92)?\n\nEducate journalists about misconceptions involved in stereotypes, and about how stereotypes characterize individuals unfairly.\n\nWhat are the unchallenged assumptions?\n\nOften the most important message of a story is not explicitly stated. For instance, in coverage of women on welfare, the age at which a woman had her first child will often be reported\u2014the implication being that the woman\u2019s sexual \u201cpromiscuity,\u201d rather than institutional economic factors, are responsible for her plight.\n\nCoverage of rape trials will often focus on a woman\u2019s sexual history as though it calls her credibility into question. After the arrest of William Kennedy Smith, a New York Times article (4/17/91) dredged up a host of irrelevant personal details about his accuser, including the facts that she had skipped classes in the 9th grade, had received several speeding tickets and-when on a date-had talked to other men.\n\nIs the language loaded?\n\nWhen media adopt loaded terminology, they help shape public opinion. For instance, media often use the right-wing buzzword \u201cracial preference\u201d to refer to affirmative action programs. Polls show that this decision makes a huge difference in how the issue is perceived: A 1992 Louis Harris poll, for example, found that 70 percent said they favored \u201caffirmative action\u201d while only 46 percent favored \u201cracial preference programs.\u201d\n\nChallenge the assumption directly. Often bringing assumptions to the surface will demonstrate their absurdity. Most reporters, for example, will not say directly that a woman deserved to be raped because of what she was wearing.\n\nDemonstrate how the language chosen gives people an inaccurate impression of the issue, program or community.\n\nIs there a lack of context?\n\nCoverage of so-called \u201creverse discrimination\u201d usually fails to focus on any of the institutional factors which gives power to prejudice\u2014such as larger issues of economic inequality and institutional racism.

Newspaper articles on the most widely read pages (the front pages and the editorial pages) and lead stories on television and radio will have the greatest influence on public opinion.",
