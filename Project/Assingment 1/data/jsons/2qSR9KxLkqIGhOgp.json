To make the payments , the federal government must determine whether an inmate is definitely or possibly in the country illegally . FAIR used the number to then calculate overall incarceration rates .\nThe method is not without controversy . One analyst dismissed the calculations , saying SCAAP data counts are not comparable to other incarceration counts .\nBut FAIR says the SCAAP numbers are the best calculation because they focus on those known to be arrested on criminal charges and whom federal officials have concluded are in the country illegally .\nIn the 10 states FAIR selected , they determined that illegal immigrants ended up behind bars at higher rates , per capita .\n\u201c This study should put to rest , once and for all , the notion that illegal aliens commit crimes at a lower rate than legal residents , \u201d FAIR President Dan Stein said . \u201c By focusing on states with significant illegal alien populations and that consistently report to the SCAAP program , FAIR \u2019 s study refutes this erroneous claim . \u201d\nIllegal immigration and its nexus to crime , long a controversial subject , has gained even more importance in recent weeks as President Trump has pushed for stiffer border security \u2014 including a border wall \u2014 that he says would \u201c bring crime down in half in our country . \u201d\nFAIR , which advocates for a crackdown on illegal immigration , doesn \u2019 t quite answer that question , but it does attempt to get at the overall rates of criminal behavior of people whom the government has confirmed are in the country illegally , and then to compare that to the rate of criminality by the rest of the population .\nThe group took a snapshot of the prison population in a state , using data from the Prison Policy Initiative , then subtracted the number of illegal immigrants the federal government paid to incarcerate in a year . That provided numbers for both an illegal immigrant prison population and everyone else .\nFAIR then compared those with estimates for the overall residential numbers for each state .\nFor Arizona , analysts used 10,300 confirmed or suspected illegal immigrants for which the federal government reimbursed the state and counties in 2016 . They subtracted that from an overall prison and jail population to get a non-illegal-immigrant population of 46,700 .\nEach of those numbers was stacked up against total populations . FAIR estimates that Arizona has an illegal immigrant population of 365,950 and non-illegal-immigrant population of 6.7 million . Incarceration rates were 2.815 percent for illegal immigrants and 0.702 percent for all others .\nThat means one out of every 35 illegal immigrants in Arizona was in state prison or jail in 2016 , which was the highest rate of any of the states they studied .\nThey did the same calculations for nine other states that have strong SCAAP reporting and account for about three-quarters of the estimated illegal immigrant population in the country .\nIn each of the 10 states , they found illegal immigrants incarcerated at higher rates . The gap was biggest in New Jersey , with an illegal immigration jail rate 440 percent higher , followed by Arizona , Oregon , Washington and California in the top five .\nNew York and Nevada came next , with rates at least 160 percent higher , followed by Florida , Texas and New Mexico , with the smallest gap \u2014 though even there , illegal immigrants were 42 percent more likely to be in prison or jail than the citizen and legal resident population .\nJohn R. Lott Jr. , president of the Crime Prevention Research Center , said FAIR \u2019 s research gets around two issues that plague a lot of other research on illegal immigrant crime rates .\nMany studies rely on survey data , such as the census , to ask about criminal pasts . But Mr. Lott said that if people are reluctant to take part in the census because they fear answering citizenship questions , then they might refuse to take part or might shade their answers if they are illegal immigrants with criminal records . He said that would skew the results of crime rate studies based on census data .\nAnother type of study looks at all immigrants combined , without dividing out legal residents and illegal immigrants .\nMr. Lott \u2019 s research , using data from Arizona that differentiates between immigrants , found that legal immigrants had the lowest rates of incarceration , with citizens in the middle and illegal immigrants with the highest rates of crime .\n\u201c FAIR here has stuff from multiple states indicating that if in fact they \u2019 re right on all this , it \u2019 s pretty much systematically true across all prison systems and jail systems , \u201d he said .\nBut Alex Nowrasteh , a senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute , questioned FAIR \u2019 s methodology .
