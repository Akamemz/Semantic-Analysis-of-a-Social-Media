The bad news : Black defendants are still getting longer sentences than white ones for the same crimes \u2014 and the racial gap is actually growing .\nThat 's the conclusion of a new study conducted for the Bureau of Justice Statistics , based on data from 2005 \u2014 after a Supreme Court decision gave judges more flexibility in sentencing \u2014 through 2012 . But it 's certainly not the first study to find that even when the criminal justice system as a whole is getting more lenient , that leniency varies depending on the race of the defendant . And it 's a big challenge for criminal justice reformers \u2014 who end up caught in a terrible double bind .\nJudges are using their discretion to help white defendants more than black ones\nAfter someone 's convicted of a crime in federal court , the judge determines a prison sentence by consulting a set of federal guidelines . The guidelines consider a bunch of factors related to the defendant 's criminal history and the seriousness of the crime , plug them into some complicated calculations , and spit out a recommended range for the prison sentence to fall into .\nThis study looked at how judges responded to those recommendations . What they found was not great . For pretty much every type of crime , white offenders who get a certain recommended sentence ( under the guidelines ) end up getting a shorter sentence than black offenders who get the same recommendation . And the difference between white and black sentences has grown since 2005 .\nHow big the disparity is depends on the type of crime and how severe it is . For a relatively minor drug offense that does n't involve weapons \u2014 something where the recommended sentence might be around two and a half years \u2014 a black man and a white man would actually get around the same sentence in 2005 . In 2012 , the black man would be sentenced to about two months longer than the white man would .\nFor a relatively minor crime that does n't involve drugs but does involve weapons \u2014 something where the recommended sentence might be a little over four years \u2014 a black man would have gotten about five months longer in prison than a white man in 2005 . In 2012 , the black man would get a sentence over a year and a half longer than his white counterpart .\nAs judges get more discretion , this is becoming a bigger problem\nThe sentencing guidelines , like the name says , are supposed to be guidelines . But for decades , most judges followed them as rules , and rarely ( if ever ) gave out sentences that were higher or lower than the guidebook recommended . In 2005 , the Supreme Court clarified that judges really could go above or below the recommended sentence if they thought it was appropriate for the case . ( A second decision , at the end of 2007 , clarified that judges were supposed to calculate the sentencing range recommended by the guidelines , but could then decide whether to follow it or not . ) That 's why this study 's time period matters : It 's looking at the era in which judges have had more power in sentencing .\nIt 's become incredibly common for judges to hand out shorter prison sentences than the guidelines recommend . Over the summer of 2015 , judges actually handed out `` below-guideline '' sentences in a majority of all cases ( 50.6 percent ) ; they handed out `` above-guideline '' sentences only 2.6 percent of the time .\nWhen judges get to decide whether someone deserves to get a shorter sentence than the guidelines recommend , they might find some kinds of defendants more deserving than others \u2014 based on factors that happen to be racially skewed ( like education or employment ) , or based on plain old implicit racial bias . It 's hard to judge this just by looking at average sentence length for a given crime , just because there 's so much variation in the recommended sentences for each crime . Two people can be convicted of robbery , but if one of them has a long criminal history and the other one was coerced into the robbery by an abusive boyfriend , federal policy says the second one should get a shorter sentence for it .\nTo actually calculate whether judges are using their discretion to favor white defendants more than black ones requires some serious statistical analysis . But other researchers who 've done that analysis , just like the authors of the new study , have found that racial disparities have persisted .\nInterestingly , the researchers found that prosecutors ' behavior did n't appear to change much over this time . The difference was because judges had more power to use their discretion , and they appear to have exercised that discretion to help white defendants more than black ones .\nThe sad irony is that criminal justice observers have known this for a long time : The more that sentences are left up to a judge to determine , the more racial bias will come into play . This was a big criticism back in the 1960s and 1970s , when sentencing was so all over the place that a judge in California could sentence someone to a single day , or to years , for the same crime .\nReformers told legislators and governments that they needed to set clearer standards for how long a sentence should be for a given crime . One result was the development of the federal sentencing guidelines to begin with ; another result was the use of mandatory minimum sentences that judges could n't go below if they wanted to .\nIf you 're familiar with mass incarceration , you know where this is going . Both of those policies have led to people going to prison for far longer than they used to , because stiff sentences were imposed across the board .
