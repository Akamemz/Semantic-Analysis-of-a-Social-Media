    "content": "Adrian Carrasquillo is a national political reporter covering 2020 and Latino issues who has written for NBC News , BuzzFeed , and The New Republic .\nAs a reporter , I \u2019 ve talked to immigration activists for the better part of a decade . They don \u2019 t often cry , at least not in front of me .\nBut all day on Sunday , the day after the shooting in El Paso , hardened advocates became emotional while explaining what it \u2019 s like to live in the United States after a killer drove 10 hours to kill Mexicans , Latinos and immigrants . The next day I still felt restless after a conversation with a friend . She had been crying because her husband overheard white men at the community pool remarking that while they didn \u2019 t agree with the killings \u2014 how magnanimous \u2014 they , too , didn \u2019 t want white people to be \u201c wiped out \u201d and for Hispanics to \u201c take over . \u201d\nWhere was this said ? The deeply Republican city of Los Angeles , of course .\n\u201c He openly was discussing this like it was sports talk , \u201d she told me , furious . \u201c After 20 people are dead . \u201d\nThe news media \u2019 s approach to its coverage of the El Paso shooting has obscured what made it uniquely horrifying for the Latino community . From the moment the shots were fired , this was a trend story : Another mass shooting , so let \u2019 s restart our debates about gun control and mental illness , maybe pull up some video game b-roll . And after so many shootings in recent years , journalists have decided it \u2019 s wrong to give too much attention to the shooter , so we downplayed his name and face , his bizarre and hateful manifesto .\nBut the media \u2019 s desire to erase the shooter and his ideology ended up erasing his victims and their community , too . While the news media successfully portrayed this shooting as part of a national epidemic of mass killings , we failed to accurately convey how this one was different . The visceral emotions of the Latinos I spoke with should have been\u2014and should still be\u2014front and center .\nAfter years of covering immigration , I thought I understood how immigrants felt , because of our similar backgrounds . But I didn \u2019 t , not really . I \u2019 m Puerto Rican and Ecuadorian and from New York . Like many Hispanics , I \u2019 ve known undocumented people , but while I could empathize with immigrants going through hardship , that \u2019 s not the same as sharing their experience .\nThis killer expressly traveled to a city filled with Mexicans and immigrants . This is new territory . The El Paso shooting isn \u2019 t just a sad moment that will pass , but the culmination of an anti-immigrant four decades in politics that ratcheted up in the 1990s and 2000s and has become only louder , emboldened and unchecked by American leaders , led by the president but certainly not just by him .\nOf the 49 victims three years ago at Pulse , a gay nightclub in Orlando , 90 percent were Latino . Almost half were Puerto Rican . Others were Colombians , Mexicans and Dominicans . But what makes El Paso different is that people were targeted , not by someone pledging themselves to ISIS , but to white supremacy .\n\u201c Now Hispanic Americans have been targeted , some who are immigrants , and all who have limited political power , \u201d I wrote on Twitter on Tuesday . \u201c That \u2019 s what \u2019 s going on . And people are terrified . \u201d\nI received more than 160 private messages on Twitter along with some emails and texts from people who told me they didn \u2019 t have a safe space to share these stories .\nThey were from immigrants and people born in this country just like me . They were from older people scared for their children and grandchildren , but also from teenagers , heartbreakingly young teens of 16 and 17 , who shouldn \u2019 t have to worry that someone is going to tell them to \u201c go back to Mexico \u201d and threaten to attack them while walking their dog if they don \u2019 t cross the street now . They were from people in red states and blue states , the united states of hating immigrants and people who just look like they might be . They were from biracial people , but also from white people who explained that their sister had married a Latino man and that means they have two Latina nieces , or a grandson , and they \u2019 re scared of the ways their neighbors might try to hurt them \u2014 with words they won \u2019 t forget or violence that could take them away forever .\nA Latina in a predominantly Hispanic border city \u201c very much like El Paso \u201d told me she has a new job , overseeing a team of mostly Hispanic staff , with her name on the door \u2014 something to really be proud of . But instead she \u2019 s terrified , she said , because the office is marketed toward Latinos and that means she feels like a target .\nA Dreamer in Texas told me he was terrified of taking his son to stores or crowded places , and said he warned his parents not to speak Spanish in public . A first-generation Salvadoran man with a wife who is white said they just had a baby boy four weeks ago . He said he has told her he hopes the baby doesn \u2019 t have dark skin .\nA white man said his Latina wife from the Rio Grande Valley broke down after reading the shooter \u2019 s manifesto . She told him she \u2019 s sorry if their future kids are targets because of her .\nThere were people who said they wish they didn \u2019 t have an accent so they could pass as white , and others who said they are ashamed to be relieved they can pass as white . \u201c We \u2019 re not fine , \u201d a resident of a border town wrote to me .\nAnd then the process started all over again . A massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at seven food processing plants in Morton , Mississippi , led to the arrests of 680 undocumented workers , a record . Children cried outside the gates for their parents . Wives came to the scene to say goodbye to their husbands . It was a new method for separating families , but with the same result .\nAt first I didn \u2019 t watch the video of 11-year-old Magdalena Gomez Gregorio tearfully begging the government to release her father every time it popped up online , because while as a journalist I understand the news value of these images to show the human cost of Trump \u2019 s immigration policy , I \u2019 ve personally found it hard to continue looking at haunting images like it . I remember little Jakelin , 7 , who died of dehydration in U.S. custody last year , or Oscar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez and his 23-month-old daughter , Angie Valeria , face down in the Rio Grande in June , their tragedy transformed into a small part of the perpetual motion machine of online content . But I watched the video as I wrote this paragraph , of her asking the government to \u201c please show some heart , \u201d between sobs , while adding that her father is not a criminal .\nLike her , many Hispanics are worried . They live in parts of the South where there aren \u2019 t many Latinos , but also in majority-Hispanic areas where the actions of an outsider coming to a border town to kill means the cocoon of community doesn \u2019 t present the sense of protection it once did . But even in this dark moment there are hopeful signs .\nThe Latino community in the United States is not monolithic . At most , we have a shared language that not all speak . But I \u2019 ve seen a growing awareness of people sticking together online , as people check on one another on Instagram , in person and on the phone . There is fear , but people are also resolute that things will get better . And some wanted to make clear to me that while they \u2019 re well aware of how deeply awful this moment is , they still stand in defiance of those who would instill fear .\n\u201c I am done being terrorized , \u201d one young man wrote to me . \u201c My stepdad didn \u2019 t march and organize in the Chicano movement for our generation to live in fear . \u201d\nAnd while I think the news media should do better to contextualize the El Paso attack as a toxic brew of American gun culture and hatred of Latinos , there has been a lot of good coverage , too . Univision preempted its programming with a prime-time special by Jorge Ramos and Patricia Janiot titled \u201c Hispanics in the Crosshairs , \u201d and Telemundo \u2019 s Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart interviewed El Paso victims from the hospital , sharing Spanish-language texts exchanged between a mother and her daughter .
