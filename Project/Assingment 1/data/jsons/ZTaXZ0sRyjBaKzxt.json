    "content": "Barack Obama was a member of the Senate 's Democratic minority when Republicans tried to eliminate the filibuster against judicial nominees in 2005 . And he was n't happy about it .\n`` If the right of free and open debate is taken away from the minority party , and the millions of Americans who asked us to be their voice , I fear that the already partisan atmosphere in Washington will be poisoned to the point where no one will be able to agree on anything , '' he said . `` That does n't serve anyone 's best interests , and it certainly is n't what the patriots who founded this democracy had in mind . ''\nTen years later , from the vantage point of the White House , Obama 's take on the filibuster has changed sharply . In an exclusive \u2588\u2588\u2588 interview , I asked him what America needed to do to remain governable , given the deep divide between Democrats and Republicans . His answer turned quickly to the filibuster , and it 's worth reading in full :\nProbably the one thing that we could change without a constitutional amendment that would make a difference here would be the elimination of the routine use of the filibuster in the Senate . Because I think that does , in an era in which the parties are more polarized , it almost ensures greater gridlock and less clarity in terms of the positions of the parties . There 's nothing in the Constitution that requires it . The framers were pretty good about designing a House , a Senate , two years versus six-year terms , every state getting two senators . There were a whole bunch of things in there to assure that a majority did n't just run rampant . The filibuster in this modern age probably just torques it too far in the direction of a majority party not being able to govern effectively and move forward its platform . And I think that 's an area where we can make some improvement .\nBut it 's not just politicians ' attitudes towards the filibuster that change . The filibuster itself is always changing \u2014 and usually in one direction .\nThe arc of history is long , but it bends against the filibuster\nAs Obama says , the filibuster is n't mentioned in the Constitution . Indeed , it was n't envisioned by the founders at all . It was , as best as historians can figure , a mistake : it arose when the Senate deleted a seemingly redundant passage from its rulebook , and it took decades for anyone to realize that it was now impossible to force a senator to stop talking .\nSince the filibuster 's creation , the rule has been changed again and again . A filibuster was initially unstoppable \u2014 there was no way for the majority to override it . Then , in 1917 , the Senate created `` cloture votes '' , which made it possible for a two-thirds majority to kill a filibuster . In 1975 , they lowered it to three-fifths .\nIn 2013 , Senate Democrats did much the same thing their Republican counterparts had contemplated in 2005 : they used a simple majority to change the underlying filibuster rule so it no longer affected non-Supreme-Court nominations . The result was not some kind of nuclear war in the US Senate . Life just continued on as usual , but it became much easier for Obama to get his nominees confirmed .\nSenate Republicans protested the 2013 rule change bitterly , of course , but since retaking the chamber , they have n't moved to restore the filibuster . Indeed , two members of the Senate Republican leadership \u2014 Lamar Alexander and Mike Lee \u2014 have proposed lifting it against Supreme Court nominees , as well .\nThe filibuster , in other words , is on trend towards elimination . And its death becomes likelier as its use becomes more common . It 's a victim of its own success .\nWhat 's really changed in America is n't the filibuster . It 's the political parties that are using it .\nFor most of the 20th century , America 's political parties were n't particularly distinct . There were conservatives in the Democratic Party and liberals in the Republican Party . That made it hard for the parties to act like parties \u2014 what Strom Thurmond wanted to filibuster , Hubert Humphrey wanted to pass .\nAnd so the filibuster , in that age , was an extraordinary tactic mostly used by individual senators and small coalitions on issues of intense passion . The most organized and consistent use of the tool was by southern racists trying to preserve Jim Crow . And its use was rare . From 1940 to 1960 , there were only 10 votes in which the majority tried to end a filibuster .\nIt 's only later that the filibuster became an ordinary tool used by organized parties . And that 's because the parties became distinct . There are no liberals in today 's Republican Party and no conservatives in today 's Democratic Party .

In Obama 's first six years , there were more than 380 votes to break filibusters . ( Cloture votes , it should be said , are not a perfect measure of the number of filibusters , but since filibusters are n't recorded , they 're the best measure we have . )\nThis is the problem with the filibuster : it is a poor fit for an era with highly polarized parties . It 's one thing to have a rule that allows individual senators or small groups of senators to stop the Senate and force more debate over issues of extraordinary importance .
