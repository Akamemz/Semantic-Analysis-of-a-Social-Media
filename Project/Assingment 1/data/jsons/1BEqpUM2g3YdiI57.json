So is getting those forecasts woefully wrong . \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine has published an annual worst political predictions list twice before , but we \u2019 ve never had quite the fodder that we did this year . In the 2016 presidential race , one presumed front-runner after another fell to the bottom of the polls ; a reality TV star is currently as admired as the pope ; and a socialist and a retired neurosurgeon gained massive followings . In Washington , a man who once wanted to give his \u201c undivided attention \u201d to the Ways and Means Committee is now speaker of the House ; and a president about to enter his final year and facing a hostile Congress reached deals on climate change , Iran \u2019 s nuclear program and international trade . Of course , we can \u2019 t blame political pundits for being wrong in a year so full of surprises ; but that won \u2019 t stop us from having some fun calling them out .

And if that same discussion is not happening at every media outlet and presidential campaign around the country , they are making a huge mistake . \u201d\nLance Ulanoff of Mashable , as quoted on Fox News , March 25 , 2015 : \u201c This [ Meerkat ] is here to stay . \u201d\nThe app , which allowed anybody to start or watch a live streaming video from their phone , from anywhere in the world , quickly rocketed to the top of the app charts after its release in February . But mere weeks after Meerkat \u2019 s launch , Twitter bought a competing app called Periscope , which also had the added feature of replaying live streams once they were done , for almost $ 100 million and began promoting it . This graph visualizes how Meerkat downloads virtually stopped while Periscope continuously surged .\nJamie Weinstein , Daily Caller , June 26 , 2015 : \u201c At this point , it \u2019 s hard to imagine Joe Biden not entering the race for the White House . \u2026 [ T ] he logic of his candidacy keeps getting more compelling by the day . Here are three reasons why Biden will likely soon announce his entrance into the race \u2026 1 . ) Hillary is vulnerable \u2026 2 . ) There \u2019 s no obvious alternative to Hillary in the Democratic race yet \u2026 3 . ) His son \u2019 s death . \u201d\nBill Kristol , Twitter , Aug. 22 , 2015 : `` Prediction : Biden will announce on September 7 after marching with cheering crowds in annual Wilmington AFL-CIO Labor Day parade .

''\nBill Kristol , Twitter , Oct. 16 , 2015 : I continue to think Biden will run -- and that he can beat Hillary . ''\nBill Kristol , Twitter , Oct. 20 , 2015 : `` Biden confirms to Obama at lunch today he 's running , announces at U Delaware tomorrow . You can feel the Joementum !

She should run for president . And despite her denials , she probably will . \u2026 Warren 's got nothing to gain from staying put in the Senate except drudgery , ineffectuality and humiliation . ''\nIn the end , Warren stayed true to her denials , opting to remain in the Senate instead of running for president . The movement encouraging her to run eventually suspended its campaign .\nMitt Romney will run for president again ( and will win ) .\nRepresentative Jason Chaffetz , MSNBC , July 7 , 2014 : \u201c I happen to be in the camp that thinks [ Romney \u2019 s ] actually going to run , and I think he will be the next president of the United States . \u201d\nBack in January , Mitt Romney scheduled a donor call that led many to believe he was about to announce a third run for president . Both Bloomberg and the Daily Beast reported that Romney was indeed running\u2014but within hours the real reason for the donor call had been reported : Romney was not launching another campaign .\n( Others rumored to be running included Ohio Senator Rob Portman , Indiana Governor Mike Pence , Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan . Needless to say , none of them did . )\nAaron Goldstein , the American Spectator , July 15 , 2015 : \u201c While this field is quite crowded , I believe it will soon become apparent that Scott Walker stands out head and shoulders above the rest . Here are the six reasons why I believe Walker will not only win the GOP nomination , but be elected President in November 2016 . \u201d\nKevin Drum , Mother Jones , November 19 , 2014 : \u201c All this is a long way of explaining why I think Scott Walker is the frontrunner . He has a record of governance . His persona is generally adult . He does n't say crazy stuff . Relatively speaking , he 's attractive to moderates . But at the same time , the tea partiers love him too . \u2026 Predictions are hard , especially about the future . But if he runs , I rate Walker a favorite right now . \u201d\nAlan Greenblatt , \u2588\u2588\u2588 , July 12 , 2015 : \u201c Plenty of Republicans don \u2019 t want to vote for Jeb Bush . The same can not be said about Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker . That \u2019 s why this understated and under-known Midwesterner could rise up and beat not just expectations but the entire field . In fact , Walker could plausibly clinch the nomination without losing a single early state . \u201d\nAt first , Walker was considered an obvious front-runner , one of the few candidates capable of uniting the GOP \u2019 s Tea Party and establishment wings . The conservative Wisconsin governor got off to a promising start , leading polls in Iowa for several months early in the year . But eventually , his disappointing debate performances and murky policy positions got the better of him , and after he plummeted in the polls , blew through all his campaign cash and upset donors , all was over ; he dropped out in September .\nTrump won \u2019 t run . Or , if he does , it won \u2019 t matter .\nDonald Trump , Oprah , April 25 , 1988 : Oprah Winfrey : \u201c Would you ever [ run for president ] ? \u201d Trump : \u201c Probably not . \u2026 I just don \u2019 t think I have the inclination to do it . \u2026 I just probably wouldn \u2019 t do it , Oprah . \u201d\nHenry Decker , National Memo , March 18 , 2015 : \u201c Although the exploratory committee is the most concrete step that Trump has ever taken toward a presidential run , there is still plenty of reason to believe that he won \u2019 t go through with it . After all , Trump has publicly flirted with running in every presidential election since 2000 ( in addition to several gubernatorial races ) , and so far he \u2019 s never been willing to expose his business interests ( or his shady personal life ) to the scrutiny that would come with a national campaign . \u201d\nJosh Voorhees , Slate , May 28 , 2015 : \u201c I have no way of knowing whether The Donald will actually run for president this time after decades of hinting at the idea in exchange for some free PR . \u2026 But until he actually proves otherwise , I \u2019 m not buying what he \u2019 s selling\u2014and neither should you . \u2026 He will never seriously compete for the GOP nomination even if he is officially running for it . \u201d\nStephen Collinson , CNN , January 27 , 2015 : \u201c Just when you thought it was safe to go back on the Republican campaign trail , Sarah Palin and Donald Trump are back . All it took to set Twitter abuzz at the first big GOP campaign bash at the weekend was for The Donald and the 2008 vice presidential nominee to clear their throats and muse , yet again , about presidential campaigns . But the idea that they \u2019 re both seriously searching their souls and considering a run for the White House doesn \u2019 t pass the smell test . \u201d\nChris Cillizza , the Washington Post , February 26 , 2015 : \u201c So , let \u2019 s assume\u2014gulp\u2014that Trump is serious this time around . Heck , while we 're at it , let 's assume he actually runs . IT . DOES N'T . MATTER . I ca n't emphasize that strongly enough . \u201d\nStuart Stevens , Daily Beast , August 20 , 2015 : \u201c Making political predictions rarely turns out well , but here \u2019 s one : Donald Trump will not be a candidate for president in 2016 . What ? Yes , I know , he \u2019 s already announced . In my view , though , he won \u2019 t take this all the way to the ballot in Iowa , New Hampshire , or any of the Republican caucus or primary elections . Why ? Because he \u2019 s Donald Trump and everything we know about him tells us he won \u2019 t do it . \u201d\nTrump publicly toyed with a presidential run in 1988 , 2000 and 2012 but perpetually failed to follow through . So it wasn \u2019 t hard to believe that he \u2019 d do the same this year\u2014or that a real estate magnate better known for his reality TV show than his political views would have trouble competing against the likes of Jeb Bush , Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz . ( So few polls for 2016 included Trump \u2019 s name among their potential candidates prior to his announcement that he didn \u2019 t even crack Huffington Post Pollster \u2019 s aggregate averages , which measure candidates with any support whatsoever , until April\u2014way later than for any other top GOP candidate . ) And yet , Trump announced his presidential bid in June , rose to first place in the Republican polls , and has held that place ever since .\nSenator Lindsey Graham , CNN , July 20 , 2015 : \u201c The American people will not tolerate what he is doing now regarding those who have served . This is a line he has crossed . This is the beginning of the end of Donald Trump . \u201d\nCharles Krauthammer , Fox News , August 6 , 2015 : \u201c The real story is the collapse of Trump in this debate . \u2026 The fact is he was out of place . \u2026 When he can go on on his own and ramble , he is entertaining , sharp and amusing , but here when he is controlled in a tight setting he was lost for most of the debate . \u201d\nJonah Goldberg , Los Angeles Times , July 22 , 2015 : \u201c The Trump squall is not over , alas . But it \u2019 s nonetheless obvious that we will someday soon look back on this as the beginning of the end of Trumpmania . \u2026 The reason his demise is all so predictable is that personality eventually shines through . A few politicians are capable of hiding their truly unpleasant personal qualities , but it takes enormous effort , and sooner or later the mask slips . \u201d\nNate Cohn , the New York Times , July 8 , 2015 : \u201c Donald Trump \u2019 s surge in the polls has followed the classic pattern of a media-driven surge . Now it will most likely follow the classic pattern of a party-backed decline . \u2026 His support will erode as the tone of coverage shifts from publicizing his anti-establishment and anti-immigration views , which have some resonance in the party , to reflecting the chorus of Republican criticism of his most outrageous comments and the more liberal elements of his record . \u201d\nSara Fagen , CNBC , September 17 , 2015 : \u201c While it \u2019 s true Donald Trump \u2019 s political demise has been written before and he has continued to defy political pundits with his strength atop the polls , we will look back at last night \u2019 s debate and see it as the beginning of the end of Donald Trump \u2019 s grip atop the GOP field . Three reasons make this so . \u2026 First , the petty insults about people 's appearances and intelligence levels are getting old . \u2026 Second , as last night \u2019 s debate moved into substantive discussions , Donald Trump faded in the background . \u2026 Third , there \u2019 s no evidence Donald Trump is building the infrastructure necessary to win the GOP nomination . \u201d\nEven after he surged to first place in July , many clung to the belief that Trump \u2019 s inevitable downfall was just one ( more ) offensive statement or lackluster debate performance around the corner . And yet , scores of Trump-driven controversies later , he is still in first place in the Republican polls and is , according to Gallup , the second most admired man in the world , tied with Pope Francis . He might end up crashing and burning at some point before November , but Trump has officially established himself as more than just a passing fad .",
