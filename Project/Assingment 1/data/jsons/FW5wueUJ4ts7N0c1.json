Tom Cotton was \u201c 100 % Correct \u201d for suggesting violent activists would cower before a US Army presence .\nAs of Monday , 23 states and the District of Columbia had mobilized thousands of National Guard members to support police officers and firefighters with trying to control the demonstrations and unrest .\nTrump , however , is unsatisfied with those efforts . In a private call with governors on Monday , he told them , \u201c If you don \u2019 t dominate , you \u2019 re wasting your time , \u201d adding that \u201c we have a wonderful military. \u201d Hours later , White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president would soon send \u201c federal assets \u201d around the nation , and mentioned the Insurrection Act as a possibility .\n\u201c The Insurrection Act , it \u2019 s one of the tools available , whether the president decides to pursue that , that \u2019 s his prerogative , \u201c she said .\nHowever , Trump did say US military police , many of whom have spent part of the past two decades in the Middle East , will deploy to Washington , DC . Importantly , they still don \u2019 t have the authority to perform law enforcement duties .\nBut if Trump were to go through with invoking the Insurrection Act , experts say it would be one of the most dramatic law enforcement escalations in decades , certain to inflame tensions between the demonstrators and their government instead of lower them .\nAn active-duty US Air Force officer who flew warplanes in Afghanistan told me such a decision isn \u2019 t wise . \u201c These protests aren \u2019 t combat and shouldn \u2019 t be viewed through the same prism , \u201d the officer said , speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about a sensitive issue . \u201c Expecting a military response is myopic on the part of the administration , tone-deaf in light of yet another intolerable and unacceptable killing , and a misuse of the military . \u201d\nBut Trump hasn \u2019 t heeded that advice . Instead , he \u2019 s leaning away from it .\nTrump absolutely can send American troops to any part of the United States to deal with the protests . He is the commander in chief , after all . But if he wants them to be able to search , seize assets , and arrest protesters and people who are looting , there are a few legalistic hoops he \u2019 ll have to jump through first .\nYou might have heard of \u201c posse comitatus , \u201d a longstanding law that bars the US military in most cases from being used to enforce domestic law . However , there is actually a way for federal troops to perform law enforcement functions . Simply put , they have to get special , statutory authorization to allow them to do those duties .\nBy far the most important of those authorizations \u2014 and the one most likely to come into play in this situation \u2014 is the Insurrection Act .\n\u201c This is the legal key that unlocks the door to use federal military forces ... to quell civil unrest , \u201d Mark Nevitt , a military law expert at the US Naval Academy , wrote for the Just Security website last Friday .\nNevitt noted two main ways the Insurrection Act could be invoked for the protests . It \u2019 s worth going through each in turn .\n1 ) Local leaders could ask the president for US military assistance\nA state \u2019 s legislature or its governor could directly request US military support . This actually happened in 1992 : California Gov . Pete Wilson sought assistance from President George H.W . Bush during the Los Angeles protests that erupted after a jury acquitted police officers charged with arresting and beating Rodney King . In response , Bush put California National Guard members under federal command and sent in soldiers and Marines already based in the state .\nIt \u2019 s unclear if any governor would actually make such a request of Trump right now . Experts told me governors typically shy away from taking this step because of how controversial it is . Plus , they have National Guard members already under their command who , when authorized , can perform law enforcement functions .\nReports , however , indicate that active-duty troops stationed around the country are on high alert to deploy within 24 hours . \u201c We have our military ready , willing and able , if they ever want to call our military , \u201d Trump told reporters on Saturday . \u201c And we can have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military . \u201d\n2 ) The president could send in US troops to protect federal property or enforce federal law\nTrump could invoke the law to send troops even without a state legislature \u2019 s or governor \u2019 s consent \u2014 but there \u2019 s a catch .\nTrump can only deploy troops within the US \u201c for certain purposes , \u201d Lindsay Cohn , a US military expert at the Naval War College , told me . \u201c Technically and legally , he can send them to protect federal property or enforce federal law . \u201d\nPast presidents used this authority to defend civil rights in the 1950s and \u2019 60s .\nIn 1957 , then-Arkansas Gov . Orval Faubus refused to follow federal integration laws after the Supreme Court \u2019 s Brown v. Board of Education ruling three years earlier . As a result , President Dwight Eisenhower sent soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock to escort nine black high school students into the all-white Central High School despite protests against them .\nFive years later , President John F. Kennedy sent Army soldiers into Oxford , Mississippi , after the state \u2019 s governor tried to block a black student from attending the University of Mississippi in Oxford ( often referred to as Ole Miss ) . This allowed the student , James Meredith , to register safely even though a mob tried to stop him .\nIn both the Eisenhower and Kennedy cases , the president used federal troops to enforce federal laws . That \u2019 s important , Cohn told me , because the key is that those and other deployments by presidents were to suppress insurrections against US federal laws \u2014 not laws of the individual states .\nReading the provision in full helps drive this vital point home :\nWhenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions , combinations , or assemblages or rebellion against authority of United States makes it impracticable to enforce the law of the United States in any State or territory by judicial proceedings , the President may call into Federal service the militia of any State and use the Federal military to enforce the laws or suppress the rebellion .\nImportantly , to invoke the act , Trump must first \u2014 with the attorney general \u2019 s help \u2014 issue a \u201c proclamation to disperse. \u201d Basically , he has to give the people working against federal law a bit of time to stop their actions . If they don \u2019 t , the president is free to send in the US military .\nIf Trump were to do this , it would be guaranteed to anger a lot of people , and many would likely contend that Trump is behaving in an authoritarian manner , using the might of the US military to crack down on protesters . But while the impulse behind it may seem undemocratic , that doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean it wouldn \u2019 t be legal .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not implausible to argue that these statutes could apply now , \u201d Steve Vladeck , a national security law expert at the University of Texas Austin , tweeted on Saturday . \u201c And it \u2019 s hard to imagine courts second-guessing factual determinations by the President that circumstances warrant use of the military to restore order . \u201d\nIf Trump wants soldiers and Marines to go into American cities and start shooting , he \u2019 ll be wildly disappointed .\nAs Nevitt explained , there are clear and severe restraints on active-duty troops using force while performing policing duties at home , even under the Insurrection Act :\n[ F ] orce is to be used only as a last resort , and the force used should be the minimum necessary .
