It \u2019 s hard to run the same way in 2020 as he did in 2016 , \u201d a person close to the Trump campaign said .\nThe challenges are not lost on the president \u2019 s campaign staff . This time , Trump will launch his 2020 campaign with organizational and financial advantages his previous crew could have only dreamed of \u2014 soothing allies who worry the current political environment is less conducive to victory .\nFrom a 14th-floor suite originally designed to house the offices of a capital markets firm , Trump \u2019 s modest campaign team of about 50 employees has spent the past several months laying the groundwork for a 2020 race that diverges from 2016 without sacrificing his insurgent populist message . Extensive assistance from the Republican National Committee \u2014 driven by a massive staff , existing presence in all 50 states and a staunch Trump ally at its helm \u2014 has helped , bringing institutional knowledge and resources that were notably absent in 2016 .\nOfficials at the RNC \u2019 s Capitol Hill headquarters are in constant contact with counterparts who work out of the Trump campaign \u2019 s Arlington , Va. , office , and staffers from each side often travel to the same events to show simultaneous support for the party and for Trump . For example , Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel both attended a dinner this week hosted by the local Republican Party in Macomb County , Mich. , often called the \u201c home of the Reagan Democrats \u201d and a must-win for Trump in 2020 .\n\u201c If you look at where the campaign was in 2016 and where it is today , it \u2019 s a completely different organization . It has a united Republican Party behind it that also has one of the best fundraising operations we \u2019 ve ever seen , \u201d a Michigan Republican Party official said , adding the Trump campaign plans to deploy significant staff to Michigan beginning in early July .\nA campaign official said Parscale plans to have \u201c a fully functioning ground game by the end of summer , \u201d as well as several coalition groups that will specifically target female , Latino and African American voters .\nMany of those campaign staffers , along with members of the GOP \u2019 s state party affiliates , have gone through a program known as GROW , or Growing Republican Organizations to Win .

One state party official who recently completed the training said they were asked to draft mock news releases and budgets as part of the programming .\nCampaign officials readily admit that Trump determines the message on any given day , making it difficult to create a fixed communications strategy that volunteers and staff can follow . Earlier this year , for instance , Trump son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner instructed campaign staff to avoid targeting specific 2020 Democratic candidates only to watch the president lob repeated insults at former Vice President Joe Biden weeks later . Trump has also insulted Sens . Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , former Rep.

But the campaign has begun crafting candidate-specific messages that it hopes Trump will test out and eventually deploy regularly , depending on who becomes the Democratic nominee . Officials have largely focused on Biden , Sanders and Warren , believing Trump \u2019 s opponent be one of those three .\n\u201c If it \u2019 s Sanders or Warren , they immediately become advocates for radical change that \u2019 s a step too far for most voters , and Trump becomes the centrist .
