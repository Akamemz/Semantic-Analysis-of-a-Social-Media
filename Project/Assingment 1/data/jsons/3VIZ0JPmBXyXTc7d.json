    "content": "From Hollywood comes a steady stream of movies casting powerful liberals as embattled and marginalized conservatives as menacing . Hollywood \u2019 s latest tribute to a hopelessly entitled press , The Post , is in that vein . Meryl Streep plays an astonishingly brave and nervy Katharine Graham , willing to risk her fortune and even her freedom to publish the Pentagon Papers in the Washington Post . It is a feel-good film for the kind of press liberals who consider Trump \u2019 s mere tweets a singular and monstrous threat to their freedom .\nThe film borrows from the Nixon tapes to make it seem like his impotent ravings imperiled her paper . But most of those rantings don \u2019 t even pertain to the Pentagon Papers , and in the one tape that does Nixon sounds remarkably blas\u00e9 . If director Steven Spielberg had included the whole conversation with Al Haig in the movie , viewers would have heard the two agreeing that the disclosure of the Pentagon Papers primarily threatened to tarnish the legacy of the Kennedy administration .\nNixon , after all , ended the war that Post editor Ben Bradlee \u2019 s close chum JFK started . Yet to most casual viewers , Nixon will appear as the president who had the most to hide . The subtext of the film , of course , is that Trump stands as the new Nixon . According to press reports , Meryl Streep and Spielberg squeezed into their visit to Washington , D.C. ( for the premiere ) a dinner with the Obamas , and Tom Hanks has stoutly rejected a hypothetical question from a reporter about a screening at the White House . Trump , we \u2019 re supposed to take from this posturing , is a unique threat to the press .\nBut what has he done to it again ? Nothing , save criticize it . Has he wiretapped any reporters ? No , the dinner mate of Streep and Spielberg did that . Obama \u2019 s uber-progressive attorney general Eric Holder had Fox News reporter James Rosen investigated for talking to a State Department official . Rosen was labeled a \u201c criminal co-conspirator \u201d under the Espionage Act , a law that liberals , as we \u2019 ve seen from the Mueller investigation and the Flynn entrapment , like to use against conservatives but otherwise treat as antiquated and absurd .\nIn The Post , the Nixon administration \u2019 s invoking of that law is presented as self-serving and tyrannical . But these days the admirers of Daniel Ellsberg and his media conduits rejoice at its partisan applications . In power , liberals love wiretappings , entrapments , and quarantining undesirable press ( Obama wanted Fox News excluded from press briefings ) ; out of power , all of that suddenly becomes evidence of a government run amok .\nIt is fitting that smug and privileged celebrities play such phony heroes as Graham and Bradlee . They share a lot in common . Streep \u2019 s Graham frets over doing time in the slammer , which is about as convincing as Streep \u2019 s award show speeches in which she portrays multimillionaire \u201c artists \u201d as the ostracized kin of illegal immigrants . Liberals love to turn bullies into victims and victims into bullies . The real complaint underlying Hollywood \u2019 s hagiography is that liberals don \u2019 t possess one hundred percent of the power in America . All of their whining about \u201c tyranny \u201d is just a projection of their own desire for it .\nThey want checks on everyone \u2019 s power but their own . It is out of that sense of entitlement that their Trump hysteria has grown , mushrooming to the point where they feel terrorized by a tweet .\nThe unstated premise of movies like The Post is that the press deserves more public trust than elected government officials .
