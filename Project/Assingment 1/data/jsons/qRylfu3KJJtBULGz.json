    "content": "Parts of ObamaCare are starting to fray , even before full implementation .\nThe Obama administration now says a special system of exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses to provide insurance will be delayed an entire year -- to 2015 .\n`` Lots of small businesses struggle with providing insurance for their workers so this was supposed to facilitate it and make it easier for small business to do this , '' said Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center . `` It was a huge portion of the sale job . When they passed the law in 2010 there were many senators and members of Congress who were saying ' I am doing this because it 's going to help small businesses . ' ''\nThe exchanges were designed to give workers a range of choices supported by dollars from their employers . But now they will have only one choice until 2015 , which could mean they ca n't shop for insurance that includes their current providers . Capretta said the administration is `` way '' behind schedule .\nSince insurance is more expensive for small businesses , many of which have no obligation under the law to provide coverage , analysts now fear many might just stop trying and let workers go on the soon-to-be-launched state exchanges .\nMore On This ... Delays and Denials Threaten Obama Health Law\nSara Teppema of the Society of Actuaries -- which did an exhaustive study of ObamaCare -- said that `` even if it 's just a small change of people who are leaving the employment-based insurance and coming into the individual insurance market , their costs and their numbers will overwhelm those who are currently uninsured . ''\nMeanwhile , 79 senators including several liberal lawmakers recently voted to repeal a new tax on medical devices contained in the health care law following a similar vote in the House .\n`` The House and the Senate agreeing ? This is a harmonic convergence , it does n't happen , '' said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh . `` But on this it 's happened because the adverse consequences to our economy and the quality of health care are so apparent . ''\nThe two separate votes have not become law but show widespread opposition to the 2.3 percent sales tax on medical devices . Critics say the law is unfair to the industry since it 's a tax on gross sales -- meaning it adds up to a much bigger percentage of a company 's profits .\nBut supporters such as Paul Van de Water of the Center for American Progress oppose any repeal .\n`` I think that repealing the device tax would be irresponsible . We need the revenue and it 's not going to be a job killer , '' he said .\nThe theory was that ObamaCare would insure 30 million more people and that device makers , like pharmaceutical companies , would get lots of new customers and a steady stream of new revenue to make up for the tax . Van de Water predicted that would still happen .\n`` These device manufacturers are for the most part going to be getting a large increase in business thanks to health reform , thanks to ObamaCare , '' he said .\nBut the CEO of one company said that 's not true for the 7,000 small companies with 400,000 employees who make a wide range of devices .\nChristine Jacobs of Theragenics said : `` We make widgets -- hips , knees , stents , pacemakers , and implants , even , for prostate cancer . Those widgets tend to be used by people that are elderly . As the body parts wear out , we 're needed . ''\nBut Jacobs notes that most people whose body parts wear out are already on Medicare , so ObamaCare does not provide a new revenue stream for her company -- only financial pain .\n`` In the case of a small company , that medical device tax is equal to our R-and-D budget for this year , '' Jacobs said .\nBayh said in his own state of Indiana , one company planned to open up to five facilities over the next five years but had to scrap those plans because of the `` uncertainty created by this tax . ''\nJacobs said the huge multinational device makers might be able to handle the burden but not the small companies .\n`` It 's just such a disproportionate burden for little guys , '' she said . `` Because we 're all being told that it 's the little companies that create the jobs . And that 's not message that we 're getting . ''\nThe tax will even be applied to sutures used on pets that Theragenics developed for the veterinary market .\nShe sought FDA approval to demonstrate the quality of her products . But now she said `` it 's hard for me not to get frosted on this one '' -- she explained that whoever wrote the regulations said `` if you have FDA approval , you will be taxed . ''\nPresident Obama has vowed to veto any repeal of the tax , but Bayh notes that 79 votes in the Senate would be more than enough to override any veto .",
