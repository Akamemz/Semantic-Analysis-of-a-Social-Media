    "content": "Securing our southern border against a massive influx of illegal immigrants and deadly illegal drugs is a national security crisis of the highest order . President Trump deserves bipartisan support from Congress and the American people to deal with this national emergency .\nWith an estimated 11 million or more illegal immigrants in the U.S. and hundreds of thousands more coming in , President Trump understands it \u2019 s his responsibility to enforce our immigration laws and secure our borders .\nSo it \u2019 s particularly disappointing that not only partisan Democrats but even some Republicans in Congress are complaining about tariffs the president wants to impose on Mexican products imported in the U.S . The tariffs are designed to pressure the Mexican government to work with us to cut the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs entering our country .\nTRUMP : MEXICO TARIFFS \u2018 WILL TAKE EFFECT , \u2019 \u2018 FOOLISH \u2019 FOR GOP TO BLOCK\nPressure works . Even The New York Times \u2013 which certainly can \u2019 t be called a friend or supporter of President Trump \u2013 reported Monday on \u201c a broad Mexican crackdown against the surge of Central Americans and others streaming toward the United States . \u201d\n\u201c Detentions and deportations in Mexico are multiplying quickly \u201d of illegal immigrants from Central America , the Times reported . Why ? \u201c The Mexican government has been under intense pressure from President Trump to block the tens of thousands of undocumented migrants trudging north each month . \u201d\nBut Mexico is still not doing enough . That \u2019 s why President Trump quite sensibly announced last week that he will impose a 5 percent tariff on imports from Mexico June 10 , increasing by 5 percent a month until it hits 25 percent in October \u201c unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory . \u201d\nPresident Trump \u2019 s goal , of course , is not to impose tariffs . It is to get Mexico to enforce its own immigration laws and work with the U.S. to keep illegal immigrants out of our country .\nPresident Trump is giving Mexican officials the opportunity to save face and look out for their own interests , while at the same time becoming a true partner with the United States in border security . This partnership will ensure the economic prosperity for the Mexican people .\nThe tariffs President Trump announced have served as a wake-up call to Mexico to carry out its responsibilities . The nation \u2019 s president , foreign minister and other top officials are all now fully engaged on dealing with the immigration crisis as a result .\nAs a Border Patrol agent and as the current president of the National Border Patrol Council \u2013 the exclusive labor representative of approximately 16,000 Border Patrol agents \u2013 I know first-hand the many harmful consequences of an unsecure border . This is why the National Border Patrol Council fully supports the president in his effort to protect our nation from illegal immigrants and drugs .\nThere \u2019 s an old saying that \u201c short-term pain is always worth long-term gain. \u201d This is the case with President Trump \u2019 s proposed tariffs and other border policies . In the long-run they will be enormously beneficial to our nation and the American people .\nFor example , after President Trump announced planned tariffs on Mexico last week , the stock market lost more than 350 points and economists were screaming \u201c recession. \u201d But on Tuesday the Dow Industrial Average was higher than the day before the tariffs were announced . This clearly show that our economy is not cratering as a result of the president \u2019 s action to defend our border .\nAnd remember , the stock market is only one major factor that drives the American economy . Another is taxes . A non-secure border costs the American people billions of dollars annually in taxes \u2013 money that comes out of the pockets of all of us .\nOn top of this , we must never forget the terrible human cost in deaths and ruined lives and the huge financial cost of the illegal drugs coming across our border with Mexico .\nDescribing the fentanyl , methamphetamine and cocaine-related deaths in the U.S. in 2017 , the New York Times reported : \u201c Together they add up to an epidemic of drug overdoses that is killing people at a faster rate than the H.I.V . epidemic at its peak. \u201d That is truly alarming .\nBut it doesn \u2019 t stop with drugs . The American taxpayer is also on the hook for many other costs associated with illegal immigration .\nThe Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) estimates that the American taxpayer shells out billions of dollars annually to cover the costs of social welfare , schooling , transportation , housing , law enforcement , and other needs crated by illegal immigrants .\nRemember that politicians who insist we must spend this money \u2013 money you pay in taxes \u2013 are really doing so to appease their base and ensure their own re-elections .\nFar-left economists , media and politicians , however , are trying to deflect and misdirect the conversation . They would prefer to have you believe that the tariff argument comes down to the price of avocados .\nThey refuse to accept the argument that the rule of law \u2013 a secure border \u2013 would actually drive down the cost of produce in the long run . They are making an argument that has been proven false time and time again .\nPresident Trump has characterized our current southwest border crisis as an invasion , and as someone who has first-hand experience working on the border with Mexico I emphatically agree . In fact , I don \u2019 t know any border security expert who disagrees .\nThe invasion is being carried out by both drug and human smugglers and unfortunately , it \u2019 s not a far leap to conclude that the Mexican government shares at least some responsibility .\nJust as President Trump pursues a policy of \u201c America First , Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador puts his own country \u2019 s interest above all others . This is only natural \u2013 the job of every nation \u2019 s leader is to serve his or her citizens .\nBy imposing tariffs on Mexico to pressure the nation to work more closely with us to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs , President Trump has incentivized his Mexican counterpart to work more closely with the U.S. to at long last secure the border we share .\nPresident Trump is giving Mexican officials the opportunity to save face and look out for their own interests , while at the same time becoming a true partner with the United States in border security .
