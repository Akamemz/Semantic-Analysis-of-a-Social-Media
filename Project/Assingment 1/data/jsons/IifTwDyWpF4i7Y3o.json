    "content": "It was getting late when Colvin Grannum started walking home from Just My Sweet , an event space and art gallery on Fulton Avenue here in a still-notorious part of Brooklyn .\nThe Bedford Stuyvesant haunt , which features Jazzy Mondays and art by African artists , was hosting a dinner honoring local civil servants this evening \u2013 \u201c all products of Bedford Stuyvesant who went on to do great things , \u201d Mr. Grannum says .\nBut as he walked home just before 11 p.m. , taking especial notice of the smiles and laughter he was seeing on this vibrant thoroughfare , Grannum , the president of a major community center not too far from Just My Sweet , says he couldn \u2019 t help but think of Donald Trump of all people .\nDuring Monday \u2019 s debate , the Republican nominee had said that \u201c African-Americans and Hispanics are living in hell , \u201d following up on a theme he had been sounding at campaign events the week before .\nAs in North Carolina last Saturday , when Mr. Trump told a mostly-white audience that \u201c African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they 've ever been in before . Ever . Ever . Ever . You take a look at the inner cities . You \u2019 ve got no education . You \u2019 ve got no jobs . You get shot walking down the street . \u201d\nGrannum found his words \u201c shocking and dumbfounding , \u201d and he wondered : Is that what people think of inner city communities like his ?\n\u201c It \u2019 s far from the truth , it \u2019 s just far from reality , and it \u2019 s not the way people who live here feel , \u201d he says of Bed-Stuy , where 64 percent of its 150,000 are black and 20 percent are Hispanic . \u201c Could the conditions be better ? Yes . But they \u2019 re a lot better than they used to be and they \u2019 re getting better every day . \u201d\nTake the formerly abandoned milk bottling plant which has been transformed into a full city block of lively cultural and community spaces . His organization , the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation , oversees the center , which includes the Billie Holiday Theater , Skylight Gallery , and Youth Arts Academy , where some 500 children participate in youth choruses and dance troupes . Its outdoor spaces are often the site of weddings , outdoor concerts , or just a place for the community to gather .\nIn recent years , many have noted \u201c the surprising optimism of black Americans , \u201d who often express more faith in the future than their white counterparts in opinion polls . And from increasing life expectancies to notable employment gains there have been notes of progress . In 2015 , for example , while employment growth for whites and Hispanics slowed when measured as an employment-to-population ratio , African-American adults with a job increased 2.5 percentage points , according to the Employment Policy Institute in Washington .\nIn the 2016 elections , too , black political power emerged as a surprising bulwark for the status quo , providing Hillary Clinton with the support she needed to become the Democratic nominee during a season in which Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Trump were champions of party revolutions .\nMake no mistake , for many black communities around the country , the struggle for equal standing and social justice remains as urgent a cause as ever . From protests spanning city streets to National Football League sidelines , many have been giving voice to the issues surrounding police shootings and the inequities within the criminal justice system . Outside the headlines , many community leaders continue to struggle for greater equality in health care , housing , and education as well .\nTrump \u2019 s words , interpreted generously , were in some respects political hyperbole , making a rough-and-ready point that black Americans , according to a number of measures , lag well behind the nation . Black unemployment is still double the national rate ; black homeownership is the lowest among any racial group , according to the Census Bureau ; and 26 percent of blacks live in poverty , compared with 15 percent of the country as a whole .\nSuch social ills are especially acute in Bed-Stuy , where 1 of 3 residents live below the poverty level , and 1 of 6 remain unemployed . The neighborhood , which , along with Manhattan \u2019 s Harlem is considered a historic center of black culture in New York , also has one of the city \u2019 s highest crime rates . In 2016 so far , one of its two police precincts has recorded the second highest number of murders in all the five boroughs .\nBut Brenda Fryson , a member of the Brownstoners of Bedford Stuyvesant , a nonprofit volunteer organization dedicated to the preservation and revitalization of the neighborhood , says the community here , with numerous block associations and a spirited community board , has always been particularly close-knit , even when times were rougher .\nNow in her 70s , Ms. Fryson , the former chairwoman of the neighborhood \u2019 s community board , has lived in Bed-Stuy for over 40 years , and is something of a \u201c force of nature , \u201d residents say .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a Brooklyn girl , born and bred , \u201d she says with an easy laugh , which occurs often in her conversations . \u201c And what always impressed me , was that there was this deep commitment to neighbors and community ... That still exists . And I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s going anywhere . I think that \u2019 s so deep in our DNA that , you know , when people come , we \u2019 ve always been a welcoming community , at least that \u2019 s been my experience . \u201d\n\u201c The block associations were always extremely , extremely strong , \u201d Fryson continues . \u201c And that is something that I really love about Bedford Stuyvesant , that you have these neighbors that get together , they plan , they look at legislation \u2013 they don \u2019 t take no junk . \u201d\nBack in the 1980s when Bed-Stuy resident Tony Herbert was growing up on the streets of Brooklyn , the streets he knew were infamously mean .\nOne of four boys being raised by a single mother \u2013 a teacher \u2019 s aide who took home a little bit more than $ 200 from her biweekly paycheck \u2013 he and his family even spent time being homeless , squatting in abandoned buildings between finding affordable apartments .\n\u201c People stole the copper pipes from the basement , so we had to go outside to get running water from the hydrants , \u201d says Mr. Herbert , now the president of the New York State Minority Restaurant and Nightlife Association , and a community advocate in the Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood .\n\u201c Yet as I reflect on what we 've come from , as far as the '80s and '90s were concerned , when crack was king and created an atmosphere where everybody wanted to make some money real quick and got involved in that , there have been enormous strides , \u201d he says , noting there were often dealers in the buildings where he grew up .\nBut even then , Herbert noted a certain kind of community . \u201c Our saving grace , these drug dealers knew my mother from the public school , so they showed her the respect of saying , \u2018 We wo n't let your kids get involved with this , nor will we let them get into harm 's way . \u2019 \u201d\nToday he works with business owners and entrepreneurs , helping them navigate city ordinances and license requirements .
