    "content_original": "By Michael Barone - February 7, 2013\n\nThe House Republicans, in serious trouble with public opinion as they blinked facing the \"fiscal cliff\" over New Year's, seem suddenly to be playing a more successful game -- or rather, games -- an inside game and an outside game.\n\nThe inside game can be described by the Washington phrase \"regular order.\" What that means in ordinary American English is that you proceed according to the rules.\n\nBills are written in subcommittee and committee and then go to the floor. When the House and Senate pass different versions -- likely when Republicans control the House and Democrats have a majority in the Senate -- the two are taken to conference committee to be reconciled.\n\nThen both houses vote on the conference committee report. If it is approved, the president can sign or veto it.\n\nNote the lack of negotiations between the White House and congressional leaders. Speaker John Boehner decided they're useless after the failure of his grand bargain talks with Barack Obama.\n\nUnder regular order, House Republicans had little leverage when the fiscal cliff loomed on New Year's Day. Taxes were to go up by $4.5 trillion if the House didn't act. So Republicans accepted higher rates on those earning more than $400,000.\n\nNow, Republicans have the leverage. The budget sequester to automatically take effect March 1 would cut spending by $1 trillion. Republicans don't like the $500 billion defense spending cuts, but they can stomach them.\n\nObama took to the teleprompter yesterday afternoon to call for short-term spending cuts and revenue increases through elimination of deductions.
