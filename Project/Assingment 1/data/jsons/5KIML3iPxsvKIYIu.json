At that time , President Donald Trump tweeted that in order to `` protect the jobs of GREAT American citizens , '' he would be suspending immigration to the United States . On Tuesday evening , he provided further details , saying he would order a 60-day pause that would apply only to people seeking green cards to become permanent US residents . It was unclear whether temporary workers would be affected .\nThis imminent suspension of the issuance of work visas and green cards for employment-based immigrants shows -- among other things - how the Trump administration is planning to use the Covid-19 pandemic to further its agenda of severely limiting immigration to the United States .\nIn-person immigration processing had already been suspended owing to the virus , following the closure of consulates and United States Citizenship and Immigration Service ( USCIS ) processing centers . However , the suspension of processing , which has been in place for several weeks , differs from the hold on green card applications that has just been announced by the President , in that it 's a cessation based on policy desires and not pandemic-related closures . In the former case , those waiting for new visas and those whose H-1B visas were running out were given a 60 day period in which to file their claims . During that time , they could remain in the country . It now seems those temporary residents may not be affected immediately by the executive order . However , many of those visa holders would have been waiting to convert their status to permanent residency ; the typical H1-B or O visa-holder who applies for a green card is very likely to be a skilled or talented professional who has lived and worked in the US for several years . With the President 's announcement , those applicants for new visas will be thrown into chaos and may well have to leave .\nIn a statement following the President 's Monday tweet , White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany stated that the move was made to protect `` the health and economic well-being of Americans , '' a veiled but transparent reference to the virus -- though the United States has the highest number of cases globally . Her statement said further : `` Decades of record immigration had produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens , especially for African-American and Latino workers . ''\nThis White House line claiming that immigration hurts American citizens is incorrect . A National Bureau of Economic Research study , which looked at the impact of immigration on US workers between 1990-2004 ( the years of highest immigration to the United States ) , found that the wages of American-born workers actually increased owing to immigration .\nBeyond the mistruths offered to justify it , this action on immigration is likely to be yet another shock to the already flailing economy . Now suddenly US employers that were relying on talented employees being able to convert their status so they could remain in the US will face terrible uncertainty . Answering questions about the imminent order on Tuesday , President Trump said his first priority was ensuring American citizens had jobs .\nThe H-1B ( or highly skilled worker ) visa holders who are in line for green cards face the worst of this chaos ; they could now lose their place in line and may have to leave the lives they have established in the US to return to their countries of origin . In an instant , their lives and futures have been upended and now hinge on the wording of the President 's expected executive order .\nThe White House statement provides no information on how so many people will actually be removed from the United States in the coming months , when travel is limited and some borders are closed .

Visas are granted entirely at the discretion of the issuing government and are not subject to discrimination claims as would be the case if the petitioners were US citizens .
