(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)\n\nKentucky and New York had primaries Tuesday, but the winners of the closest races probably won\u2019t be known until next week. What\u2019s going on?\n\nGet used to it. Slow vote counts and delayed results are a feature of elections during the pandemic and are likely to continue into the general election in November, when many election officials say that, absent a landslide, it won\u2019t be clear who won the presidential election for several days.\n\n\u201cAmericans need to learn a little patience,\u201d said Josh Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky who studies voter rights. \u201cThe fact of not knowing who won right away is the process actually working.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE HOLDUP?\n\nIn short, more Americans are voting by mail \u2014 heeding health officials\u2019 warnings that close contact at polling places could spread the coronavirus \u2014 and mail ballots take longer to count.\n\nOfficials have to process the ballots before they can count them. Election workers must open them, make sure the voter is registered and filled out the correct ballot, and perform any required security checks such as verifying signatures -- all the things that poll workers do when voters show up at neighborhood polling places.\n\nSome states have laws that limit when election officials can even start this process.

That also takes time.\n\nWHY DO WE KNOW SOME WINNERS AND NOT OTHERS?\n\nThe Associated Press has long declared winners based on partial election results. But with so many outstanding votes in Kentucky and New York, the AP was only able to declare winners in the most lopsided races. Those races included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s victory in the Republican primary in Kentucky, and New York Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win over a challenger in the Democratic primary there.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut most of the high-profile races in each state were more competitive. That\u2019s why the AP did not call a winner on election night in the Kentucky Democratic Senate primary between Amy McGrath and Charles Booker, or in the Democratic primary in New York\u2019s 16th Congressional District between the incumbent, Rep.

Congress is debating whether to send money to states to help, but it\u2019s been tied up and might not arrive soon.\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR NOVEMBER?\n\nAll the factors delaying the count in Kentucky and New York are present in presidential battleground states this November.\n\nMany are expected to go from a relatively low rate of mail voting to the majority of ballots being cast that way. The key swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania have laws preventing mail votes from being processed early. And Democrats are pushing courts to require states to count ballots that arrive after Election Day, ensuring that a large number of votes wouldn\u2019t be in election officials\u2019 hands when polls close.\n\nThat might not matter in a blowout.
