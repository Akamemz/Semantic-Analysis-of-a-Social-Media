We were attacked apparently by Al Qaeda and it is a very troubling development , '' Romney said during a campaign stop in Ohio .\nRomney 's comments underscored complaints made by Republican lawmakers , who question the administration 's shifting explanation , starting with claims that the Sept. 11 strike was `` spontaneous '' violence tied to protests over an anti-Islam film produced in the U.S. Obama officials gradually walked back that description , and Obama acknowledged Monday that it clearly `` was n't just a mob action '' -- though he did not go as far as to call it a terrorist attack .\nOne of Obama 's advisers , National Counterterrorism Center Director Matt Olsen , was more direct last week , testifying to Congress that the four Americans `` were killed in the course of a terrorist attack . ''\n`` When the director of the Counterterrorism Center comes to Congress and testifies and says that this is a terrorist attack ... I think you would want to ask that question of the president , why he is not on the same page with his own administration officials ? '' Ryan said .\nObama devoted much of his address Tuesday to the United Nations General Assembly to the attack in Libya and unrest in the Mideast . He paid tribute to Ambassador Chris Stevens , who died in the attack , recalling Stevens ' time serving in the Peace Corps as an English instructor in Morocco .\nThe president went on to restate his administration 's support for the Arab Spring , calling it a `` season of progress . '' But he said the recent violence and unrest is indicative of the difficulties along the way . `` True democracy -- real freedom -- is hard work , '' he said .\nThe president , however , did not mention terrorism in his U.N. speech , and he has yet to elaborate on how extremists were able to launch what now appears to have been a coordinated attack on the consulate . Obama and others in his administration have been criticized by Republicans for not taking a more definitive stance on the attack .\nObama , in an interview taped Monday on ABC 's `` The View , '' condemned extremist elements in the Muslim world and vowed the U.S. is `` not going to shrink back from the world because of this . ''\n`` We are going to hunt down those who did this , '' he said . `` We will bring them to justice . ''\nHe also said in the interview , which aired Tuesday , that there was `` no doubt '' that the assault `` was n't just a mob action '' but a sign of extremism in nations lacking stability . `` What 's been interesting , just this past week , there were these massive protests against these extremists militias that are suspected , maybe , of having been involved in this attack . ''\nIn interviews and at campaign events Monday , Romney assailed Obama 's leadership abroad , leading a chorus of Republicans in criticizing the president for what they said was minimizing the death of the Ambassador Stevens . Obama , in an interview with CBS ' `` 60 Minutes , '' said recent violence in the Mideast was due to `` bumps in the road '' on the way to democracy . Romney on Monday also suggested Obama was leaving American foreign policy at the mercy of events instead of working to shape global politics in America 's interest .",
