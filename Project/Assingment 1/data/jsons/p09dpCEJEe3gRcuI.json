It \u2019 s called a \u201c caravan , \u201d because \u201c invading horde \u201d is a little too \u201c on the nose \u201d for the liberal media to report . Whatever you call it , it has to not only be stopped , they have to be prevented from happing again in the future . But how ?\nThere are obvious ways like building a wall and streamlining the deportation process . But there are more , less obvious ways , too . Here are some suggestions .\nMexico doesn \u2019 t care that tens , if not hundreds , of thousands of illegal aliens march through their country on the way to the US every year , and they really have no reason to . If they were stopping in Mexico they \u2019 d be tossed out like yesterday \u2019 s garbage , as Mexico actually enforces its immigration laws . Since they aren \u2019 t , and it \u2019 s a way to stick a thumb in the eye of President Trump , the government looks the other way .\nBut we have an advantage . Mexico is dependent upon the United States for a great many things , none more important than the money Mexican nationals here legally and the millions of illegal alien Mexicans send back home to their families every day . We can tax that . Hell , we can stop it . That would get the government \u2019 s attention and help prevent the invaders from receiving a 1700 mile police escort .\nDemocrats are never going to care about the invasion , they see only potential voters in the uneducated and illiterate in their own language masses ( to say nothing of being able to communicate in English ) and that \u2019 s all they care about . Voters have to make them care . Voters also have to make squishy Republicans care .\nBoth parties support illegal immigration , Democrats just do it uniformly while only some Republicans are on board . A bipartisan cadre of rich donors love cheap labor , and people who feel more than they think like to pretend they \u2019 re being compassionate . But artificially depressing wages isn \u2019 t compassionate .\nSerious fines for employers who hire illegal aliens , and I \u2019 m talking company-threatening fines , would make work nearly impossible to find and dry up a major part of their incentive to be here . This would likely have to be coupled with work requirements for welfare recipients , especially in times of full employment like now , but those should be in place anyway .\nBy making hiring illegal aliens so unattractive , and dangerous , they \u2019 d have little to come here for .\nYour geography of birth should have nothing to do with citizenship , and it was never meant to . Liberals bastardized our laws to create this mess , it \u2019 s time to fix it . It may sound heartless , but I don \u2019 t care . I care about Americans first and anyone else a distant second .\nAmerican taxpayers are on the hook for a fortune every year just covering the cost of births of illegals , and \u201c birth tourism \u201d from Asia , particularly China , is a very real thing . It \u2019 s crazy , and no other nation on the planet has such a stupid system . It has to end .\nThe US has to take a more active role in Latin America .\nThe carrot and stick approach can be very useful here . We send a lot of money south in foreign aid . That blind system should end . If governments are corrupt , cut them off ; if they won \u2019 t control the chaos within their own borders to the point that people flee en masse , cut them off . When the Soviet Union was a threat it might have made sense to deal with despots . But the Soviet Union doesn \u2019 t exist anymore .
