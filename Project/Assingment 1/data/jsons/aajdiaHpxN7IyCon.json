Civil and economic freedom can contribute to the common good , and attention to the common good ( while noble in its own right ) can also be instrumental to the preservation of our liberties .\nThough some sectors of the post-liberal Right and Left have soured on the idea of \u201c capitalism , \u201d much could be said on behalf of this system for contributing to the common good . It has slashed poverty across the globe , and , as Benedict XVI has suggested in Caritas in Veritate , the diversity of employment opportunities provided in a market economy helps open up the realization of individual gifts . For all the faults of the high neoliberal era ( and there are many ) , it has also helped lift hundreds of millions out of crushing poverty . One needn \u2019 t be a radical utilitarian to think that this is a considerable accomplishment . The birth of the industrialized , modern market has helped nurture a modern middle class , one of the bulwarks of stable democratic governance .\nAs Hawley and Rubio have both noted , there are reasons to believe that trends over the past two decades have not been in the national interest \u2014 or the interest of a sustainable freedom . With skyrocketing deaths of despair , diminished GDP growth , and slipping productivity growth , the American political system is under increasing strain . Chris Arnade in his recent book Dignity chronicles the struggles ( and deep-grained resilience ) of many parts of this country . These economically hollowed-out areas are a breeding ground for human misery and political alienation .\nMeanwhile , a few urban hubs \u2014 especially New York , San Francisco , and Washington , D.C. \u2014 have hoovered up many credentialed Americans with high levels of social capital . But this concentration of opportunity generates its own tensions . Ferociously battling for gold-flake-topped slices of a shrinking pie , ambitious young meritocrats find themselves in a world of long hours , vertigo-inducing costs of living , and a haunting sense of gilded precariousness . This is a perfect storm for political radicalization . With family formation and hopes of a secure middle-class life indefinitely deferred , the would-be members of the new gentry class find themselves increasingly frustrated \u2014 and they have the cultural influence to make their frustrations resonate throughout the broader political system . Much of the new radicalism is fed not by the unemployed in the economic hinterlands or inner cities but by the interns and contingent staffers at prestige institutions . Here , again , the increasing concentration of financial and cultural power encourages social conflict . As avenues for opportunity close , battles intensify for the privilege of controlling the remaining paths to influence and power . For the ideological faction that does control them , the reward grows greater .\nAmerican journalism exemplifies this tendency . The shuttering of local newsrooms across the country has led to a press corps more focused on national politics , and a financially embattled press environment places a greater premium on generating clicks and controversy than on the sober work of getting the facts right . To maintain market share , the remaining national media behemoths have favored polarization , and aspiring journalists have a motivation to feed into it . As the middle ranks of journalists are gutted , news media have been pulled between the teeming masses of the underpaid and a ( relatively ) few marquee names . One need only open a national newspaper or watch a few minutes of a cable-news broadcast to see the damage that dynamic has wrought .\nNational policy choices ( on trade , finance , immigration , and so forth ) have contributed to these trends , and policy choices could be made to address them . While federal policy is not the only lever for achieving some of these ends , it has an important role to play . For instance , Senator Rubio in his speech highlighted the role of an expanded child tax credit and , in general , of increased tax benefits for families with minor children .\nImmigration , health care , finance , infrastructure , and even federal employment are other policy areas for such reform . Through setting immigration policy , the federal government can influence the labor market , and a tight labor market is one of the greatest boons to working families . Immigration patterns , both legal and illegal , have in recent decades increased pressure on the wages of Americans without a college degree . Compounding this trend , guest-worker programs also risk undermining the employment opportunities of American college graduates . Taking efforts to tighten the labor market for Americans ( both native-born and recent immigrants ) could broaden opportunity and facilitate social integration .\nA capitalism for the common good might confront the exploding costs of health care , which weigh on American families and threaten to undermine the dynamism of the American economy as a whole . While Republicans have made considerable effort in recent decades to cut income taxes , health-care costs devour a bigger portion of the income of many American families than income taxes do . Some of the interventions in this sector might include federal subsidies to help backstop health-care financing for less affluent Americans . But some of this effort to combat health-care costs would probably also include some market-oriented measures , such as repealing \u201c certificate of need \u201d laws , breaking up medical cartels , allowing more-flexible licensing for medical professionals , and pushing for price transparency . Some medical lobbying groups might push back against some of these efforts , but they might soon face a choice between market-oriented reforms and total government control of the health-care sector . Reduction of medical costs could advance another public interest as well : making the federal budget more sustainable ( as medical spending is a significant driver of federal expenditures ) .\nMany critiques of the high neoliberal era have trained their fire on financialization , and here again market principles can reinforce a common-good correction . For instance , one of the stronger arguments for reinstating some version of the Glass-Steagall separation of investment from commercial banking is that this wall of separation would fracture banking interests , thereby making it harder for one set of interests to gain excessive influence over federal legislation . The era of increased financial consolidation has made the American economy more vulnerable to systemic risk , so undoing some of that would help put the economy on sounder footing . More broadly , more-robust anti-monopoly efforts could help spur more market growth while also empowering a more diverse set of actors .\nThe infrastructure of the 21st century includes roads and bridges as well as digital communications . To maintain great-power status , the United States will almost certainly have to defend and extend this infrastructure . Development of it can sustain local communities and also enhance opportunities for private individuals . Moreover , protecting diverse supply-chain production networks in the United States serves both the national geopolitical interest and economic vibrancy .\nSenators Hawley and Marsha Blackburn ( R. , Tenn. ) have recently proposed moving many federal agencies away from the Beltway to other parts of this country . Even relocating a few agencies could help reverse the concentration of cultural and political capital in the Beltway , while also providing new opportunities for struggling parts of the country , from inner-city Detroit to rural West Virginia . A few hundred ( or even thousand ) jobs here and there wouldn \u2019 t transform the American economy , but they would send a message and help diversify social capital .\nWhile this invocation of a capitalism of the common good has struck some observers as a radical new idea , steps to address the common good are well within the mainstream of American policy .
