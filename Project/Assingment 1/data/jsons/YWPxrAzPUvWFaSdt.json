During the presser the false eyebrow Trudeau was wearing over his left eye partially fell off .\nStupidity isn \u2019 t illegal , but it can be evidence of a crime . Mr. Lamar Brown is serving an 18-year sentence for burglary in South Carolina . The state \u2019 s supreme court upheld his conviction despite his lawyers \u2019 argument that his cell phone , found abandoned at the crime scene , was searched illegally .

Instead of the rock , wood , or air-filled rubber circles mankind has used since the days of Fred Flintstone , the new DARPA wheel changes shape at the push of a button .

Even if you have to sacrifice everything. \u201d What Kaepernick has sacrificed \u2014 he \u2019 s being paid millions of dollars by Nike \u2014 is not at all clear . What is clear is the fact that by the end of August one hundred law enforcement officers had died in the line of duty this year .

When she ordered lox , cream cheese and capers \u2014 so far so good \u2014 she then committed the deadly sin of completing her order by saying she wanted it on a cinnamon raisin bagel . This sin is even greater than that committed by John Kasich during his ridiculous 2016 presidential campaign when he ate pizza with a knife and fork .\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstein told his staff to examine the wisdom and legality of selling the naming rights to NASA \u2019 s rockets and spacecraft .

Owner Kevin Jones had applied for a special use permit to do so but the town council ( which didn \u2019 t want a gun store in town ) denied the permit after stalling for six months . Jones subsequently decided to sell women \u2019 s lingerie in the gun shop , and the town can \u2019 t do a damned thing about it . \u201c Bullets and Bras \u201d ?\nScientists at Harvard and Yale jointly proposed a cure for global warming . They want to give the earth a \u201c stratospheric aerosol injection \u201d to block the sun \u2019 s rays and thus keep it cool here on the ground .

Asked what it wanted most, the computer answered that it wanted to eat the questioner\u2019s liver \u201c\u2026with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.\u201d\n\nThe Miss America beauty contest announced that it would no longer have the girls compete based on their appearance. There will be no more bikini parades or \u201clookism.\u201d Thus was charted a path to yet another comeback for Hillary Clinton and Roseanne Barr.\n\nAt the G-7 summit, Canada\u2019s metrosexual Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was so upset with President Trump that he held a news conference to bash Trump after the event. During the presser the false eyebrow Trudeau was wearing over his left eye partially fell off.\n\nStupidity isn\u2019t illegal, but it can be evidence of a crime. Mr. Lamar Brown is serving an 18-year sentence for burglary in South Carolina. The state\u2019s supreme court upheld his conviction despite his lawyers\u2019 argument that his cell phone, found abandoned at the crime scene, was searched illegally. The cops had searched the phone after entering 1-2-3-4 as the passcode, which unlocked the phone and enabled the cops to trace the phone to Brown.\n\nBill Clinton, saddened that the days are gone when a president could get oral sex from an intern in the Oval Office, confessed, \u201cI think the norms have really changed in terms of, what you can do to somebody against their will, how much you can crowd their space, make them miserable at work.\u201d\n\nAs the month ended, the mischievous geniuses at the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency \u2014 DARPA \u2014 announced that they had, just for the hell of it, reinvented the wheel. Instead of the rock, wood, or air-filled rubber circles mankind has used since the days of Fred Flintstone, the new DARPA wheel changes shape at the push of a button. The round wheel becomes a triangle with a rotating tank track that can climb over almost anything. Every enlisted man who has ever had to push a HUMVEE out of the mud rejoiced.\n\nJuly\n\nBrigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali, head of Iran\u2019s Civil Defense Organization, claimed that Israel was committing \u201cweather theft\u201d by manipulating clouds to prevent rain from falling on Iran. Before special counsel Robert Mueller could open an investigation into Jalali\u2019s claim, the Israeli Mossad \u2014 or at least the brilliant smartasses who run the Mossad\u2019s Twitter page (@MossadIL) \u2014 bragged about their ability to steal water from Iranian clouds.\n\nRumors circulated that Hillary Clinton had abandoned the idea of competing in the Miss America contest for another run at the presidency in 2020. Republican and conservative reaction was consistent: PLEASE! OHPLEASE! OHPLEEEEEASE!\n\nCutie Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat old time Dem Joe Crowley in a congressional primary in New York City. She immediately hit the campaign trail in several states, accompanied by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The only thing better than another Hillary presidential bid would be a Sanders-Cortez ticket in 2020.\n\nAugust\n\nThe New York Times welcomed Mizz Sarah Jeong to its editorial board and reporting staff. She is apparently qualified for her new job because she has tweeted jewels of editorial wisdom such as, \u201cDumb*ss f***ing white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants,\u201d and \u201cWhite men are bulls***.\u201d (There were no asterisks in the original. The asterisks are my totally futile effort to preserve some standards in journalism.)\n\nA RAND Corporation survey determined that Marines were more likely to engage in unprotected sex and other dangerous behaviors than members of other services. Somebody ought to tell RAND\u2019s \u201cexperts\u201d that Marines have been engaging in dangerous behaviors around the world since 1775.\n\nThe city of Berezniki, Russia \u2014 somewhere in the Ural Mountains \u2014 held its annual \u201cMosquito Festival.\u201d It featured prizes for the people with the skinniest, most mosquito-like legs and the \u201ctastiest girl\u201d contest, the winner of which received the most bites in the period of twenty minutes. Why would anyone think that life in Putin\u2019s Russia is a dull misery?\n\nThe Noo Yawk Mets appeared on the way to a record-setting season, losing so many games that they didn\u2019t seem to qualify for last place in the National League. After they lost a game to the Washington Nationals by the franchise-record margin of 25-4, a New York-based online mental health marketplace, UMA Health, offered free therapy to distraught Mets fans. It didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe Chinese government banned the latest Disney \u201cWinnie the Pooh\u201d movie, Christopher Robin. They did so because Chinese President Xi Jinping was being mocked for his resemblance to A. A. Milnes\u2019s portly bear. Pooh Xi?\n\nA Mexico City restaurant was busted for serving tarantula tacos because the \u201cMexican red rump\u201d tarantula is a protected species. The same joint reportedly still serves tacos with grasshoppers and scorpions.\n\nIran unveiled its new domestically-produced fighter jet, the \u201cKowsar,\u201d which appears to be a copy of the Northrop F-5, one of the finest examples of 1960s technology.\n\nAs the month ended, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and challenger Cynthia Nixon had a heated debate before the Dem primary election. At one point when each was accusing the other of lying Cuomo said, \u201cI\u2019ll stop lying as soon as you do.\u201d\n\nSeptember\n\nAthletic shoe company Nike chose former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick to be its ad spokesman this year. Kaepernick is memorable only for kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in what he said was a protest of police brutality and oppression of black people. His 2016 protests caught on among the spoiled brats who play for the NFL and continued sporadically two years later.\n\nKaepernick\u2019s motto is, \u201cBelieve in something. Even if you have to sacrifice everything.\u201d What Kaepernick has sacrificed \u2014 he\u2019s being paid millions of dollars by Nike \u2014 is not at all clear. What is clear is the fact that by the end of August one hundred law enforcement officers had died in the line of duty this year. In a Tweet praising Kaepernick, former Iranian prez Mahmoud \u201cDeath to America\u201d Ahmadinejad said it was unfortunate that Kaepernick wasn\u2019t on a team roster this year.\n\nTennis great Roger Federer lost his U.S.; Open match to the 55th\u2013 ranked player in hot weather. The New York Times blamed Federer\u2019s loss on climate change.\n\nDemocrat Cynthia Nixon blew her chance to defeat Andrew Cuomo for the Dem nomination in the New York governor\u2019s race at Zabar\u2019s Deli. When she ordered lox, cream cheese and capers \u2014 so far so good \u2014 she then committed the deadly sin of completing her order by saying she wanted it on a cinnamon raisin bagel. This sin is even greater than that committed by John Kasich during his ridiculous 2016 presidential campaign when he ate pizza with a knife and fork.\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstein told his staff to examine the wisdom and legality of selling the naming rights to NASA\u2019s rockets and spacecraft. The possibilities are endless. \u201cOne small step for a man, one giant leap for Pizza Hut.\u201d\n\nCharlotte\u2019s Legendary Lobster Pound of Southwest Harbor, Maine, announced that it was no longer going to allow lobsters to suffer by tossing them into boiling water. Before a lobster will be cooked at the restaurant, it will be immersed in water infused with marijuana smoke which, says proprietress Charlotte Gill, should sedate them.\n\nOctober\n\nNew Jersey finally ranked first in a survey. Unfortunately, its first-place rank was for the most-stressed population of any state.\n\nProcter & Gamble applied to the U.S. Patent Office for trademarks on the acronyms \u201cLOL,\u201d \u201cNBD,\u201d \u201cWTF,\u201d and \u201cFML\u201d often used by millennials in text messages. Advertisements to market \u201cWTF\u201d hand soap and \u201cFML\u201d tooth brushes may prove difficult to write.\n\nSen. Fauxcahontas Warren finally took a DNA test to prove her Cherokee heritage. The results showed that she was about 1/1,000 native American, which is about the same as any American of European descent. The Cherokee Nation was not amused.\n\nHillary Clinton joked that black men such as Cory Booker and Eric Holder \u201call look alike.\u201d None of the media, even the New York Times and MSNBC, demanded that she be tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail, so let us be the first.\n\nNovember\n\nThe Delaware History Museum began selling the \u201cJoe Biden-scented\u201d candle for $22. The candle is supposed to lead you to restored senses of hope and optimism. It reportedly smells like orange Gatorade. No one is yet selling a Hillary Clinton-scented candle, thank Heaven.\n\nThe morning after Election Day, Newsweek beat the rest of the media to the first story about the 2020 presidential campaign with a pro-Dem story. It speculated that political newbie Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2014 fresh from being beaten by Ted Cruz \u2014 would be our next president.\n\nScientists at the University of Grenada determined that, despite the Pinocchio fable, a person\u2019s nose actually shrinks when he tells a lie. Empirical evidence \u2014 e.g., Bill\u2019s and Hillary\u2019s honkers \u2014 suggests the U of G\u2019s theory is either highly limited or entirely incorrect.\n\nWhen incoming House Dems threatened to vote against Nancy Pelosi in her effort to become House Speaker, Trump offered to get a lot of votes for her. Meanwhile, Pelosi praised Al Sharpton for \u201csaving America.\u201d\n\nNewly elected congresswoman to be Alexandria Cutie-Cortez stopped complaining that she couldn\u2019t afford an apartment in D.C. long enough to say, \u201cIf we work our butts off to make sure that we take back all three chambers of Congress \u2014 uh, rather, all three chambers of government: the presidency, the Senate, and the House.\u201d\n\nThe town of Hamilton, Virginia, decided that a local gun store \u2014 named \u201cBullets and Beans\u201d \u2014 couldn\u2019t sell coffee on its premises. Owner Kevin Jones had applied for a special use permit to do so but the town council (which didn\u2019t want a gun store in town) denied the permit after stalling for six months. Jones subsequently decided to sell women\u2019s lingerie in the gun shop, and the town can\u2019t do a damned thing about it. \u201cBullets and Bras\u201d?\n\nScientists at Harvard and Yale jointly proposed a cure for global warming. They want to give the earth a \u201cstratospheric aerosol injection\u201d to block the sun\u2019s rays and thus keep it cool here on the ground. Unfortunately, Coppertone says it will take it at least 124 years to manufacture the necessary 37 billion tons of SPF 30 sunblock by which time \u2014 according to Algore \u2014 the planet will have already been incinerated.\n\nThe city of Tulsa, Oklahoma is offering a bounty of up to $10,000 to people who relocate there and stay for a year. So far, over twelve hundred people have applied. All of them are currently residents of New Jersey.\n\nDr. Gavin Clarkson and his fianc\u00e9e were denied a marriage license by the District of Columbia Superior Court Clerk because the clerk and her supervisor both insisted that their New Mexico drivers\u2019 licenses weren\u2019t enough without a Mexican passport. The marriage license was finally provided after a Google search proved to the clerks\u2019 satisfaction that New Mexico was actually a U.S. state.\n\nDecember\n\nRev. Al Sharpton sold his life story for $531,000 to the National Action Network, a supposedly charitable organization of which he is founder and president. There were no other bidders.\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hi) said the reason Democrats have a hard time connecting with voters is that the Dems are too smart. She added that Democrats need to stop speaking in a way that comes off as manipulative or strokes fear and resentment, but wouldn\u2019t that silence them altogether?\n\nThe Medical Journal of Australia published a study by New Zealand\u2019s University of Otago which determined that James Bond met six of eleven criteria for being an alcohol abuser and determined that 007\u2019s binge drinking was affecting his work because he sleeps with the enemy. The study concludes that MI6 needs to redefine Bond\u2019s job description to reduce stress.\n\nCongresswoman-elect Alexandria Cutie-Cortez, exhausted from all her political activity, decided to take a week off for \u201cself-care\u201d and, saying she didn\u2019t know how, invited suggestions on how to do it. We suggested she spend it reading The Federalist Papers to acquaint herself with the system of government in which she is about to serve.\n\nThe year ended in the midst of a shutdown of about one quarter of the government, those agencies that are deemed non-essential. As the clock ticked to midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve, we were left to wonder why those non-essential agencies shouldn\u2019t be closed permanently.\n\nThe best thing we can say about 2018 is that it\u2019s over and probably only weeks before the first Dem will announce her 2020 presidential candidacy.\n\nHappy New Year all our readers. And fasten your seat belts because 2019 is going to be a wild ride.",
