Change their preference . Vote for the Republican if they voted for President Obama in 2012 . Vote for the Democrat if they pulled the lever for Mitt Romney last time out .\nThat \u2019 s because the United States is becoming a country where no one changes his or her mind about presidential politics . Voters are increasingly divided into reliably partisan camps . Those swing voters pundits love to talk about ? They \u2019 re mythical creatures , unicorns , nothing but a flash of white in the forest at dusk . New research shows they \u2019 re now about 5 percent of the US electorate \u2013 the lowest percentage ever recorded .\nWhy such a static situation ? It \u2019 s not because most Americans are in love with their choices . Fear and anger are likely causes of much of this sorting . Many voters aren \u2019 t so much trying to elect their candidates as block the ones from the other party , whom they see as a danger to the republic . Negative partisanship has become one of the strongest forces in this particle physics theory of US politics .\nAnd that may be just fine with the two big parties that govern the nation . There \u2019 s evidence that they devote more attention to rallying committed supporters than reaching out to the uncommitted in presidential campaigns . They \u2019 ve been moving in that direction since 2000 , when the virtual dead heat between George W. Bush and Al Gore showed them \u2013 and the rest of the nation \u2013 how closely balanced Republicans and Democrats are .\n\u201c Campaigns are changing their strategies to focus on the people who are at the ideological extremes rather than centrist voters , \u201d says Costas Panagopoulos , a political scientist at Fordham University in New York who \u2019 s researching the subject . \u201c My sense is that \u2019 s operating in primaries as well as general elections . \u201d\nIndeed , the decline of swing voting may help explain the partisan dynamics of this unusual presidential primary season , in which the ideological separation between the parties seems particularly wide .\nConsider the GOP : Since the days of Richard Nixon , the maxim of the party \u2019 s establishment has been that candidates need to run right in the primary , then pivot back toward the center in the general election . But on immigration , many of the Republican hopefuls have moved so far to the right \u2013 No amnesty ! Ship immigrants here illegally home ! \u2013 that they might have a difficult time reversing course if they win the nomination .\nThere \u2019 s been similar rightward movement by some GOP candidates on abortion and other provocative issues .\nMeanwhile , Democrats are doing much the same thing , only pointing in the opposite direction . They \u2019 re talking about everything from free college tuition to paid family leave and higher taxes on the rich . It \u2019 s hard to imagine front-runner Hillary Clinton repeating her husband Bill \u2019 s 1996 pronouncement that \u201c the era of big government is over . \u201d\nThere are a number of reasons for the development of this partisan chasm . They include the angry mood of the electorate and the rise of particular outsider candidates ( yes , we mean Donald Trump ) .\nBut a major cause may be that a candidate who tacks to the center will find it a much less populated place . Compared with election cycles past , there aren \u2019 t as many unaffiliated voters sitting around wondering whom to vote for . The polarization of US politics so evident in Washington has filtered down to the grass-roots level . This means parties are freer to adopt the policy choices of their most committed members , because swing voters have become less important .\n\u201c Party elites can ignore the moderating specter of floating voters because polarization has changed many of them into loyal supporters , \u201d writes Corwin D. Smidt , a Michigan State University assistant professor of political science , in his recently published journal article \u201c Polarization and the Decline of the American Floating Voter . \u201d\nLet \u2019 s stop a moment to make an important point : Swing , or floating , voters are not the same thing as people who declare themselves political independents .\nSelf-described independents are the largest category of voters in the US . A record 43 percent of Americans now say they are neither Republicans nor Democrats , but members of the unaffiliated group of \u201c I , \u201d according to Gallup figures .\nHowever , if pressed , about half of these independents will say they lean toward one party or another . Another large chunk consists of low-information voters who don \u2019 t usually bother to go to the polls .\nAnd many of those who remain have voted like partisans in recent years , whatever their personal beliefs and political motivation .\nThat \u2019 s the upshot of Professor Smidt \u2019 s groundbreaking study , published in October in the American Journal of Political Science . Drawing on data from the American National Election Studies ( ANES ) \u2013 a series of academic voter surveys dating back to 1948 \u2013 he shows that recent presidential elections exhibit the lowest levels of floating voting ever recorded .\nSwing voting \u2013 defined as casting a presidential ballot for a different party than one voted for the previous election \u2013 used to be relatively common . Between 1956 and 1980 the average rate of vote switching among the entire US electorate was 12 percent \u2013 easily a big enough bloc of voters to determine the outcome of an election .\nSince then that figure has dropped precipitously . In 2008 only 8.1 percent of voters reported voting for a different party than in 2004 . In 2012 , it hit an all-time low , with only 5.2 percent of Americans voting for a different major-party nominee , according to Smidt .\nMeanwhile , the percentage of \u201c standpatters \u201d \u2013 people who vote for the same party over a series of consecutive elections \u2013 has risen correspondingly and is now approaching 60 percent of Americans of voting age . ( Nonvoters and periodic voters account for the rest . )\nThe result : There may be less and less reason for presidential campaigns to trim their rough edges and appeal to swing voters in the middle . Over time this could lead to more-partisan candidates \u2013 and presidents \u2013 who in turn push voters more to the ideological edges .\n\u201c More Americans today may not identify with a party , but their behavior indicates we have never observed as many loyal supporters , \u201d writes Smidt .\nTo see how this looks in real life , consider the opinions of Tyrone Quinn , an investment businessman from Chicago interviewed while on a flight to Boston . Mr. Quinn says he prefers to identify himself as an independent because voters should strive to choose whichever candidate they think is the best person .\n\u201c The hard left and the hard right , both of \u2019 em kind of make me sick , \u201d he says . \u201c Career politicians make me sick , too .... Give me a good , smart , wise , and decent person . \u201d\nQuinn says that on the local level he \u2019 s voted for candidates of both parties . For instance , he \u2019 s backed Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White , a Democrat , because he feels Mr. White \u201c is a good guy . \u201d\nBut Quinn has exclusively voted for Republicans in national elections . He believes that on the Washington level the Democratic Party is in favor of uncontrolled regulation . Democrats have a \u201c total lack of regard for spending other people \u2019 s hard-earned money , \u201d he says .\nWhy have floating voters stopped floating around ? Quinn \u2019 s answers hint at one major possible reason : In today \u2019 s polarized political world , almost everybody has a clear idea of what he or she thinks US political parties believe .\nSometimes these views tilt the electorate in favor of one party . Sometimes they tilt it in favor of the other . But there is little confusion or indecision about the Democrats \u2019 or Republicans \u2019 identities .\nAs recently as the early 1980s , the parties were still somewhat mixed up , ideologically speaking . The Democrats had a significant conservative Southern wing . The Republicans had liberals , primarily in the Northeast .\nBut that \u2019 s winnowed out now . Liberals and conservatives have separated into completely different camps . The differences between the parties have become so marked and clear that even Americans who seldom follow politics can tell them apart . So they pick a side , and stick with it .\n\u201c People are more confident in their opinions when they see polarized parties , \u201d says Smidt in an interview . \u201c They think , \u2018 Well , if the choices are so stark , it \u2019 s just not a gray area at all . \u2019 \u201d\nAnd \u201c stark , \u201d in this context , might mean \u201c worrisome. \u201d Because there \u2019 s also evidence that voters are sticking with one party not because they \u2019 re excited about it , but because they dislike , even fear , the other side .\nThat \u2019 s what research by Emory University political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster indicates , in any case . They set out to directly study why partisan voting is going up at a time when fewer voters than ever label themselves Democrats or Republicans .\nTheir conclusion : The trend is driven by what they call \u201c negative partisanship. \u201d In other words , fear and antipathy . Voters aren \u2019 t so much trying to elect someone as block somebody else from winning .\nTheir data showed that the more US voters disliked the other party , the greater the probability they would stick with their own party \u2019 s choice .\n\u201c Along with increasing awareness of party differences , increasing negativism toward the opposing party has contributed significantly to the rise of party loyalty and straight ticket voting in recent years , \u201d they write .\nA simple thermometer scale of attitudes toward the big US parties shows the nature of this trend . Since 1980 , according to ANES data , Americans \u2019 feelings toward their own party have cooled slightly , dipping from an average of 72 degrees to 70 degrees in 2012 . Their feelings about the other party ? They \u2019 ve frozen , dropping from 45 degrees in 1980 to 30 degrees in 2012 .\nWhat \u2019 s behind this disparity , Mr. Abramowitz and Mr. Webster theorize , are increasing racial and religious differences between Democrats and Republicans that make it easier for voters to see their opponents as threatening , as \u201c others . \u201d\nNonwhites now account for 45 percent of Democratic voters on the national level , but only 11 percent of Republicans . Meanwhile , the percentage of white voters who are religiously observant ( attend services at least once a week ) and lean GOP has increased significantly , from 48 percent in 1980 to 72 percent in 2012 .\nThe religious divide in particular has helped create a wide gap in party attitudes on volatile cultural issues such as abortion and gay marriage .\n\u201c The growing cultural divide among white voters and the growing racial divide among all voters have both contributed to a widening ideological divide between Democratic and Republican voters , \u201d write Abramowitz and Webster .\nThis divide echoes in the words of Tara Schiraldi , a young liberal Democrat in her last year of law school at Georgetown University , interviewed in Philadelphia on a job-hunting trip .\nShe \u2019 s interested in working with a nonprofit that advocates for juveniles . She \u2019 s worked for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center . She \u2019 s concerned about what she sees as a \u201c school-to-prison \u201d pipeline in America for disadvantaged youth .\nBut the issue she keeps coming back to is women . She says she draws a line on women \u2019 s issues such as access to birth control , sex education \u2013 and , most notably , abortion .\n\u201c The way in which the Republican Party deals with women ... makes it difficult for me to feel respected by the Republican Party , \u201d she says .\nThe republican and democratic hierarchies are well aware of the increasing scarcity of swing voting . For them , trying to win over voters who aren \u2019 t already committed supporters is becoming an increasingly difficult and inefficient activity , like fishing the Gulf of Maine for dwindling stocks of Atlantic cod .\nSo presidential campaigns , more and more , may be throwing their nets where they \u2019 re likely to catch larger numbers of votes . There \u2019 s some evidence they \u2019 ve shifted in recent years to devoting more effort to the mobilization of their party base , as opposed to the pursuit of undecided , independent , or swing voters .\nMr. Panagopoulos , who is currently a fellow at Yale University \u2019 s Center for the Study of American Politics , has examined the rates at which presidential campaigns contact various voter categories . He \u2019 s found that in recent elections that rate has risen much more sharply for committed partisans than it has for independents or adherents of the other party .\nIn other words , the parties are devoting increased resources to e-mailing , calling , and ringing the doorbells of their own strong supporters , instead of reaching out and trying to sway swing voters or loosely committed opponents .\n\u201c The evidence seems to suggest that the attention strong partisans receive is greater than the attention swing voters get , \u201d says Panagopoulos .\nThe election of 2000 was the breaking point . That \u2019 s when the line of this trend really started to nose upward . This timing is no surprise given that Bush vs. Gore was a virtual dead heat , highlighting the need for campaigns to scramble for any possible edge . Plus , that \u2019 s when microtargeting technology and e-campaign techniques began to mature and spread through US politics , making it easier for campaigns to carry out finely tuned outreach programs .\nCampaigns still try and woo new voters , of course . It \u2019 s just that they now appear convinced that there \u2019 s more bang for the donor buck in rousting old friends and making sure they vote .\n\u201c Campaigns have limited resources . They have to figure out how to allocate them as efficiently as possible , \u201d Panagopoulos says .\nIt \u2019 s possible that this mobilization trend has produced a self-\nreinforcing cycle . If strong partisans are pushed harder by the parties , they may vote at higher rates , electing more-partisan candidates , who push the parties further to the left or right , creating more strong partisan supporters . Rinse , repeat .\n\u201c The potential is that the increased focus on strong partisans has transformed the voting electorate in a more polarized way , and can be linked to growing polarization in government , \u201d says the Fordham professor .\nThis imbalance in voter outreach efforts may not be a good thing for America . But political campaigns are in the business of winning , not building up the pillars of democracy . Counteracting the cycle of polarization may require efforts by the US government or nonpartisan organizations to increase voter turnout for everyone , not just those at the ideological poles .\n\u201c That \u2019 s really where the impetus is going to come from , \u201d says Panagopoulos .\nHe adds , \u201c There are all kinds of reforms that have been proposed. \u201d These include everything from Sunday voting to easier methods of voter registration .\nIn the end , it \u2019 s important to remember that this state of affairs is not foreordained . American politics is not locked in a never-ending cycle in which both parties inevitably drift away from the uncommitted center . The behavior of swing voting has dwindled . The potential for swing voting has not .\nThe problem now is that both parties think the existing state of polarization benefits them . At some point , one or the other will likely wake up and realize that \u2019 s not true . In the past , systematic losses have had this effect .\nConsider the Democratic Party of the early 1990s . After three consecutive White House defeats many Democrats decided a swivel back to more-centrist policies might be in order . That led to President Clinton , a former southern state governor backed by the middle-of-the-road Democratic Leadership Council .\n\u201c Parties are the problem and parties are the way out . People want to win , \u201d says Smidt of Michigan State .\nAnd possible swing voters do still exist , even as an endangered species . Take Dave Bradford , a Connecticut salesman tapping away on his laptop at the 30th Street train station in Philadelphia . Mr. Bradford voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984 because he thought the president had done well in his first term . Since then , he \u2019 s voted for Democratic presidential candidates .\n\u201c I probably lean more towards the Democrats , but as I get older , I \u2019 m more in tune with some of the Republican philosophies and stands , \u201d Bradford says .\nHe thinks some of Rand Paul \u2019 s ideas are worth listening to and exploring , particularly those that deal with taxation and \u201c taking government off our back. \u201d He \u2019 d like to see former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg run , not so much because of Mr. Bloomberg \u2019 s political philosophy , but because of the competence Bloomberg showed as mayor , and because he , like Bradford himself , is a businessman .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

If strong partisans are pushed harder by the parties, they may vote at higher rates, electing more-partisan candidates, who push the parties further to the left or right, creating more strong partisan supporters. Rinse, repeat.\n\nThat\u2019s a subject of Panagopoulos\u2019s continuing research.\n\n\u201cThe potential is that the increased focus on strong partisans has transformed the voting electorate in a more polarized way, and can be linked to growing polarization in government,\u201d says the Fordham professor.\n\nThis imbalance in voter outreach efforts may not be a good thing for America. But political campaigns are in the business of winning, not building up the pillars of democracy. Counteracting the cycle of polarization may require efforts by the US government or nonpartisan organizations to increase voter turnout for everyone, not just those at the ideological poles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really where the impetus is going to come from,\u201d says Panagopoulos.\n\nHe adds, \u201cThere are all kinds of reforms that have been proposed.\u201d These include everything from Sunday voting to easier methods of voter registration.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s important to remember that this state of affairs is not foreordained. American politics is not locked in a never-ending cycle in which both parties inevitably drift away from the uncommitted center. The behavior of swing voting has dwindled. The potential for swing voting has not.\n\nThe problem now is that both parties think the existing state of polarization benefits them. At some point, one or the other will likely wake up and realize that\u2019s not true. In the past, systematic losses have had this effect.\n\nConsider the Democratic Party of the early 1990s. After three consecutive White House defeats many Democrats decided a swivel back to more-centrist policies might be in order. That led to President Clinton, a former southern state governor backed by the middle-of-the-road Democratic Leadership Council.\n\n\u201cParties are the problem and parties are the way out. People want to win,\u201d says Smidt of Michigan State.\n\nAnd possible swing voters do still exist, even as an endangered species. Take Dave Bradford, a Connecticut salesman tapping away on his laptop at the 30th Street train station in Philadelphia. Mr. Bradford voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984 because he thought the president had done well in his first term. Since then, he\u2019s voted for Democratic presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cI probably lean more towards the Democrats, but as I get older, I\u2019m more in tune with some of the Republican philosophies and stands,\u201d Bradford says.\n\nHe thinks some of Rand Paul\u2019s ideas are worth listening to and exploring, particularly those that deal with taxation and \u201ctaking government off our back.\u201d He\u2019d like to see former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg run, not so much because of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s political philosophy, but because of the competence Bloomberg showed as mayor, and because he, like Bradford himself, is a businessman.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
