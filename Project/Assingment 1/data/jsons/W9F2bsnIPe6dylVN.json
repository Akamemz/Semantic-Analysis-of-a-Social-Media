    "content": "If you 've been following the judicial confirmation wars of recent years , you 're already aware that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly taken off the gloves , forcing Democrats to live by the hardball partisan rules they 've established over the course of numerous ends-driven power grabs . He detonated Harry Reid 's nuclear option after the minority party launched an unprecedented filibuster against Justice Gorsuch 's nomination , and has subsequently trimmed and stymied other delay tactics , as Democrats have adjusted their approach to across-the-board resistance . With some Democrats already fuming over the current consequences of the status quo they helped establish ( President Trump and Leader McConnell have teamed up to confirm judges at a record pace ) , additional changes may be on the way . In a Politico op/ed , McConnell lays out his case -- noting that the ongoing problem is not limited to judicial nominees :\nIt \u2019 s been 354 days and counting in Senate purgatory for the president \u2019 s nominee to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . Two-hundred eighty-seven days and counting for the under secretary of state for management . Noncontroversial lower court nominees have languished for weeks and weeks \u2014 for no discernible reason \u2014 before they , too , were confirmed unanimously . These are just a few examples of the historic obstruction Senate Democrats have visited upon President Trump \u2019 s nominees for two years and counting . Since January 2017 , for the first time in memory , a minority has exploited procedure to systematically obstruct a president from staffing up his administration . This new , across-the-board obstruction is unfair to the president and , more importantly , to the American people . Left unchecked , it is guaranteed to create an unsustainable precedent that would see every future presidency of either party obstructed in the same mindless way . The Senate needs to restore normalcy . And this week , we will vote to do just that .\nMcConnell recites some powerful statistics that justify his course of action , pointing out the truly extraordinary abuse of forced , time-consuming cloture votes by Senate Democrats during President Trump 's first two years on the job :\nAcross the first two years of each of the six presidents preceding President Trump , the Senate only had to hold 24 total cloture votes on nominations . That \u2019 s the once-rare procedural step that unlocks an up-or-down confirmation vote even though a minority has sought to block it . And in President Trump \u2019 s first two years ? We had to hold a stunning 128 cloture votes to advance nominations . Our Democratic colleagues made the Senate jump over five times as many hurdles as in the equivalent periods in the Carter , Reagan , Bush , Clinton , Bush and Obama administrations combined . Because of this obstruction , the Senate \u2019 s progress in filling important executive branch positions has been insufficient . Crucial jobs are still being held empty out of political spite . More nominees whom I suspect would be confirmed without opposition are still being delayed indefinitely because our colleagues can not finish grieving their loss in 2016 .\nDemocrats ' rebuttal to this mostly amounts to `` Merrick Garland '' -- which , as we 've analyzed previously -- is n't much of an argument at all . Republicans ' 2016 blockade of President Obama 's third SCOTUS nominee had ample historical precedent , and followed the recommendations of prominent Democrats during recent Republican presidencies . And the Senate majority 's willingness to link arms and block Garland was unquestionably informed by their opponents ' stunning 2013 'nuclear ' rules change . McConnell writes that previous bipartisan reforms on the upper chamber 's handling of presidential nominations should serve as the template for additional shifts , noting that an Obama-era compromise garnered 78 votes . He also targets Democrats who say they favor his proposals -- so long as they do n't apply to the current presidential term :\nOur proposal would only reduce the time a minority can keep delaying lower-tier nominations after a majority has invoked cloture .
