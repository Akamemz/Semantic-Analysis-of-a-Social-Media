    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden are becoming the best of enemies as their escalating head-to-head clash helps both accomplish early political goals on the road to the 2020 election .\nThe President and the former vice president are feuding on foreign policy , character issues and long ago political wars a year before the Democratic race produces a presumptive nominee .\nThe confrontation -- that escalated over the Memorial Day weekend -- has campaign handicappers debating whether Trump is running scared of Biden . Some believe that the Democratic veteran could threaten the President 's blue-collar appeal in swing states , such as Pennsylvania and Michigan .\nSuch questions could end up deciding the destiny of the presidency . They can only be definitively answered should Biden emerge atop the crowded Democratic pack next summer .\nBut the two 70-somethings are currently doing more than simply offering a preview of how the final months of the 2020 campaign could play out . Right now -- and despite some risks -- both men benefit from their intensifying engagement , since it helps each of them position for a potential contest , offers a chance to wound a possible rival and strengthens them both with their respective bases .\nBiden seizes on Trump 's love for foreign strongmen and disdain for traditional US values to paint him as dangerously unfit for the presidency and an affront to the very idea of America .\nTrump is using Biden , for decades a denizen of the Washington establishment who is offering a return to political normality , to reinvigorate outsider credentials incumbents find difficult to preserve .\nFor the former vice president , every Trump attack plays into his implicit campaign rationale that he is the best-placed Democrat to beat the President . Trump 's preoccupation with Biden -- even during a pomp-saturated trip to Japan -- can be used to bolster the narrative that the longtime Delaware senator is a mortal peril for the President .\nCNN has reported that aides have advised Trump not to elevate Biden -- a potentially strong opponent . It might seem counter intuitive for Trump to put the candidate he fears most on a pedestal . But the President never takes the orthodox route .\nThe Biden campaign quickly turned the President 's embrace of weekend attacks on the former vice president by North Korea into a fundraising drive that positions him as Trump 's most dangerous foe -- a key undercurrent of the entire Biden campaign .\n`` Folks -- You 've got Donald Trump rattled , '' said a campaign email sent to Biden supporters highlighting repeated insults flung by the President towards Delaware 's favorite son .\n`` Why ? It 's simple : Trump 's afraid he 's going to lose , '' the email read , appealing for donations of between $ 5 and $ 250 .\nA flurry of rapid response exchanges between the two camps in recent days has looked like a general election fight , and helps Biden stand above the Democratic fray .\nThe rhetorical affray with Trump keeps Biden in the public eye even as he pursues a risk averse and stately campaign itinerary that is the privilege of the front-runner and involves heavy fundraising .\nWhen the Democratic candidates climb on stage together in the first debates this summer , it will be harder for Biden to avoid scrutiny over the purity of his progressive appeal .\nBut it suits him for now to be perceived as fighting the President rather than his fellow Democrats -- since any such bouts would simply elevate hopefuls who currently trail him .\nA continuing confrontation with an angry , erratic President -- and Trump 's odd kinship with foreign dictators -- helps flesh out one of Biden 's foundational campaign pillars that the commander-in-chief is unfit to serve a second term .\nThere are risks for Biden in attacking Trump .
