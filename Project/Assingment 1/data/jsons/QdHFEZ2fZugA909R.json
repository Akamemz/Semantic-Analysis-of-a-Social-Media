The president said federal regulators should reclassify the Internet as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act .\n`` For almost a century , our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business , '' Obama said in his statement . `` That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one , and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider .
