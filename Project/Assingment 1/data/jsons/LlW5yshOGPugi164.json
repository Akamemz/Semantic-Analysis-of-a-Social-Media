    "content": "Conn analyzed the official White House talking points on President Obama 's executive action on immigration late last week , and found them wanting . Setting aside the subject of immigration ( although if Obama 's DACA order fueled the unaccompanied minor crisis , how can its impact will this massive new de facto 'amnesty-with-papers ' have in terms of incentivizing illegal immigration ? ) , the core of opponents ' opposition to the plan deals with the separation of powers and executive excess . The president 's defenders argue that ( a ) Congress has failed to act for too long , ( b ) that many other presidents have taken some form of unilateral action on immigration in the past , and ( c ) that the executive branch exercising enforcement discretion is hardly a new phenomenon and is , in fact , that federal branch 's appropriate role . The first point is an illegitimate non sequitur . Frustration with Congress ' inaction does n't give any president license to effectively legislate via executive decree . The second point has been rebutted in several trenchant columns , focusing primarily on the scope and context of previous actions . And former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy is out with a sharp piece explaining why this executive amnesty is a fundamental perversion of the executive branch 's legitimate enforcement authority :\nProsecutorial discretion is a simple and , until recently , an uncontroversial matter of resource allocation . It merely holds that violations of law are abundant but law-enforcement resources are finite ; therefore , we must target the resources at the most serious crimes , which of necessity means many infractions will go unaddressed ... Prosecutorial discretion means you are not required to prosecute every crime \u2014 which , since doing so would be impossible , is just a nod to reality . It does not mean that those crimes the executive chooses not to enforce are now no longer crimes . Prosecutorial discretion has never meant that the passive act of non-enforcement has the legal effect of repealing criminal laws enacted by Congress . And it has never even been suggested , because to do so would be absurd , that under the doctrine of prosecutorial discretion , the executive decision not to prosecute certain crimes means the people who commit those crimes should be rewarded for committing them . That , of course , would only encourage others to commit them on a more massive scale . Yet that is President Obama \u2019 s theory . He is claiming not only the power to determine what immigration laws get enforced and which illegal immigrants get prosecuted \u2014 power he unquestionably has . He also claims the power to declare ( a ) that criminal acts are somehow lawful \u2014 that illegal aliens now have a right to be here \u2014 just because Obama has chosen not to prosecute them ; and ( b ) that those who engage in this unprosecuted activity will be rewarded with benefits ( lawful presence , relief from deportation , work permits , etc . ) , as if their illegal acts were valuable community service .
