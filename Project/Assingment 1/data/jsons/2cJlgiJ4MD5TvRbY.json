I know pneumonia extremely well . I have had it off and on for about 25 years . It is a cruel disease . It does not just suddenly come on like a stroke . It comes on and lingers and once you have it , you know it .\nPneumonia exhibits itself in many ways , but one way is a crushing , overwhelming fatigue accompanied by dizziness and confusion . Pneumonia is not a cold . It is a cold loaded with plutonium . It is a serious disease and it must have been apparent to Mrs. Clinton and the persons around her for a good long while that she was unwell . They simply lied about it , as they lie about everything that comes across their path .\nPneumonia is not cured easily , and often it is never cured at all . It killed my beloved father . It is a crafty disease and can hide in the most obscure bays and inlets in the lungs and then burst forth with shrieking fatigue , hoarseness , coughing , and dizziness . Not only have I experienced this , but I have been reading about it constantly ever since I first was diagnosed with it in about 1992 at Bonner General Hospital in Sandpoint .\nThe patient can bombard the germs with antibiotics and that sometimes , in fact usually , makes the symptoms go away for a time . But often , the pathogens can and do hide and then come out again . Eventually , they can defeat any antibiotic thrown at them and the patient is left with a low grade pneumonia waiting for Blitzkrieg any time the host is exhausted or stressed . That \u2019 s the definition of a typical modern President .\nThere is also viral pneumonia , which is even more difficult to cure than the one I just discussed , bacterial pneumonia . There are hardly any effective anti-virals for viral pneumonia and once you have it , you have it until the Grim Reaper comes for you . This is something for us all to contemplate seriously .\nPneumonia is one of the easiest serious diseases to diagnose . Even a small hospital like Bonner General diagnosed mine in about ten minutes with an X-Ray machine . It appears as a cloud over a photo of the lungs . Even a tiny fog covering , say , less than five percent of the lungs in a photo can result in agonizing fatigue . Fatigue that makes you want to curl up and die .\nThe idea that a woman of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s means , surrounded by aides , did not know she had a powerful lung infection before her falls and collapse Sunday is farfetched at best , which calls into question her many denials on the subject .\nAgain , this means she has been lying to us \u2014 again .\nThere is some good news : while pneumonia is often resistant to meds , it is extremely receptive to bed rest and pharmaceuticals as simple as aspirin . In my own case , I have felt as if I were at death \u2019 s door and after a good night \u2019 s sleep , my delicious Campbell \u2019 s Cream of Chicken soup , and aspirin , I have felt like a world beater for the next few days .\nPneumonia is not a disease that prevents a person from being an effective thinker and analyst and speaker if she were one before .\nMrs. Clinton is obviously a woman of iron self-discipline . I think she could be counted on to conserve her energy if she were President and to stay in bed a good part of the week . There is nothing wrong with that . Much of what a President has to do is to read and be briefed . She can do that after a prolonged nap and a long sleep . Mr. Obama can not resist a trip . He should have and she can .\nShe \u2019 s not running for power forward on the OKC Thunder . She is running for a job that requires thought and analysis , and not physical strength . She can do it , with the usual caveat :\nThe problem is not that Mrs. Clinton is too ill to serve as President . The problem is \u2014 once again \u2014 her character . She lies way too much .

That \u2019 s standard and I don \u2019 t blame her for it .\nIt \u2019 s just that there have been so very many lies about so very many subjects . It \u2019 s rare to find a big subject she has not lied about .\nThere is another subject worth noting : being ill affects one \u2019 s judgment . This is something everyone in the world knows . If you are ill , you tend to make poor judgments , to fly off the handle , to be intemperate .
