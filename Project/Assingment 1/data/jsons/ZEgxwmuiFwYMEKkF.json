Among the findings are that native-born citizens are more likely to view the U.S. as \u201c better \u201d than other countries , more likely to see English as central to the American experience , and more likely to see the U.S. Constitution as a higher legal authority than international law .\nJohn Fonte , director of the Center for American Common Culture at the Hudson Institute , said those findings show a glaring hole in the immigration system that should be fixed if Congress is going to add millions more immigrant citizens to the country .\n\u201c We see this as an important part of any immigration project . Whether it \u2019 s comprehensive or in pieces , this is one of the pieces , \u201d Mr. Fonte said . \u201c If it \u2019 s comprehensive , what could be more important than the end of the whole immigration process , assimilation .
