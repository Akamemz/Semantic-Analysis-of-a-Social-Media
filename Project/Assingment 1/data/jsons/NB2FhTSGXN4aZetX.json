A new poll released on Saturday showed him as the clear front-runner. The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was a virtual unknown when he announced his campaign in April, but he has recently surged in states that will be among the first to vote in the primary.\n\nButtigieg, an openly gay military veteran, was the top choice of 25 percent of likely Iowa caucus-goers, outpacing long-standing frontrunners Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The poll shows major growth in his support in the past three months. A poll taken in August had him at just 8 percent.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nThough it\u2019s only two polls, some political experts see it as evidence that Buttigieg may have a chance at winning the Democratic nomination \u2014 and even the presidency. Buttigieg has staked a position where he can be seen as a reasonable alternative for voters who have doubts about the three leading candidates.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s policy platform is progressive, but not as far left as Sanders\u2019s and Warren\u2019s. A key example is his Medicare for All Who Want It plan, which would be a major shift in how the U.S. health care system works, but not as transformative as the Medicare for All plans promoted by Warren and Sanders.
