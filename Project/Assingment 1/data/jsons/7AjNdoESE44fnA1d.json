Until that happens the door is left open . \u201d\nRepublicans have a series of piecemeal reform bills that satisfy the conservatives ' call for more enforcement , improvements to border security , and an E-verify system to make it impossible for companies to employ undocumented immigrants . Those bills largely avoid the issue of citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. , but some Republicans are flirting with the idea of legal status for immigrants .\nThe Democratic-led Senate passed its vision of immigration reform in June . That measure includes doubling the number of border patrol agents along the Mexican border to about 40,000 and providing a 13-year pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million in the country without papers . Republicans see this pathway as \u201c amnesty. \u201d However , the bill has been lingering in the House of Representatives for months now because of Boehner \u2019 s promise to not put a bill on the floor without a `` majority of the majority '' support .\nIn an attempt to break the impasse and keep the issue at the forefront , House Democrats , led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California , introduced their own legislation , removing the \u201c border surge \u201d in the Senate \u2019 s bill and replacing it with a bipartisan amendment that passed the House Homeland Security Committee in May . The border security bill from Rep. Michael McCaul requires that the administration draft a border plan for 90 percent apprehension of illegal border crossers in five years .\nBut from FAIR \u2019 s perspective , any of the House bills can be used a \u201c vehicle to get amnesty \u201d via a conference with the Senate legislation .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear that moving forward any new immigration law that tries to improve our legal immigration system and also prevent illegal immigration will not be enforced , \u201d Williamson said .\nWhile FAIR waits for a commitment from the establishment , Alex Nowrasteh , an immigration policy analyst at libertarian think tank Cato Institute , is a bit more confident that it \u2019 s likely a no-go this year for immigration reform .\nNowrasteh said that timing is the reason , as there aren \u2019 t enough legislative days left on the calendar to pass it . There are just 15 legislative days left this year . The momentum the issue had earlier this year among lawmakers was quickly derailed by the Syrian chemical weapons crisis , NSA spying , and the recent government shutdown . Currently , the broken health-care websites and the fact that millions of Americans are losing insurance plans they would like to keep remain the focus of President Barack Obama and his administration .
