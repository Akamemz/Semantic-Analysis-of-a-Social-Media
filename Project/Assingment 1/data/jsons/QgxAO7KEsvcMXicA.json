Grants and Contributions\n\n\u00b7 Any contribution that is recognized under campaign finance law as a reportable contribution.\n\n\u00b7 Grants to section 527 political organizations and other tax-exempt organizations that conduct candidate-related political activities (note that a grantor can rely on a written certification from a grantee stating that it does not engage in, and will not use grant funds for, candidate-related political activity).\n\n3. Activities Closely Related to Elections or Candidates\n\n\u00b7 Voter registration drives and \u201cget-out-the-vote\u201d drives.\n\n\u00b7 Distribution of any material prepared by or on behalf of a candidate or by a section 527 political organization.\n\n\u00b7 Preparation or distribution of voter guides that refer to candidates (or, in a general election, to political parties).\n\n\u00b7 Holding an event within 60 days of a general election (or within 30 days of a primary election) at which a candidate appears as part of the program.\n\nAccording to a release about the rules, the proposal reduces \"the need to conduct fact-intensive inquiries, including inquiries into whether activities or communications are neutral and unbiased.\"\n\n\u201cThis is part of ongoing efforts within the IRS that are improving our work in the tax-exempt area,\u201d IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel said in the release. \u201cOnce final, this proposed guidance will continue moving us forward and provide clarity for this important segment of exempt organizations.\u201d\n\nBefore the agency issues final guidance, it will first seek public comments on the new proposals, and go through other parts of the regulatory process.
