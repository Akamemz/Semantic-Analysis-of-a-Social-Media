For example , his suggestion that the Republicans should become a pro-choice party likely wrinkled few brows among his core supporters .\nThe idea that Trump would change his attitude and approach along with his opinions wouldn \u2019 t trouble many who have faith in him as a man and a leader . For those who believe the Trump is the only person who can make America great again , putting on a new guise for the general election would be nothing troubling .\nRemember , these are people who believe him when he describes himself as the new Reagan and the person more presidential than anybody since Lincoln .\nBut can Trump create a habitat that is healthy for both his backers and the kinds of folks that his newly expanded campaign are schmoozing here in Hollywood without further antagonizing the substantial chunk of his party that ranges from resentful to outright outraged about Trump \u2019 s surprising success in overtaking the GOP ?\nTrump had a very good day here Thursday . Aside from turning back a Rules Committee vote that might \u2019 ve helped Sen. Ted Cruz win a floor fight at the convention , delegates and other members of the establishment were very impressed by Trump \u2019 s campaign \u2019 s effort to start sucking up to them .\nPromises of Trump \u2019 s flexibility when served alongside seafood platters and open bars from his new K Street handlers went a long way toward convincing the GOP elite that Trump is ready to play ball .\nLittle could be more comforting to them than the pledge from Trump \u2019 s campaign boss that the wildness of the frontrunner to this point has been a put on .\nConsultants and party elders are not uncomfortable with the idea of tricking rubes or profit and or patriotism . And for those facing general election oblivion , anything that sounds like avoiding a savage showdown in Cleveland and not losing the general election by 40 states sounds good .\nBut even if Trump and his new handlers can keep the GOP elite and his existing populist base happy , the current maneuvers do pose a risk .\nThe most important thing for the Republican frontrunner right now is for his detractors and enemies on the conservative side of the party to just give up .\nThere are enough Republicans who loathe Trump to still stop him . But they have to go vote and they have to be willing to blow up their conventions to do it .\nWhen Trump \u2019 s new Sherpa suggests that it has all been a fake so far , that gives new cause for alarm to the conservatives who already deeply mistrust Trump and see him as more of a Democrat than Republican .\nAll Trump needs in order to win is for the resistance to just lay down for a couple of weeks . When they wake up it will all be over .\nBut if Trump starts fishtailing in his turn towards conventionality it will reinvigorate the # NeverTrump movement .\nIt \u2019 s great to suck up to the party , even belatedly , but doing in such a transparent manner could be hazardous to Trump \u2019 s nomination .\n[ GOP delegate count : Trump 845 ; Cruz 559 ; Kasich 147 ( 1,237 needed to win ) ]\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday : Trump \u2019 s new man - Mr. Sunday sits down with the Trump campaign \u2019 s new boss , Paul Manafort , to discuss the latest campaign news on the heels of the RNC \u2019 s spring meeting . \u201c \u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday with Chris Wallace \u201d airs at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m .

One recent private poll not affiliated with any of the presidential campaigns showed Cruz leading in two congressional districts , Kasich in one , and Trump dominating in two more . Three other congressional districts , meanwhile , showed Cruz and Kasich essentially tied\u2026Although there are just 57 delegates at stake in Indiana , the contest is one of the few remaining wild cards on the primary map . If Cruz or Kasich do not win , the Republican race could quickly spiral out of their control . If Trump does not win Indiana , however , his delegate math becomes exceedingly difficult to win the nomination before Cleveland . \u201d\nUnpacking Trump \u2019 s health proposal - Health care policy expert , James Capretta , points out the flaws in Trump \u2019 s health care plan proposal : \u201c Trump has said he wants to get rid of the entirety of the [ Affordable Care Act ] , including subsidies for health insurance and its expansion of Medicaid .

This lengthy piece goes into the origins and results of the shift in American political thought :\n\u201c The smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demography .
