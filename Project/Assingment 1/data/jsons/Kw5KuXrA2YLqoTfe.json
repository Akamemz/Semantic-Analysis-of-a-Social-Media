    "content": "Donald Trump is one of the most Russia-friendly presidents in modern history . But in less than an hour on Thursday , he rebuked Russia harder than he has throughout his entire time in the White House .\nAround 9:40 am , the White House released a joint statement in which the US , UK , France , and Germany blamed Moscow for a nerve agent attack against a Russian ex-spy on British soil . It was the first time since the March 4 attack that the Trump administration said the Kremlin was likely the culprit .\nAnd at 10:30 am , the US Treasury Department announced long-awaited sanctions to punish Russia for its meddling in the 2016 presidential election and a worldwide cyberattack last year . The measures targeted nearly 25 Russian individuals and organizations , including members of Internet Research Agency ( IRA ) \u2014 the troll farm that used social media to sow divisions before the November 2016 vote .\nTreasury also sanctioned Yevgeny Prigozhin , known as \u201c Putin \u2019 s chef , \u201d for his role in bankrolling Russian hackers . Special counsel Robert Mueller had indicted IRA members and Prigozhin last month , as part of his ongoing investigation into possible Trump-Russia collusion during the 2016 presidential election .\nPut together , a president marred by Russia-related scandals and his affinity for Vladimir Putin has finally pushed back on Moscow . \u201c These targeted sanctions are a part of a broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia , \u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement after the sanctions announcement .\nBut even so , experts say , this response could be too weak to have much of an effect . \u201c It \u2019 s a good move by the administration to impose sanctions \u201d and show solidarity after the Kremlin \u2019 s attack in the UK , Alina Polyakova , a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution think tank , told me , \u201c but it \u2019 s still not enough to respond to growing Russian aggression . \u201d\nOn March 4 , Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found on an outside bench in Salisbury , England . It turned out they had been poisoned with a highly toxic nerve agent .\nEight days later , UK Prime Minister Theresa May said it was \u201c highly likely \u201d that Russia was behind the attack on the Skripals . When asked about the event later that day , White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to directly blame Russia but said that \u201c we offer the fullest condemnation \u201d of the attack .\nBut on Thursday , the White House issued a joint statement with allies to support Britain \u2019 s claim , which said : \u201c The United Kingdom thoroughly briefed its allies that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack . We share the United Kingdom \u2019 s assessment that there is no plausible alternative explanation . \u201d\nMoscow , however , denies it had any hand in the attack .\nThe sanctions that the US Treasury Department issued on Thursday have a bit more of a backstory . It all goes back to the January 2017 US intelligence community assessment that Russia did meddle in the election , and did so to help Trump win the White House .\nBut then last August , Trump reluctantly signed into law the Countering America \u2019 s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act . Republican and Democratic lawmakers crafted the bill in response to Trump \u2019 s unusual warmth toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and his refusal to blame Russia for interfering in the election .\nThe legislation passed both chambers almost unanimously \u2014 98-2 in the Senate and 419-3 in the House \u2014 and it was clear that Congress would override a presidential veto . It was explicitly designed to make old sanctions against Russia permanent and pressure Trump to impose new ones . The bill forced Trump to impose costs on Putin for interfering in America \u2019 s democratic process and for his interventions in Ukraine and Syria .\nBut Trump resented Congress \u2019 s move to box him in on Russia policy . The president slammed the legislation in a signing statement , calling it \u201c seriously flawed , \u201d and said that he could \u201c make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress . \u201d\nStill , the law forced Trump to impose sanctions in late January \u2014 but he missed the deadline . Instead , the administration released a list of 210 Russian leaders and billionaires with purported ties to Putin in order to indicate that the administration was watching them .\nThen on March 6 , Mnuchin and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats announced that new sanctions on Russia were imminent , with Mnuchin adding that Trump was \u201c fully supportive of the work we \u2019 re doing. \u201d And on Thursday , the sanctions were finally announced .\nSenior administration officials told reporters that the sanctions were meant to punish Russia for interfering in the 2016 election and for masterminding a global cyberattack , known as NotPetya , that hit large corporations and hospitals in the US and Europe last summer .\n\u201c The administration is , arguably for the first time , directly acknowledging and responding to Russia \u2019 s intervention in the 2016 campaign , \u201d Sean Kane , a former sanctions official at the Treasury Department , told me .\nThe new measures target five Russian organizations and 19 Russian individuals . The big organizational targets include two Russian intelligence agencies , known by their acronyms FSB and GRU , and prominent Russians like Prigozhin . That means people connected to the intelligence agencies , and Prigozhin himself , can not travel to America or do business with American companies , and will soon see their US assets frozen .\nExperts tell me the timing of the sanctions was surely meant to show support for London and condemn Moscow after the nerve agent attack .\nNow the question is : Does this signal a change in Trump \u2019 s attitude toward Russia ? Well , it \u2019 s complicated .\nDespite the sanctions , Trump continues to minimize Russia \u2019 s involvement in the election . He thinks Russia didn \u2019 t interfere \u2014 and that Democrats use the Trump-Russia narrative as an excuse for losing the election . He \u2019 s famously called the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia a \u201c WITCH HUNT ! \u201d\nAnd on February 16 , 2018 , Mueller filed charges against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian groups who allegedly interfered with the 2016 US elections \u2014 including members of the IRA and Prigozhin .\nEven Trump \u2019 s own national security team said he could be tougher on Russia . On February 13 , Coats told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia would continue to interfere in American elections : \u201c Frankly , the United States is under attack . \u201d\nTwo weeks later , on February 27 , Adm. Michael Rogers , who leads US Cyber Command , said during a congressional hearing that Trump had yet to ask him to take measures against Russia \u2019 s hackers . \u201c If we don \u2019 t change the dynamic here , this is going to continue , and 2016 won \u2019 t be viewed as something isolated , \u201d Rogers told the Senate Armed Services Committee . \u201c This is something that will be sustained over time . \u201d\nOther military leaders echoed the admiral \u2019 s sentiment , including Army Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone , Trump \u2019 s nominee to replace Rogers . \u201c I would say right now they do not think much will happen to them , \u201d he said of Russia during his confirmation hearing last week . \u201c They don \u2019 t fear us . \u201d\nThat , in part , is why experts seem skeptical that Trump will all of a sudden become a Russia hawk . Trump \u201c has a reluctance divorced from what is best for America to speak clearly about the threat Russia poses to the United States and our allies , \u201d Evelyn Farkas , formerly the Pentagon \u2019 s top Russia official , told me .\nAnd lawmakers , many of whom are usually critical of the president , feel he could do more to punish Russia . \u201c If President Trump believes that today \u2019 s action sufficiently addresses the sanctions package Congress sent to respond forcefully to Moscow \u2019 s election interference , then he is sorely mistaken , \u201d California Rep.

Today is the first time he really did anything to back up that claim \u2014 and he may have more chances .\n\u201c By no means will this constitute the end to our ongoing campaign to instruct Mr. Putin to change his behavior , \u201d a senior administration official told reporters on Thursday morning .",
