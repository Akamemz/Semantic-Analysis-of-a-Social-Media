    "content": "`` The only antidote to decades of ruinous rule by a small handful of elites is a bold infusion of popular will . On every major issue affecting this country , the people are right and the governing elite are wrong , '' wrote Donald Trump in an April op-ed for The Wall Street Journal . That could be a textbook definition of populism .\nTwo political scientists\u2014J . Eric Oliver of the University of Chicago and Wendy M. Rahn of the University of Minnesota\u2014define populist rhetoric as a style `` that pits a virtuous 'people ' against nefarious , parasitic elites who seek to undermine the rightful sovereignty of the common folk . '' They add , `` A populist moment requires the right rhetoric spoken by the right person to the right audience at the right time . And , as we look to the data , the 2016 election has all the hallmarks of a populist moment . '' Tuesday 's vote proved them right .\nConsider a post-election television interview of Trump voters from central Virginia , where I live . `` People want the people to be in control of the country , not the politicians , '' Greene County resident Chad Aylor told WCAV-TV . The report noted that `` for Aylor , voting Trump was not against Clinton or voting Republican . Aylor said he considers himself voting as an American . '' Trump trounced Clinton 62 to 31 percent in the mostly rural county .\nSo why is 2016 the right time for populism ? University of Georgia political scientist Cas Mudde argues that `` populism is an illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism . '' Populism , he suggests , criticizes `` the exclusion of important issues from the political agenda by the elites . '' Oliver and Rahn agree , proposing that populism arises `` when existing political parties are not responding to the desires of large sections of the electorate . '' This opens up a `` representation gap '' that can be exploited by a would-be populist leader .\nOliver and Rahn measure this gap with polling data . People are asked whether they agree with such statements as `` Public officials do n't care much about what people like me think '' and `` People like me do n't have any say about what the government does . '' They found higher percentages of Americans agreeing with such sentiments as the 21st century advanced .\nThey also compared those responses to the degree of partisan conflict in Congress , which they gauged by tracking the number of strict party-line votes . The idea is that the representation gap grows as the distance between the major parties ' core supporters and swing voters grows larger . They find that such a gap opened in the early 1990s , which saw the entrance of such populists as Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan . The representation gap in 2016 was even larger .\nTo get a handle on the degree of populism represented by U.S. presidential candidates from both major parties , Oliver and Rahn analyzed the announcement speeches of the top seven candidates , including Trump , Bernie Sanders , Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio , John Kasich , Hillary Clinton , and Ben Carson . They looked for `` anti-establishment '' and `` blame '' language , along with rhetoric signifying the creation of a unified people . In addition , they measured the simplicity and `` everydayness '' of the candidates ' language\u2014basically , shorter sentences and shorter words .\nTrump and Sanders used considerably more blame language , with Sanders focusing more on economic grievances and Trump on political transgressions . Trump made more `` we-they '' contrasts and pointed more often to international threats than the other candidates did . Trump and Kasich used fewer words that were longer than 6 letters , and Trump 's sentences averaged 10 words in length . Sentences from Sanders and Rubio were twice as long .\n`` Trump scores high in targeting political elites , blame language , invoking both foreign threats and collective notions of 'our ' and 'they , ' and the simplicity and repetition of his language , '' report Oliver and Rahn . In contrast , they find that Sanders uses more complex locutions and fewer we-they contrasts . `` While Sanders may be 'populist ' in a strictly economic sense , his language is not nearly as 'of the people ' as either Carson 's or Trump 's , '' they conclude .\nWhat made Trump best able to take on the mantle of the populist tribune ? Oliver and Rahn point to several traits common to populist leaders . They invoke a sense of crisis , and they claim to speak for a `` silent majority '' of ordinary people ignored and dominated by `` arrogant elites , corrupt politicians , and strident minorities . '' Oliver and Rahn note that `` populists employ a distinctive style , one that is simple , direct , emotional , and frequently indelicate . '' The populist disrupts normal dinner-table conversation like a `` drunken guest '' with `` bad manners '' ; his followers treat this lack of decorum as evidence of authenticity . Members of the establishment , by contrast , perceive such pugnaciousness as demagoguery that encourages undemocratic sentiments .\nIn 2016 , Oliver and Rahn report , many Americans were receptive to populist appeals . In February and March , they surveyed more than 1,000 voters to assess their degree of anti-elitism , mistrust of expertise , and nativism . They asked respondents to rate such statements as `` The system is stacked against people like me , '' `` When it comes to really important questions , scientific facts do n't help very much , '' and `` It would be unwise to trust the judgments of the American people for today 's complicated political issues . '' Trump supporters scored highest on nativism and mistrust of expertise and second highest on anti-elitism . In contrast , Sanders ' supporters scored lowest on nativism and mistrust of expertise , and highest on anti-elitism .\nOther questions sought to determine attitudes toward ideology , anger at the federal government , anomie , nativism , conspiracism , and fundamentalism . Ideology ranged from very liberal to very conservative . Respondents were asked if they were pleased , satisfied , indifferent , frustrated , or angry about federal government performance . Their degree of anomie was determined by asking if they believed most people are trustworthy or would take advantage of them if given the chance . Nativism was assessed by asking whether too many immigrants were criminals and if they were more of a burden than a benefit to America . Conspiracism was probed with questions about five conspiracy theories . And fundamentalism was reckoned with queries about Biblical inerrancy and endtimes prophesies . In addition , financial pessimism was evaluated by asking , among other things , if respondents thought that that their children 's standard living would be better or worse than theirs .\nTrump voters scored highest on financial pessimism , nativism , anomie , and conspiracism and second highest on anger . ( Cruz voters were angrier at the federal government . ) Clinton voters were nearly the exact opposite . Sanders voters were financially optimistic , were not angry at the government , and scored lowest of all on nativism , but exhibited a slight penchant for anomie and conspiracism .\nOliver and Rahn concluded that `` Donald Trump stands out in particular as the populist par excellence . ''\nIn September , Hillary Clinton cluelessly declared , `` You know , to just be grossly generalistic , you could put half of Trump 's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables . Right ? The racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamaphobic\u2014you name it . And unfortunately there are people like that . And he has lifted them up .
