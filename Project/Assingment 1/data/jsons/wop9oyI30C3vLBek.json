    "content": "On July 1st , a group of venture capitalists and well-known tech elites logged on to the invite-only social platform Clubhouse to discuss a pressing issue in Silicon Valley : journalists canceling CEOs . \u201c When it comes to our industry , specifically how the tech industry is covered , there \u2019 s a really , really toxic dynamic that exists right now , \u201d said Nait Jones , a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz . While some harsh tech coverage was warranted , he said , \u201c there has been kind of an influx of takedowns . \u201d\nAt another point in the discussion , multiple sources tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Figs co-founder and co-CEO Trina Spear said she didn \u2019 t understand what gave the reporters the right to investigate private companies . Instead , she suggested the \u201c markets \u201d should decide .\nSpear denied saying this in a statement given to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c This quote is inaccurate and is being falsely attributed to me . I did not make this statement nor do I agree with its sentiments. \u201d Spear did not respond to follow-up questions .\nTo many tech executives and investors , this was cancel culture going too far\nThe Clubhouse discussion was sparked by a tweet from New York Times journalist Taylor Lorenz regarding the CEO of the luggage company Away . The executive , Steph Korey , had been railing against the media on Instagram . Lorenz posted screenshots of the tirade , writing , \u201c Steph Korey , the disgraced former CEO of Away luggage company , is ranting on IG stories about the media . Her posts are incoherent and it \u2019 s disappointing to see a woman who ran a luggage brand perpetuate falsehoods like this abt an industry she clearly has 0 understanding of . \u201d\nThe post exploded on Twitter , prompting a wave of harassment from venture capitalists and other tech executives who felt Lorenz was being unfair . A \u201c cancel Taylor Lorenz \u201d Twitter account popped up , and a parody website resurfaced . \u201c Every CEO , founder , investor , and engineer in tech sees the vitriolic tweets these employees of media corporations put out , \u201d wrote Balaji Srinivasan , an angel investor who previously worked at Andreessen Horowitz . \u201c Then they turn around and feign neutrality by writing passive voice articles . We get it : you hate us . And you \u2019 re competitors . \u201d\nInvestors had been defending Korey since December 2019 , when \u2588\u2588\u2588 published a series of investigative articles detailing employee complaints about the CEO \u2019 s management style . The articles , which drew wide attention , were followed by a fresh wave of reports about working conditions at venture-backed startups like Outdoor Voices , Bird , and The Wing .\n\u201c Overall , it seems like cancel culture has become this really easy thing to deflect to . \u201d\nTo many tech executives and investors , this was cancel culture going too far . \u201c 100 % of companies could have a negative article written about them , and without any fishing at all . All the reporter has to do is decide he wants to write a negative article , \u201d tweeted venture capitalist Paul Graham after the first Away report was published .\nAway employees felt Korey \u2019 s defenders were missing the point . \u201c Overall , it seems like cancel culture has become this really easy thing to deflect to , instead of needing to say there \u2019 s a solid issue here I need to pay attention to , \u201d says a current member of Away \u2019 s leadership team . \u201c The default has become \u2018 this is a hit piece , this is a snarky journalist trying to get clicks. \u2019 I think there \u2019 s a genuine group of people who haven \u2019 t had the first hand experience that sources in these stories have had . \u201d\nIf the venture capitalists \u2019 rhetoric feels familiar , it \u2019 s because the tactics aren \u2019 t new . In 2014 , under the banner of \u201c ethics in games journalism , \u201d an online mob attacked outspoken women and progressive figures within the game industry for months . Eron Gjoni penned a vengeful screed about his ex , developer Zoe Quinn , in August 2014 , which Gamergate supporters used to create a narrative about the games media at large . In addition to doxxing and harassing Quinn , Gamergaters coordinated harassment against several other prominent women with vicious online attacks ; figures like Brianna Wu fled their homes out of concern for personal safety . Gamergaters also badgered advertisers in an effort to silence voices they disagreed with .\nDespite Gamergaters \u2019 best efforts to push a narrative about paid-for coverage and collusion in the industry , no such corruption ever came to light . In the time since , the Gamergate crowd has shown little interest in actual ethical concerns in games , such as exploitative labor practices and sexual harassment and abuse perpetrated by powerful figures at the top .\nThis strategy has resurfaced elsewhere , marking the emergence of a culture war that has shaped the internet and even American politics . In Silicon Valley , harassers have latched on to \u201c ethics in journalism \u201d to legitimize their attacks and turn the conversation away from the larger issue : a conflict between tech workers and executives .\nVenture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 which invested $ 10 million in Clubhouse directly and bought up an additional $ 2 million of previous investors \u2019 shares \u2014 was early to tap the power of media to raise the profiles of its startups . \u201c Unlike established venture firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia , which let the press come to them , Andreessen Horowitz has gone on the offensive , pitching stories about its startups , leaking news to reporters , and planting itself right in the middle of the technology news churn , \u201d Bloomberg News wrote in 2014 .\nThe firm \u2019 s co-founder , Marc Andreessen , \u201c loves Twitter because \u2018 reporters are obsessed with it . It \u2019 s like a tube and I have loudspeakers installed in every reporting cubicle around the world , \u2019 \u201d according to a May 2015 New Yorker profile .\nBut Silicon Valley \u2019 s relationship with the media began to change in October 2015 , when The Wall Street Journal published the first of a series of blockbuster stories that exposed high-flying blood-testing startup Theranos as a scam . The news embarrassed journalists who \u2019 d written glowing profiles of Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes and inspired a fresh generation of investigative reporting on the tech industry . Andreessen defended Holmes throughout , blocking Twitter users who questioned his remarks , though he hadn \u2019 t invested in the startup .\nThe sources of The Wall Street Journal \u2019 s reporting were current and former employees of Theranos . In the 2018 Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal , employees of that company also revealed that millions of users had their data harvested without consent , another turning point for how the media covered tech companies . In the past few years , story after story has been driven by employees and contractors at tech companies disillusioned by their working conditions and their products \u2019 effects on society .\n\u201c What they \u2019 re trying to do is destabilize the ability to be critical about tech CEOs . \u201d\nThis shift posed something of a problem for founder-centric VCs . \u201c I think the Andreessen marching order , which is a great one , is to defend the founders at any cost , \u201d Upstream co-founder Alex Taub says . He adds that while it \u2019 s good for founders , it gets complicated when those people are accused of abuse or fraud .\nSimilarly , unquestioningly backing the founder while dismissing worker concerns isn \u2019 t good public relations , but refusing to stand by the founders could inhibit future investments . The answer , when it presented itself , was simple : go after the media instead .\n\u201c There \u2019 s sort of this larger project going on where they are trying to transmute accountability for CEOs , and the rising worker movements with values they don \u2019 t agree [ with ] , into what they are going to reframe as part of the \u2018 cancel culture \u2019 problem , because that \u2019 s the thing that has larger purchase , that there \u2019 s pushback on , \u201d one well-known tech CEO tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c What they \u2019 re trying to do is destabilize the ability to be critical about tech CEOs . \u201d\n\u201c I am convinced that most people in the tech world do not understand the role of a free media in a liberal society , \u201d Can Duruk , a product manager at Very Good Security , wrote in his newsletter , The Margins , in January . \u201c The media is not there to be your friend . It \u2019 s there to inform the public , and make you feel self-aware . \u201d\nAndreessen Horowitz did not respond to a request for comment on this story .\nThe tension between tech journalism and venture capital was at the heart of the discussion that took place on Clubhouse on July 1st . In an hour-long audio clip obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 and first reported by Vice , some speakers painted CEOs as the victims and questioned why the industry needed journalists .\n\u201c I believe in standing up for people who do not have a voice , who can not stand up for themselves , \u201d said Srinivasan when asked during the discussion about defending Steph Korey , the CEO of Away , who New York Times journalist Taylor Lorenz had tweeted about . On the recording , Felicia Horowitz , the founder of the Horowitz Family Foundation and wife of a16z founder Ben Horowitz , added : \u201c You can \u2019 t fucking hit somebody , attack them and just say , \u2018 Hey , I have ovaries and therefore , you can \u2019 t fight back . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c The New York Times company is not the free press . \u201d\nSrinivasan also pushed his belief that the industry needed to move away from professional journalists . \u201c The New York Times company is not the free press . You are the free press . You the citizen , \u201d he said . \u201c As citizens it \u2019 s your responsibility and mine to hold every institution accountable. \u201d Later , he added that the reason media companies won \u2019 t issue retractions is that \u201c their business model is literally marketing themselves as the truth ... They are not the truth , mathematics is the truth . \u201d\nThe next day , Srinivasan issued a $ 1,000 bounty ( to be paid in bitcoin ) for a retraction or correction to a February 13th Recode article about Silicon Valley \u2019 s early response to the coronavirus . The story , entitled \u201c \u2018 No handshakes , please \u2019 : The tech industry is terrified of the coronavirus , \u201d opens with an anecdote : \u201c Andreessen Horowitz recently put up a sign on its door , cautioning eager startup founders and business partners who walk into its offices : \u2018 Due to the Coronavirus , no Handshakes please . Thank you . \u2019 \u201d\nThe first sentence is supported by a photograph of the sign in question ; the rest of the piece is about the tech industry \u2019 s early response to the virus , which was substantially more aggressive than the state and federal response at the time . ( Recode , like \u2588\u2588\u2588 , is owned by Vox Media . )\nAsked about these bounties and whether they lead to harassment , Srinivasan replied : \u201c Do you think attacking female founders for profit , till they get fired , constitutes harassment ? \u201d He then began tweeting about \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s coverage of Away , saying our strategy was to \u201c pretend cancel culture isn \u2019 t real \u201d and then to \u201c crash a company \u2019 s stock price , making everyone poorer , while pretending to care about employees. \u201d ( Away is not a publicly traded company . )\n\u201c You \u2019 re making some boogeyman about journalists rather than talking about the real situation . \u201d\nThe tenor of the Clubhouse discussion didn \u2019 t sit well with some of the listeners . \u201c It felt fairly one-sided , \u201d says a woman who was listening to the call and requested anonymity because she currently works in tech and does not want to face retaliation . \u201c There were a couple people who \u2019 d worked in comms before and tried to even it out . But there wasn \u2019 t a lot of active dissent . And the moderators never asked for dissent to come forward . With a large audience you have to actively ask people . \u201d\nAn app builder who was listening in agreed . \u201c They \u2019 re all under the premise that running a company as CEO is very , very hard , sometimes stuff goes on . We should get a pass . You \u2019 re making some boogeyman about journalists rather than talking about the real situation . Or being held accountable . \u201d\nAfter the main discussion died down , a group of younger tech workers moved to another room in Clubhouse ( a process called \u201c rerooming \u201d ) . There , they rehashed the debate \u2014 and why some had felt it was unproductive . \u201c It was mostly women talking , \u201d the app builder said . \u201c It almost became a therapy session talking about how painful the first discussion was made . \u201d\nClubhouse co-founder Paul Davison joined and asked the group for feedback on how the app could make discussions more productive or inclusive . The talk then shifted to a product feedback session , where people brought up the need for more moderation .\nA spokesperson for Clubhouse declined to comment for this story .\nA preview of the tech industry \u2019 s animosity toward the Times occurred on Twitter the week before the Lorenz kerfuffle erupted , when Scott Alexander \u2014 a pseudonym \u2014 deleted his blog , SlateStarCodex , which centered on rationalist thought . In a final post , Alexander claimed The New York Times was going to \u201c dox \u201d him by revealing his real name in an article \u2014 an article he believed couldn \u2019 t be written if the blog was taken down . He directed people to contact Times tech editor Pui-Wing Tam , who subsequently received thousands of emails and tweets , some of which were \u201c toxic \u201d in nature , a source familiar with Times \u2019 reporting says . Srinivasan named the reporter on Twitter , who was subsequently harassed as well .\n\u201c Alexander , whose role has been to help explain Silicon Valley to itself , was taken up as a mascot and a martyr in a struggle against the Times , which , in the tweets of Srinivasan , Graham , and others , was enlisted as a proxy for all of the gatekeepers\u2014the arbiters of what it is and is not O.K . to say , and who is allowed , by virtue of their identity , to say it , \u201d wrote Gideon Lewis-Kraus in an article about the campaign in The New Yorker .\nUltimately , these efforts ran out of steam , as nothing about Alexander or SlateStarCodex has yet been published by The New York Times . The source familiar with the Times \u2019 reporting says \u201c not a word \u201d of the SlateStarCodex story had been written when Alexander deleted his blog . But the tenor of the discussion had been set .\nAt the heart of the tech backlash to the media is a fear of getting \u201c canceled \u201d \u2014 a nebulous term that \u2019 s often used to refer to those who get called out online and may subsequently lose power in real life as a result . For investors and CEOs , the idea that one damning article can throw a whole company into turmoil is infuriating : it often feels like only part of the story is being told \u2014 and that part is often unflattering .\nBut hidden in the discussion is the fact that workers are also at risk of getting \u201c canceled \u201d \u2014 and they often have much more to lose . \u201c We don \u2019 t have a lot of money or the name recognition that the founders and venture capitalists do , \u201d says a former Away employee . They added that no CEO , male or female , should be able to treat workers poorly \u2014 a reference to the argument that male leaders aren \u2019 t held to the same standards . \u201c It \u2019 s white feminism , \u201d the employee adds . \u201c [ The CEO ] got to where they were by playing the game and now they \u2019 re getting called out for mistreatment . So yes , for years men have been doing the same things . But what makes it okay for men to do this ? That was the \u2018 girl boss \u2019 promise . That women would do it better . But they didn \u2019 t . \u201d\nNow that the tech industry has grown to be a major cultural force , workers are wondering why they aren \u2019 t treated better\n\u201c Cancel culture \u201d aside , it seems like there has been a major cultural change in both the tech industry and tech reporting . Ten years ago , tech employees were excited to do something that might change the world for the better . Now that the tech industry has grown to be a major cultural force , workers are wondering why they aren \u2019 t treated better . They want to know why their platforms require armies of moderators who frequently get PTSD . Or why their cloud platforms are being used by the military . Or why their facial recognition systems appear to be openly racist .\nAs a result , tech reporting has focused less on founders and CEOs and more on the hundreds of thousands of workers who power their businesses . For founders and CEOs , that means public calls for their accountability . Some of those are bound to appear on major media outlets .\nAs Marc Andreessen pointed out in that 2015 New Yorker profile , the future changes in ways one can \u2019 t necessarily predict . It is no longer 1999 ; a founder-focused culture has been the norm in Silicon Valley for at least a decade . This particular reckoning may erode media credibility among some members of the tech community . It \u2019 s also possible that founders and CEOs learn to listen to their employees before they go to the press . After all , workers wouldn \u2019 t have to leak their stories to the media if companies responded to their concerns .",

Or being held accountable.\u201d\n\nAfter the main discussion died down, a group of younger tech workers moved to another room in Clubhouse (a process called \u201crerooming\u201d). There, they rehashed the debate \u2014 and why some had felt it was unproductive. \u201cIt was mostly women talking,\u201d the app builder said. \u201cIt almost became a therapy session talking about how painful the first discussion was made.\u201d\n\nClubhouse co-founder Paul Davison joined and asked the group for feedback on how the app could make discussions more productive or inclusive. The talk then shifted to a product feedback session, where people brought up the need for more moderation.\n\nA spokesperson for Clubhouse declined to comment for this story.\n\nA preview of the tech industry\u2019s animosity toward the Times occurred on Twitter the week before the Lorenz kerfuffle erupted, when Scott Alexander \u2014 a pseudonym \u2014 deleted his blog, SlateStarCodex, which centered on rationalist thought. In a final post, Alexander claimed The New York Times was going to \u201cdox\u201d him by revealing his real name in an article \u2014 an article he believed couldn\u2019t be written if the blog was taken down. He directed people to contact Times tech editor Pui-Wing Tam, who subsequently received thousands of emails and tweets, some of which were \u201ctoxic\u201d in nature, a source familiar with Times\u2019 reporting says. Srinivasan named the reporter on Twitter, who was subsequently harassed as well.\n\n\u201cAlexander, whose role has been to help explain Silicon Valley to itself, was taken up as a mascot and a martyr in a struggle against the Times, which, in the tweets of Srinivasan, Graham, and others, was enlisted as a proxy for all of the gatekeepers\u2014the arbiters of what it is and is not O.K. to say, and who is allowed, by virtue of their identity, to say it,\u201d wrote Gideon Lewis-Kraus in an article about the campaign in The New Yorker.\n\nUltimately, these efforts ran out of steam, as nothing about Alexander or SlateStarCodex has yet been published by The New York Times. The source familiar with the Times\u2019 reporting says \u201cnot a word\u201d of the SlateStarCodex story had been written when Alexander deleted his blog. But the tenor of the discussion had been set.\n\nAt the heart of the tech backlash to the media is a fear of getting \u201ccanceled\u201d \u2014 a nebulous term that\u2019s often used to refer to those who get called out online and may subsequently lose power in real life as a result. For investors and CEOs, the idea that one damning article can throw a whole company into turmoil is infuriating: it often feels like only part of the story is being told \u2014 and that part is often unflattering.\n\nBut hidden in the discussion is the fact that workers are also at risk of getting \u201ccanceled\u201d \u2014 and they often have much more to lose. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of money or the name recognition that the founders and venture capitalists do,\u201d says a former Away employee. They added that no CEO, male or female, should be able to treat workers poorly \u2014 a reference to the argument that male leaders aren\u2019t held to the same standards. \u201cIt\u2019s white feminism,\u201d the employee adds. \u201c[The CEO] got to where they were by playing the game and now they\u2019re getting called out for mistreatment. So yes, for years men have been doing the same things. But what makes it okay for men to do this? That was the \u2018girl boss\u2019 promise. That women would do it better. But they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNow that the tech industry has grown to be a major cultural force, workers are wondering why they aren\u2019t treated better\n\n\u201cCancel culture\u201d aside, it seems like there has been a major cultural change in both the tech industry and tech reporting. Ten years ago, tech employees were excited to do something that might change the world for the better. Now that the tech industry has grown to be a major cultural force, workers are wondering why they aren\u2019t treated better. They want to know why their platforms require armies of moderators who frequently get PTSD. Or why their cloud platforms are being used by the military. Or why their facial recognition systems appear to be openly racist.\n\nAs a result, tech reporting has focused less on founders and CEOs and more on the hundreds of thousands of workers who power their businesses. For founders and CEOs, that means public calls for their accountability. Some of those are bound to appear on major media outlets.\n\nAs Marc Andreessen pointed out in that 2015 New Yorker profile, the future changes in ways one can\u2019t necessarily predict. It is no longer 1999; a founder-focused culture has been the norm in Silicon Valley for at least a decade. This particular reckoning may erode media credibility among some members of the tech community. It\u2019s also possible that founders and CEOs learn to listen to their employees before they go to the press. After all, workers wouldn\u2019t have to leak their stories to the media if companies responded to their concerns.\n\nWho knows? It might even be good business.\n\nWith reporting by Nilay Patel.",
