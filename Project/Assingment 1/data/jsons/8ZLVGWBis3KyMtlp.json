We don \u2019 t have to do that . We don \u2019 t have to disclose it , but I think we have an obligation to our readers . \u201d\nAxios\u2014whose participation in the program would likely have been difficult to keep secret\u2014was among 1,661,367 recipients , according to the PPP web site .\n\u201c Everything that we write is in front of the paywall , \u201d VandeHei continued , \u201c so people can judge us based on the quality of our work . Do you feel like we \u2019 re being aggressive ? Do you feel like we \u2019 re being fair ? Do you feel like we \u2019 re being clinical ? If so , you \u2019 re going to continue to read us\u2026 If you think we \u2019 re pulling punches because we got a loan , then you shouldn \u2019 t read us . \u201d\nHe added : \u201c We \u2019 re not stupid so we knew that we could , and probably should , get additional scrutiny\u2026 The debate is knowing that I \u2019 m going to get a question from [ a media reporter ] about how you \u2019 re an institution that covers government , and you \u2019 re taking money from the government . \u201d\nVandeHei predicted that Axios\u2014which , like every other media outlet , has suffered declining advertising and has already sustained a 15-percent revenue hit as its live events business vanished\u2014will endure a terrible second half of 2020 , losing at least $ 10 million .\nIn a follow-up email , he wrote : \u201c Every small business CEO in America is confronting the stark reality of big chunks of their business disappearing before their eyes . So you unapologetically do every damn thing in your power to protect your people and brace your company for the very worst . \u201d\nIn fairness , Axios is not the only journalistic outlet taking money from Trump \u2019 s PPP . Also on Wednesday , The Seattle Times announced that it received $ 10 million in federal aid , which the publication \u2019 s chief financial officer said was a temporary \u201c lifeline \u201d to help the company avert layoffs and cutbacks over the next several months . The Tampa Bay Times\u2014which is owned by the non-profit Poynter Institute for Media Studies\u2014also announced this week that it had received an $ 8.5-million loan as part of the government \u2019 s aid program .\nThe already thinning ecosystem of local media , however , has become increasingly fragile as the coronavirus has resulted in mass layoffs and furloughs at many alt-weeklies and newspapers , including those owned by mass-media company Gannett . Such outlets often perform a public service at the local level , one that can not necessarily be replaced by Beltway-centric outlets like Axios .\nThe owner of another of Axios \u2019 D.C. media peers , Politico\u2014which was co-founded in 2007 by VandeHei , a former Wall Street Journal and Washington Post reporter\u2014also considered using PPP to shore up the financial situation of a sister publication .\nPolitico publisher Robert Allbritton told staffers on a conference call Wednesday that he could not apply for a government loan in order to avoid cuts at Protocol , his recently launched tech website , which laid off over a dozen staffers on Tuesday . According to Allbritton , because of Protocol \u2019 s common ownership with Politico , it did not qualify because the two publications combined boast over 500 employees .\nIt \u2019 s also fair to wonder , of course , how Axios , a three-year-old , almost 200-employee media company , unlike thousands of others in desperate need during the COVID-19 crisis , quickly obtained the taxpayer-guaranteed loan , which is designed to be largely forgiven if Axios maintains its payroll at pre-pandemic levels for at least eight weeks .\nAxios , a privately-held company with a reported $ 200-million valuation , is hardly without means , and neither VandeHei nor anyone else at the company plans to take a pay cut\u2014a sacrifice that executives at other businesses are reported to be making during the economic crisis .\n\u201c We have not cut anybody \u2019 s wages . You have to remember , we \u2019 re at a startup , so we \u2019 re not drawing massive salaries , \u201d VandeHei said , while declining to disclose his own . \u201c Even with our employees , the reason you \u2019 re at a startup is you tend to take a lower salary , and then you have ownership in the company\u2014and everybody in our company has ownership . \u201d\nAxios has raised around $ 30 million in venture capital from blue-chip investors such as Emerson Collective founder Laurene Powell Jobs , Huffington Post co-founder and former BuzzFeed chairman Ken Lerer , former Atlantic Media owner David Bradley , and NBC News , and was investing heavily in new technology last year , including hiring 62 more staffers in the months before the coronavirus hit , VandeHei said .\nVandeHei and his co-founder Mike Allen , along with star reporter Jonathan Swan , enjoy insidery access to Donald Trump , Jared Kushner , and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin among other top federal officials ; Axios hosts an eponymous documentary series on HBO , and aspires to quick-and-dirty journalism that it has famously dubbed \u201c smart brevity . \u201d\nThe company secured federal largesse even as thousands of worse-off , less-impressively-wired enterprises that the emergency pandemic legislation classifies as small businesses\u2014that is , 500-and-under-employee companies suffering severe financial stress\u2014failed to get any taxpayer money at all before the initial $ 349 billion PPP fund went broke last week .\n\u201c A lot of it had to do with how fast your bank acted , \u201d said Marc Goldwein , who has been tracking the government \u2019 s pandemic response as senior policy director for the Washington-based Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget . After the Small Business Administration launched Trump \u2019 s PPP in early April on a first-come , first-serve basis , \u201c a lot of companies didn \u2019 t get the loan because their bank was slow to get to the SBA , \u201d Goldwein told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nBy mid-April the well was dry . While VandeHei \u2019 s business department , under president and co-founder Roy Schwartz , rapidly assembled the required documentation and Axios \u2019 bank , J.P. Morgan Chase , certified the numbers and quickly applied for the benefit , Goldwein said the PPP money was doled out based simply on companies that met the complicated criteria\u2014mainly that they were small businesses facing substantial economic harm .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t promise you that there wasn \u2019 t some company that called up the president directly and got a fast-track , \u201d Goldwein said , \u201c but there are no reports of that that I \u2019 m aware of . \u201d\nRodney Ramcharan , a finance and business economics professor at the University of Southern California \u2019 s Marshall School of Business , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 : \u201c I don \u2019 t know , but there are rumors that maybe people with the connections in Congress or with the administration or with the Treasury Department got the funds a little bit sooner . And if you were a very small company and were banking with a smaller bank that didn \u2019 t have the administrative capacity to understand how the program was going to work , those people got the funds much later or didn \u2019 t get the funds . \u201d\nRamcharan added : \u201c We know from the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 , there \u2019 s been some research done that shows that firms that were more closely aligned with certain members of Congress were able to get some of the funds faster . And that was a time when there was a lot of oversight on how those funds were being disbursed . This is a time where the oversight is substantially less , so it doesn \u2019 t take a PhD to figure out that this might be going on . \u201d\nVandeHei said Axios received no advantage because of its influence and status in Washington . Yet it \u2019 s hard to argue that those things count for nothing .\nAs The \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported , North America \u2019 s top media union , the 30,000-plus-member NewsGuild-CWA , is planning to hire a well-connected Republican lobbying firm in order to reap rewards from any economic rescue packages being considered by Congress .\n\u201c As a believer in the First Amendment , \u201d said one of the union \u2019 s suitors , GOP lobbyist Sam Geduldig , \u201c I believe everybody has a right to petition their government , even journalists . \u201d\nSteven Waldman , president of Report for America , a non-profit whose mission is focused on saving local journalism , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 : \u201c I tend to think that in terms of government policies that touch on the media , this one [ PPP loans ] is pretty benign . The policies that tend to work the best are the ones that are very general and neutral and formulaic\u2014as opposed to , say , there \u2019 s a department of local journalism that President Trump appoints Jared Kushner to be the secretary of .
