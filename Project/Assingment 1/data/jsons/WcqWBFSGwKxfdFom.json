Tuesday came the bizarre news that there were going to be four \u2013 four -- different GOP replies to the State of the Union address . To work with Republicans Obama would need actual Republican leaders , and instead he \u2019 s dealing with hundreds of freelance potentates and kooks .\nThe GOP is splintering in real time , and that \u2019 s a bigger story than anything the president said in his 70-minute address . Sen. Rand Paul even gave what was billed as \u201c the Rand Paul response \u201d -- as though he \u2019 s his own political party , and maybe he is -- in which he billed African-American GOP columnist Star Parker as the answer to poverty .

Obama did announce one bold decision that will actually change lives : an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contract workers . But for a speech that was promoted by staff as a bold take-charge moment for a president tired of being thwarted by the GOP , and derided in advance as the equivalent of a martial law declaration by the right , it was unexpectedly conciliatory and short on concrete action .\nApart from the minimum wage order , Obama mostly outlined a bully-pulpit approach to the next year : He \u2019 s \u201c pulling together \u201d all sorts of \u201c new partnerships \u201d and \u201c summits \u201d and \u201c calling on Congress \u201d and \u201c cutting red tape \u201d and proposing a new federally backed type of IRA called , yes , myRa . Obama may have talked toughest to his fellow Democrats in the Senate when he promised , appropriately , to veto a bill that would tighten sanctions on Iran .\nAnother SOTU leak revealed an internal split over whether Obama should stress \u201c income inequality \u201d or \u201c opportunity , \u201d and revealed that \u201c opportunity \u201d won because apparently income inequality is a big downer and sounds like class warfare . In the end , the president did mention income inequality while stressing \u201c ladders of opportunity , \u201d but the preliminary hype made me more sensitive to his disappointing storytelling : Obama blamed the decline of opportunity and the rise of inequality on \u201c massive shifts in technology and global competition , \u201d but left out the deliberate shift of wealth and power from the majority to the top 1 percent , and the deliberate dismantling of \u201c ladders of opportunity \u201d that began under Ronald Reagan and continue through today .\nOverall , it was a well-delivered but tepid and still disappointingly cautious speech . He made a great joke about \u201c Mad Men \u201d policies toward women , but given the way Republicans have escalated the War on Women just this week thanks to Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul , he missed opportunities to highlight his party \u2019 s superiority , especially given the House voting for more restrictions on abortion just hours earlier .\nOnce again , though , as throughout his career , the president is blessed by having lame enemies . In her SOTU response , Rep.
