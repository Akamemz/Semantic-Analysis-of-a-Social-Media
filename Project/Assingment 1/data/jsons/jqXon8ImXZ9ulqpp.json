    "content": "The US economy roared into 2017 , adding 238,000 jobs in January and 235,000 jobs in February . But with the Labor Department 's March unemployment report , released on Friday , that strong start seems to be sputtering .\nEconomists had expected that hiring would cool off , projecting an increase of about 180,000 new jobs . But the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2019 s establishment survey fell short of even that projection , finding that total nonfarm payroll increased by just 98,000 jobs last month . ( Its household survey showed a 326,000-person drop in unemployment , but economists consider the establishment survey , which has a larger sample size and focuses on employers , to be a more accurate measure . )\nLast month \u2019 s hiring dip was likely felt by many of the 7.2 million Americans currently unemployed . But while March \u2019 s employment results were disappointing , they don \u2019 t mean that the nation 's long-running pattern of job growth has ended .\n\u201c I think it 's a little bit surprising ... that it came in as low as 98 [ thousand ] , \u201d says Elise Gould , senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute ( EPI ) . \u201c I expect that it 's a slip , and that we will see more on-trend numbers next month . \u201d\nIn a phone interview with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Dr. Gould identifies one possible \u2013 and surprising \u2013 reason for the drop .

Both could have shifted economic trends ; warmer-than-usual winter weather , for instance , means that construction sites can stay open and that more potential shoppers and home-buyers may feel inclined to venture outside .\nOn the flipside , a big snowstorm can close workplaces and put a damper on those activities .
