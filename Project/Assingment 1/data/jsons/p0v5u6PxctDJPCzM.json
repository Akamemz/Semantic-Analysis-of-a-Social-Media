Virtually every person who takes this step ultimately throws his or her hat in the ring . It \u2019 s only a matter of time .\nPolls show him at or near the top of the prospective Republican nominees for 2016 . The recent McClatchy-Marist poll has Mitt Romney and Bush leading with 19 and 15 percent respectively . And a PPP poll has Bush ahead of Chris Christie , Mike Huckabee , Paul Ryan and both Rand Paul and Ted Cruz .\nDespite this , Bush by no means has an insurmountable lead . And while the Bush name for some is a positive and will help Jeb enormously , for others it is an unalterable negative both because of prior history , ideology and perceived performance in office .\nThat said , there is one constituency that I fully expect to support Jeb Bush : the donors , bundlers and those who pursue independent expenditure . There \u2019 s every reason to believe that this community \u2013 the money community \u2013 will rally behind Bush \u2019 s candidacy and given the importance of independent expenditure political action committees in the last presidential election , it \u2019 s fair to assume that between his own campaign committee and outsiders , he will be the best funded candidate in the Republican field .\nNevertheless , it will be far from a cakewalk for Bush in the primary . His problems are three fold .\nFirst , his ardent support for Common Core does not sit well with many in his party . Second , he has come out in support of comprehensive immigration reform , a hot button issue today with the GOP and its supporters , especially in light of President Obama \u2019 s executive action last month . And third , he \u2019 s considered tax increases as part of an overall reform package to help balance the budget in the past \u2013 anathema to those that control the GOP today .\nFor all these reasons , it may be hard for Tea Party Republicans and the right wing of the party more generally , to support his candidacy .\nThis is not to say that Jeb Bush will not be smart enough to try to neutralize these potential disadvantages . He surely will . To this end , Bush \u2019 s thoughtful and reasonable message at the Wall Street CEOs conference was a positive and uplifting one , exactly what the Republican Party needs to go mainstream and what the Tea Party itself abhors .\nShould Bush make the general election he will be a compelling candidate against the likely Democratic nominee , Hillary Clinton .
