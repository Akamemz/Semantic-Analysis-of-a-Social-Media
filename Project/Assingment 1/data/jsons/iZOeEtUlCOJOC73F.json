    "content": "LONDON/WASHINGTON A Tehran-based agency has quietly fed propaganda through at least 70 websites to countries from Afghanistan to Russia . And American firms have helped .\nWebsite Nile Net Online promises Egyptians \u201c true news \u201d from its offices in the heart of Cairo \u2019 s Tahrir Square , \u201c to expand the scope of freedom of expression in the Arab world . \u201d\nIts views on America do not chime with those of Egypt \u2019 s state media , which celebrate Donald Trump \u2019 s warm relations with Cairo . In one recent article , Nile Net Online derided the American president as a \u201c low-level theater actor \u201d who \u201c turned America into a laughing stock \u201d after he attacked Iran in a speech at the United Nations .\nUntil recently , Nile Net Online had more than 115,000 page-followers across Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . But its contact telephone numbers , including one listed as 0123456789 , don \u2019 t work . A Facebook map showing its location dropped a pin onto the middle of the street , rather than any building . And regulars at the square , including a newspaper stallholder and a policeman , say they have never heard of the website .\nThe reason : Nile Net Online is part of an influence operation based in Tehran .\nIt \u2019 s one of more than 70 websites found by \u2588\u2588\u2588 which push Iranian propaganda to 15 countries , in an operation that cybersecurity experts , social media firms and journalists are only starting to uncover . The sites found by \u2588\u2588\u2588 are visited by more than half a million people a month , and have been promoted by social media accounts with more than a million followers .\nThe sites underline how political actors worldwide are increasingly circulating distorted or false information online to influence public opinion . The discoveries follow allegations that Russian disinformation campaigns have swayed voters in the United States and Europe . Advisers to Saudi Arabia \u2019 s crown prince , and the army in Myanmar , are also among those using social media to distribute propaganda and attack their enemies . Moscow has denied the charges ; Riyadh and Yangon have not commented .\nFormer CIA director John Brennan told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that \u201c countries around the globe \u201d are now using such information warfare tactics .\n\u201c The Iranians are sophisticated cyber players , \u201d he said of the Iranian campaign . \u201c There are elements of the Iranian intelligence services that are rather capable in terms of operating ( online ) . \u201d\nTraced by building on research from cybersecurity firms FireEye and ClearSky , the sites in the campaign have been active at different times since 2012 . They look like normal news and media outlets , but only a couple disclose any Iranian ties .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 could not determine whether the Iranian government is behind the sites ; Iranian officials in Tehran and London did not reply to questions .\nBut all the sites are linked to Iran in one of two ways . Some carry stories , video and cartoons supplied by an online agency called the International Union of Virtual Media ( IUVM ) , which says on its website it is headquartered in Tehran . Some have shared online registration details with IUVM , such as addresses and phone numbers . Twenty-one of the websites do both .\nEmails sent to IUVM bounced back and telephone numbers the agency gave in web registration records did not work . Documents available on the main IUVM website say its objectives include \u201c confronting with remarkable arrogance , western governments and Zionism front activities . \u201d\nNile Net Online did not respond to questions sent to the email address on its website . Its operators , as well as those of the other websites identified by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , could not be located . Previous owners identified in historical registration records could not be reached . The Egyptian government did not respond to requests for comment .\nSome of the sites in the Iranian operation were first exposed in August by companies including Facebook , Twitter and Google \u2019 s parent , Alphabet , after FireEye found them . The social media companies have closed hundreds of accounts that promoted the sites or pushed Iranian messaging . Facebook said last month it had taken down 82 pages , groups and accounts linked to the Iranian campaign ; these had gathered more than one million followers in the United States and Britain .\nBut the sites uncovered by \u2588\u2588\u2588 have a much wider scope . They have published in 16 different languages , from Azerbaijani to Urdu , targeting Internet users in less-developed countries . That they reached readers in tightly controlled societies such as Egypt , which has blocked hundreds of news websites since 2017 , highlights the campaign \u2019 s reach .\n\u00b7 A news site called Another Western Dawn which says its focus is on \u201c unspoken truth. \u201d It fooled the Pakistani defence minister into issuing a nuclear threat against Israel .\n\u00b7 Ten outlets targeting readers in Yemen , where Iran and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia have been fighting a proxy conflict since civil war broke out in 2015 ;\n\u00b7 A media outlet offering daily news and satirical cartoons in Sudan . \u2588\u2588\u2588 could not reach any of its staff ;\n\u00b7 A website called Realnie Novosti , or \u201c Real News , \u201d for Russian readers . It offers a downloadable mobile phone app but its operator could not be traced .\nThe news on the sites is not all fake . Authentic stories sit alongside pirated cartoons , as well as speeches from Iran \u2019 s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . The sites clearly support Iran \u2019 s government and amplify antagonism to countries opposed to Tehran - particularly Israel , Saudi Arabia and the United States . Nile Net \u2019 s \u201c laughing stock \u201d piece was copied from an Iranian state TV network article published earlier the same day .\nSome of the sites are slapdash . The self-styled , misspelled \u201c Yemen Press Agecny \u201d carries a running update of Saudi \u201c crimes against Yemenis during the past 24 hours. \u201d Emails sent to the agency \u2019 s listed contact , Arafat Shoroh , bounced back . The agency \u2019 s address and phone number led to a hotel in the Yemeni capital , Sana \u2019 a , whose staff said they had never heard of Shoroh .\nThe front page of the 'Yemen Press ' website . Nov. 30 2018\nThe identity or location of the past owners of some of the websites is visible in historical Internet registration records : 17 of 71 sites have in the past listed their locations as Iran or Tehran , or given an Iranian telephone or fax number . But who owns them now is often hidden , and none of the Iranian-linked operators could be reached .\nMore than 50 of the sites use American web service providers Cloudflare and OnlineNIC - firms that provide website owners with tools to shield themselves from spam and hackers . Frequently , such services also effectively conceal who owns the sites or where they are hosted . The companies declined to tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 who operates the sites .\nUnder U.S law , hosting and web services companies are not generally liable for the content of sites they serve , said Eric Goldman , co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University . Still , since 2014 , U.S. sanctions on Iran have banned \u201c the exportation or re-exportation , directly or indirectly , of web-hosting services that are for commercial endeavors or of domain name registration services . \u201d\nDouglas Kramer , general counsel for Cloudflare , said the services it provides do not include web-hosting services . \u201c We \u2019 ve looked at those various sanctions regimes , we are comfortable that we are not in violation , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nA spokesman for OnlineNIC said none of the sites declared a connection to Iran in their registration details , and the company was in full compliance with U.S. sanctions and trade embargoes .\nThe U.S. Treasury \u2019 s Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) declined to comment on whether it planned an investigation .\nIranians burn an effigy of U.S. President Donald Trump in Tehran , Iran June 8 , 2018 . Tasnim News Agency\nThe Kremlin is widely seen as the superpower in modern information warfare . From what is known so far , Russia \u2019 s influence operation - which Moscow denies - dwarfs Iran \u2019 s . According to Twitter , nearly 4,000 accounts connected to the Russian campaign posted over 9 million tweets between 2013 and 2018 , against over 1 million tweets from fewer than 1,000 accounts believed to originate in Iran .\nEven though the Iranian operation is smaller , it has had impact on volatile topics . AWDnews - the site with the focus on \u201c unspoken truth \u201d - ran a false story in 2016 which prompted Pakistan \u2019 s defense minister to warn on Twitter he had the weapons to nuke Israel . He only found out that the hoax was part of an Iranian operation when contacted by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c It was a learning experience , \u201d said the deceived politician , 69-year-old Khawaja Asif , who left Pakistan \u2019 s government earlier this year . \u201c But one can understand that these sorts of things happen , because fake news has become something huge . It \u2019 s something which anyone is capable of now , which is very dangerous . \u201d\nIsraeli officials did not respond to a request for comment .\nAWDnews publishes in English , French , Spanish and German and , according to data from web analytics company SimilarWeb , receives around 12,000 unique visitors a month . Among others who shared stories from AWDnews and the other websites identified by \u2588\u2588\u2588 were politicians in Britain , Jordan , India , and the Netherlands ; human-rights activists ; an Indian music composer and a Japanese rap star .\nHatebook Why Facebook is losing the war on hate speech in Myanmar\nFireEye , a U.S. cybersecurity firm , originally named six websites as part of the Iranian influence operation . \u2588\u2588\u2588 examined those sites , and their content led to the Tehran-based International Union of Virtual Media .\nIUVM is an array of 11 websites with names such as iuvmpress , iuvmapp and iuvmpixel . Together , they form a library of digital material , including mobile phone apps , items from Iranian state media and pictures , video clips and stories from elsewhere on the web , which support Tehran \u2019 s policies .\nTracking usage of IUVM content across the Internet led to sites which have used its material , registration details , or both . For instance , 22 of the sites have shared the same phone number , which does not work and has also been listed for IUVM . At least seven have used the same address , which belongs to a youth hostel in Berlin . Staff at the hostel told \u2588\u2588\u2588 they had never heard of the sites in question . The site operators could not be reached to explain their links with IUVM .\nTwo sites even posted job advertisements for IUVM , inviting applications from women with \u201c ability to work effectively and knowledge in dealing with social networks and ( the ) Internet . \u201d\nOne of IUVM \u2019 s most popular users is a site called Sudan Today , which SimilarWeb data shows receives almost 150,000 unique visitors each month . On Facebook , it tells its 57,000 followers that it operates without political bias . Its 18,000 followers on Twitter have included the Italian Embassy in Sudan , and its work has been cited in a report by the Egyptian Electricity Ministry .\nThe office address registered for Sudan Today in 2016 covers a whole city district in north Khartoum , according to archived website registration details provided by WhoisAPI Inc and DomainTools LLC . The phone number listed in those records does not work .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 could not trace staff members named on Sudan Today \u2019 s Facebook page . The five-star Corinthia hotel in central Khartoum , where the site says it hosted an anniversary party last year , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 no such event took place . And an address listed on one of its social media accounts is a demolished home .\nSudan used to be an Iranian ally but has changed sides to align itself with Saudi Arabia , costing Tehran a foothold in the Horn of Africa just as it becomes more isolated by the West . In that environment , Iran sees itself as competing with Israel , Saudi Arabia and the United States for international support , and is taking the fight online , said Ariane Tabatabai , a senior associate and Iran expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , D.C .\nHeadlines on Sudan Today \u2019 s homepage include a daily round-up of stories from local newspapers and Ugandan soccer results . It also features reports on bread prices - which doubled in January after Khartoum eliminated subsidies , triggering demonstrations .\nOhad Zaidenberg , senior researcher at Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky , said this mixture of content provides the cover for narratives geared at influencing a target audience \u2019 s attitudes and perceptions .\nThe site also draws attention to Saudi Arabia \u2019 s military actions in Yemen . Since Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir ended his allegiance with Iran he has sent troops and jets to join Saudi-led forces in the Yemeni conflict .\nOne cartoon from IUVM published by Sudan Today in August shows Donald Trump astride a military jet with an overflowing bag of dollar bills tucked under one arm . The jet is draped with traditional Saudi dress and shown dropping bombs on a bloodstained map of Yemen . The map is littered with children \u2019 s toys and shoes .\nTurkish cartoonist Mikail \u00c7ift\u00e7i drew the original . He told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he did not give Sudan Today permission to use it .\nThis cartoon was copied by IUVM without permission from the artist .\nAlnagi Albashra , a 28-year-old software developer in Khartoum , said he likes to read articles on Sudan Today in the evenings when waiting for his baby to fall asleep . But he and three other Sudan Today readers reached by \u2588\u2588\u2588 had no idea who was behind the site .\n\u201c This is a big problem , \u201d he said . \u201c You can \u2019 t see that they are not in Sudan . \u201d\nGovernment officials in Khartoum , the White House , the Italian Embassy and the Egyptian Electricity Ministry did not respond to requests for comment .\nIt is unclear who globally is tasked with responding to online disinformation campaigns like Iran \u2019 s , or what if any action they should take , said David Conrad , chief technology officer at ICANN , a non-profit which helps manage global web addresses .\nSocial media accounts can be deleted in bulk by the firms that provide the platforms . But the Iranian campaign \u2019 s backbone of websites makes it harder to dismantle than social media , because taking down a website often requires the cooperation of law enforcement , Internet service providers and web infrastructure companies .\nEfforts by social media companies in the United States and Europe to tackle the campaign have had mixed results .\nShortly after being contacted by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Twitter suspended the accounts for Nile Net Online and Sudan Today . \u201c Clear attribution is very difficult , \u201d a spokeswoman said , but added that the company would continue to update a public database of tweets and accounts linked to state-backed information operations when it had new information .\nGoogle did not respond directly to questions about the websites found by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . The company has said it identified and closed 99 accounts which it says are linked to Iranian state media . \u201c We \u2019 ve invested in robust systems to identify influence operations launched by foreign governments , \u201d a spokeswoman said .\nFacebook said it was aware of the websites found by \u2588\u2588\u2588 and had removed five more Facebook pages . But a spokesman said that based on Facebook user data , the company was not yet able to link all the websites \u2019 accounts to the Iranian activity found earlier . \u201c In the past several months , we have removed hundreds of Pages , Groups , and accounts linked to Iranian actors engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior . We continue to remove accounts across our services and in all relevant languages , \u201d he said .\nAccounts linked to the Iranian sites remain active online , especially in languages other than English . On Nov. 30 , 16 of the Iranian sites were still posting daily updates on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram or YouTube - including Sudan Today and Nile Net Online . Between them , the social media accounts had more than 700,000 followers .\nThe address listed for 'Sudan Today ' on one social media account leads here .\n( Corrects to delete two paragraphs in section three - WHO representative was not authorised to speak to the media )",

But the Iranian campaign\u2019s backbone of websites makes it harder to dismantle than social media, because taking down a website often requires the cooperation of law enforcement, Internet service providers and web infrastructure companies.\n\nEfforts by social media companies in the United States and Europe to tackle the campaign have had mixed results.\n\nShortly after being contacted by Reuters, Twitter suspended the accounts for Nile Net Online and Sudan Today. \u201cClear attribution is very difficult,\u201d a spokeswoman said, but added that the company would continue to update a public database of tweets and accounts linked to state-backed information operations when it had new information.\n\nGoogle did not respond directly to questions about the websites found by Reuters. The company has said it identified and closed 99 accounts which it says are linked to Iranian state media. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested in robust systems to identify influence operations launched by foreign governments,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nFacebook said it was aware of the websites found by Reuters and had removed five more Facebook pages. But a spokesman said that based on Facebook user data, the company was not yet able to link all the websites\u2019 accounts to the Iranian activity found earlier. \u201cIn the past several months, we have removed hundreds of Pages, Groups, and accounts linked to Iranian actors engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior. We continue to remove accounts across our services and in all relevant languages,\u201d he said.\n\nAccounts linked to the Iranian sites remain active online, especially in languages other than English. On Nov. 30, 16 of the Iranian sites were still posting daily updates on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or YouTube - including Sudan Today and Nile Net Online. Between them, the social media accounts had more than 700,000 followers.\n\nThe address listed for 'Sudan Today' on one social media account leads here.\n\n(Corrects to delete two paragraphs in section three - WHO representative was not authorised to speak to the media)",
