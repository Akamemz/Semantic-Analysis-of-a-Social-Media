Mr. Weener said Monday at the crash site that the recorder was found in the train 's front car and has been sent to Washington for analysis .\nThe other event recorder was found earlier in the rear locomotive .\nWeener said investigators hope to download information from the memory cards from that recorder on Monday . They hope it can provide information on the speed of the train , how the brakes were applied and the throttle setting .\nHe says they 've already had some success in retrieving data . But the information has to be validated before it 's made public .\nThe NTSB said it would consider whether excessive speed , mechanical problems or human error could have played a role in the Sunday morning crash , which threw some riders from toppling cars .\nIt was the latest accident in a troubled year for the second-biggest U.S. commuter railroad , which had never experienced a passenger death in an accident in its 31-year history .\nOfficials warned the 26,000 weekday riders of Metro-North railroad to brace for crowded trains during the morning commute .\nThe locomotive was hoisted back on the track before dawn Monday morning , and two cranes were in place to lift the rest of the toppled cars pending approval of the board , spokesman Aaron Donovan said .\nAbout 150 people were on board when the train derailed as it rounded a riverside curb . Donovan said the railroad believed everyone aboard has been accounted for .\nSome of the passengers on the Metro-North train from the town of Poughkeepsie to Manhattan were jolted from sleep around 7:20 a.m. to screams and the frightening sensation of their compartment rolling over on the bend .\nWhen the motion stopped , all seven cars and the locomotive had lurched off the rails .\nIn their efforts to find passengers , rescuers shattered windows , searched nearby woods and waters and used pneumatic jacks and air bags to peer under wreckage .\nNTSB board member Earl Weener said at a news conference Sunday the agency had just begun its investigation and had n't yet spoken to the train 's engineer , who was among the injured .
