What I look for is the pacer horse- the one candidate that we \u2019 re not going to be able to keep our eyes off of . The candidate that everyone is going to feel the need to respond to . Keep your eyes on that person , not just for what they did on Tuesday night , but going into Wednesday as well . Early in the night on Tuesday , I thought it was going to be Bernie . But it wasn \u2019 t . It was Elizabeth Warren . She came out swinging and didn \u2019 t stop .\nWho had a memorable message ? I always look for a message that is going to stick . After the cameras go off and we are left to think about the candidates , who created a lasting impression ? Sadly , no one from last night will have a message that will stick .

Sometimes it \u2019 s as interesting to focus on what wasn \u2019 t said as what was . What wasn \u2019 t talked about : impeachment .

Each candidate \u2019 s performance will determine if we see them again .\nWith so much riding on it , it \u2019 s surprising that there were so many forgettable candidates . The one stand-out performance came from Elizabeth Warren and I predict that she is the only candidate who will move in the polls .",
