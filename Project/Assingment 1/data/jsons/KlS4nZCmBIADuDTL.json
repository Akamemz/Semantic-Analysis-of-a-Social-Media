These two measures , which are still subject to sequestration , were negotiated with broad bipartisan support even though they did not become law during the last session of Congress .\nAides on both sides of the aisle say the funding tactic enables lawmakers to respond to changing circumstances or address the funding priorities of an agency rather than rely on existing spending plans that may have become outdated or impractical .\n`` The legislation will avoid a government shutdown on March 27 , prioritize DoD and Veterans programs , and allow the Pentagon some leeway to do its best with the funding it has , '' Rep.
