    "content": "As Donald Trump staggers following a series of self-inflicted political wounds , Republican candidates up and down the ballot are expressing growing disinterest in hitting the campaign trail with him this fall .\nOver the past week , \u2588\u2588\u2588 surveyed nearly 50 GOP candidates in competitive House , Senate and governor \u2019 s races on whether they \u2019 d be willing to campaign with the Republican nominee . Only a handful said yes \u2014 and the rest said no , refused to commit or didn \u2019 t respond at all .\nIt \u2019 s an unusual turn of events . Typically down-ballot candidates \u2014 eager to generate excitement and media attention for themselves , to turbocharge fundraising , and to increase their stature \u2014 spend the fall months proudly campaigning alongside their presidential nominee .\nBut in the year of Trump , appearing on the same stage as the party \u2019 s standard-bearer \u2014 whose negative ratings are higher than any other GOP nominee 's in recent memory \u2014 is perilous for those running in hypercompetitive states and districts .\n\u201c I would recommend they have a perpetual scheduling conflict , \u201d said Rob Jesmer , a former National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director who advises a number of the party \u2019 s most prominent lawmakers .\nAmong those most wary of campaigning alongside Trump is Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman , a suburban Denver Republican whose district broke for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 . Nearly 20 percent of the district is Latino \u2014 meaning it could well turn against Trump , whose rhetoric on immigration has alienated minorities . In recent days , Coffman , an Army and Marine veteran who fought in Iraq , has made clear his displeasure with Trump .\n\u201c Mike has grave reservations about his policies , his tone , this latest mind-blowing dust-up with Gold Star parents , \u201d said Cinamon Watson , a Coffman spokeswoman . \u201c So no , we are n't campaigning with Donald Trump . \u201d\nThe lack of enthusiasm is just as apparent in Florida , a must-win state for Trump that also features a number of competitive down-ballot contests . During a back-and-forth with reporters last week , Sen. Marco Rubio , a defeated Trump primary rival now running for reelection , refused to commit to appearing with his former foe .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll take that on a case-by-case basis . I have to run my own campaign , and so I \u2019 ve got to set my own schedule and I can \u2019 t be canceling events , \u201d said Rubio , who \u2014 unlike some of his Senate colleagues \u2014 has endorsed Trump . \u201c But if the opportunity presents itself , we \u2019 ll look at that and see if it makes sense . ''\nOthers in the state are being more definitive : It isn \u2019 t happening .\nA spokeswoman for GOP Rep. David Jolly , whose St. Petersburg-area district was narrowly won by Obama in the past two presidential elections , said the congressman `` has no plans to campaign with Mr . Trump . '' Rep. Carlos Curbelo , a freshman Republican who hails from a majority Latino district in South Florida and is a loud critic of Trump , declined to answer when asked about the prospect of campaigning with the GOP nominee \u2014 but volunteered that he \u2019 d be appearing with Rubio .\nThere is even a Republican in bright red Nebraska who is leery of being onstage with the party \u2019 s nominee . Nebraska allocates three of its five electoral votes by congressional district , and in the most diverse and politically competitive one \u2014 the Omaha-based 2nd \u2014 Republican Don Bacon , a retired Air Force brigadier general who is waging his first campaign for a House seat , has decided he \u2019 s better off not aligning himself with Trump .\n\u201c Campaigning with presidential candidates is n't currently part of our strategy , '' said Elliott Bottorf , a Bacon spokesman .\nIn the traditionally Democratic states that Trump has vowed to compete in , the desire to separate from Trump is even more intense . In Illinois \u2014 a state that hasn \u2019 t been won by a Republican presidential nominee since 1988 , but which Trump has said he \u2019 ll put in play \u2014 GOP Rep. Bob Dold has declared that he won \u2019 t support or vote for Trump . \u201c Bob 's position on that has never changed , so no , he will not be campaigning with or supporting Donald Trump in any fashion , \u201d said James Slepian , a Dold spokesman .\nThen there \u2019 s Trump \u2019 s home state of New York , where three Republican congressional hopefuls in swing districts say they had no plans to appear alongside the nominee . A spokesman for John Faso , a former leader in the state Legislature who is seeking a Hudson Valley-based seat , said the candidate \u201c is not expecting to be joined on the trail by any other national candidates or officials . \u201d\nTrump spokespersons declined to comment on his upcoming plans to campaign with endangered Republicans . His travel this week is expected to take him to Wisconsin , where GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is running for reelection . Yet Johnson , according to an aide , isn \u2019 t expected to be in attendance .\nRoughly half of the Republicans surveyed for this story did not respond to multiple requests for comment . Among them : Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey , who has refused to endorse Trump . Toomey , one of the most imperiled Republican incumbents in the country , skipped the Republican National Convention and was not present on Monday during a Trump rally in Mechanicsburg , Pennsylvania . According to a count compiled by the Washington Examiner , he has been absent for all four of the events Trump has held in the state as the nominee .\nThe dodging comes as senior GOP strategists grapple with how to deal with Trump . Amid the latest controversy surrounding his criticism of a family of a fallen U.S. soldier , some are urging Republican down-ballot hopefuls to take a harder tack against the nominee . Liesl Hickey , who served as National Republican Congressional Committee executive director during the 2014 midterms , has begun circulating a memo \u2014 obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 and titled \u201c How to Survive in 2016 \u201d \u2014 addressed to imperiled House GOP contenders in which she argues that they have little to lose by distancing themselves from Trump .\n\u201c Vulnerable candidates are wringing their hands over this , and they should just stop . First , you do not need to motivate Trump voters to vote \u2014 they are voting and it has nothing to do with you and everything to do with Hillary Clinton , \u201d writes Hickey , who has worked on a number of races in swing parts of the country .\nHickey encourages candidates to take a decisive stand on whether they back Trump \u2014 something many of them have struggled to do . \u201c Make the decision based solely on what your district expects \u2014 not what party leaders , consultants or anyone else expects . Whatever position you take , it has got to be authentic , \u201d she writes . \u201c If there is any time to be absolutely clear , this is it . And if you supported him at one time and no longer can , don \u2019 t be scared to say it . \u201d\nRepublicans , she advises , shouldn \u2019 t spend all their time talking about Trump . Hickey urges them to launch focused , carefully crafted attacks on Clinton \u2014 but to avoid personal diatribes , such as saying she belongs in prison .\nDemocrats , for their part , appear far more willing to campaign with Clinton . Of about 50 Democratic candidates for House , Senate and governors who were contacted , nearly half said they \u2019 d want to hit the trail with their presidential nominee .\nOnly two wouldn \u2019 t commit to campaigning with Clinton ( though others declined to reply ) . One , Utah congressional hopeful Doug Owens , \u201c is not planning to participate in any national campaigns , \u201d said a spokesman . The other , Indiana gubernatorial candidate John Gregg , would \u201c certainly consider it , \u201d a spokesman said .\nWhile Clinton \u2019 s negatives remain high , Democrats acknowledge , she \u2019 s not as toxic as Trump .\n`` It 's no surprise that House Republicans are using every excuse in the book to avoid campaigning with Donald Trump , \u201d New York Rep. Steve Israel , a former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman , wrote in an email . \u201c He continues to offend voters , including the families of our greatest American heroes .
