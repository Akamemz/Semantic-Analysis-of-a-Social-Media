( Jim Bourg/Reuters )\nFrom Dianne Feinstein to John Kerry to Maxine Waters to Cory \u2018 Spartacus \u2019 Booker , Democrats are losing their marbles .\nThe progressive street is leading fossilized Democrats into a sort of collective madness .\nThe dinosaurs of the party desperately seek relevance by sounding crazier than the new unhinged base that disrupts Senate hearings , loudly pronounces a new socialist future , and envisions octogenarian Maxine Waters as more the future of the party than is septuagenarian Nancy Pelosi . The spectacle is right out of Euripides \u2019 s Bacchae , as the creaky old guard of the polis , Tiresias and Cadmus , dress up in trendy , ridiculous ritual costumes to stumble along after the racing and frenzied young maenads in their lethal courtship of suicidal Dionysian madness .\nSix-term senator Dianne Feinstein is running against a far more radical Democrat , Kevin de Le\u00f3n , in California \u2019 s general election . ( He added the accent and the \u201c de \u201d to his name in midlife , thereby enhancing his ethnic authenticity . ) Feinstein \u2019 s current Senate colleague , the junior senator Kamala Harris , has been interrupting , sermonizing , and shouting at the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings in a fashion that generates the media buzz and attention usually reserved for supposedly sober and judicious old hands like Feinstein .\nApparently in reaction to these youthful , far-left challenges , a frustrated Feinstein has decided to descend even lower than Harris , who once , after all , joked about killing Trump . ( When asked what she would do if stuck in an elevator with Trump and Pence , Harris answered , \u201c Does one of us have to come out alive ? \u201d ) Feinstein is now saying that she has had the new \u201c evidence \u201d about Judge Brett Kavanaugh in her possession for at least six weeks . And now , at the eleventh hour after the confirmation hearings are over , it could gin up enough hysteria , without formal refutation , to sink his nomination to the Supreme Court .\nSupposedly when Kavanaugh was a 17-year-old in high school ( that is 36 years ago ) , a young female fellow high-schooler ( that is , Christine Blasey Ford , the suddenly identified author of the complaint ) felt that she was sexually harassed by the teenage Kavanaugh and a chum , and that at this opportune moment , the traumatic experience of more than three decades ago has come to a boil and therefore should be aired precisely when Kavanaugh is likely to be confirmed . Dozens of high-school friends of Kavanaugh have offered testimonies that they never heard of any such assault . His supposed co-defendant adamantly denies the charge . Blasey Ford apparently can not remember the location or the date of the alleged assault . In her originally anonymous accusation , she claimed that she had sought \u201c medical attention \u201d for the attack . In fact , she is apparently referring , less dramatically , to a visit 30 years later to her therapist , where she mentioned the incident in the course of relationship therapy . And yet the therapist \u2019 s notes , taken at the time of her assertions six years ago , do not support her latest version of the teenage Kavanaugh \u2019 s alleged assault 36 years ago .\nIn publicizing the letter anonymously at first , Feinstein apparently had lots of aims besides blowing up the Kavanaugh sure-thing nomination . In the new progressive world of Julia Salazars and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezes , Feinstein also wants to strut her ossified progressive fides . That is , she seems desperate to remind California voters that while she may be an 85-year-old white woman , married to a hyper-capitalist billionaire , and a longtime resident of a 20-million-dollar Pacific Heights mansion , she is still a growling hard-left and partisan lioness in winter .\nFeinstein also hopes to show that she is still a key Senate player and a newsmaker . Recently , we learned that , for nearly 20 years , she was cuckolded by unknowingly hiring and retaining a chauffeur and personal gofer who all the while was a Chinese spy \u2014 a disclosure suggesting that the former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee was , well , not exactly so intelligent .\nA similarly angry and frustrated Democrat , former secretary of state John Kerry , is not to be outdone either . Recently in a variety of venues he has confessed that he has kept back-channel communications open with Iranian foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif , his former partner in forging the so-called Iran deal . Apparently , Kerry is seeking to reassure the Iranians that Trump \u2019 s recent cancellation of the deal is felt to be a mistake by sober and judicious Washington establishmentarians such as himself . Further , if the two such transnational professionals can maintain deep-state negotiations apart from and contrary to the current U.S. government , one day calm with Tehran will be restored by the likes of none other than John Kerry .\nAs Kerry put it in bureaucratic lingo : \u201c What I have done is tried to elicit from him [ Zarif ] what Iran might be willing to do in order to change the dynamic in the Middle East for the better. \u201d Translated , \u201c dynamic \u201d means something along the lines of \u201c I am trying to work with the Iranians to nullify the current official policy of the U.S. government. \u201d Paul Manafort was indicted in part for being an unregistered foreign agent . John Kerry feels that he should be praised as paragon of moral virtue for the same offense . Otherwise , America need not \u201c elicit \u201d anything from Zarif , given that one need only look to the work of the Iranians and Hezbollah in Iraq , Lebanon , Syria , and Yemen , and survey its missiles and surrogate rockets pointed at Israel .\nPause for a moment and collate some of the assertions of other mainstream Democrats in recent weeks . Former law professor Senator Elizabeth Warren ( D. , Mass . ) has claimed that an anonymous op-ed in the New York Times and unsubstantiated charges from unnamed sources in Bob Woodward \u2019 s book Fear are now grounds for removing from office an elected president through the invocation of the 25th Amendment . Follow further the law professor \u2019 s logic : Produce an unsigned accusation or write a book based on gossip of unnamed informants , and , presto , the president is proven nuts and should be removed . I suppose the anonymous op-ed and concurrent Woodward expos\u00e9 fueled by anonymous sources will be short-cut substitutes for impeachment and a trial in the Senate .\nSenator Cory Booker ( D. , N.J. ) railed long and hard at the Kavanaugh hearing before boldly announcing that he was violating Senate rules ( \u201c bring it on \u201d ) by bravely releasing classified information for the higher purpose of destroying Kavanaugh \u2019 s chances . Only , he didn \u2019 t \u2014 Booker knew that his supposedly explosive leaked information had already been declassified and was in fact mundane .\nWeirder still , Booker apparently did not grasp or care that the documents reflected positively , not negatively , on Kavanaugh \u2019 s character .
