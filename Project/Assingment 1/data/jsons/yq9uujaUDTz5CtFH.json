    "content": "Over the weekend , a shootout between three rival biker gangs at a bar in Waco , Texas , left at least nine gang members dead and 18 others hospitalized with gunshot and stab wounds .\nIt was a huge , devastating tragedy . The New York Times reported that law enforcement sources called it `` the worst violence in the Waco area since the siege on the Branch Davidian compound in 1993 that left 86 people dead . ''\nBut if you follow the social media conversations around the incident , you 'll see something in addition to the predictable shock , curiosity , and mourning for the victims : there 's frustration and anger over how the Waco shootout ( whose perpetrators appear to be mostly white ) is being talked about \u2014 and , specifically , how that contrasts with the coverage and commentary of crimes when the people involved are black .\nWith the Waco incident , we got just the news \u2014 not the racial pathology\nThose who are using what happened in Waco to start conversations about stereotypes and media biases against black people are n't complaining about the tenor of this weekend 's media coverage . They 're saying something a little different : that by being pretty reasonable and sticking to the facts , this coverage highlights the absurdity of the language and analysis that have been deployed in other instances , when the accused criminals are black .\nIn particular , you 'll see a lot of sarcasm about `` white-on-white crime '' and `` white-on-white violence . ''\nThat 's because hand-wringing over `` black-on-black '' violence is frustratingly common \u2014 especially as an attempt to derail the focus on high profile stories of police-involved deaths of black people . It 's finally catching on that focusing on black-on-black crime in response to criticism of law enforcement practices does n't make sense , but the absence of any similar refrain in cases in which the suspected criminals are white is a reminder of how the idea of intraracial crime is almost exclusively \u2014 and unfairly \u2014 brought up when black people are involved .\nHey @ CNN and @ FoxNews : Are you gon na talk about white on white crime tonight . Waco is plagued with biker gang violence . \u2014 Terrell J.
