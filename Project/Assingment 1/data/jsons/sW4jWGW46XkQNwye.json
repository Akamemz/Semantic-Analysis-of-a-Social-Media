    "content": "For nearly seven years , Republicans have been saying that they would repeal and replace Obamacare as soon as they had the power to do it . Now they have the White House and majorities in both houses of Congress , but appear not to have any viable strategy for making good on that promise .\nThe elusiveness of that strategy follows from the many constraints under which Republicans are operating . Here are six . One : A lot of people who voted for Republicans want to see the end of Obamacare , for both philosophical and practical reasons . Two : A lot of them \u2014 sometimes the same people \u2014 are nervous about losing their health coverage if it goes . Most people also like important elements of Obamacare , such as its ban on insurer discrimination against people with preexisting conditions and its requirement that adults under age 26 be allowed to get coverage through their parents \u2019 plans .\nThree : Senate rules are generally thought to expose any legislation that modifies or abolishes Obamacare \u2019 s regulations to filibuster \u2014 which means that any 41 of the chamber \u2019 s 48 Democrats could block that legislation . Republicans can use the \u201c budget reconciliation \u201d rules to pass legislation with 51 votes in the Senate , but only , they think , if that legislation exclusively concerns taxes and spending rather than regulations . Four : The Democrats are nearly uniform in their opposition to doing anything to Obamacare other than tweaking or spending more money on it .\nFive : Republicans do not all agree on what \u201c replacement \u201d should look like . The most worked-out Republican plans would make it possible for nearly everyone to buy catastrophic-insurance policies but vastly reduce the federal role in regulating health insurance . Some Republicans , though , would prefer to return government policy to what it was before Obamacare , or to pursue a different free-market policy , even if those alternatives led to a loss of coverage for 10 to 20 million Americans .\nSix : Obamacare \u2019 s provisions are interrelated in a way that makes piecemeal changes perilous . Because the law requires insurers to sell the same policies at the same prices to the sick and the healthy alike \u2014 one of its popular elements \u2014 it creates an incentive for healthy people to forgo insurance . They can wait until they are sick to buy it . But health-insurance markets can not work if only sick people buy coverage . That \u2019 s why Obamacare also includes its unpopular provision fining people for not buying insurance : to prod healthy people to get covered . Take away the fines but not the regulation , and insurance markets could unravel .\nIn the weeks following the election , when they were surprised that their party had won unified control of the government and would have to enact health-care legislation , Republican congressional leaders came up with a strategy that attempted to take account of the first five conditions . That strategy came to be known as \u201c repeal and delay. \u201d Early in 2017 , Republicans would pass a bill under the reconciliation rules to repeal the tax and spending provisions of Obamacare but would provide that the repeal take full effect a few years from now . In the interim , they would pass legislation replacing Obamacare .\nIf Republicans stick together , they can execute the first part of this strategy without any Democratic votes and without reaching an agreement among themselves on a replacement . They could then tell conservatives that Obamacare is dead , or at least that it has been given a death sentence , and tell voters in general that a replacement is coming . Some Republicans even say that Democrats will work with them on the second bill ( replacement ) once the first one ( partial repeal ) has been enacted .\nMany Republicans are , however , uneasy about this strategy . Republicans who want a replacement that ensures that most of Obamacare \u2019 s beneficiaries have access to insurance fear that some of their Republican colleagues will call it a day once they have crippled Obamacare . They think Democrats will be more eager to blame them for taking away people \u2019 s coverage than to work with them on restoring it \u2014 and think that Democrats will be successful in blaming them , since they will in fact have passed a law taking it away .\nOne serious drawback of the strategy is that it does not account for the interrelatedness of Obamacare \u2019 s provisions ( our sixth fact above ) . The partial-repeal bill would abolish the fine for people who go without insurance , and might even do that effective immediately . But it would leave in place Obamacare \u2019 s protection for people with preexisting conditions , both because it is popular and because it is a regulation that they think can not be touched under reconciliation rules .\nObamacare \u2019 s exchanges have already been attracting a relatively sick segment of the population : Many healthy people are paying the fine instead of buying insurance . That \u2019 s why many insurers have been booking losses and leaving the exchanges . If the fines are abolished , even more healthy people will decide to forgo health insurance until they get sick . The result could be higher premiums , more insurers dropping out , and even fewer customers . Ending the subsidies for people buying insurance on the exchanges by a date certain , as the partial-repeal bill would do , would make insurers even more inclined to leave the exchanges .\nPeople buying individual health policies outside the exchanges could be affected , too . Their premiums might also increase as healthy people decide they don \u2019 t need health insurance .\nDemocrats will probably try to score political points by assailing the Republicans for having wrecked Obamacare without replacing it .\nIf partial repeal has these effects , Democrats will probably try to score political points by assailing the Republicans for having wrecked Obamacare without replacing it , and to demand that Republicans restore the law \u2019 s repealed components rather than work with them on a replacement . The plan could amount to repealing in haste and repenting at leisure .\nThe strategy could not be better designed to maximize disruption in health markets . Yet public hostility to such disruption is the central fact in the politics of health care . It is the main reason the Clintons \u2019 health-care plan crashed and burned in the 1990s : Remember those ads saying it threatened everything viewers valued in their health care ? It is the reason that Barack Obama spent $ 44 million savaging John McCain for threatening to tax employer-provided health insurance in 2008 . It is the reason that one of President Obama \u2019 s main talking points in selling Obamacare was that it would let people keep their plans if they liked them . It is the reason that the cancellation of many plans as a result of Obamacare \u2019 s regulations became the biggest political problem his administration faced on health care since the law passed . And it is the reason Speaker of the House Paul Ryan keeps saying that Republicans will see to it that we make a \u201c stable transition \u201d from Obamacare to a better system .\nA better Republican strategy would be designed around Ryan \u2019 s stated goal . It would begin with the understanding that Obamacare \u2019 s worst features are its overregulation of health insurance and its centralization of regulation in Washington , D.C . The way Obamacare regulates insurers \u2019 treatment of people with preexisting conditions , the benefits they have to offer , and the difference between what they can charge the young and the old have raised premiums and deductibles , resulted in insurance policies that are not attractive to the young and healthy , and so made the exchanges shaky at best in much of the country even with the help of the individual mandate .\nRepublicans already have a set of legislative ideas ( if not yet actual legislation ) that builds on that insight .

Those already covered by Obamacare \u2014 that is , who enrolled in the expanded version of Medicaid or bought exchange policies \u2014 would be able to stay covered .
