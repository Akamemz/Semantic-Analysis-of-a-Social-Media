    "content": "Over the weekend , a Danish man attacked a free speech event and a synagogue hosting a bat mitzvah in Copenhagen , killing two and wounding five before being shot by police . The parallels with the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris , which targeted cartoonists who had drawn Muhammed and later a kosher supermarket , are obvious and chilling .\nThese mass shooters are far from alone in targeting Jews . For the past two decades , anti-Semitic violence has been on the rise worldwide .

Its Kantor Center for the Study of Modern European Jewry annually tallies official reports of anti-Semitic violence , death threats , and vandalism , which it publishes in an annual report . Since 1989 , the earliest date covered by the Kantor Center data , there 's been a clear and consistent rise in anti-Semitic violence .\nMost of the violence was , unsurprisingly , recorded in places with high Jewish populations . A little over a fifth of the attacks the Kantor Center recorded in 2013 , the last year covered by the data , took place in France , which houses the world 's third-largest Jewish population after Israel and the United States .\nEurope also has large Muslim immigrant populations , many of whom are poor and socially isolated . This `` globalization of populations , '' according to Ohio State sociologist William Brustein , explains the recent upsurge in European anti-Semitic violence .\nAccording to Kantor , this is the reason behind the near-doubling in anti-Semitic activities spike in 2009 . Israel 's December 2008 incursion into Gaza infuriated Arab and Muslim populations , many of whom turned to anti-Semitic violence in anger . This led to `` unprecedented anti-Jewish activity worldwide , '' in the Kantor researchers ' words . We saw reports of a similar upswing in European anti-Semitism during the 2014 Gaza war , so when the Kantor Center data for last year is released , there will likely be another surge in anti-Semitic violence .\nSo it makes sense that the US , where Muslim and Jewish communities are on much better terms , is a clear exception to the general trend . The Anti-Defamation League , which maintains its own database of domestic anti-Semitic incidents , has found a clear decline in domestic anti-Semitism since a peak in 1994 .\nPut together , these two databases tell us several important things about the Paris and Copenhagen shootings .\nOne important factor explaining the difference in trends between the US and Europe is that anti-Semitism appears to grow on itself .

According to the Kantor Center , this triggered a 58 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in France over 2011 . `` It was the most violent year in France since 2004 , '' the Kantor researchers write , `` and its impact was felt in other countries as well , notably the UK . ''\nDanish security official Jens Madsen told reporters that they were investigating whether the Copenhagen attack was `` inspired by the events in Paris .
