Romney sounded sympathetic yet confident , while Obama all but ignored the news of our stagnant economy , and instead tried to spin the numbers as a positive development . Then again , this is Romney 's forte , he knows what to do . Obama ? Not so much - just more `` excuses '' as usual .\nSpeaking in New Hampshire this morning , Romney hammered the president \u2019 s same old ideas and policies that have failed to get America working again . He wasted no time in asserting that the jobs report is `` another kick in the gut to middle class families . \u201d\n`` Not only is the 8.2 percent number unacceptably high and that has been in place for over 41 months , but in addition if you look at the broader analysis of people who are out of work or dropped out of the workforce or that are underemployed in part-time jobs needing full time work , it 's almost 15 percent of the American public , '' Romney said , according to a rush transcript . `` Then there those that are working , but working in jobs well beneath their skill level or multiple part-time jobs . Kids that are coming out of college not being able to find work . Veterans coming home not being able to do anything but stand in an unemployment line . These are very difficult times for the American people . ''\n`` I know he \u2019 s been planning been planning on going across the country and celebrating what he calls \u201c forward , \u201d well forward doesn \u2019 t look a lot like forward to the millions and millions of families that are struggling today , '' he continued . Using the opportunity as a platform for his proposed policies , he assures the crowd he has a plan :\n`` My plan calls for action that will get America working again and create good jobs . Both near and long-term . It includes finally taking advantage of energy resources and creating energy jobs and convincing manufacturers that energy will be available and low cost in America . It means opening up new markets for American trade , particularly in Latin America where the opportunities are extraordinary and cracking down on china when they cheat and making sure they do n't steal our jobs and bringing tax rates down .
