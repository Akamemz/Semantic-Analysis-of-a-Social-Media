    "content": "Three recent surveys from highly rated polling firms ( Marist College , Field and Public Policy Institute of California ) show Bernie Sanders just 2 points behind Hillary Clinton in California . Clinton is ahead by double digits , however , in other polls , including one that has her up by 18 percentage points . It \u2019 s making for another confusing finish in a primary season that has already had plenty of them . And it \u2019 s an indication of how little we know about how Hispanic Democrats ( and Asian-American Democrats ) are voting this year .\nOur polls-only model , taking all the various polls into account , gives Clinton a 5 percentage point lead , and translates that into a 86 percent chance of her winning California . Even though Clinton has led in every poll , that seems overconfident given the generally mixed track record of the polls in the Democratic primaries this year , and I \u2019 d happily take Sanders at the 6-to-1 odds the model offers .\nBut unlike in Michigan or Indiana , the two previous states that Sanders won as an underdog in our polling model , the demographics in California aren \u2019 t necessarily out of step with polls showing a Clinton lead .\nAt various stages throughout the Democratic primaries , we \u2019 ve been issuing forecasts from a demographic model . The ingredients of the model have changed slightly over time as we \u2019 ve learned more about what determines the Democratic vote \u2014 that Sanders does better than Clinton in caucuses , for example , or that Clinton does better in primaries that are closed to independent voters .\nThese demographic models have always accounted for race , but there are a lot of different ways to do it . Here are five alternative strategies :\nI . Account for the percentage of white voters in a state ; group all nonwhite voters ( black , Hispanic , etc . ) together .\nII . Account for the percentage of black voters in a state ; group all nonblack voters ( white , Hispanic , etc . ) together .\nIII . Account for the percentage of white voters and the percentage of black voters ; group Hispanic , Asian and \u201c other \u201d voters together .\nIV . Account for the percentage of black voters and the percentage of Hispanic voters ; group white , Asian and \u201c other \u201d voters together .\nV. Account for the percentage of white voters , the percentage of black voters and the percentage of Hispanic voters ; group Asian and \u201c other \u201d voters together .\nI \u2019 ve seen all of these strategies applied by various people over the course of the campaign . We ourselves have not been totally consistent about it , starting out by using strategy I , and most commonly using strategy IV , with occasional forays into strategy III .\nMost of the time , it doesn \u2019 t make a lot of difference , but it does for California , and for some of the other states set to vote on June 7 . Model I is very favorable for Clinton , for example . It notes that Clinton usually does well in states with lots of nonwhite voters . Therefore it projects Clinton to get 60 percent of the two-way vote in California , a state with lots of nonwhite voters , meaning that she \u2019 d beat Sanders by about 20 percentage points .\nModel II has Clinton as a slight underdog in California , by contrast . It notes that the state has relatively few black voters ( more of those nonwhite voters are Hispanic or Asian ) , and that its primary is open to independent voters . To model II , California looks a lot like Indiana \u2014 another open primary state with few black voters \u2014 and it expects Clinton to lose California by 3 or 4 percentage points , similar to her margin of defeat in the Hoosier State .\nThese differences are even more profound in other states . Depending on which model you use , Clinton is either an underdog in New Mexico , which has few black voters but lots of Hispanics and Native Americans , or a 50-point favorite .\nPROJECTED CLINTON VOTE SHARE STATE MODEL I MODEL II MODEL III MODEL IV MODEL V California 60.1 % 48.4 % 50.5 % 54.9 % 54.2 % Montana 46.2 39.1 39.6 38.4 36.7 New Jersey 63.7 59.1 59.9 60.3 59.4 New Mexico 76.0 46.7 52.4 63.2 61.0 North Dakota 26.5 29.5 28.8 28.3 28.8 South Dakota 47.4 39.5 40.2 38.3 36.0 How you model race makes a lot of difference in your forecast All models control for whether the election is open or closed to independent voters , whether it \u2019 s a primary or a caucus , and national polls at the time of the election .\nThis serves as a neat illustration of how small choices in building a model make a lot of difference . I don \u2019 t mean to make it seem like an exercise in futility , however . Instead , I think there are pretty good reasons to use one of the models ( IV or V ) that account separately for the Hispanic vote . Those models would have Clinton winning California by 8 to 10 percentage points , consistent with her lead in the polling average or maybe just a pinch better than it .\nOne reason is that Clinton has a good track record this year in states with large Hispanic populations , having blown Sanders out in Florida , Arizona , Texas and New York , and edged him out in Nevada ( although she lost the Colorado caucuses ) . As you can see below , it \u2019 s hard to explain the vote in those states unless you have a variable to account for the Hispanic vote . ( For the sake of simplicity , I \u2019 ve limited the table to models II and IV . ) So it \u2019 s not just that the Hispanic vote is a statistically significant predictor of Clinton \u2019 s vote ; it \u2019 s also highly practically significant .\nCLINTON VOTE SHARE STATE MODEL II PROJECTION MODEL IV PROJECTION ACTUAL Nevada 42.7 % 47.7 % 52.7 % Colorado 39.6 43.3 40.6 Texas 56.4 66.4 66.3 Arizona 49.3 55.1 57.6 Florida 63.1 64.9 65.9 New York 56.2 57.2 58.0 Accounting for states \u2019 Hispanic populations produces more accurate results\nAnother reason is that , in those states , Clinton has done well in heavily Hispanic areas .
