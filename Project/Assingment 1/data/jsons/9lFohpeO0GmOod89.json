    "content": "Before rushing to defend or excoriate Trump \u2019 s actions , we should all know the facts .\nRarely has it been more important to consider all sides of a debate than in the last four days , as anger has raged over Trump \u2019 s executive order on refugees . Our atomized political discourse has led to parallel reactions of euphoria and fury that are far out of proportion to the contents of the order itself . Myths abound , and if you believe any of these myths you \u2019 re simply losing the truth and slipping into an alternate political reality . Here , in no particular order , are five of the most dangerous .\nMyth One : The executive order will \u201c Make America Safe Again. \u201d Truth be told , it \u2019 s barely even a start . Cut through the sound and fury , and we \u2019 re talking about an order that caps refugees at numbers slightly above Bush administration levels and only slightly below the levels of Obama \u2019 s first seven years in office . It bans entry from just seven countries that are either actively jihadist or torn by jihadist violence for only 90 days .\nThis is not a significant immigration reform . Indeed , it \u2019 s not even a true ban : The AP reports that the Trump administration is admitting 872 refugees because of hardship concerns . A pause is important and wise , but the next moves will be far more important . What happens after the pause ? What will new security measures look like ?\nFurthermore , immigration policy is but one part of a much larger overall problem . What can we do about radicalization of communities and individuals already here ? What can be done to introduce a degree of stability back into the Middle East to prevent future refugee crises and ameliorate the existing disaster ? The executive order was the tip of an iceberg \u2019 s worth of decisions and policy changes .\nMyth Two : The executive order will make America more dangerous . Every single time a Republican makes a move to escalate the war against jihadists , you can count on multiple Democrats to claim that move has handed terrorists a \u201c recruiting tool. \u201d At this point , after decades of unrelenting terrorist violence through seven successive American administrations , why are we still having this debate ? Have jihadists really struggled with recruitment through the Carter , Reagan , Bush , Clinton , Bush , Obama , and now Trump administrations ?\nIn 1979 , jihadists helped touch off the Iranian revolution . In the 1980s , they blew up an American barracks , kidnapped Americans , blew up night clubs , and downed an airliner . In the 1990s we fought the Battle of Mogadishu , al-Qaeda gained strength , and Bill Clinton \u2019 s efforts toward Middle East peace were rewarded with the second Intifada , embassy bombings , and the near-sinking of the USS Cole . All that \u2019 s happened in the years since , from 9/11 onward , speaks for itself .\nThere is an ocean of jihadist hate for Israel , the United States , and our Western allies . Does anyone think that ISIS is capable of hating us more ? Of trying harder to kill Americans ? These are people motivated to fight a thousand-year war , not to detonate themselves in protest of American executive orders . It \u2019 s shocking that some Americans still can \u2019 t understand that sobering truth .\nMyth Three : The goal of American foreign policy is to \u201c help people. \u201d It \u2019 s interesting to see the level of unthinking sentimentality online . Pictures of crying parents and bloody kids circulate across the web , and the argument that the policy \u201c hurts people \u201d is treated as ironclad evidence that it \u2019 s wrong .\nBut even liberals who think hard about this construct understand that it breaks down on closer examination . The goal of American foreign policy is to protect the national interests of the United States . Make no mistake , it \u2019 s in our national interest to seek and achieve a degree of international stability built around the rule of law and respect for individual liberty , but that doesn \u2019 t mean that America \u2019 s foreign policy can be reduced to \u201c helping people . \u201d\nThe goal of American foreign policy is to protect the national interests of the United States .\nIndeed , if America \u2019 s foreign policy is merely to \u201c help people , \u201d then few presidents have failed to execute it as spectacularly as Clinton and Obama . The Rwanda genocide happened on Clinton \u2019 s watch . The Syrian and Iraqi genocides happened on Obama \u2019 s watch . In both cases , there were concrete actions America could have taken to fulfill the world \u2019 s alleged pledge of \u201c never again. \u201d In both cases , Democratic administrations largely stood aside while men , women , and children died by the hundreds of thousands .\nWhen the Obama administration finally did move , it did so with half-measures that have prolonged suffering in jihadist-dominated regions . The counter-offensive against ISIS has been agonizingly slow . The number of refugees that the \u201c compassionate \u201d Obama administration decided to admit into the United States was never more than a trickle , a mere drop in an ocean of suffering .\nMost of those pictures of crying women and bloody children were taken during the Obama administration , and you can \u2019 t fault Trump for \u201c reversing \u201d an open-arms refugee policy that was never Obama \u2019 s to begin with .\nMyth Four : Terrorism is our only concern when evaluating prospective immigrants from the Middle East . This is perhaps one of the most consequential misunderstandings in the entire debate .
