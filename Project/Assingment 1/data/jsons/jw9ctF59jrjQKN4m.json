Based on that information, police were dispatched to two homes on Tuesday night to check for packages.\n\nThe bomber is understood to have used 'exotic' and foreign batteries ordered online from Asia to make the bombs, NBC reports. Law enforcement said the signature trait is what helped them quickly link all the bombings together.\n\nIt is not known if the suspect was planning to deliver a seventh device when police stopped him. Chief Manley said it is not clear why he tried to leave the parking lot of the hotel.\n\nChief Manley has warned residents not to let their guard down yet, saying there was a possibility that more bombs had yet to be found.\n\n'We don't know where this suspect has spent his last 24 hours and therefore we still need to remain vigilant to ensure that no other packages or devices have been left to the community,' Manley said.\n\nThe I-35 was closed off in both directions following the explosion and officers are set to remain on scene until their investigation has been completed.\n\nAustin PD homicide detective David Fugitt said the Conditt family was cooperating 'above and beyond' what police could expect. He said a ballistics sniffing dog had been brought to the family home on a quiet cul-de-sac later on Wednesday but stressed that was just a precaution.\n\n'They are having a difficult time,' Fugitt said. 'It's a shock to their conscience as well.'\n\nHe said police have no information that Conditt's family had any knowledge of Mark's bombing campaign.\n\n'They want to express their condolences to the families affected by this.'\n\nHe said the family will issue a formal statement later Wednesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who was earlier criticized for failing to speak out over the shootings, tweeted 'Austin bombing suspect is dead' on Wednesday morning. 'Great job by law enforcement and all concerned,' he added.\n\nPolice say they tracked the bomber to the Round Rock area using CCTV (pictured above), store receipts and cell phone data\n\nConditt was captured on CCTV cameras sending two packages at a FedEx office on Sunday. He was dressed in disguise and was wearing latex protective gloves at the time\n\nThe packages he sent from Austin were addressed to two places in the city. One exploded at a FedEx facility and the other was found before it could detonate\n\nPresident Trump, who was earlier criticized for his silence around the attacks, tweeted on Wednesday morning. Republican Ted Cruz also thanked police for their efforts\n\nThe series of bombings killed two people and injured at least five others, unnerving residents of Austin, a city of some 1 million people.\n\nThe first incident occurred on March 2 when a package bomb exploded at a northeast Austin home, killing a 39-year-old Anthony Stephan House.\n\nTwo more package bombs then exploded further south on March 12. Draylen Mason, 17, was killed and his mother was wounded after they opened a package in their kitchen.\n\nA 75-year-old Hispanic woman named by family as Esperanza Herrera was severely injured when a package bomb exploded at her home a few hours later.\n\nOn Sunday, two white men aged in their 20s were badly injured when they triggered a 'near-invisible' tripwire linked to another explosive device.\n\nA female employee was wounded at a FedEx facility in San Antonio just after midnight on Tuesday when a package exploded while moving between conveyor belts. The package had been posted from a FedEx office in the Austin area and was addressed to a home in Austin.\n\nHours later, a bomb was discovered at another FedEx facility near Austin airport but was found before it detonated. The package was posted from the same address in Austin as the one that exploded earlier in the day.\n\nThe first three devices were parcel bombs dropped off in front of homes around Austin neighborhoods.\n\nThe series of bombings bewildered law enforcement officials, who by Sunday began taking the unusual step of publicly calling on the bomber to get in touch and explain why he was carrying out the attacks.\n\nAuthorities had initially believed the bombings may be hate crimes because the first two victims were black, but they backed off that theory after Hispanic and white victims from different parts of the city were also affected.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had earlier been criticized for his silence over the bombing spree given most of the victims were from the city's historically black and Latino neighborhoods.\n\nUnlike other attacks, such as the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida, which Trump was quick to label an act of terrorism, the president initially remained silent about the Austin bombs.\n\nPrevious victims: Anthony Stephan House, 39, (left) died on March 2 and Draylen Mason, 17, (right) died on March 12 when package bombs were left at their respective homes\n\nA second package was later intercepted and was confirmed to contain another bomb (pictured, FBI agents at the facility where a package exploded)\n\nTwo men were injured on Sunday after triggering a tripwire bomb, the fourth such explosion in the city in two weeks",
