Far from a conservative Clark Kent , Walker is visibly straining in the closing days of his race against Mary Burke , a wealthy former Trek Bicycle executive and member of the Madison School Board .\nIf Walker survives once more on Tuesday , it will represent another win for the divide-and-conquer strategy he has used since 2010 to become the dominant political figure in this traditionally Democratic state . It will also mark a downward revision of Walker \u2019 s own aspirations : Instead of realigning Wisconsin behind a new vision for conservative reform \u2014 and perhaps vaulting himself into the White House in the process \u2014 Walker is struggling to assemble a bare majority that will keep him in the job he has .\nAt campaign stops this week , the 46-year-old Walker shouted himself hoarse defending his record on job creation , an unexpectedly contentious point in his record .
