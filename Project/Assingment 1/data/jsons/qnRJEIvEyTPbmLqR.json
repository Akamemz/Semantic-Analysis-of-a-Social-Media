    "content": "Democrats will complain , but the attorney general can \u2019 t be faulted for following the law .\nIn disclosing the Mueller report , Attorney General William P. Barr will have to redact grand-jury information . That is the upshot of the ruling today by a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit .\nI flagged this case , now called McKeever v. Barr ( formerly McKeever v. Sessions ) , last week . It did not arise out of the Mueller investigation , but it obviously has significant ramifications for the Mueller report \u2014 in particular , how much of it we will get to see .\nAt issue was this question : Does a federal court have the authority to order disclosure of grand-jury materials if the judge decides that the interests of justice warrant doing so ; or is the judge limited to the exceptions to grand-jury secrecy that are spelled out in Rule 6 ( e ) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ? The D.C. Circuit \u2019 s McKeever ruling holds that the text of Rule 6 ( e ) controls . Consequently , judges have no authority to authorize disclosure outside the rule .\nThis is significant for the Mueller report because Rule 6 ( e ) does not contain an exception to secrecy that would permit disclosure to Congress .\nThe case involves a writer , Stuart McKeever , who was researching a book on the disappearance of Columbia University professor Jes\u00fas de Gal\u00edndez Su\u00e1rez in 1956 . It was suspected that Gal\u00edndez , a very public critic of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo , was kidnapped and flown to the D.R. , where he was murdered . In the course of a federal investigation , suspicion fell on John Joseph Frank , a former FBI agent and CIA lawyer , who later worked for Trujillo . Frank was eventually prosecuted for failing to register as a foreign agent but never charged with any involvement in Gal\u00edndez \u2019 s murder .\nIn 2013 , for purposes of his research , McKeever petitioned the court for release of records of the grand-jury proceedings that led to Frank \u2019 s 1957 indictment . There is nothing in Rule 6 ( e ) that would permit the veil of grand-jury secrecy to be pierced for an academic or literary research project . Yet the district judge asserted that federal courts have \u201c inherent supervisory power \u201d to disclose grand-jury materials , including those that are \u201c historically significant. \u201d Ultimately , however , the judge denied the petition , reasoning that it was \u201c overbroad . \u201d\nMcKeever appealed . In opposition , the Justice Department argued not only that he should be denied the grand-jury records , but also that the lower court had been wrong to claim authority to disclose the materials outside the strictures of Rule 6 ( e ) . The three-judge panel agreed with the Justice Department , in an opinion written by Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg ( now a senior judge , appointed by President Reagan ) and joined by Judge Gregory Katsas ( appointed by President Trump ) . Judge Sri Srinivasan ( appointed by President Obama ) dissented .\nThe majority explained that the Supreme Court has long recognized the vital purposes served by grand-jury secrecy , and thus that secrecy must be protected unless there is some clear contrary indication in a statute or rule . Disclosure is the exception , not the rule .\nIn Rule 6 ( e ) , Congress has prescribed grand-jury secrecy and its exceptions . Those who contend that a court may permit disclosure outside the rule argue that judges had such authority before the rule was enacted . The panel majority , however , emphasized the rule \u2019 s sweeping language : Officials must refrain from disclosure \u201c unless these rules provide otherwise. \u201d The rule also takes pains to spell out the situations in which a judge may authorize disclosure .
