Election law is set by partisan state lawmakers and administered , in most places , by secretaries of state , who are partisan officials .\nIn several Republican-leaning states , the difficulties voters face start with the documents they are required to produce in order to exercise their democratic right . Legislators across the country have tightened the requirements for acceptable forms of identification \u2013 this in a country where 7 % of Americans do not have photo IDs , and the number is higher among black and Hispanic populations .\nIt \u2019 s no surprise that the US trails behind other democracies in voter turnout\u2013about 55 % of eligible Americans voted in the 2016 election\nIn 2016 , Wisconsin reinstated strict voter ID laws , ostensibly to fight voter fraud , which experts have repeatedly found to be almost non-existent .\nFor this reason , in the run-up to the presidential election , a woman named Anita Johnson traversed three counties in the south-east of the state . She was part of an entire industry of activists trying to get people to the polls .\nWhen Johnson , who is an attorney and works with the not-for-profit VoteRiders , made her way through the majority black communities in towns such as Racine and Kenosha , she battled rumors and confusion about what forms of ID people needed to vote . She accompanied them to various government offices to get a driver \u2019 s license or helped them find the old address records that they needed to register . It became clear to her that Wisconsin \u2019 s policies were discouraging would-be voters .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve done this all year since the 2018 election \u2013 the thing is to not stop , \u201d she said . \u201c There is going to be a lot of confusion during the 2020 election because not everyone pays attention to democracy like I do . \u201d\nAnd not everyone in the state had an activist like Johnson to help them . When Donald Trump eventually won Wisconsin with a 22,000-vote lead , political analysts found that in the city of Milwaukee alone there was a 3 % lower turnout , or 41,000 fewer votes cast , than four years before .\n\u201c The most serious curtailment to voting rights and turnout in Wisconsin is due to the extreme and restrictive photo voter ID law , \u201d said Jay Heck , director of Common Cause , a non-partisan government accountability group in the state .\nThe same year , 600,000 people in Texas were estimated to lack the IDs needed to vote under the state \u2019 s strict guidelines . Virginia put new restrictions on organizations and not-for-profits that were registering people to vote through drives and campaigns . This year , Tennessee sought to make such groups subject to criminal penalties if they make mistakes .\nFor many Americans , even finding a voting booth presents a formidable challenge . A report released a few months ago by the the Leadership Conference Education Fund , a civil rights organization , revealed that 1,688 polling places have been shut since 2012 . These closures have taken place in states with histories of racial discrimination in elections , including 214 precinct closures in Georgia .\nAs Sean Young , legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia , told the Atlanta Journal Constitution , \u201c our elections officials are supposed to defend and protect our democracy . Instead , many have been aggressively pushing poll closures in communities of color with phony pretexts . \u201d\nTen per cent of Georgia \u2019 s counties were left with a single precinct for all voters , with some having to travel miles to cast their votes . Outranking Georgia , Texas had 760 poll closures and Arizona had 320 .\nThese poll closures are a direct result of the changes to the Voting Rights Act in 2013 \u2013 previously Georgia was one of nine states that had to get pre-clearance before they shuttered polling stations or made changes to electoral law . That is no longer the case .\nAnd if stricter voter ID laws and the closure of polling booths aren \u2019 t sufficient deterrents , there are yet more ways to discourage and suppress the vote . Another method is called a \u201c voter purge \u201d - and it is precisely what happened to Christine Jordan , King \u2019 s cousin .\nJordan thought she was registered to vote when she went to the polls . She hadn \u2019 t changed her residence or her name . Yet she had still been wiped from the rolls , like 17 million other people in the US between 2016 and 2018 , according to the Brennan Center .\n\u201c Voter purging \u201d is when officials scrub names from the voter rolls ostensibly to ensure people don \u2019 t vote twice and that people who have died or moved get removed from the rolls . These are perfectly legitimate justifications .\nYet it tends to be on the rise , the Brennan Center reported , in areas and states that previously would have been prevented from making such changes by the Voting Rights Act . Places , that is , with a history of voting discrimination .\nAnd as the Brennan Center reports , \u201c Problems arise when states remove voters who are still eligible to vote . States rely on faulty data that purport to show that a voter has moved to another state .\n\u201c Oftentimes , these data get people mixed up . In big states like California and Texas , multiple individuals can have the same name and date of birth , making it hard to be sure that the right voter is being purged when perfect data are unavailable .\nOne infamous system , the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck System , has been used by dozens of states since it was introduced in 2005 to search for people who are registered in more than one jurisdiction . A 2017 study found that Crosscheck is 99 % more likely to purge legitimate rather than inadmissible voters .\nThe authors of the study stated , \u201c We find that one of Crosscheck \u2019 s proposed purging strategies would eliminate about 300 registrations used to cast a seemingly legitimate vote for every one registration used to cast a double vote . \u201d\nWeigh up the combined impacts of strict ID laws , poll closures and voter purges and you are still nowhere close to estimating the number of people who are actively deterred from voting in the US . Another approximately 4.7 million Americans are prevented from voting at all . This is the number of convicted felons who have no right to vote , including those incarcerated for grave crimes such as homicide and rape but also encompassing charges including burglary and repeated driving under the influence .\nForty-eight states have some form of felon disenfranchisement , but three states \u2013 Iowa , Kentucky and Virginia \u2013 disenfranchise people for life . The impacts are disproportionate : one in 13 African Americans have lost their right to vote as a result , compared with one in 56 non-black voters , according to the Sentencing Project .\nJevon Gerrard Stevens , a 42-year-old water treatment plant operator for Miami-Dade county water and sewer department in Florida , was convicted of third-degree grand theft auto in 1998 , which resulted in his jailing for three months . He hasn \u2019 t been able to vote for 21 years .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a way for those that are in power to control the less fortunate , and once you become a convicted felon you fall right into that category , \u201d he said .\nThere are signs , however , of a nationwide change in sentiment . Until recently , Florida had one of the strictest felon disenfranchisement rules in the country . Then , in late 2018 , a majority of Floridians voted to return the franchise to felons after they leave prison \u2013 to Stevens \u2019 delight .\nThe move , which has been contested by Republicans , has the potential to restore the vote to 1.4 million people in the state , a not insignificant number considering that the margin between Trump and Hillary Clinton in the last presidential election in Florida was just 1.2 points .\nThere are numerous other ways politicians and operatives have worked to dilute the power of Americans \u2019 votes .\nMany states allow gerrymandering , or the drawing of electoral district lines to favor one party by packing voters from another party into as few districts as possible , leaving them with fewer seats after election day . In a remarkable move in July , the supreme court decided not to offer a ruling , in a 5-4 majority decision , on partisan gerrymandering . It was saying , in effect , that it would not find partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional .\nIn an excoriating dissent , Elena Kagan and the court \u2019 s liberal justices accused the court \u2019 s majority of shirking its duty .\n\u201c The partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights : the rights to participate equally in the political process , to join with others to advance political beliefs , and to choose their political representatives . \u201d\nIt is for all the issues cited here that \u2588\u2588\u2588 has pledged to put the issue of voting rights at the heart of our 2020 coverage .
