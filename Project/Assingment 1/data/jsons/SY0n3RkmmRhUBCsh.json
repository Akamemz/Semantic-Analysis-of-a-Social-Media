Such is , when you can \u2019 t make a rational argument for or against something , make a racist or sexist one .

This past 4th of July celebration , a celebration of our national unity , saw Colin Kaepernick , the one-time NFL quarterback continue his assault on all things American that cost him his once truly mediocre career . After the public reaction to his hatred of this country ( along with his QB rating and overdeveloped sense of self-worth ) cost him his ability to publicly kneel for the anthem , Kaepernick determined the planned Nike \u201c Betsy Ross Flag \u201d shoe was just too racist to stand , or kneel , for . Yes , Betsy Ross , abolitionist , Quaker , and alleged designer of the flag , apparently , was a racist .
