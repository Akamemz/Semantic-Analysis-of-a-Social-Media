But that 's lately started to change \u2014 for better or worse .\nCoverage of global warming on the broadcast networks ( ABC , CBS , NBC , and Fox ) has been steadily increasing over the last five years , according to a recent tally from Media Matters :\nIn 2014 , the networks devoted 154 minutes to the subject . That 's more than the year prior , though it 's still well below 2009 levels . The leaders were CBS and NBC , with 56 and 47 minutes respectively . Fox had the least coverage , with 19 minutes \u2014 largely because it does n't have a nightly news program .\nAbout 22 million people in America still watch the evening news on ABC , NBC , or CBS , so this is a fairly big media source , though obviously the networks do n't have anywhere near the vast reach they once did .\nSo what 's behind the recent uptick ? A separate recent survey from The Daily Climate , looking at a similar increase in newspaper coverage , suggested it was mostly event-driven . President Obama has been talking about climate change more in recent years \u2014 which in turn drives headlines and news coverage .\nThere were also a lot of huge climate-related stories in 2014 : new EPA regulations on coal , the US-China deal on greenhouse-gas emissions , the UN climate talks at Lima . Coverage of fracking has also been expanding \u2014 and fracking has lots of climate implications :\nThere were similar news coverage upticks in 2006-'07 when Al Gore was speaking out about climate change a lot . And there was another spike in 2009 , when Congress was considering a big cap-and-trade bill and there were major UN talks at Copenhagen . High-profile politicians and events are always good for driving coverage .\nGranted , as the Media Matters report points out , not all network TV coverage is great coverage . Oftentimes a fair bit of nonsense can appear on the Sunday talk shows :\nOn its February 16 show , Fox News Sunday hosted a panel discussion comprised of frequent climate misinformer George Will and others dismissing the scientific consensus on climate change . During the segment , Will said that he does n't `` buy '' the president 's focus on global warming because `` the climate is always changing , '' and Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel argued that the term `` global warming '' became `` climate change '' because `` you could n't prove that there was much global warming anymore ... as the temperature did n't change .
