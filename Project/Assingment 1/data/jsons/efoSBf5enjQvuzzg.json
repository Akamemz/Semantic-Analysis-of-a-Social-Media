    "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden won what looks to be at least a narrow delegate victory in yesterday 's Super Tuesday contests , which will award a third of all delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July . While the campaign is far from over , Sen. Bernie Sanders ' ( I-Vt. ) march to the nomination that looked so likely just a week ago is a long-gone dream for the progressive left . As he and his campaign look upon the wreckage of what could have been a casual romp en route to Milwaukee , they absolutely must correct course and start the difficult process of appealing to mainstream Democrats if they want to have any hope of winning .\nLet 's start with the toplines : It was a bloodbath for Sanders and a bonanza for Biden . States where Sanders had the inside track just days ago , particularly Maine , Minnesota , Texas , and Massachusetts , went for Biden , who also won Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Arkansas , Oklahoma , and Alabama . His margin in Virginia alone provided him with enough ballast to survive Sanders ' numbers out West . Sanders got obliterated so badly in Alabama that he likely will get close to zero delegates , just a worst case scenario performance . Overall , Biden won 10 of the 14 states that voted yesterday , and while we of course do not know what the precise delegate totals will be , he has opened up a lead on Sanders that wo n't be easy to overcome .\nAnd Sanders was boxed in , scoring victories only in Vermont , Colorado , Utah , and California . The Golden State win was important , because it kept him within hailing distance of Biden , but it was n't nearly as huge as it looked like it might have been recently . If there 's any silver lining for Sanders , it 's that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren reached viability in multiple states , holding Biden 's margins down a bit and making it dramatically more likely that no one will reach a pledged delegate majority before the convention . But as the dust settles this morning , Biden has the inside track on at least a strong delegate plurality , which would make a Sanders nomination virtually unthinkable .\nThe tectonic shift in this race that took place over the last 7 days is unprecedented . On the night of the last Democratic debate before South Carolina voted , Sanders had a comfortable national lead as well as clear advantages in delegate sinks California and Texas . But Biden delivered a forceful performance in that debate , blew out Sanders in South Carolina , and then staged the impressive feat of convincing rivals Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar to drop out and endorse him in the two days before Super Tuesday . While neither had much of a chance to win , collectively they controlled about 10 percent of the national electorate . That 's not nothing , and it looks to have contributed to a massive movement toward Biden among late-breaking voters in the Super Tuesday electorate .\nWhat went wrong for Bernie ? Let 's start with his self-destructive 60 Minutes interview on February 24th . If there 's one thing that terrifies Democratic elites more than anything itself , it 's Bernie 's long history of sympathizing with left-wing authoritarians in places like Cuba and Nicaragua . So when he went on national television and praised Fidel Castro 's literacy program from the 1960s , you could literally hear the faces of party strategists smacking into desks all across the country . There 's an easy way for Sanders to handle this kind of question : `` I was wrong to say anything positive about Fidel Castro , who was a brutal tyrant . But American foreign policy in these countries was still catastrophic and we should never side with dictators no matter what side of the political spectrum they happen to fall on . ''\nNot for this guy . He ca n't do it . He ca n't walk back a mistake . And it 's terrifying .\nI hope this is obvious by now but there is zero conceivable political benefit to soft-pedaling your criticism of Fidel . Pro-Castro voters in America are like less than 1 percent of the electorate . As Andrew Yang might say : MATH . Someone in a position of authority in the campaign needs to pull Sanders aside and just give him a script about the 1970s and 1980s and tell him never to deviate from it . Memorize it , carve it in block letters on his arm , and read it out robotically whenever anyone asks about Cuba or the Sandinistas . Wash , rinse , shout , repeat .\nSanders also has a real and growing problem building out his coalition . While Biden was rolling up the support of the other Democratic contenders , what was Sanders doing ? Did anyone reach out to Warren to see if she might drop out and endorse him ? Think of it this way : At one point there were more than 20 Democrats running for president . Most of them have hit the eject button and parachuted back to safety , and the only two who endorsed Sanders were the eccentric lifestyle guru Marianne Williamson and New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio , who was so unpopular that his candidacy was rejected immediately by the electorate like he was the wrong blood type for a transfusion .\nWas Bernie ever going to be an easy sell to most of these people ? No . But someone like Sen. Cory Booker ( D-N.J. ) , who sports one of the most progressive voting records of anyone in the U.S. Senate , was probably gettable . So was Sen. Kamala Harris ( D-Calif. ) , whose Senate record is eerily similar to Bernie 's . The fact that they both sat quietly on their hands while the only progressive remaining in the race with a plausible path to victory was surging in the polls should tell you something about the Sanders campaign 's outreach operation . If they do n't have someone on board who can do this kind of thing , they need to get on it . Yesterday .\nBernie 's troubles securing the backing of other Democrats are too broad to blame on any one particular factor . I noted in September that some personnel calls , including the decision to place strategic communications in the hands of Twitter personality David Sirota , seemed almost designed to shrink the Sanders coalition on purpose . Sure , people like Booker know who this is . You can bet that someone who works for Jim Clyburn does . Journalists who set campaign narratives do . But do normal people care about or even know who he is ? No , of course not . It 's a zero upside play with massive downside , in the same way that trotting Bull Durham star and 2016 Jill Stein voter Susan Sarandon out at campaign events is just mind-bogglingly self-destructive .\nEveryone in the Sanders orbit was perfectly justified by pushing back hard on the insane McGovern hysteria that has gripped party elites since Iowa . To reiterate : The electability case for Sanders is almost indistinguishable from the one for Biden . But Sanders would have been well advised to do something , anything , to placate nervous Democrats , particularly older black voters who are n't inclined to gamble another four years of Trump on a Sanders nomination .

With Warren almost certainly on the way out , and with Bloomberg reassessing his chances , it could be a two-person scrum as early as the end of this week .
