    "content": "President Obama \u2019 s Labor Day announcement of an executive order requiring paid sick leave for federal contractors is the latest step in a broader second term push to expand worker protections .\nSpeaking at a Greater Boston Labor Council breakfast , Mr. Obama said the new regulation would offer roughly 300,000 people working on federal contracts the ability to earn up to seven days of paid sick leave each year . Federal law already requires employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave . But the White House says some 44 million workers \u2013 or 40 percent of the total private-sector work force \u2013 do not have access to paid leave .\nWorkers could use the paid time off under the Obama administration proposal to care for themselves or a family member or to deal with absences resulting from domestic violence or sexual assault . The provision would take effect in 2017 , after Obama leaves office .\nAt the union rally , the president also announced that the Labor Department this week will publish a final rule prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees and job applicants who want to discuss how much money they make . The goal is to provide `` a critical tool to encourage pay transparency and make it easier for workers to recognize pay discrimination and seek appropriate remedies , '' according to a White House fact sheet .\nThe rule could be of special help to women who , on average , make 78 percent of what men make .\nThe president signaled his intention to take action to fight income inequality and declining economic mobility in a December 2011 speech in Osawatomie , Kan .
