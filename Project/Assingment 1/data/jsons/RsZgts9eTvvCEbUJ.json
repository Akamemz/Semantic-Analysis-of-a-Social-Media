This despite a unanimous promise by every Republican since 2010 to do precisely that .\nNo political party has been so futile in its efforts at fulfilling a fundamental campaign promise over so long a time as the GOP has been with Obamacare , and that futility has come to a head this year when multiple efforts at a repeal failed \u2014 none of them perfect , to be sure , but each of the bills would have provided some relief to the millions of Americans saddled with an unconstitutional obligation to buy something they don \u2019 t want at an exorbitant , above-market price . That the Republican Party and its Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were unable to marshal 50 of its 52 Senators behind even so much as a partial fulfillment of that promise is a disgusting shame .\nOne of the holdouts , at least in the Graham-Cassidy bill which represented the last legislative attempt to get rid of Obamacare , was Kentucky \u2019 s Rand Paul . Paul , who had backed other potential remedies , albeit reluctantly , can be said to have made the perfect the enemy of the good with Graham-Cassidy . But Paul \u2019 s demand for a long time has been a federal embrace of what are known as association health plans \u2014 and on Thursday President Donald Trump found a way to turn Paul \u2019 s demand into policy .\nThe executive order which changed an interpretation of federal law to sweep away regulatory impediments to association health plans Thursday is a big deal , and it might represent the largest policy victory the junior senator from the Bluegrass State has had since entering the Senate in 2011 . As he noted in a Breitbart op-ed published Thursday , the change Thursday \u2019 s announcement represents is a potential game-changer for people currently trapped in the individual market so warped by the Obamacare exchanges :\nHow will it work ? Well , nationwide associations like the National Restaurant Association will be allowed to form groups across state lines and , with the leverage of size , demand Big Insurance bring down their outrageous premiums . Many of the 28 million people left behind by Obamacare who still don \u2019 t have insurance work low-wage jobs in our fast food restaurants . The President \u2019 s decision today will allow workers from two million restaurants to come together to form a buying group and through sheer size get cheaper and better insurance . Millions of people will be eligible for the same group insurance that big corporations offer . In fact , Health Associations may grow to be larger than the largest of our corporations . Currently , about half of private insurance is cross-state , self-insured ERISA plans , and most employees love them . The President \u2019 s action today will allow the millions of people in the individual market an escape route to group insurance . Association Health Plans will be among the biggest free-market reforms of health care in a generation , and it will do more to counter the impact of Obamacare than most of the repeal bills did , because it will actually go after regulations that the legislation didn \u2019 t touch due to Senate rules . Existing law allows the President to legalize these new groups and plans . Where previous administrations have been weak , President Trump is bold to allow this reform . All group insurance guarantees access regardless of pre-existing conditions . But what is great about cross-state Health Associations is that they will be exempt from some Obamacare and State regulations . This exemption from regulations is why cross-state group insurance has seen the lowest rise in premiums of any health insurance available .\nWhat \u2019 s not yet known is whether Trump \u2019 s new order is limited to employer-based insurance , essentially meaning small business people banding together to cover their employees , or whether it might extend to other kinds of associations . Perhaps one day we can go back to the pre-FDR days when voluntary organizations offered some sort of health plan as part of their membership \u2014 meaning health insurance would be truly portable and not a factor tying people to jobs or localities they no longer desire .\nBut this is certainly a start . And for those Never Trump conservatives ( your author was guilty for a time in dabbling with such sentiments ) , that it was the populist-nationalist president acting to make reality a key piece of conservative policy that the GOP establishment couldn \u2019 t muster its own Senate membership for has to be something of a wakeup call . Trump \u2019 s move Thursday is as much a repudiation of what passes for Beltway conservatism as it is a victory for conservative policy , and perhaps it \u2019 s time for the Capitol creatures to get the message and work with him on things like tax reform they also purport to be for .\nThat said , McConnell does deserve a modicum of credit for a move he finally made this week to eliminate the silly \u201c blue slip \u201d power which gave individual Senators more or less a pocket veto over judicial appointments in their states . Blue slips have been used , particularly this year , by Democrats to hold up federal judgeships for Trump appointees indefinitely , and after months of obsequious tolerance by McConnell to the whims of his Democrat counterpart Chuck Schumer and the rest of the minority party , he finally became irritated enough to make them go away .\nThe media played up an \u201c objection \u201d by Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley to the move , as Grassley said through a spokesperson that he \u2019 d retain control over the blue slip process . But Grassley \u2019 s office said he \u2019 d address \u201c abuses \u201d of blue slips on a case-by-case basis , which is a telltale sign that willy-nilly delays of conservative judges because they might come from states with one or more Democrat senator are over .\nAnd that \u2019 s good news .
