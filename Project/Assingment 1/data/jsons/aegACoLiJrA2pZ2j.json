Will she give details about the nondisclosure agreement?\n\nDaniels has never spoken publicly about the nondisclosure agreement that purportedly bars her from speaking about her alleged affair with Trump.\n\nBut a lawsuit filed by Daniels earlier this month confirmed the existence of such a document, arguing that it is invalid because it was never co-signed by Trump himself.\n\nWhether Daniels will discuss the details of the agreement in the \"60 Minutes\" interview remains to be seen. Her lawsuit seeking to void the contract is still pending, and NDAs often prohibit signatories from speaking about the agreements.\n\nDaniels has hinted that is true of her NDA. During an interview with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel in January, Kimmel pointed out that Daniels would likely be barred from discussing the agreement if it, in fact, existed.\n\n\"You're so smart, Jimmy,\" was her cagey response.\n\n2. Will she talk openly about the alleged affair?\n\nDaniels has implied she was paid $130,000 by Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen weeks before the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about the alleged affair.\n\nSpeaking openly about her claims would certainly violate the terms of the disputed NDA, and could subject Daniels to legal penalties.\n\nIn court papers filed earlier this month, Trump's lawyers said that Daniels could face up to $20 million in damages for violating the terms of the agreement.\n\nOne question that remains is whether Daniels could toss out the NDA completely in her \"60 Minutes\" interview, and provide details about her alleged relationship with the president. The last time she spoke about it was 2011, when she gave an interview to In Touch magazine that wasn't published until this year.\n\n3. Will she mention possible video or photographic evidence?\n\nAvenatti has repeatedly hinted that video or photographic evidence of Daniels's alleged affair with Trump exists.\n\nThe March 6 lawsuit filed by Daniels to void the nondisclosure agreement with Trump refers to \"certain still images and/or text messages which were authored by or relate to\" the president. While the NDA reportedly required her to turn over such material and get rid of her own copies, Avenatti has suggested that Daniels may have retained it.\n\nAvenatti hinted this week that he may be in possession of such material, tweeting a cryptic photo of a compact disc inside of what appeared to be a safe.\n\n\"If 'a picture is worth a thousand words,' how many words is this worth?????\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\n4. Will she address whether she was physically threatened?\n\nAvenatti prompted questions earlier this month when he said that Daniels had been threatened with physical harm in connection with the alleged affair with Trump.\n\nAsked on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" whether Daniels had been physically threatened, Avenatti bluntly replied, \"yes.\"\n\nExactly who may have threatened Daniels or what the nature of those threats may have been is unclear, and Avenatti has declined to discuss the matter in greater detail.\n\nDaniels herself has not addressed any potential physical threats that she may have gotten, leaving open whether she will discuss the topic in the \"60 Minutes\" interview.\n\n5.
