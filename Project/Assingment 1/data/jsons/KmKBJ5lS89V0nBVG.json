The first thing that surprised me when I started was the station \u2019 s approach to community-oriented journalism .

KMEX has taught me otherwise .\nOver my first few months on the job at the city \u2019 s most popular network ( in any language ) , I saw my assignment desk colleagues transform calls from our viewers into specific news stories . The plight of a family wrongly evicted became an investigative series . A complaint about pollution turned into a story that uncovered malfeasance by a recycling company . The news team \u2019 s commitment , I soon learned , extended into territory that might not be strictly considered journalism but rather a sort of companionship\u2014a mission to offer guidance for a mostly immigrant audience , in need of help navigating their adoptive country .

This kind of loyalty is a privilege , but also a huge responsibility and one we don \u2019 t take lightly. \u201d The current crisis brought this duty into pristine focus . Over the past couple of months , we have dedicated our newscasts almost exclusively to the very specific needs of a community that is undergoing a seismic upheaval .\nAfter local and state officials in California first put quarantine rules into effect , we held a Facebook Live chat to address the community \u2019 s concerns and , hopefully , alleviate its fears . The number of questions overwhelmed us . Some left me heartbroken . Many viewers agonized over how they would make rent or what they would do if their landlord tried to evict them . Others wanted help understanding what exactly an \u201c essential \u201d job was or whether they would be getting any sort of relief from the government . Many explained a distressing choice : try to wait out the pandemic and risk losing everything they had patiently built since immigrating , or pack their belongings and return to their countries of origin , closing the door on their American dream .\nFor the majority of our audience\u2014and the country \u2019 s immigrant community as a whole\u2014these questions are not rhetorical . Though many work jobs deemed essential by the government itself , such as health care services and those involved in the nation \u2019 s food supply , undocumented workers are now deeply vulnerable , left out of any relief from Washington \u2019 s massive stimulus package .
