    "content": "Critics of President Trump \u2019 s foreign policy , both Democrats and establishment Republicans , find much to loathe about his views and actions . Some of the criticisms are substantive and reasonable , if debatable . Others , though , are little more than unhinged , ad hominem attacks . The latter poison the public discourse and make intelligent , meaningful debate on America \u2019 s role in the world nearly impossible .\nThe criticisms are especially intense regarding Trump \u2019 s policies toward NATO and Russia , and they have reached a crescendo this month following the NATO summit and the subsequent bilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin .\nNATO partisans were furious at the president \u2019 s comments about the Alliance and his treatment of the European allies . Objections about the president \u2019 s diplomatic style were certainly warranted . He proved to be even more abrasive than normal , accusing German Chancellor Angela Merkel of making Germany a \u201c captive \u201d to Russia by increasing her country \u2019 s reliance on Russian natural gas . He also bluntly reiterated his complaints about continued anemic defense expenditures of NATO \u2019 s European members and their lack of security burden sharing .\nHowever , his overall message was neither new nor unwarranted . U.S. officials have complained for decades about European free-riding on Washington \u2019 s military exertions , their overreliance on the United States to solve security problems in their region , and the persistent underinvestment in their own defense . It was entirely appropriate for Trump to raise that issue \u2014 and to stress that America \u2019 s patience is wearing thin . It was also legitimate to express doubts about NATO \u2019 s continuing relevance . The Alliance was created during a different era , and both Europe and the overall international system have changed dramatically in the past seven decades .\nYet , the president \u2019 s critics acted as though it was sacrilege for him even to raise questions about whether NATO truly benefits America \u2019 s security interests any longer . Any dilution of the existing U.S. commitment to the defense of the European allies , they insist , plays directly into the hands of Putin and encourages Russian aggression . In their view , it even imperils the entire liberal world order .\nBut unconditional NATO defenders are the ones who are out-of-line and out-of-touch . A growing number of foreign policy experts contend that the Alliance has outlived its usefulness , and that new , perhaps European-run security arrangements are needed for the conditions of the 21st century .\nThe negative reviews of Trump \u2019 s performance at the NATO summit were mild , though , compared to the shrill , even hateful , assessments of his summit with Putin in Helsinki \u2014 especially the post-summit joint press conference . The president enraged his opponents when he contended that clumsy and provocative U.S. actions bore considerable responsibility for the deterioration of bilateral relations . That apostasy was not his worst offense , however ; he also disputed the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election .\nFor his adamant critics , especially those on the left , such comments were the last straw . Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer fumed : \u201c In the history of our country , Americans have never seen a president of the United States support an adversary in the way Trump supported President Putin . He took the word of the KGB over the men and women of the CIA . \u201d\nSome of the vitriol was almost beyond belief . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi did not hold back on the nasty innuendos . Trump \u2019 s behavior , she said , \u201c proves that the Russians have something on the President , personally , financially or politically. \u201d Other political and media critics accused him of appeasing a brutal dictator and engaging in groveling and bootlicking . MSNBC host Joe Scarborough sneered that the president was \u201c a weak , dumpy stooge \u201d at the Helsinki summit . Others compared his performance to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain \u2019 s appeasement of Adolf Hitler at the 1938 Munich conference . Indeed , dozens of them , including former CIA Director John Brennan , accused the president of outright treason , which CNN host Fareed Zakaria stated \u201c might not be strong enough . \u201d\nThose types of denunciations land squarely in the \u201c unhinged \u201d category . It is perfectly reasonable to argue that Trump was too solicitous toward Putin in his press conference comments , or that it is equally legitimate to argue it was improper for the president to dispute the intelligence community \u2019 s findings publicly in a foreign country .

It was not legitimate , however , to accuse the president of treason and to circulate homophobic columns and editorial cartoons implying an erotic relationship between Trump and Putin .
