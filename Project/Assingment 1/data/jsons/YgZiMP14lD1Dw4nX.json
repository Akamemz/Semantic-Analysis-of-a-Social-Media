No, we haven\u2019t seen it, either, but that was what he said would happen when he signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. A trillion dollars later, we\u2019re no better off.\n\nThe housing bubble burst and stock portfolios lost trillions of dollars in value at the onset of the Great Recession in 2007. Those were dark times, and the country naturally thought it was time for a change.\n\nAs his first major act in office, Mr. Obama signed what he called \u201cthe most sweeping economic-recovery package in our history.\u201d It was certainly sweeping, and one of the single largest checks written in history, but there was no recovery.\n\nThe value of \u201cshovel-ready\u201d jobs was $830 billion, by the reckoning of the Congressional Budget Office.
