Some in the White House have urged Trump not to focus as much on the wall , try to pass a clean debt-ceiling bill and move to tax reform . \u201c You have barely anyone here saying , \u2018 Wall , wall , we have to get the wall at all costs , \u2019 \u201d one White House official said . \u2026 Two people who have spoken to Trump said he sees not building the wall as a personal embarrassment \u2014 and that he has shown more interest in building the wall than in other issues , like the upcoming budget negotiations . \u201c You don \u2019 t want a government shutdown , \u201d the White House official said . \u201c He is told that . He says , \u2018 I want money for the wall . \u2019 \u201d\nThe same emphasis on tax cuts for the elite before immigration reform for voters was also cited by Axios on August 20 , in an article which claimed to explain why top staff chose to stay in the White House amid elite hatred of his populist , wage-boosting , pro-American priorities . Axios reported :\nWe talked to a half dozen senior administration officials , who range from dismayed but certain to stay , to disgusted and likely soon to leave . They all work closely with Trump and his senior team so , of course , wouldn \u2019 t talk on the record . Instead , they agreed to let us distill their thinking/rationale : \u201c You have no idea how much crazy stuff we kill \u201d : The most common response centers on the urgent importance of having smart , sane people around Trump to fight his worst impulses . If they weren \u2019 t there , they say , we would have a trade war with China , massive deportations , and a government shutdown to force construction of a Southern wall . \u201c General Mattis needs us \u201d : Many talk about their reluctance to bolt on their friends and colleagues who are fighting the good fight to force better Trump behavior/decisions . They rightly point out that together , they have learned how to ignore Trump \u2019 s rhetoric and , at times , collectively steer him to more conventional policy responses .\nThis situation leaves Trump dependent on a few aides \u2014 such as immigration reformer Steve Miller \u2014 and his supporters at his rallies to help fend off the insistent demands by his globalist aides for a back-room surrender of his presidential goals .\nThat surrender would help his aides win Democratic support for their goals \u2014 but it would leave Trump with few friends heading into the 2018 midterm elections and the crucial 2020 reelection , says D.C. insiders . For example , the pro-American immigration reformers who backed Trump in the election fear his globalist aides will push Trump to accept and establish former President Barack Obama \u2019 s DACA amnesty in exchange for minor concessions , such as a modest amount of funds to build a short distance of border wall .\n\u201c If [ Trump \u2019 s aides ] are left to their own devices , they would exchange this for a few trinkets , \u201d so violating Trump \u2019 s campaign promise before the 2018 and 2020 elections , said Ira Mehlman , a spokesman for FAIR , the Federation for American Immigration Reform .\nThe suggested deal was outlined in a Tuesday article by Anita Kumar , a reporter for the McClatchy news service .
