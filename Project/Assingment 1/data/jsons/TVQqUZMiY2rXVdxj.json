    "content": "The social media forays of the Islamic State ( IS ) range from the jarringly adolescent to sophisticated advertising campaigns meant to portray extremism as a normal lifestyle decision .\nThese include Twitter feeds aimed at women , with pictures of kittens and designer shoes tweeted alongside jihadist rhetoric and snapshots of children in IS fan gear , \u201c much as children are dressed in favorite football team jerseys , \u201d notes Christina Schori Liang , senior fellow in the Emerging Security Challenges program at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy .\nWhile these efforts have prompted popular movements to oppose the IS message , including online vigilante groups of women known as the Anonymisses , the US government has been grappling mightily with how it , too , can counter IS rhetoric in the social media realm .\nThe efforts to date have ranged from clever and snarky responses meant to put down IS tweeters to truth-telling campaigns designed to deflate the idyllic picture that IS , also known as ISIS , paints of its rule . But how , precisely , to \u201c flip \u201d the IS narrative ?\nThe possibilities might include giving former foreign fighters a platform to discuss how their perception of joining IS did not match up with the reality , and figuring out how to create an atmosphere that encourages the sorts of organic social media outpourings that happened in the wake of the Sydney , Australia , shootings by an IS sympathizer last year . It may also require having a `` mature '' discussion , analysts add , about the US policies that have created animosity among so many in the Arab world .\nStill , the role of the US government in any of these endeavors is tricky and potentially alienating , analysts say .\n\u201c You have to look at why the Islamic State has been attracting people . It \u2019 s not just that they \u2019 re good at social media . They have a story to tell \u2013 that they have established an actual state . That they are fulfilling prophecy , \u201d says William McCants , who from 2009 to 2011 served as the State Department \u2019 s senior adviser for countering violent extremism .\nThe message is \u201c a powerful recruiting tool \u201d for IS , he adds . That means for the US and others , \u201c it \u2019 s not as simple as putting out a different message [ from IS ] or trying to undermine their message with a more sarcastic message . \u201d\nIndeed , US government social media responses tend to be \u201c viewed as inauthentic , snarky \u2013 sort of marked already by US policy in the region , \u201d says Nicholas Heras , a researcher in the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington .\nPentagon efforts in this area can also \u201c take on the connotation of a psy-op , \u201d or psychological operation , an even bigger hurdle to overcome , he adds . \u201c I \u2019 m skeptical about how we can even create a formal anti-IS social media program . \u201d\nNot that governments don \u2019 t try . The US military has an active social media presence . The British Army has created a special force , the 77th Brigade of \u201c Facebook warriors , \u201d skilled in psychological operations . The French Ministry of the Interior has created a website with stark language , aimed at discouraging young people : \u201c They say \u2018 sacrifice yourself with us , you will defend a just cause. \u2019 In reality , you will discover hell on earth and die alone , away from home . \u201d\nOfficials from the State Department \u2019 s Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications ( CSCC ) have said that what the center really needs is its own \u201c fan club , \u201d or \u201c knights of uploading , \u201d as the IS calls its support network .\nOne option that involves direct US government assistance \u2013 from a safe distance \u2013 is to put American funds into training youth , alternative , and local media , Mr. Heras says . \u201c The best anti-IS messaging comes from locals , from Syrians who are active on social media . They craft messages far more effectively and are really in the know about the on-the-ground impact of IS campaigns . \u201d\nThis might include former IS fighters who come forward to share their experience . But simply decrying the brutality of IS may play into the hands of aspiring fighters .\n\u201c We think that exposing their extreme violence is going to be off-putting , but ISIS is celebrating that kind of violence , \u201d says Mr. McCants , who is now director of the Project on US Relations With the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution in Washington .\nYet countering the perceptions of what the fighting life is actually like could be another matter .\n\u201c Finding some former ISIS fighter talking about how awful it was , the racism he encountered , that the brutality wasn \u2019 t what he signed up for \u2013 that stuff can pack a punch , \u201d McCants says , adding that it doesn \u2019 t tend to be governments , but news outlets like the Bill Maher-affiliated Vice \u201c that are talking to real , honest-to-God people and trying to get insight . \u201d\nMessages are \u201c always more powerful when they \u2019 re organic and the public is driving it , \u201d he says .\nThe # illridewithyou campaign that cropped up in Sydney on the heels of a gunman in a cafe proclaiming an affinity for IS helped to counter creeping Islamophobia in the aftermath . As part of the campaign , thousands of people offered to meet Muslims at transportation hubs to accompany them on their journey .\n\u201c What was beautiful about what happened in Australia is that it was by all accounts something that happened spontaneously , \u201d Heras says .\nThe best way to help encourage those sorts of campaigns is to \u201c create an atmosphere domestically where communities feel included and are not labeled terrorists , \u201d he adds . \u201c That \u2019 s something that \u2019 s difficult to measure ; it \u2019 s an intrinsic value .\n\u201c In this day and age , there \u2019 s a great temptation to try to create a program to engender something like that , \u201d he notes . \u201c Really all you can do is support these values and hope that it \u2019 s the message [ they inspire ] . \u201d\nPart of supporting these values should not involve shutting down the Twitter accounts of those who promulgate even \u201c repugnant ideas , \u201d argues Yasir Kazi , a Muslim cleric and assistant professor in religious studies at Rhodes College in Memphis , Tenn .\n\u201c We betray our own values [ of free speech ] when we shut down these sites , especially when we only do it for ISIS and not for home-grown [ American ] militias of the far-right , \u201d he says . \u201c When we apply it to Muslim radicals , once again this impression is given that this war is only against Islam . \u201d\n\u201c These tactics further enrage our youth and make them feel as if the government is out to get them , \u201d he adds . \u201c If anything , these tactics encourage , rather than discourage , radicalism . \u201d\nUS efforts to counter social media hatred should also include some \u201c mature \u201d foreign policy assessments , Dr. Kazi says . \u201c It must involve having a frank discussion about what we ourselves have done to generate so much animosity against us as a nation . \u201d\nHe mentions the Abu Ghraib prison scandal , and the more than 500,000 Iraqis who died in the decade after the US war there started in 2003 , according to a 2013 study from researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington . That figure includes people who died from bombings as well as from war-related causes \u2013 for example , a pregnant woman who encountered difficult labor but could not reach a hospital because of fighting , the study says .\n\u201c So somebody \u2019 s got to ask , \u2018 What \u2019 s going to be the impact of these deaths ? Where is that anger going to be directed ? \u2019 \u201d adds Kazi , who has been threatened with death by IS .\n\u201c Then we can tell ISIS , as Muslim clerics , \u2018 We \u2019 re also angry at the bombs , at our own foreign policy . But we ask you , do you think the religion of Islam will tell you that you should indiscriminately kill and perpetrate violence against innocent people ? \u2019 \u201d\nDespite the volume of IS social media , it \u2019 s important to keep it all in perspective , says J.M .
