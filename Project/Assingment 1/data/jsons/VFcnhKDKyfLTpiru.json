For every net new job created , about four people dropped out of the workforce . So we 're going in the wrong direction . ''\nThe former Massachusetts governor said the Federal Reserve has run out of ammo , and said business-friendly policies from the White House are the best hope for turning around the moribund economy .\n`` I do n't think that there 's any action that [ the Federal Reserve is ] going to take that will have an immediate impact on the economy , '' Romney said . `` And frankly I think they have shot a lot of their monetary bullets and those bullets are not able to strike at a target that makes a real difference for the American worker today .\n`` What we need is to have policies coming from Washington that are fiscally sound and get America back on track , '' he added\nRomney , who said he did n't watch President Obama 's speech Thursday night but read it on Friday , said he was nonetheless displeased .\n`` I was disappointed with the speech , '' Romney said . `` Of course , it has been a disappointing four years . There was nothing in the speech that gives confidence that the President knows what he is doing when it comes to jobs and the economy .

All told , the proportion of the adult population that 's either working or looking for work fell to 63.5 percent . That 's the lowest level in 31 years for the so-called labor force participation rate . The rate peaked at 67.3 percent in early 2000 .\n`` This has been a very disappointing time for the American people , '' said Romney , who believes his private sector experience gives him an edge over Obama in the issue Americans care most about \u2014 the economy .\nRomney said Obama 's speech was a reminder of the promises he made in 2008 that have not come to fruition .\n`` The speech had a few new promises , Romney said . `` Old ones , he did n't report on \u2014 [ he 's been ] unable to fulfill them . What we saw and what we read was a President making new promises and offering no new plan , no new ideas . ''\nRomney bristled at claims by Democrats that his own speech in Tampa was short on specifics , noting he laid out five steps he said will lead to increases in jobs and income for Americans . He also rejected former President Clinton 's claim in Charlotte that `` no president '' could have turned around the economic mess Obama inherited when he was sworn in in 2009 , saying he `` could have done a heck of a lot better job .

He said he opposes sequestration , the automatic defense cuts that will kick in Jan. 1 if lawmakers and the White House ca n't agree on a a deficit-cutting strategy .\n`` When you give a speech , you do n't give a laundry list , '' Romney said . `` You talk about the things that you think are important .
