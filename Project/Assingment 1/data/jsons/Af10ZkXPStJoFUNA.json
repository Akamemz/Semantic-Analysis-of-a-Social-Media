Their travel would be limited to south Florida , where they have lived , and New York , where the charges have been filed and the case against them will proceed .\nParnas and Fruman began attending campaign fundraising events in March 2018 , the indictment alleges .\nAccording to court documents , Fruman contributed $ 10,000 on Nov. 1 , 2018 , to a Nevada state candidate . State campaign finance filings show Fruman contributed to the campaigns of two Republican candidates : Adam Laxalt , former state attorney general , and Wesley Duncan , former state assembly member .\nHaving no significant prior history of political giving , the pair \u201c sought to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working , \u201d the indictment charges .\nAmong their beneficiaries , according to court documents , was a U.S. congressman who received $ 5,400 last year from the pair who also pledged raise $ 20,000 for the lawmaker as they sought to enlist him in an effort to remove Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine . The congressman was not named in court documents , but a person familiar with the matter identified the lawmaker as former Rep. Pete Sessions , R-Texas .\nSessions wrote a letter last year to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , urging Yovanovitch 's ouster . The former congressman could not be immediately reached for comment . Yovanovitch was recalled in May .\nTo hide their sources of funding and capital , Parnas and Fruman created a limited liability company called Global Energy Producers and \u201c intentionally caused certain large contributions to be reported in the name of GEP instead of their own names , \u201d the indictment says .\nWhen news about the Global Energy Producers ' contributions surfaced , the indictment says , an individual working with Parnas remarked that this `` is what happens when you become visible \u2026 the buzzards descend . '' Parnas responded , that 's `` why we need to stay under the radar . ''\nThe indictment alleges that Parnas , Fruman , Correia and Kukushkin schemed with an unidentified foreign national who is a Russian citizen to get retail marijuana licenses in states , including Nevada . In or around September and October 2018 , Correia drafted a table of prospective political donations . The table allegedly described a multistate licensing strategy that would funnel $ 1 million to $ 2 million in contributions to federal and state political committees .\nThe plan allegedly included a funding schedule of two $ 500,000 transfers . The foreign national arranged for the funds to be wired on or around Sept. 18 , 2018 , and Oct. 16 , 2018 , from overseas accounts to a U.S. corporate bank account controlled by Fruman and another individual , \u201d the indictment charges .\nThe alleged conspirators are accused of taking steps to hide the foreign national \u2019 s involvement and role in the funding . In Kukushkin 's words , hiding the foreign national 's role was necessary because of `` his Russian roots and current political paranoia about it , '' the indictment says .\nParnas and Fruman , who were born in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union and live in Florida , have become political players in recent years . In May 2018 , Parnas posted pictures on Facebook of himself and Fruman with Trump in the White House and with the president 's son Donald Jr. in California . That was the same month their company , Global Energy Producers , was credited with giving $ 325,000 to the committee that supports Trump 's reelection , America First Action SuperPac .\nThe campaign contribution sparked a complaint to the Federal Election Commission \u2013 and at least two lawsuits \u2013 because of questions about the source of the money . Berman , appointed by Trump , characterized the $ 325,000 contribution as `` one of the largest donations '' received by the committee .\nThursday , the committee acknowledged receiving the Global Energy Producers donation in May 2018 .\n`` In July 2018 , a complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission concerning this contribution , '' the committee said in a written statement . `` There is also separate litigation pending in Florida that concerns these funds . Accordingly , America First Action placed that contribution in a segregated bank account , it has not been used for any purpose and the funds will remain in this segregated account until these matters are resolved . We take our legal obligations seriously and scrupulously comply with the law and any suggestion otherwise is false . \u201d\nThree House committees \u2013 Foreign Affairs , Intelligence and Oversight and Reform \u2013 scheduled depositions Thursday with Parnas and Friday with Fruman to ask how they fit in with Trump 's dealings with Ukraine .

Dowd did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday .\nThe impeachment investigation has focused on a phone call July 25 in which Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden . Text messages between top State Department officials suggested the demand was a trade-off for nearly $ 400 million in military aid .\nTrump has tweeted that as president , he has `` an absolute right , perhaps even a duty , '' to investigate corruption . He defended his discussion with Zelensky as a `` perfect '' call and said there was no quid pro quo between the request to investigate Biden and the military aid .\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone notified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , and the three committee chairmen Tuesday that Trump would not cooperate with an investigation he considers partisan and unfair .\nMore : A diagram of events in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump\nParnas and Fruman drew the congressional spotlight because they helped arrange a meeting in January in New York between Giuliani and Ukraine \u2019 s then-prosecutor general , Yuri Lutsenko , according to Ukrainian media reports .\nFormer Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin , Lutsenko \u2019 s predecessor , is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry because Trump and Giuliani pushed an unsubstantiated claim that Biden urged Shokin 's removal in 2016 to thwart an investigation into a company tied to his son Hunter . Biden denied wrongdoing , and Lutsenko told The Washington Post that Hunter Biden `` did not violate anything . \u201d\nDowd , the lawyer who represents Parnas and Fruman , told the Intelligence Committee by letter Oct. 3 that they could n't meet a deadline Monday for documents and communications because the men were also represented by Giuliani and the material might be protected by attorney-client privilege .\n`` Your request for documents and communications is overly broad and unduly burdensome , '' Dowd told the panel , calling the request an effort to `` harass , intimidate and embarrass my clients . '' Dowd said the committee should recognize `` some semblance of due process , fairness , justice and common decency .

The contribution was attributed to the company Global Energy Producers on the committee 's report to the Federal Election Commission . Parnas was listed as CEO of the company and Fruman as president in other campaign documents .\nAccording to The Associated Press , the money actually came from a different corporate entity , Aaron Investments I , which was managed by Parnas and his wife . Aaron Investments received $ 1.2 million from the proceeds of a private mortgage May 15 , 2018 , secured by a condo unit in North Miami Beach owned by a separate corporation tied to Fruman , according to AP . Wire-transfer records show $ 325,000 was then wired from Aaron Investments to America First Action , even though the contribution was credited to Global Energy Producers .\nThe Campaign Legal Center , a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog based in Washington , filed a complaint with the FEC in July 2018 arguing that Global Energy Producers shielded the source of the political contribution .

Parnas has contributed nearly $ 125,000 since October 2016 and Fruman more than $ 44,000 , according to FEC records .\nThe large political contributions prompted at least two lawsuits against Parnas for unpaid debts .\nA Florida man named Felix Vulis filed a state lawsuit in March against Fruman , Parnas and Global Energy Producers seeking repayment of a $ 100,000 loan that was provided to help the business achieve the goal of becoming the country 's biggest exporter of liquid natural gas . Vulis wrote a check Oct. 1 , 2018 , that was supposed to be repaid by Dec. 1 , 2018 , but was n't , according to the lawsuit . Both sides said the case was settled amicably Aug. 23 .\nA thornier case lingers from a federal judgment that Parnas owes for a movie that never got made .\nThe Pues Family Trust IRA filed a federal lawsuit in 2011 in New York City seeking repayment of a $ 350,000 loan to Parnas . The trust 's executor , Michael Pues , described the money in court documents as a bridge loan for a movie with the working title `` Anatomy of an Assassin , '' while Parnas found more investors .\nParnas denied in a court filing that the money was a loan . Parnas said the movie , which he said was going to be called `` Memory of a Killer , '' fell apart because of financing problems , including Pues not contributing $ 1 million as promised .\nA judgment in the federal case in March 2016 ordered Parnas to pay the Pues Family Trust $ 510,435 for the loan and 9 % annual interest .\nAfter learning of the political contribution , Pues asked a federal court in Florida in January 2019 to enforce the unpaid judgment . Pues asked the court to undo the political contribution related to Global Energy Producers , Aaron Investments I and America First Action , so the judgment can be partially repaid .\nAmerica First Action said in a filing in July that it objected to the lawsuit 's claim that the $ 325,000 contribution came from Aaron Investments rather than Global Energy Producers .
