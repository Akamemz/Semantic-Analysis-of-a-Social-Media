Here's what you need to know:\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe Senate and Assembly, in a joint session, will pick someone to fill out the remainder of Schneiderman's four-year term, which runs through the end of the year.\n\nIt's all laid out in Section 41 of the state's Public Officers Law, according to Bennett Liebman, Albany Law School's government lawyer-in-residence.\n\nThe law reads, in part: \"When a vacancy occurs or exists, other than by removal, in the office of comptroller or attorney-general ... the two houses thereof, by joint ballot, shall appoint a person to fill such actual or prospective vacancy.\"\n\nIt will be up to legislative leaders when to call the session.\n\nWho will control the process?\n\nThe Democrat-led Assembly and Speaker Carl Heastie, D-Bronx.\n\nThere are 213 seats in the state Legislature, meaning Schneiderman's successor will need 107 votes from lawmakers.\n\nThere are 104 Assembly Democrats in the chamber, according to Mike Whyland, a spokesman for Heastie. That's by far the single-largest bloc of votes among the legislative conferences and almost a majority on its own.\n\nHas this happened before?\n\nYes. Several times.\n\nWhen Comptroller Alan Hevesi resigned amid a corruption scandal in late 2006, it set off a chaotic process to replace him.\n\nLawmakers \u2014 led by Assembly Democrats \u2014 ultimately settled on then-Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli to succeed Hevesi, a choice that angered then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who preferred several candidates with more financial experience.\n\nDiNapoli, however, was popular among his legislative colleagues, who voted him in. And he's won two terms since then.\n\nIn 1993, the Legislature picked another Democratic assemblyman \u2014 Oliver Koppell \u2014 to replace Robert Abrams as attorney general after Abrams stepped down a year early.\n\nWill there be an election?\n\nYes.\n\nThe state attorney general position is on the ballot every four years. That includes this November, when a full four-year term will be up for grabs.\n\nManny Alicandro, a Republican corporate attorney from Manhattan, announced his bid for the seat Monday, hours before Schneiderman's resignation.\n\nBut Republican leaders say others could soon hop into the race, particularly after Schneiderman's exit.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, now have an unexpected vacancy to fill on their statewide ticket, but they have an advantage since the Legislature will almost certainly pick a Democrat to temporarily succeed Schneiderman.\n\nBut being selected by lawmakers to fill out Schneiderman's term isn't a guarantee that a candidate will win in November.\n\nIn 1994, Koppell lost a Democratic primary for attorney general.
