    "content": "On Wednesday , President Trump gave credence to a smear against Rep. Ilhan Omar ( D-Minn. ) when he told reporters that there was \u201c a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother , \u201d and that he was \u201c sure that somebody will be looking at that . \u201d\nIt was almost only a matter of time before the smear , an unfounded accusation which started in fringe corners of the internet , earned the ultimate far-right cosign of being mentioned by Trump . The rumor appears to have started three years ago , but begun catching more serious online attention in recent months as Omar came under increasing right-wing attacks . According to an analysis of tweets by Zach Verdin , a partner at the pro-democracy independent research collective Guardians.ai , messages including the words \u201c Ilhan Omar , \u201d \u201c brother , \u201d and \u201c marriage \u201d had significant spikes in the spring . On April 16 , after an article purporting to substantiate the claim was circulated by OANN host Jack Posobiec , it was mentioned in 7,880 tweets .\nConservative outlets with a track record of spreading misinformation published stories relaying the smear .\nIn the run-up to that peak , smaller spikes correlated with right-wing media sites publishing stories on the smear , illustrating how the conservative media eco-system can boost unfounded accusations and conspiracies into the mainstream .\nLast summer , on August 8 , 2018 , Alpha News and PJ Media published a story about the smear . Days later , a right-wing troll and former Project Veritas staffer crashed a campaign event supporting Omar before her election to Congress , accosting people there over the candidate \u2019 s supposed marriage to her brother . One of the first such Twitter spikes came shortly after that incident , when , on August 13 , 2018 , there were 242 posts mentioning the smear . That same day , conservative outlets with a track record of spreading misinformation , including PJ Media again , published stories relaying the claim .\nThe next spike of over 2,250 tweets came on October 29 when a PJ Media story from August claiming to present school records substantiating the theory recirculated on Twitter . PJ Media followed up the next day by publishing a new story . And again , on October 27 , Alpha News published another story pushing the smear . Another spike came on Feb. 14 , after Posobiec tweeted about the claim , garnering over 2,000 retweets .\nOn June 23 , Minnesota \u2019 s largest newspaper , the Minneapolis Star\u2013Tribune , examined the accusation in a long article that detailed Omar \u2019 s marriages to two men , her dismissals of the claim one was her brother , and incidents where she or her campaign declined to provide reporters information or arrange interviews that could help verify her story . While the article \u2019 s lede sentence boasted that \u201c New investigative documents released by a state agency have given fresh life to lingering questions about the marital history of Rep. Ilhan Omar , \u201d those documents , related to a state inquiry into whether Omar \u2019 s campaign violated spending rules by hiring an accountant to resolve tax issues related to her marriages , offered nothing to support the claim she had married her brother . The article noted that the newspaper \u2019 s broader review of public records \u201c could neither conclusively confirm nor rebut the allegation \u201d that a man Omar had once been married to was her sibling . Following the article \u2019 s publication , the accusation that Omar had married her brother was mentioned 2,800 times on Twitter , partially with the help of right-wing media consultant Caleb Hull who boosted the story .\nA jumping-off point for most of the Omar marriage claims appears to have been an August 13 , 2016 post by Alpha News , a hyper-partisan Minnesota-based website that , according to the Star Tribune , has connections to the state \u2019 s Republican and tea-party groups . The story was pointed out to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by Ben Decker , who runs the media and tech investigations consultancy Memetica .\nRight-wing actors have spread extremely flimsy information , forming a wall of conservative media protecting the rumor from serious interrogation .\nThe Daily Beast reported that it had found a slightly earlier instance of the claim being pushed from an anonymous account with a history of false posts on Somali Spot , an immigrant diaspora forum .
