Throughout the election cycle , Clinton supporters have often been out-shouted by Trump 's and Bernie Sanders ' more vocal voter bases . Today , however , the Ohio hashtag was brimming with photos of voters who had already cast votes for Hillary Clinton .

The social media site tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 that of the tweets sent using the hashtag # OHVotesEarly over the last 24 hours , 75 percent included mentions of Clinton , while just 25 mentioned Trump . `` It 's an inexact science , '' says Twitter spokesman Nick Pacilio , but it 's a staggering disparity , nonetheless .\nIt could very well have something to do with the fact that it was a Clinton supporter who originally tweeted the hashtag on October 2 . It could also have something to do with the fact that Clinton 's Ohio digital team is spreading it far and wide . It could have something to do with the fact that the Trump campaign tweeted out the wrong start date for early voting when they asked supporters in Ohio a few weeks ago to get out and vote . Or , perhaps , it has to do with the fact that Trump is quickly losing his lead in Ohio , after The Washington Post published a \u2013 video over the weekend in which Trump talks about sexually assaulting women on a hot microphone .\nA new poll by Baldwin Wallace University Community Research Institute , taken after Sunday night 's debate , shows that Clinton is now surging in the state , beating Trump 43 to 34 percent in a four-way race . In a head-to-head race , she beats him 48 percent to 37 percent . This is a drastic turnaround from just a month ago , when most polls showed Trump winning Ohio handily . For the Clinton camp , that was a bad sign , considering no candidate since John F. Kennedy in 1960 has ever won the White House without winning Ohio .

On Sunday , Trump volunteers in Ohio knocked on more than 118,000 doors , according to the campaign . `` Our campaign will be using every day of early and absentee voting to get out our voters , culminating in an Election Day win for Mr. Trump , '' Bob Paduchik , Trump 's Ohio state director , said in a statement .\nEarly voting returns in other states show Clinton with a slight advantage .
