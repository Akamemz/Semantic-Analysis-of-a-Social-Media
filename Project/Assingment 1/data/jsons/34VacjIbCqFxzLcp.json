    "content": "As part of a series of articles on the innovators tackling the filter bubble phenomenon , Andrew Brightwell interviews John Gable , founder and CEO of AllSides , a website that has devised its own way to present alternative perspectives on American news .\nWhen a man who helped build the first successful web browser says there \u2019 s something wrong with the Internet , it probably pays to listen .\nJohn Gable \u2019 s diagnosis has authority : he has more than 30 years in the tech business , including stints at Microsoft , AOL and as a product manager for Netscape Navigator .\nNow he is founder and CEO of AllSides Inc , a news website with a distinct mission . Visit AllSides.com and it offers the news you \u2019 d expect on any US politics site , except that its lead stories include a choice of articles : one from the left , centre and right .\n\u201c The headlines are so radically different that even reading [ them together ] tells you more about that topic than reading one story all the way through . \u201d\nOn first visiting AllSides I find myself drawn in directions I don \u2019 t normally take \u2013 towards right-wing pieces , from sites like the National Review , the Washington Times or Fox News .\nThis is AllSides \u2019 intention : to push the comfortably certain in new directions . With The Echo Chamber Club and Read Across The Aisle , AllSides is at the vanguard of a movement against political polarisation of the web .\nWhen you click on one story you \u2019 re offered a range of alternatives . Browsing AllSides is like an odyssey through American political opinion .\n\u201c We think that the best way to serve humanity is a free flow of information . And when you talk about something that \u2019 s false , fake news or something like that , we have always solved it by showing the report that says it \u2019 s fake news right next to it . \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s just the start . AllSides plans to fix the whole of the web , starting with news .\nFor John , the seeds of the Internet \u2019 s demise were evident even when hopes it would usher in a new era of openness and democracy remained unblemished .\nSpeaking over Skype from his office in the San Francisco Bay Area , he says :\n\u201c I gave a speech in January of \u2018 97 saying I was afraid it might not work out that way ; that , as a result of the overwhelming information from the Internet and the way we connect , we may actually be trained to think in terms of categories or discriminate in new ways . \u201d\nSo it has proved . Following Donald Trump \u2019 s election , critics have attacked Google and Facebook for their part in a breakdown of veracity and civility in public discourse .\nAt the heart of their critiques are the concepts of fake news and \u2018 filter bubbles \u2019 , in which social media users are insulated from views they \u2019 ll find disagreeable .\n\u201c We are less informed today than we were 10 years ago , even 200 years ago , on controversial topics . I \u2019 d say we are more confidently ignorant , because we hear a small piece of the answer so many times that we \u2019 re convinced that \u2019 s correct . \u201d\nJohn tells me that by inferring authority from the number of links a web page attracts , the Internet is vulnerable to distortion .\n\u201c To deal with all this overwhelming information , Google started with the idea of references in libraries , so if this is cited by a lot of different sources , it must be a good one . \u201c Well , for controversial subjects it \u2019 s [ polarised content ] that becomes what is most popular . \u201d\nThose who shout loudest and rudest win out , because they are more likely to attract attention and , therefore , links .\n\u201c A third of the clicks from a Google search page go to the number-one result ; 92 per cent go to the first page , \u201d he says .\nRecent history leaves us unprepared for the consequences . John mentions Walter Cronkite , a US news anchor of the 60s , 70s and 80s , who is synonymous with unblinking trust for the news .\n\u201c Walter Cronkite was the aberration . What people didn \u2019 t realise was that back in history we recognised that the media was biased . And if you wanted to understand , you had to look at different points of view . People understood that . \u201d\nJohn likens today \u2019 s age of Internet disruption to the arrival of the printing press , which he says also resulted in wild speculation , rumour and violence .\n\u201c Not until society had learned how to use that new earth-shattering technology did things get better and the Reformation happened . \u201c I believe we \u2019 re in the Dark Ages of the Internet , when it comes to controversial topics . \u201d\nAllSides has been going for a little more than four years ; not long enough to start a new enlightenment , but enough to shed a little light .\nThat has started with the development of a patented \u2018 crowd-driven \u2019 political bias rating .\nVisitors to the site are invited to take part in a blind rating of news publishers \u2019 politics , after their own bias is tested to enable a representative sample .\nJohn says it took trial and error to arrive at the system , with AllSides first using a Wikipedia model that relied on crowd-sourced editing and writing .\n\u201c We found that that was too slow . That the information flow online is so quick that you can \u2019 t have a bunch of people write about it and think about it . \u201d\nThe site identifies five grades of political view : Left , lean-left , centre , lean-right , and right .\nIn the interests of transparency , AllSides publishes its staff members \u2019 ratings . ( John , who once worked for the Republican party , is rated as lean-right . )\nA system that makes bias transparent isn \u2019 t without controversy . Many journalists insist reporting is politically neutral . John says the chief editor of one prominent \u2018 liberal \u2019 publication simply couldn \u2019 t accept that his output could be rated .\n\u201c His basic argument was that the news is either right or wrong . And the idea that there was any bias in anything they or anybody did was\u2026 I mean he really was sweating and turning red and stuff . \u201d\nSuch encounters are uncommon , however , and away from journalism the bias rating offers advantages .\nJohn explains that AllSides is used by teachers in 38 out of 50 US states .\n\u201c If [ teachers ] bring up politics , there are two big things that frighten them . One is that their class themselves will get very divided and angry of each other , so you create chaos in the classroom . The other is that parents and administrators will charge them for being biased in one way or another . \u201c And that \u2019 s a very big concern . We remove both of those problems . \u201d\nThe site has also proved popular with visitors from outside the US , who John says come for a unique perspective on US politics by seeing all sides of the argument .\nNo doubt foreign visitor numbers grew in the wake of Donald Trump \u2019 s victory , and the preceding ill-tempered electoral race , which in turn has piqued interest in the site \u2019 s mission .\n\u201c Certainly six months before the election we had to explain filter bubbles , and how that was a problem . Now people explain it to us . \u201d\nThis offers new opportunities . To date , the site has had more than 2.2 million unique visitors , but is sustained by donations , \u201c thousands of hours of free work \u201d and John \u2019 s own funds .\n\u201c Before [ the election ] we would go to some venture capitalists or funders and they \u2019 d be like , \u2018 oh that \u2019 s nice. \u2019 Now we have them calling us , which has not happened before . \u201c So we are scrambling , frankly , to build a business model , to raise the money to take this big-time . \u201d\nBut John says a long term income strategy is likely to include affiliate selling and advertising .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the old kind of mantra from news journalism early on , where news never made money , news was only used to sell classifieds . And we \u2019 ll do the same kind of thing . \u201c But there are lots of things we will not do . The click-baiting things that you see a lot of journalists do , I think that a lot of media companies have an addiction to bad media practices that help them make a little bit more money this next week or next month , but ultimately kills their credibility . \u201d\nSuch a strategy will benefit from the site \u2019 s high Google rankings and build on topic-specific \u2018 evergreen \u2019 content about political issues that AllSides writes itself .\nJohn isn \u2019 t yet happy with AllSides \u2019 mobile experience , but the site is already most popular among Millennials . He says young people are more likely to change their behaviour on learning of a bias , but are also more vulnerable to filter bubbles . That \u2019 s because they mostly get their news from Facebook and other social media .\n\u201c It \u2019 s kind of getting news by accident . When you get news by accident you \u2019 re getting bubbled . You \u2019 re in a serious filter bubble . \u201c If you \u2019 re just getting it as it comes to you , you \u2019 re being very brainwashed in one way or another . \u201d\nThe site also has a dialogue section , where it allows readers to join debates on chosen subjects \u2013 and has been trialling video conversations with small groups .\n\u201c Now we \u2019 re trying to figure out a way to show it to the rest of the world and let other people in participate in it . \u201d\nJohn says AllSides wants to find partners in the UK and elsewhere to develop the website for different territories .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a big problem and we do have a unique way of solving it that other people haven \u2019 t figured out yet . \u201d\nAfter interviewing John , Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook \u2019 s CEO , publishes a 5,000-plus word broadside on \u2018 Building Global Community \u2019 . He shares some of his thoughts on how the company plans to tackle filter bubbles and fake news , warning there \u2019 s no quick fix .\n\u201c Research shows that some of the most obvious ideas , like showing people an article from the opposite perspective , actually deepen polarisation by framing other perspectives as foreign . \u201c A more effective approach is to show a range of perspectives , let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s striking how similar this is to AllSides \u2019 approach , so I ask John if they have had any contact .\nHe says they have networked with some people at the firm and are hoping to have more in-depth conversations soon .
