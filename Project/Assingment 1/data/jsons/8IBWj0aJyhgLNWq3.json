The United States has said local fighters , rather than U.S. forces , must lead the fight against ISIS , a strategy that has come under withering criticism as the terror group gains ground in Iraq and Syria .\nThe remark surprised Iraq 's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi , who told the BBC that Carter was `` fed the wrong information .
