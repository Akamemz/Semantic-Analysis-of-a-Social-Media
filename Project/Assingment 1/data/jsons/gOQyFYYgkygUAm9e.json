At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\n\u201c The long-run structure of the American welfare state , which is heavily focused on providing health care and retirement security to the elderly , requires a growing population and economy . Immigrants contribute to both goals \u2026 Going forward , demographers forecast that immigration \u2014 both the people it provides directly and the children that immigrants bear and raise \u2014 is the only reason America \u2019 s working-age population isn \u2019 t declining . This is doubly true when you consider that immigrants \u2019 work in the household and child care sectors likely serves to increase native-born Americans \u2019 childbearing as well\u2026 That hundreds of millions of people around the world would like to move to our shores \u2014 and that America has a long tradition of assimilating foreigners and a political mythos and civil culture that is conducive to doing so \u2014 is an enormous source of national strength . It \u2019 s time we started to see it that way. \u201d Matthew Yglesias , Vox\n\u201c By signaling that the huddled masses are no longer welcome while others in the administration ( particularly Jared Kushner ) continue to advocate for the types of visas favored in Silicon Valley , Team Trump spins this as advocating not for \u2018 zero immigration , \u2019 but for the \u2018 right kind of immigration \u2019 \u2026 [ But ] \u2018 the president has made it more difficult\u2014and expensive\u2014to hire high-skilled tech workers from other countries . The administration has throttled a program that encouraged entrepreneurs to come to the U.S. It \u2019 s also ending work permits for spouses of H-1B holders , who are often highly skilled professionals themselves. \u2019 As a result of the administration \u2019 s efforts , there was a 10 percent decline in H-1Bs issued last year\u2026 It isn \u2019 t just about dissuading the tired and poor from coming , it \u2019 s about telling everyone to stay away . \u201d Alex Shephard , New Republic\n\u201c [ The rule ] won \u2019 t attract greater numbers of better-heeled , success-bound applicants . But it will radically slash the total number of immigrants gaining legal admission . And it will deprive the U.S. economy of badly needed workers of the sort who have a long track record of upward mobility\u2026 The fact remains that less-well-heeled immigrants fill jobs for which there are insufficient native-born applicants ; they perform well in those jobs and move up the income bracket . The administration \u2019 s new rules , while complex \u2014 they exempt pregnant women , asylum seekers , refugees , military service personnel and others \u2014 would drastically expand the pool of those who could be denied legal permanent residency based on poor predictors of future success. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c The Labor Department reports that seven million jobs are going unfilled even as the economy is slowing\u2026 Foreign-born workers include surgeons , computer engineers and financiers , and also those working in restaurant kitchens and driving cabs , doing the less desirable jobs at the lowest wages . But they contribute to the growth of the nation , and if some of them need help at some point with housing or food stamps , it \u2019 s a bargain in the long term . The economic return makes immigration a great investment for the nation . Which is why Mr. Trump \u2019 s public charge rule is bad for all Americans , not just those who strive to become one. \u201d Bill Saporito , New York Times\n\u201c Aside from the strong moral arguments against letting poor people go hungry and sick , no rational government would want immigrant communities to , for example , forgo vaccinating their children in order to avoid a punitive reaction from immigration authorities ; that has all the makings of a public health catastrophe . No rational government of a country with millions of immigrants would want millions of immigrant children to show up at school hungry each morning because their parents are afraid to apply for food stamps . No rational government would want hundreds of thousands of immigrant families to risk homelessness because of a temporary dip in their financial situation . Simply out of self-interest , a country such as the United States can not afford to drive millions of legal immigrants entirely outside the social safety net. \u201d Sasha Abramsky , The Nation\n\u201c Never mind that immigrants are , for one thing , less likely to rely on welfare benefits than native-born Americans\u2026 consider for a moment how many Americans -- our parents , grandparents , or great-grandparents -- would n't be here today if regulations that used the straitened circumstances of new immigrants to measure their future earning potential had been in place. \u201d Jill Filipovic , CNN\n\u201c The first comprehensive immigration law at the federal level was the 1882 Immigration Act , which , among other things , excluded anyone who was \u2018 unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge. \u2019 That principle \u2014 the \u2018 public-charge doctrine , \u2019 as it \u2019 s called \u2014 has been included in all subsequent immigration legislation , including the 1996 immigration and welfare-reform laws\u2026\n\u201c The Clinton administration issued guidance that barred consideration of anything other than cash benefits for purposes of determining self-sufficiency . In other words , an immigrant using food stamps , Medicaid , free school lunch , and public housing \u2014 but not cash benefits such as TANF or SSI \u2014 was to be considered self-supporting\u2026 Immigrants shouldn \u2019 t just use welfare less than the native-born \u2014 ideally , they shouldn \u2019 t use it at all . \u201d\n\u201c This approach is rooted in the common sense notion that immigrants should support themselves , not burden taxpayers . If they can \u2019 t support themselves , they should leave\u2026 However , the rule isn \u2019 t draconian . It applies to \u2018 an alien who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period. \u2019 Receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months . Thus , immigrants in dire straits can seek assistance of the types addressed in the new rule . Their status will be in jeopardy only if they remain on it for a year or more , total , during a three-year period . And even if they do , they won \u2019 t automatically be denied green cards . Other factors will be considered in assessing the likelihood that an immigrant who has used welfare extensively will be granted status . \u201d\nSome , however , argue \u201c there \u2019 s little evidence that immigrants are free-riding , and the DHS rule cedes too much discretion to bureaucrats over immigration decisions\u2026 most immigrants don \u2019 t qualify for most public benefits until they have lived in the country for at least five years . Thus DHS is directing immigration officers in the 837-page rule to project the likelihood that immigrants might someday become a \u2018 public charge \u2019 based on arbitrary levels of income , employment , education and English proficiency\u2026\n\u201c While supposedly trying to flesh out a vague statute , DHS is essentially rewriting immigration law on its own . And wouldn \u2019 t you know , the rule bears a striking resemblance to the \u2018 merit-based \u2019 system that restrictionists in the White House have proposed but can \u2019 t get Congress to pass . If this sounds like Barack Obama \u2019 s legislate-by-rule strategy on climate change , that \u2019 s because it is . \u201d\n\u201c Congress passed a law decades ago establishing that potential immigrants likely to become a \u2018 public charge \u2019 should not be permitted to enter the country . That makes some sense : A new resident should be able to add to , not detract from , the existing community \u2019 s economic resources . The problem is that Congress did not do its job and clearly establish when an aspiring immigrant meets or fails that test\u2026\n\u201c The rule announced on Monday is 837 pages long . It needed to address all the thorny issues Congress avoided and makes a roomful of contentious value judgments along the way\u2026 This is a problem inherent in what conservative lawyers call \u2018 the administrative state. \u2019 Congress passes laws that amount to mere statements of intent , avoiding the difficult choices that invite scrutiny and make enemies . It passes the buck to executive agencies , which then must make the value judgments and trade-offs via processes largely behind closed doors\u2026 Judicial oversight is no substitute for congressional abdication . Judges are not equipped to make the moral or technical judgments such laws in all but name require . \u201d\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t about race\u2026 the story of immigration to the United States has always been about people of every race , color and creed who come here to work and take advantage of American freedoms and opportunity \u2014 not a desire to take advantage of the welfare state\u2026 Even if you don \u2019 t share administration hard-liners \u2019 desire to cut back legal immigration , \u00ademphasizing merit is a common-sense concern that is supported by most Americans . Our culture is rooted in self-sufficiency and individual initiative . Our immigration system should reflect our national creed . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame .
