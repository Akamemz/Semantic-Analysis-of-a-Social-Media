    "content": "CNN joined the ranks Thursday of The Washington Post , The New York Times and other national media outlets in warning about the supposedly harmful economic effects of the RAISE Act , a Trump administration-backed bill to reduce legal immigration levels by half over a decade .\nIn a report titled \u201c Trump immigration plan to cost 4.6 million jobs , Ivy League study finds , \u201d CNN highlighted an analysis of the bill by the University of Pennsylvania \u2019 s Wharton School of Business . The Wharton study projects that by 2040 , the American economy would lose more than 4 million jobs and be 2 percent smaller under the RAISE Act than it would be under current immigration levels .\nEven assuming Wharton \u2019 s predictive model is accurate , CNN unquestioningly relies on the study \u2019 s jobs and GDP figures , and then misreads what they actually portend for the U.S. economy .\nSteve Camarota , the director of research at the Center For Immigration Studies ( CIS ) , says CNN is ignoring the fact that there will be 4.6 million fewer workers in the U.S. under the RAISE Act precisely because there will be roughly 10 million fewer immigrants . In other words , a smaller population will have fewer workers than a larger population , but that fact illustrates nothing about the the bill \u2019 s effect on the native population .\n\u201c It looks like what they \u2019 re arguing is that that the U.S. population will be somewhat smaller , and the overall GDP will be somewhat less , but all of that is absorbed by the people that don \u2019 t come , \u201d Camarota told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation . \u201c There \u2019 s nothing in there that says the existing population of native-born and legal immigrants will in any way be harmed . \u201d\n\u201c In fact , it all looks like good news because it states that the employment rate \u2014 that is the share of people with a job \u2014 is going to go up , \u201d Camarota added . \u201c They inadvertently make the case for the RAISE Act . \u201d\nAccording to the study \u2019 s authors , the domestic worker participation rate wouldn \u2019 t increase enough under the RAISE Act to fill the jobs that immigrants would have filled . That means the job market will become more favorable for native-born Americans , as CIS fellow Jason Richwine noted in a blog post Thursday .\n\u201c That suggests not only that Americans will work more under the RAISE Act , but also that the \u2018 lost jobs \u2019 will be lost not by Americans , but by the immigrants who would not arrive , \u201d Richwine wrote .\nAs for the lost economic output that results from lighter immigration , Camarota says the media \u2019 s focus on gross domestic product ( GDP ) is highly misleading .\n\u201c Adding people to the United States , as a general proposition , doesn \u2019 t raise the standard of living , \u201d Camarota explained . \u201c If it did why wouldn \u2019 t Bangladesh be richer than New Zealand ? After all , it \u2019 s got a lot more people , and its GDP is slightly larger .
