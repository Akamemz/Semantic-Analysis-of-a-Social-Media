Fifteen Republicans voted in favor of it .\nThe vote -- which was technically a vote to shut down debate on the amendment -- needed 60 senators to proceed .

At the same time it sets out a pathway to citizenship for some 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally , who would be permitted to get permanent resident green cards only once all the border changes had been put in place , about a decade after enactment of the legislation .\nSessions and other lawmakers , though , warned that the mass legalization could happen even if the border security measures were not fully implemented .\nDespite Monday 's Senate vote , the bill still faces uncertain prospects in the House , where many conservatives oppose citizenship for people in this country illegally .
