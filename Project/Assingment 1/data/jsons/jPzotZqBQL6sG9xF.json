    "content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s 448-page report is a copiously detailed chronicle of shady conduct from Donald Trump and his associates , from the campaign through to the White House .\nMueller makes clear that his investigation did not establish that there was a conspiracy between Trump associates and the Russian government to interfere with the election . And the special counsel doesn \u2019 t say one way or the other whether he thinks President Trump criminally obstructed justice while in office \u2014 though he makes clear he thinks the evidence of that is quite concerning .\n\u201c If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice , we would so state , \u201d Mueller writes . \u201c We are unable to reach such a judgment . \u201d\nThe report makes several things clear : that the Russian government tried to help Trump win , that the Trump campaign was eager to benefit from hackings targeting Democrats , that Trump \u2019 s campaign advisers had a host of ties to Russia , and that President Trump tried again and again to try to impede the Russia investigation .\nFor instance , Mueller writes that Trump \u201c repeatedly \u201d asked people associated with his campaign to \u201c find \u201d tens of thousands of emails Hillary Clinton had deleted , and that campaign adviser Michael Flynn embarked on an ( unsuccessful ) effort to do so . The special counsel also describes how Trump \u2019 s campaign manager Paul Manafort gave a Russian associate internal polling data and stressed a focus on Midwestern states . And the report \u2019 s volume on obstruction of justice lays out facts about Trump \u2019 s behavior on 11 different episodes , from FBI Director James Comey \u2019 s firing to his efforts to intimidate one-time Trump lawyer Michael Cohen .\nRelated 3 winners and 3 losers from the Mueller report\nSeveral loose ends remain . A good deal of material in the report is redacted \u2014 including , it seems , information about just what exactly happened regarding Roger Stone \u2019 s efforts to get information about hacked emails from WikiLeaks . Furthermore , an appendix to the report also lays out 14 redacted matters that are still being investigated ( two that Mueller was handling , and 12 that he referred elsewhere ) .\nBut Trump \u2019 s criminal jeopardy from the Mueller probe itself is over . And some Democrats are throwing cold water on any impeachment push based on Mueller \u2019 s findings \u2014 \u201c based on what we have seen to date , going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point , \u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told CNN Thursday .\nMueller \u2019 s Russian interference findings and his decision not to charge Trump associates with conspiracy , explained\nThe first volume of Mueller \u2019 s report focuses on the Russian effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential election , and whether any Trump associates were involved in that effort . This is popularly referred to as \u201c collusion , \u201d but Mueller writes that collusion is not a criminal term and he instead relied on conspiracy law . The volume begins by describing the two major Russian government efforts to interfere with the election .\nFirst , there was the social media propaganda operation \u2014 the \u201c troll farm , \u201d in which Russia \u2019 s Internet Research Agency ( funded by an oligarch known as \u201c Putin \u2019 s chef \u201d ) created fake online accounts that \u201c favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton , \u201d according to Mueller . The special counsel writes that his investigation has \u201c not identified evidence that any Trump Campaign official \u201d was knowingly involved in their efforts ( Mueller indicted several Russian nationals and Russia-affiliated people and organizations in February 2018 ) .\nSecond , there was what Mueller calls the \u201c Russian hacking and dumping operations. \u201d Russian intelligence officers hacked into the accounts of Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations . Some of that material was then posted online by the Russians themselves , while other material was eventually posted by WikiLeaks .\nMueller does not suggest any involvement from Trump officials in the hacking itself \u2014 but his findings about the leaks aren \u2019 t so clear . A section titled \u201c Trump Campaign and the Dissemination of Hacked Materials \u201d is heavily redacted , and appears to include information about Trump associates \u2019 discussions about WikiLeaks . ( Some of this redacted material likely relates to Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone , who faces an upcoming trial . )\nThis section also describes how , according to Michael Flynn , Trump repeatedly asked his campaign advisers to find Hillary Clinton \u2019 s deleted emails . ( This referred to tens of thousands of emails Clinton deleted rather than hand over to the government , with the justification that they were personal rather than work-related . ) Flynn in fact tried to \u201c find \u201d those emails , contacting an elderly Republican donor who tried to obtain them on the \u201c dark web. \u201d He did not succeed .\nBeyond probing whether Trump associates were involved in those two main Russian interference operations , Mueller also investigated \u201c links and contacts \u201d between Trump associates and people with ties to Russia \u2019 s government .\nPer Mueller , the idea was to look into \u201c whether those contacts constituted a third avenue \u201d of Russian influence , and into whether there was a conspiracy involving \u201c Russia providing assistance to the campaign \u201d in exchange for future \u201c favorable treatment . \u201d\nThis section of the report is more than 100 pages long and explores these , among other , topics :\nMichael Cohen \u2019 s efforts to advance a project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow , and outreach to Russian government officials about it\nGeorge Papadopoulos , a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser , getting a tip that Russia had \u201c dirt \u201d on Clinton . The tip came from a professor with ties to the Russian government .\nDonald Trump Jr. \u2019 s meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York , to try and get dirt on Hillary Clinton\nFormer Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak \u2019 s contacts with Trump advisers \u2014 including Jeff Sessions , Jared Kushner , and Michael Flynn\nPaul Manafort \u2019 s longtime Russia and Ukrainian connections , and his contacts with a Russian associate during the campaign , to whom he provided Trump campaign polling data and talked Midwestern battleground states\nTrump associate Erik Prince \u2019 s secret meeting in Seychelles with a Russian financier after the election\nIn the end , though , Mueller concluded that none of these contacts added up to \u201c an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal criminal law . \u201d\nThe special counsel also looked into whether Donald Jr. \u2019 s meeting the Russian lawyer violated campaign finance law , under the theory that it involved a request for a \u201c thing of value \u201d from a foreigner who \u2019 s not permitted to donate to a US political campaign . But Mueller concluded that the evidence he had , particularly regarding the parties \u2019 intent to violate the law , wasn \u2019 t sufficient for a likely criminal conviction .\nAn important caveat Mueller makes is that when he writes that his investigation \u201c did not establish particular facts , \u201d that \u201c does not mean that there was no evidence of those facts. \u201d But in the end , his 22-month investigation spent a great deal of time and resources probing these matters \u2014 and despite all of the shady information they turned up , they didn \u2019 t end up clearly documenting a Trump-Russia election interference conspiracy .\nThe second volume of Mueller \u2019 s report is a detailed investigation of events that potentially implicate President Trump in obstruction of justice .\nThe special counsel writes that he \u201c determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment \u201d on whether Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice . The main reason he did so was because the Justice Department has held that a sitting president can \u2019 t be indicted . \u201c We determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes , \u201d he writes .\nOddly , though , Mueller also goes out of his way to point out that he does not have \u201c confidence \u201d that Trump did not obstruct justice \u2014 and claims that , if Trump indeed \u201c clearly did not commit obstruction of justice , \u201d he would say so . The implication is that the evidence against Trump on obstruction shouldn \u2019 t be dismissed lightly ( even though Attorney General Bill Barr did end dismissing it rather lightly ) .\nThe key obstruction-related events Mueller collected facts and evidence on are :\nTrump insisted that he doubted that Russia was behind the hacking of Democrats \u2019 emails , and denied having any business in Russia even though his company was trying to build a skyscraper in Moscow . Trump tried to get FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into Michael Flynn ( but Comey didn \u2019 t do it ) . Trump tried several times to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal from oversight of the Russia investigation or to rein in the probe . Trump fired Comey . Trump directed McGahn to have Mueller himself fired ( but McGahn didn \u2019 t carry this out ) . Trump tried to prevent the disclosure of emails revealing Donald Jr. \u2019 s meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer . Trump and his legal team urged key figures in the probe ( like Paul Manafort ) not to \u201c flip \u201d and attacked those who did flip ( like Michael Cohen ) .\nMuch of this seems to be clearly aimed at trying to impede the Russia investigation . And some of the details here are very juicy indeed . For instance , an administration official \u2019 s notes describe Trump \u2019 s reaction upon learning of Mueller \u2019 s appointment : \u201c Oh my God . This is terrible . This is the end of my Presidency . I \u2019 m fucked. \u201d After that , Trump spoke to his advisers about \u201c knocking out Mueller \u201d and tried \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to have Jeff Sessions rein in the Russia investigation .\nWe also learned that , when Flynn moved toward cooperating with the government , Trump \u2019 s lawyer told Flynn \u2019 s attorney that he interpreted this as an expression of hostility toward the president and that he planned to make Trump aware of it . And that after Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were indicted , Manafort told Gates that it would be stupid to strike a plea deal , since Trump \u2019 s lawyer had made clear they \u2019 d \u201c be taken care of . \u201d\nMueller writes that the evidence doesn \u2019 t establish that all this \u201c was designed to cover up a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia \u201d \u2014 but that Trump could well have had other corrupt motives . For instance , regarding Trump \u2019 s firing of Comey , Mueller writes :\n\u201c The president had a motive to put the FBI \u2019 s Russia investigation behind him ... a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns . \u201d\nFor many of these potentially obstructive incidents , Mueller includes some analysis of what the evidence shows about the three requirements for whether something can be considered criminal obstruction of justice \u2014 whether it involves an obstructive act , whether it has a connection to a pending proceeding , and what Trump \u2019 s intent was .\nBut , throughout , Mueller avoids coming to a conclusion on whether any of these individual acts \u2014 or the combination of them \u2014 qualify as criminal obstruction of justice . He does , however , occasionally to allude that another federal government body can address the matter : \u201c We concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President \u2019 s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice . \u201d\nAnd toward the end of the document , the special counsel writes : \u201c The protection of the criminal justice system from corrupt acts by any person \u2014 including the President \u2014 accords with the fundamental principle of our government that \u2018 [ n ] o [ person ] in this country is so high that he is above the law . \u2019 \u201d",
