    "content": "Let \u2019 s hope that the era of \u2018 lead from behind \u2019 and violated red lines is over .\nFor eight years , the Obama administration misjudged Vladimir Putin \u2019 s Russia , as it misjudged most of the Middle East , China , and the rest of the world as well . Obama got wise to Russia only when Putin imperiled not just U.S. strategic interests and government records but also supposedly went so far as to tamper with sacrosanct Democratic-party secrets , thereby endangering the legacy of Barack Obama .\nPutin was probably bewildered by Obama \u2019 s media-driven and belated concern , given that the Russians , like the Chinese , had in the past hacked U.S. government documents that were far more sensitive than the information it may have mined and leaked in 2016 \u2014 and they received nothing but an occasional Obama \u201c cut it out \u201d whine . Neurotic passive-aggression doesn \u2019 t merely bother the Russians ; it apparently incites and emboldens them .\nObama \u2019 s strange approach to Putin since 2009 apparently has run something like the following . Putin surely was understandably angry with the U.S. under the cowboy imperialist George W. Bush , according to the logic of the \u201c reset. \u201d After all , Obama by 2009 was criticizing Bush more than he was Putin for the supposed ills of the world . But Barack Obama was not quite an American nationalist who sought to advance U.S. interests .\nInstead , he posed as a new sort of soft-power moralistic politician \u2014 not seen since Jimmy Carter \u2014 far more interested in rectifying the supposed damage rather than the continuing good that his country has done . If Putin by 2008 was angry at Bush for his belated pushback over Georgia , at least he was not as miffed at Bush as Obama himself was .\nReset-button policy then started with the implicit agreement that Russia and the Obama administration both had legitimate grievances against a prior U.S. president \u2014 a bizarre experience for even an old hand like Putin . ( Putin probably thought that the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq were a disaster not on ethical or even strategic grounds but because the U.S. had purportedly let the country devolve into something like what Chechnya was before Putin \u2019 s iron grip . )\nIn theory , Obama would captivate Putin with his nontraditional background and soaring rhetoric , the same way he had charmed urban progressive elites at home and Western European socialists abroad . One or two more Cairo speeches would assure Putin that a new America was more interested in confessing its past sins to the Islamic world than confronting its terrorism . And Obama would continue to show his bona fides by cancelling out Bush initiatives such as missile defense in Eastern Europe , muting criticism of Russian territorial expansionism , and tabling the updating and expansion of the American nuclear arsenal . All the while , Obama would serve occasional verbal cocktails for Putin \u2019 s delight \u2014 such as the hot-mic promise to be even \u201c more flexible \u201d after his 2012 reelection , the invitation of Russia into the Middle East to get the Obama administration off the hook from enforcing red lines over Syrian WMD use , and the theatrical scorn for Mitt Romney \u2019 s supposedly ossified Cold War\u2013era worries about Russian aggression .\nAs Putin was charmed , appeased , and supposedly brought on board , Obama increasingly felt free to enlighten him ( as he does almost everyone ) about how his new America envisioned a Westernized politically correct world . Russians naturally would not object to U.S. influence if it was reformist and cultural rather than nationalist , economic , and political \u2014 and if it sought to advance universal progressive ideals rather than strictly American agendas . Then , in its own self-interest , a grateful Russia would begin to enact at home something akin to Obama \u2019 s helpful initiatives : open up its society , with reforms modeled after those of the liberal Western states in Europe .\nPutin quickly sized up this na\u00eff . His cynicism and cunning told him that Obama was superficially magnanimous mostly out of a desire to avoid confrontations . And as a Russian , he was revolted by the otherworldly and unsolicited advice from a pampered former American academic . Putin continued to crack down at home and soon dressed up his oppression with a propagandistic anti-American worldview : America \u2019 s liberal culture reflected not freedom but license ; its global capitalism promoted cultural decadence and should not serve as anyone \u2019 s blueprint .\nPutin \u2019 \u200bs cynicism and cunning told him that Obama was superficially magnanimous mostly out of a desire to avoid confrontations .\nAs the West would pursue atheism , indulgence , and globalism , Putin would return Russia to Orthodoxy , toughness , and fervent nationalism \u2014 a czarist appeal that would resonate with other autocracies abroad and mask his own oppressions , crony profiteering , and economic mismanagement at home . Note that despite crashing oil prices and Russian economic crises , Putin believed ( much as Mussolini did ) that at least for a time , a strong leader in a weak country can exercise more global clout than a weak leader in a strong country \u2014 and that Russians could for a while longer put up with poverty and lack of freedom if they were at least feared or respected abroad . He also guessed that just as the world was finally nauseated by Woodrow Wilson \u2019 s six months of moralistic preening at Versailles , so too it would tire of the smug homilies of Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton , and John Kerry .\nPutin grew even more surprised at Obama \u2019 s periodic red lines , deadlines , and step-over lines , whose easy violations might unite global aggressors in the shared belief that America was hopelessly adrift , easy to manipulate , obnoxious in its platitudinous sermonizing , and certainly not the sort of strong-horse power that any aggressors should fear .\nPerhaps initially Putin assumed that Obama \u2019 s lead-from-behind redistributionist foreign policy ( the bookend to his \u201c you didn \u2019 t build that \u201d domestic recalibration ) was some sort of clever plot to suggest that a weak United States could be taken advantage of \u2014 and then Obama would strike hard when Putin fell for the bait and overreached . But once Putin realized that Obama was serious in his fantasies , he lost all respect for his benefactor , especially as an increasingly petulant and politically enfeebled Obama compensated by teasing Putin as a macho class cut-up \u2014 just as he had often caricatured domestic critics who failed to appreciate his godhead .\nPutin offered America \u2019 s enemies and fence-sitting opportunists a worldview that was antithetical to Obama \u2019 s .
