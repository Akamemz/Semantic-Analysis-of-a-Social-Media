Immigration advocacy groups hope to show him that there could be political consequences if he does not take steps to help overhaul the nation \u2019 s immigration system .\nAccording to the most recent census , Mr. Tipton \u2019 s district , which covers nearly the entire western half of the state as well as part of its southern border with New Mexico , is 24 percent Hispanic . Combined with the large agricultural businesses on the Western Slope , the demographic forces alone would seem to compel Mr. Tipton to support some form of immigration overhaul . President Obama won the state narrowly in both 2008 and 2012 , and Mr. Tipton won re-election last year with 53 percent of the vote .\nThis month , a coalition of immigration advocates , as well as labor and religious groups , inaugurated the \u201c Cost of Inaction , \u201d a voter education and outreach campaign that targets nine House Republicans , Mr. Tipton included , to push for a vote on an immigration overhaul before the end of the year . Though the Senate passed its own broad immigration bill in June with bipartisan support , immigration advocates have become increasingly frustrated with the House , which has made little progress on legislation of its own and is unlikely to take a vote this year .\n\u201c We feel that to move them , we have to awaken the electoral vulnerability that Republicans face , both specific Republicans that have large and growing immigrant electorates and also the party as a national party , \u201d said Tom Snyder , the immigration campaign director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , one of the groups behind the campaign . \u201c It \u2019 s very hard to think about them winning a presidential election with an immigrant electorate that \u2019 s growing and overwhelmingly hostile to the party . \u201d\nMr. Tipton said that as a former businessman , he favored a \u201c step by step \u201d approach to the problem , with smaller bills dealing with border security and a guest worker program coming first . \u201c If we \u2019 ve got border security and , in virtual tandem , a good viable guest worker program , \u201d he said , \u201c this is going to first of all address national security concerns . \u201d\nHe is also worried about the potential immigrants still in their home countries , who have been waiting , sometimes for years , to try to enter the United States through legal channels . \u201c Do we want to treat them fairly as well ? \u201d he asked . \u201c We can \u2019 t put anyone in front of them . \u201d",
