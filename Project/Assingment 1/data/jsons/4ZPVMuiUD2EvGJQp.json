    "content": "Free speech protects advocacy groups , not just individuals ranting on street corners\nThroughout the 2000s , then\u2013Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren wanted desperately to influence members of Congress . She wanted the government to enact stricter regulations on banks and home loans , and she vigorously advocated that policy . She testified before Congress , worked with a number of groups to promote her plans , and shared her perspectives with as many policymakers as possible . As she recounted in a presidential town hall this year : \u201c I was waving my arms , ringing the bell , doing everything I could . I said families are getting cheated all over this country . . . . I went everywhere I could . I talked about it to anyone who would listen \u2014 a crisis is coming . \u201d\n\u201c Anyone who would listen \u201d included members of Congress . NBC News reported that Warren \u201c bent the ear of [ then-senator ] Hillary Clinton , \u201d and by the Democratic primary campaign in 2007 Warren was \u201c lobbying candidates behind the scenes to create what would become the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . \u201d\nIn 2019 , Senator Elizabeth Warren is proposing legislation that would restrict , tax , regulate , and otherwise impede the activities of Americans who want to advocate public policies , just as she herself did ten years ago . She calls it a plan to end corruption . It won \u2019 t work ; in fact it will hurt the very people it is supposed to help , and will establish deeply rooted government bureaucrats who can shut down \u2014 or even jail \u2014 Americans who speak out or support groups that speak out . Whether or not it becomes law , the proposal offers a window into the way all too many progressives ( and even some conservatives ) approach the regulation of politics and political speech .\nSenator Warren frames her measure as an attack on the influence of the wealthy , but it is really an attack on the influence of anyone outside government . The proposed law would regulate as lobbying virtually any activity intended to influence any government action . It would tax any organization , no matter how large , that spends more than $ 500,000 per year on \u201c lobbying. \u201d Anything more than that is \u201c excessive , \u201d she writes .\nDoes that look good on paper ? It won \u2019 t in practice . For comparison \u2019 s sake , note that the federal government spent over $ 4 trillion in 2018 alone . Federal regulations impose additional costs on Americans each year amounting to trillions of dollars . Major government projects are enormously expensive : The Trump administration recently diverted $ 3.6 billion in military funds for the construction of a border wall , and that only scratches the surface of the wall \u2019 s total projected cost .\nMost Americans don \u2019 t hold a prestigious post at Harvard University and never receive an invitation to testify before Congress . They must make their voices heard by joining membership organizations , pooling their resources , and speaking as a group . Imposing a special tax on groups that spend less than 0.000012 percent of what the leviathan they \u2019 re up against spends insulates the powerful from critique and opposition , accomplishing exactly the opposite of the proposal \u2019 s anti-corruption goals .\nProgressives imagine that such a law would sap the political strength of groups such as the National Rifle Association and the Chamber of Commerce . Then they would have a better chance of passing aggressive policies on gun control and climate change . But the same law would kneecap the ACLU and Planned Parenthood . Both organizations spend over a million dollars per year on lobbying . The proposed law \u2019 s expanded definition of lobbying would also harm groups with little involvement in partisan politics , such as the American Red Cross and United Way of America .\nSenator Warren writes that \u201c the goal of these measures is straightforward : To take power away from the wealthy and the well-connected in Washington and put it back where it belongs \u2014 in the hands of the people. \u201d But what about the people who support groups such as the NRA or the ACLU \u2014 organizations with over a million members each \u2014 or any one of the thousands of groups that keep a watchful eye on the government while their members are busy living their lives ?\nWorking together , those Americans have a real voice . Will the federal bureaucracy listen to them better when their voice is reduced to a whisper ? Or will it turn to fellow bureaucrats and friendly \u201c experts \u201d \u2014 maybe university professors \u2014 to lead the way ?\nSenator Warren \u2019 s proposal tells the government to fill the gaps her plan would leave in civil society . It creates a \u201c National Public Advocate \u201d to \u201c help the public engage \u201d with the regulatory-\nrulemaking process . In the process for public comment on proposed regulations , it also would withhold any non-peer-reviewed research deemed to have \u201c conflicts of interest. \u201d What does that even mean ? Groups that file comments with regulatory agencies have no decision-making power over those agencies , which is the standard that would traditionally establish a conflict-of-interest concern . Senator Warren \u2019 s proposal appears aimed at silencing those who stand to gain or lose from a proposed regulation . Shouldn \u2019 t the government hear from people who will be affected by its actions ?\nThis gets to the fundamental flaw in Warren \u2019 s approach : It misdiagnoses the problems in our democracy . Advocacy groups are not the enemy of the people . They are the voices of the people , amplified so that government can not easily ignore them . In aiming to restrict those voices , Senator Warren \u2019 s bill would weaken our democracy to strengthen the bureaucracy . What she calls power for the people is actually power for politicians .\nTrue small- \u201c d \u201d democratic reforms would make it easier to participate in the political process . We should reduce and simplify the hundreds of pages of statutes and regulations that make up our federal campaign-finance laws . Americans should not need to consult an attorney to promote a policy idea or a campaign . This approach would put real power in the hands of the people . Maybe that \u2019 s why politicians shy away from it .\nInstead , they propose plans that would wreak havoc on constitutional rights in order to limit the ability to oppose government action . But just as the government can not tax the \u201c excessive \u201d exercise of religion , or the \u201c excessive \u201d publishing of newspaper editorials , it has no business imposing a special tax on groups that exercise their petition rights \u201c excessively. \u201d The Supreme Court has consistently struck down limits on how much private individuals and organizations can spend to promote or oppose a candidate for office . Similarly , bans on some types of lobbying and a tax on \u201c excessive lobbying \u201d are likely to face constitutional challenges . Senator Warren \u2019 s proposal also would ban lobbyists from making campaign contributions , serving as bundlers , or hosting fundraisers . Yet the First Amendment protects both the right to petition and the right to give to candidates . The government can not demand that you sacrifice one First Amendment right to exercise another .\nFar from being a bold path forward , Warren \u2019 s proposed law doubles down on the same flawed approach that has driven efforts to regulate campaign finance for nearly 50 years : regulate more activity and punish violations more harshly . This system has never worked . In fact , regulation is what has turned lobbying into a professional endeavor that average Americans by and large can \u2019 t participate in . Wealthy interests can always hire the cleverest attorneys and operatives to work through the rules to exercise influence .
