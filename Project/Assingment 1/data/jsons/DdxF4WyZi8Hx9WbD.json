    "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019 s 11th-hour campaign decision to swerve deep into right-wing territory \u2013 reversing his support for a Palestinian state and urging supporters to counter \u201c droves \u201d of Arab voters \u2013 has paid off in a stunning victory .\nHis Likud party , trailing its leftist opponents in the final polls , not only closed the gap but surged to a six-seat victory over the Zionist Camp \u2019 s 24 seats in national elections Tuesday , according to a near-complete tally Wednesday morning .\nThe clear margin will almost certainly give Mr. Netanyahu a fourth term as prime minister . And while President Reuven Rivlin called Tuesday night for the two top parties to form a national unity government , both rejected the idea .\nNetanyahu now looks much better positioned to build a right-wing nationalist government that would allow him to govern unfettered by the wide ideological differences that doomed his previous coalition .\n\u201c Dear friends , against all odds , we got a great victory for the Likud party , \u201d he said in a jubilant election night speech at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv , to chants of \u201c Bibi ! Bibi ! Bibi ! \u201d\nThe fiercely fought campaign , which just days before the election seemed headed toward a major political upheaval , was in many ways a referendum on Netanyahu . The two main campaign slogans were , \u201c Only Netanyahu \u201d and \u201c Just not Netanyahu . \u201d\nWith turnout increasing to 68.4 percent , and nearly a quarter of the votes cast for Likud , the voters \u2019 answer was clear . But the political and social cost \u2013 never mind the $ 60 million price-tag of holding elections \u2013 remains to be seen . Once the confetti settles , and Netanyahu turns to the task of actually trying to rule a deeply fractured country besieged by enemies , he will be facing many of the same challenges \u2013 but with few fresh ideas , and perhaps fewer friends .\n\u201c I was very disappointed with the fact that there was no real discussion about the issues , \u201d Speaker of the Knesset Yuli Edelstein of the Likud party told reporters Tuesday night in Tel Aviv . \u201c It was probably one of the lowest campaigns we had , and we wasted the opportunity as a country and a society , because when exactly are we going to discuss the real issues if not during an election campaign ? \u201d\nNetanyahu called early elections last fall after firing two of his coalition partners , Finance Minister Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni of the Hatnua party . He argued that he couldn \u2019 t govern effectively with such an ideological gap . One of the divisive issues was the coalition parties ' opposition to a bill that would have formally identified Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people , a move some saw as undermining its democratic nature and marginalizing the country \u2019 s 20 percent Arab population .\nAt the time , another Netanyahu victory seemed a pretty sure bet . But Ms. Livni \u2019 s decision to partner with the Labor party \u2019 s Isaac Herzog gave the prime minister a run for his money , attracting voters with their more moderate position on Palestinians as well as their commitment to socioeconomic issues . As of the final polls last Friday , they were projected to win by three to four seats .\nSo Netanyahu , widely recognized even by his foes as a shrewd politician , abruptly switched tack . After weeks of promoting himself as the only leader who could protect Israel against Iran , Hamas , and the Islamic State , he started talking about the things that were hurting Likud \u2019 s traditional blue-collar base \u2013 the skyrocketing cost of housing and groceries . He vowed to appoint as finance minister Moshe Kahlon of the Kulanu party , a former Likudnik from a humble background whose monopoly-busting policies reduced charges for cellphone plans by 90 percent .\nNetanyahu also openly cannibalized votes from estranged right-wing allies like Naftali Bennett \u2019 s Jewish Home party and Avigdor Lieberman \u2019 s Israel Beitenu . A day before the vote , he declared that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch , reneging on a 2009 pledge of support for the two-state solution to the Middle East conflict .\nThat puts him on a collision course with the Obama administration , which is already fuming over his bombastic speech to Congress two weeks ago in which he criticized a potential Iran nuclear deal . But the reversal appears to have played well with his base .\nAs early indications Tuesday showed an uptick in Israeli Arab voter turnout , Netanyahu warned his supporters that \u201c Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls , \u201d putting a right-wing government in danger if they didn \u2019 t get out of their homes and vote .\nWhen exit polls came in Tuesday night , it was clear that his tactics had paid off .

Mr. Bennett , a rising star in the last elections , had to settle for eight seats ; Mr. Lieberman was relegated to a record-low of six .
