    "content": "The US has launched its first punitive military strikes against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria since the civil war there began six years ago , a powerful message that Washington will no longer tolerate the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population .\nPresident Trump \u2019 s administration indicated that the strikes , which saw 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired at Syria \u2019 s Shayrat airbase near Homs , were linked only to the chemical weapons attack Tuesday that killed at least 86 people , including 27 children , in Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib Province .\nAnd while they may have chastened Mr. Assad , analysts say , they do not appear to signal a broader change of US policy on Syria that would pose a longer-term threat to his hold on power .\n\u201c This [ missile attack ] clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for , \u201d Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters late Thursday . `` I would not in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy or posture relative to our military activities in Syria today . There has been no change in that status . \u201d\nThose comments might offer some reassurance to Assad that the air strikes were more a slap on the wrist than the beginning of a knockout blow . And with the war in Syria slowly turning in his favor \u2013 and with his two key allies , Russia and Iran , continuing to stand by him \u2013 Assad looks likely to stay in power , a reality that Syria \u2019 s neighbors and the international community reluctantly have had to accept .\n\u201c We should not invest the limited American military attack with any strategic connotations so far , \u201d says Fawaz Gerges , a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics ( LSE ) . \u201c It \u2019 s an attack divorced from any strategic political vision . It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration has any concrete ideas to find a political solution . I \u2019 m very skeptical . \u201d\nMr. Gerges warns , however , that military action on its own , absent a strategy , is inherently hard to contain , and could lead to an unintended deepening of US military involvement if Russia and Iran redouble their support for Assad even as Syrian rebels try to use the US strikes as leverage .\n\u201c This administration is enamored with hard power , \u201d says Gerges , author of the book , \u201c ISIS : A History. \u201d But \u201c without soft power \u2013 without diplomacy , and a political strategy \u2013 military actions might be counter-productive . \u201d\nJulien Barnes-Dacey , a Middle East analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations , warns that the strikes \u2019 ability to trigger an escalation derives from the region \u2019 s very different perceptions of US military power , including fears in Syria and Iran that the ultimate objective could become regime change .\n\u201c Obviously , Trump has framed this through a narrow proliferation lens , and the attacks were very limited . But I don \u2019 t think anyone else on the ground or internationally is going to see them through that same narrow lens , \u201d says Mr. Barnes-Dacey , speaking from Brussels .\n\u201c For [ Syria \u2019 s ] opposition and its backers , there \u2019 s long been a sense that once you get US skin in the game , an escalatory cycle will quickly take over . \u201d\nWhether or not the retaliatory strikes have any impact on Assad \u2019 s hold on power , his survival after six years of war has come at an increasing cost . Assad took office in 2000 on the death of his father , Hafez , and hopes were initially invested in him as a reformer who would modernize the ossified police state he inherited .\nSeventeen years later , Assad has achieved an international pariah status unseen since the days of Iraq \u2019 s Saddam Hussein . His country has been devastated , the economy ruined , an estimated more than 400,000 people are dead , and the conflict has created the largest refugee crisis Europe has witnessed since World War II .\nHis regime controls only about 35 percent of Syria , with the rest carved up between various Arab and Kurdish militias and the extremist Islamic State group ( ISIS ) . He stands accused of employing chemical nerve agents against his own population and executing tens of thousands of people in regime prisons . Even if the war subsides and thoughts turn to rebuilding , it is difficult to see which countries or what global institutions would be willing to bankroll a multi-billion dollar reconstruction process with Assad still enthroned in the presidential palace .\n\u201c Maybe Bashar will stay for some time now , but eventually , sooner or later [ he will go ] , nothing stays the same in this region , \u201d Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said recently , speaking to a group of foreign reporters . Mr. Hariri \u2019 s father , Rafik , was assassinated in 2005 , with Assad \u2019 s Syria widely believed to have been involved .\n\u201c It would be foolish to think that this regime is still in control in Syria , \u201d Hariri adds . \u201c The people who are in control in Syria are the Russians and the Iranians . \u201d\nMoscow , meanwhile , has reacted angrily to the air strikes , calling them an \u201c aggression against a sovereign nation \u201d and announcing an end to the de-confliction mechanism set up between Washington and Moscow to prevent accidental clashes between US and Russian aircraft over Syria , where both nations fly ostensibly on \u201c anti-terror \u201d missions against ISIS .\nThe Pentagon alerted Russia before it launched the cruise missile attack , as well as NATO allies Turkey and Britain , and the Russian forces do not appear to have activated their S-300 and S-400 air defense systems , which could have intercepted some of the cruise missiles .\n\u201c There was an effort to minimize risk to third party nationals at the airport \u2013 I think you can read Russians from that .

Initial accounts of the attack suggest that aircraft and hangars were destroyed and the runway rendered inoperable .\nAssad \u2019 s real military weakness , however , is not a lack of aircraft but insufficient ground forces to battle rebel groups , which is why his regime has had to rely on allies such as Iran , Lebanon \u2019 s Hezbollah , and Shiite paramilitary forces from Iraq and Afghanistan .
