It is important to distinguish between information that is intentionally wrong , satirical or not entirely factual , and information that is factual but is being described as \u201c fake \u201d in order to dissuade people from believing it .\nWhat is unique about the digital media environment that allows fake news to spread so widely ?\nLeslin Charles : I would focus on four main areas . First , there is the blurring of satire and real news . Second , bots can mislead users to give credibility to a story because many people are talking about it . Third , algorithms filter news based on a user \u2019 s profile and online activity . It is like a Netflix queue \u2013 it gives you what it thinks you \u2019 ll like . Fourth , there is the clickbait economy . For example , Macedonia is a country that has a fake news industry with the United States as the main consumer of the information . People get up to go to work to write fake news for our consumption .\nWhat responsibility do social media platforms like Facebook have in combating the spread of fake news ? Are they currently doing enough ?\nKatie Elson Anderson : While many platforms claim that they are doing their best , their actions do not support their statements . Both AI and human moderators have their challenges , and there are numerous examples of good information being taken down and bad information continuing to spread . The decisions being made \u2013 such as Facebook \u2019 s decision to use a questionable source in their fact-checking \u2013 prove to me that they are less interested in stopping the flow of bad information than they are in their profit and corporate relationships .\nRoberta Tipton : One good strategy is to actually use diverse and reliable alternatives for obtaining your news . Everything online looks the same \u2013 a well-designed fake site looks as good as a legitimate news site . The key to detecting a false narrative is to look in legitimate places for verification .\nKatie Elson Anderson : An excellent strategy is to ask questions and take the time to answer them . Some of these are easy to answer , such as the date of the article or whether the author has written about this topic in other places . Other questions are harder to answer and include knowing about the source , tracking how the information has moved through different media platforms , verifying images and understanding any biases .\nWhat tools are available to help us identify fake news or build skills to find credible information ?\nKatie Elson Anderson : Sites such as Snopes.com , Leadstories.com , Politifact.com and Factcheck.org can be used to double-check the accuracy of a specific story . Sites like Allsides.com and mediabiasfactcheck.com can be useful in seeing and understanding the biases in reporting , which is an important strategy for identifying how facts and nonfacts are presented .\nWhat can we do as individuals to prevent the spread of fake news ?\nLeslin Charles : Stop to think if it is too sensational , rather than impulsively forwarding information . Remember that a false story is more likely to go viral than a true one .\nRoberta Tipton : Be aware that by reading or listening only to online media that you have selected , you are narrowing your perspective and making yourself more vulnerable to false narratives . Try to read or listen a bit more widely .\nKatie Elson Anderson : When we identify it , we should take the opportunity to educate others . It is not enough to just not spread it ourselves \u2013 we must take the extra steps to help others identify it and empower everyone to speak up when they see it .\nWhy is it important to be aware of fake news and how it is used , especially in an election year ?\nRoberta Tipton : Regimes around the world would like to see a divided and unsuccessful United States for their own reasons \u2013 political and economic . Fake news is a focused strategy for destabilizing the American electorate .\nLeslin Charles : We all want to be in control of our decisions .
