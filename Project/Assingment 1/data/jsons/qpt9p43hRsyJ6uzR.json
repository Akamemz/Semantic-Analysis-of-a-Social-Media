If so , welcome to the dilemmas surrounding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act .\nThere has been speculation about whether President Donald Trump and his real estate operations abroad might be guilty of FCPA violations -- a cause for concern -- but at the same time the federal government can use the FCPA to threaten executives with prison terms of up to 20 years .

That is more than just a few bad apples crossing a line . They also estimate that the chance of an enforcement action against a violation company is only 6.4 percent . So most get away with it . To make the bribes unprofitable , it would be necessary to increase average penalties by a factor of 8.3 , or more than 22 times their average historical level . That \u2019 s probably not going to happen , and in any case it would raise the number of mistaken and ambiguous cases , raise the costs of doing business abroad , and , more hypothetically , raise the risk of using the FCPA to punish executives who are out of political favor . To worry about political bias , you don \u2019 t have to think that regulators or the executive branch sit around deliberately targeting enemies as Richard Nixon did . There is so much discretion in enforcement of this law that favorable treatment for the well-connected will , whether intended or not , create pretty much the same result of differentially punishing critics and nonsupporters .\nLike it or not , this law is not going away -- and there are some good reasons to have it . The U.S. has been the world leader in taking on corruption , and we shouldn \u2019 t give up that position without a fight .
