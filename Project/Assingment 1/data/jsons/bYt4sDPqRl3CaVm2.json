He opposed the war in Iraq \u2014 and can expose Trump \u2019 s broken promise to end the forever wars .

We win when we bring the working class and the middle class together , when we stand for diversity against division , for the poor against greed . No candidate has done more to forge that coalition than Bernie Sanders .\nDr. Martin Luther King would be proud that African American voters are called the \u201c black firewall \u201d in the 2020 campaign . He would ask a simple question : What will be the return on the firewall \u2019 s investment ?\nWith the exception of Native Americans , African Americans are the people suffering the greatest social and economic distress in the United States . Our needs are not moderate . The most progressive social and economic path gives us the best chance to catch up and Sanders represents that path .\nBiden is a decent man , but he has a different record . We said no to Clarence Thomas , he said yes . We said no to the Crime Bill , he championed it . We said no to the Iraq War , he cheered it on . We favored affirmative action , he sought to limit it .\nBiden has done well among African American voters largely because he is seen as connected to Barack Obama . Yet he was placed on the ticket to balance it , not to enhance it . Biden has offered no vision and no bold reforms . He offers safe haven and moderation .\nBut his moderation does little to address the pain of African Americans , or of working people generally .
