    "content": "In the homestretch of a presidential race where every minute shift in the economy can translate into potential votes , both campaigns took aim Friday at the Labor Department 's estimate that the jobless rate fell below 8 percent for the first time in nearly four years .\nPresident Obama 's team touted the numbers as a sign the economy is improving . Mitt Romney , along with several economists , expressed deep skepticism about the report .\nThe data even elicited a conspiracy theory from former General Electric CEO Jack Welch , who tweeted : `` Unbelievable jobs numbers .. these Chicago guys will do anything .. ca n't debate so change numbers . ''\nThe Labor Department reported that the rate dipped in September from 8.1 percent to 7.8 percent . It was a glimmer of good news for Obama , who 's trying to recover from a disappointing debate performance and whose central argument is that the economy is moving in the right direction .\n`` This morning , we found out that the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since I took office , '' Obama said at a Virginia rally Friday . `` It 's a reminder that this country has come too far to turn back now . ... We 've made too much progress to return to the policies that led to the crisis in the first place . ''\nBut skeptics pointed out that not only is 7.8 percent unemployment hardly a `` real recovery , '' but the report reflected an uptick in part-time jobs and the number of self-employed . Further , they stressed that there appeared to be a huge disconnect between the modest number of new jobs reported and the significant decrease in the unemployment rate .\nThe Labor Department , based on a broad survey of employers , said 114,000 jobs were added in September .\nBut the unemployment rate itself is based on a separate `` household survey , '' which showed a whopping 873,000 new jobs in September .\n`` This must be an anomaly , '' former Congressional Budget Office director Doug Holtz-Eakin said in a snap analysis of the numbers . `` It is out of line with any of the other data .. ''\nHoltz-Eakin noted the household survey is smaller , suggesting it is not as reliable . He called estimate of 873,000 new jobs `` implausible . ''\nHe said the report was otherwise `` solid , '' but reflected `` the economy is merely moving sideways . ''\nLiberal economist Dean Baker , with the Center for Economic and Policy Research , called the September rate drop `` almost certainly a statistical fluke . ''\n`` It is common to have large monthly changes in the employment numbers that are not consistent with other economic data . For example , employment reportedly rose by 649,000 in November of 2007 , the month before the recession began , '' he said in a statement . `` Still , this month 's numbers almost certainly indicate that the unemployment rate is moving downward , even if the speed is considerably slower than the latest data indicate . ''\nRomney 's campaign quickly pointed out the number of people who have left the workforce has also helped keep the jobless rate down .\n`` This is not what a real recovery looks like . We created fewer jobs in September than in August , and fewer jobs in August than in July , and we 've lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs since President Obama took office , '' Romney said in a statement . `` If not for all the people who have simply dropped out of the labor force , the real unemployment rate would be closer to 11 percent . ''\nThe recovery has been tepid , but the president is trying to show that it 's at least improving . The Labor Department report showed the economy created 86,000 more jobs in July and August than first estimated . Wages rose in September and more people started looking for work .\nThe revisions also show employers added 146,000 jobs per month from July through September , up from 67,000 in the previous three months . Still , the 2012 average of 146,000 jobs per month remains lower than last year 's average of 153,000 jobs per month .\nThe monthly numbers are subject to change . Voters will see one final jobless report on Nov. 2 , just days before the election .\nThe increase in September was due in part to employment growth in the health care and transportation sectors . The unemployment rate fell from 8.1 percent in August , matching its level in January 2009 , when Obama took office .\nThe decline could help Obama , who is coming off a disappointing debate performance against Romney . Stock futures rose modestly after the report . Dow Jones industrial average futures , up 30 points just before the report came out , were up 45 points after it was released .\nThe job market has been improving , sluggishly but steadily . Jobs have been added for 24 straight months . There are now 325,000 more than when Obama took office .\nStill , many of the jobs added last month were part time .
