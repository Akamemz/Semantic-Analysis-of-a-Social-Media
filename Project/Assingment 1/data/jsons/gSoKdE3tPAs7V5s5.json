From drag queens to VSCO girls\n\nTwo new language features\u2014\u201csksksk\u201d and \u201cand I oop\u201d\u2014are often talked about together. That\u2019s because VSCO girls\u2014largely white, teenage, middle class girls who promote a certain style and aesthetic on social media\u2014have popularized their use.\n\nThe first, \u201csksksk,\u201d is a popular keysmash, representing someone furiously hitting the \u201cS\u201d and \u201cK\u201d keys back and forth.\n\nIt can mean laughter, excitement or nervousness.
