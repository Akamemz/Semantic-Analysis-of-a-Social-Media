    "content": "The Obama administration promised to have the Obamacare website working smoothly by Saturday , but even President Obama knows this latest deadline is another target that his team is likely to miss .\nOnly about 25,000 Americans were able to enroll on the federal government \u2019 s HealthCare.gov website in October , when most people instead encountered computer errors . And although Mr. Obama and his top advisers vowed to fix the problems by the end of November , they have retreated from that pledge in favor of a scaled-back promise by Health and Human Service Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that the website will be working for \u201c most users \u201d by Saturday \u2019 s deadline .\nThis week , administration officials acknowledged they are holding back on a marketing campaign for the program because they don \u2019 t want too many users to visit the flawed site . And HHS also revealed this week that the Spanish-language version of HealthCare.gov still isn \u2019 t ready to enroll people ; HHS is postponing that service again until sometime in December .\nThe administration also Wednesday announced another major delay , putting off by one year the online program that lets small businesses shop for plans through the federal Obamacare marketplace .\nThe developments are the latest in a series of downsized goals , broken promises and delays for Obamacare since the program became law of the land in 2010 . If there has been a hallmark of Obamacare so far , it has been watching Mr. Obama \u2019 s optimistic assurances crumble later under the weight of reality .\n\u201c The administration completely oversold what it was going to be , in terms of all dessert and no spinach , \u201d said Paul Howard , a specialist on health-care policy at the nonprofit Manhattan Institute .\nThroughout the president \u2019 s re-election campaign in 2012 , Mr. Obama trumpeted the signature achievement of his first term and told voters that he was trustworthy above all else .\n\u201c You do want to be able to trust your president , \u201d Mr. Obama told supporters in Ohio a few days before Election Day . \u201c You want to know that your president means what he says , and says what he means . And after four years as president , you know me . You know where I stand . You know I tell the truth . \u201d\nThose words stand in stark contrast to Mr. Obama \u2019 s now-infamous broken pledge , repeatedly made without qualification , that \u201c if you like your health-insurance plan , you can keep your plan. \u201d By last month , with more than 3.5 million people being forced out of their old insurance policies by Obamacare , the president admitted that his promise wasn \u2019 t true for many people .\nBehind the scenes , he reportedly berated his staff for allowing him to boast in public that buying health insurance would be as easy as shopping on Amazon.com .\nIn an interview with Barbara Walters to be broadcast Friday night on ABC \u2019 s \u201c 20/20 \u201d show , Mr. Obama said his team is looking into why he was kept in the dark about the website \u2019 s problems .\n\u201c We \u2019 re evaluating why it is exactly that I didn \u2019 t know soon enough that [ it ] wasn \u2019 t going to work the way it needed to , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c But my priority now has been to just make sure that it works . \u201d\nBut even the president \u2019 s apology was a bit of misdirection . Mr. Obama knew as early as February 2010 , one month before he signed the law , that millions of Americans wouldn \u2019 t be able to keep their health insurance .\nAt a health care summit with congressional Republicans at Blair House on Feb. 25 , 2010 , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , Virginia Republican , who was House minority whip at the time , voiced concern to the president that \u201c between eight million and nine million people may very well lose the coverage that they have because of the construct of this bill . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think you can answer the question in the positive to say that people will be able to maintain their coverage , people will be able to see the doctors they want , in the kind of bill that you are proposing , \u201d Mr. Cantor told Mr. Obama .\nThe president replied that a relatively small portion of the population would be affected , and they would be better off under Obamacare .\nMr. Obama told Mr. Cantor , \u201c The eight to nine million people you refer to that might have to change their coverage \u2014 keep in mind out of the 300 million Americans that we are talking about \u2014 would be folks who the Congressional Budget Office estimates would find the deal in the exchange better . So , yes , they would change coverage because they got more choice and competition . \u201d\nThose promises , Mr. Howard said , \u201c were papered over \u201d later with regulations requiring more expensive coverage for many .\n\u201c The administration had to require tight grandfathering of current plans to move people into the exchanges , which means cancellations , \u201d Mr. Howard said .\nWithin six months of his second inauguration , Mr. Obama had broken his own law , delaying the crucial employer mandate portion of Obamacare by a full year until 2015 . The administration cited confusion by businesses about how to report employee insurance information to the Internal Revenue Service .\nThe president told supporters in Southern California this week that he \u2019 ll never back down from making sure the law works .\n\u201c We are going to continue to implement the health care law , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c The product is good . People want it . And we should not live in a country where people are going bankrupt just because they get sick . And anybody who is going to keep on pushing against that , they will meet my resistance , because I am willing to fix any problems that there are , but I \u2019 m not going to abandon people to make sure that they \u2019 ve got health insurance in this country . \u201d\nWith the faulty website preventing many people from enrolling , health care analysts say the next problem for Obamacare could be the failure to bring young , healthy people into the program . Obamacare needs people who don \u2019 t require much medical care to still be paying premiums , to offset the costs of older , sicker people who place greater demands on the system .\n\u201c They have assumed wrongly that the plans they \u2019 re trying to sell through the exchanges are going to be attractive to relatively healthy Americans , \u201d said James Capretta , a public policy specialist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute . \u201c I just think that \u2019 s wrong . Lots of people are going to end up not buying those plans . Mainly it \u2019 s going to be an attractive place for people who have existing health problems . It \u2019 s going to become essentially a program for relatively less healthy people . \u201d\nMr. Howard predicted the trend will create more problems for the program , financial and political , in 2014 as congressional mid-term elections near .\n\u201c If the picture doesn \u2019 t improve in terms of getting these young and healthy people to enroll and it stays skewed , you \u2019 re looking at a cycle where we \u2019 re going to have more expensive rate increases for 2015 , \u201d Mr. Howard said . \u201c The government can push back [ against insurers ] and say the rates need to be lower , but the insurers can say \u2018 We \u2019 ll walk. \u2019 That \u2019 s the real tension here . \u201d\nAs this happens , the premiums for everybody in the system then have to increase , which makes buying insurance an even less rational act for a healthy person , which means even fewer will sign up , and on and on \u2014 a phenomenon analysts of insurance markets refer to as the \u201c death spiral . \u201d\n\u201c The expectation was that there would be a big pool of really healthy people offsetting a relatively smaller pool of more expensive patients . If that doesn \u2019 t play out , then the exchanges are looking at a problem in terms of affordability , a very serious problem , \u201d Mr. Howard said .\nWhile the Obama administration is saying the website is getting better , the problems might also be preventing younger , healthier consumers from finding out how truly expensive their coverage would be .\n\u201c Right now , people haven \u2019 t been able to really shop effectively , \u201d Mr. Howard said . \u201c A lot of these plans are going to be very narrow networks and come with high deductibles . Except for a few states you can purchase a plan and not really understand what kind of physician and hospital coverage you \u2019 re going to get . And then I would expect lots of stories to start popping up after January when people start to use the coverage and hearing complaints that they can \u2019 t see the doctor they want . \u201d\nAdministration officials say the website should be able to handle 50,000 users simultaneously by Friday , citing steady improvement in the speed of the site . By last week , the average load time for the website \u2019 s pages was less than one second , down from October \u2019 s time of eight seconds , according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services .\nJeffrey Zients , who was tapped by Mr. Obama to troubleshoot the problems with the website , has warned that Saturday \u2019 s deadline will not be \u201c a magic moment \u201d for the site .
