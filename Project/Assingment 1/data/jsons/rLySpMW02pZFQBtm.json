Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : In one of his final acts in office , President Obama shortened the sentences of 209 prisoners , pardoned 64 individuals on Tuesday . The list included Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning , longtime imprisoned Puerto Rican independence activist Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera and retired U.S. Marine Corps General James Cartwright . But missing from the list is 71-year-old Native American activist Leonard Peltier .\nLater in the program , we \u2019 ll look at the cases of Peltier and Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera , but first to Chelsea Manning , who \u2019 s now set to be free May 17th , after Obama shortened her sentence from 35 years to seven . According to her attorneys , she is already the longest-held whistleblower in U.S. history . She \u2019 s been in military custody since May 2010 . Manning leaked more than 700,000 classified files and videos to WikiLeaks about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. foreign policy . She \u2019 s been subjected to long stretches of solitary confinement and denied medical treatment related to her gender identity . Chelsea Manning attempted to commit suicide twice last year .\nJoining us now are two of her attorneys . Nancy Hollander is Manning \u2019 s appellate attorney . Chase Strangio of the ACLU represents Manning in a lawsuit against the Pentagon for denial of medical care related to her gender dysphoria .

Chase Strangio , your response to what President Obama did yesterday ?\nCHASE STRANGIO : Well , I just\u2014I first want to thank you and everyone who supported Chelsea over the years . The reality is that this was a mass mobilization effort , keeping her story alive , led by Chelsea herself and all of the people who made sure that nobody forgot the justice that she fought for and the incredible symbol of democratic principles and advocacy that she really embodies . Yesterday was an incredible day for us who care about her . As I \u2019 ve said time and time again , President Obama really had her life in his hands .

It \u2019 s quite unusual for the individual to not be informed of their commutation with their attorneys . But we know that , you know , she was on standby , waiting for this . I spoke with her yesterday around 2:00 p.m. , and she was just her sort of hopeful , pragmatic self , waiting for news . And we were all hoping and praying with her . So , hopefully , today we \u2019 ll connect with her and get to share in this incredible moment that really did save her life .\nCHASE STRANGIO : Yeah , absolutely .
