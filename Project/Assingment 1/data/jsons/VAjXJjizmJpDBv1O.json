    "content": "Lindsey : I was always also super interested in politics . Real talk : I went to University of Oklahoma . I was very pragmatically a Republican at times , just because [ if you want to ] enter politics in the South , it \u2019 s much easier on the Republican side . My parents were always very socially liberal , and fiscally conservative . They were Reagan Republicans . Full disclosure : I am no longer a registered Republican , but that doesn \u2019 t mean my views have shifted . I just think the party has shifted away from something I am comfortable supporting .\nAnnie : For me , that was probably my first time interacting with someone who I respected but disagreed with . This was obviously before Donald Trump , so it was kind of a different time . But I think I have a very similar relationship with the Democratic Party that Lindsey does with the Republican Party , because of my family . [ I understood ] Lindsey \u2019 s relationship with the Republican Party was valid both because she believed in some of those values and also because of what it meant to her family . [ Family ] is an important part of politics , and that is okay .\nLindsey : My first interaction with feminism was when Annie and I were interning in D.C. together one summer in college . I remember watching something on TV and saying , \u201c I feel like feminism is weird , \u201d and Annie was like , \u201c No , Lindsey , feminism is really important , \u201d and she sat me down and she explained it to me .\nLindsey : I had the wrong idea about what feminism was . I thought that feminism was about coddling women , giving women opportunities that they maybe didn \u2019 t deserve just because they were women . I don \u2019 t think I realized the extent to which the playing field was not level . I think for a very long time , especially in the environment that I was in , I really thought that my job was to be a pretty girl , a nice , quiet girl , and not take up that much space . To get complimented .\nAnnie taught me to understand that certain things about the way that I was being treated weren \u2019 t acceptable . I really thought it was just a given that I got my ass slapped in an office . Annie was the first one to say , \u201c Lindsey , you need feminism because you shouldn \u2019 t be treated by people like that. \u201d Obviously , it was not just through one conversation , but through affirmation from Annie and from people I \u2019 ve worked with . I was really able to find myself and realize I deserve to take up space . I have so much more to offer than being a pretty girl in an office . I need feminism in order for people to see me that way and for me to see myself that way . That \u2019 s my feminist journey .\nAnnie : It \u2019 s funny you say that , because , before Lindsey , I had never met somebody so secure in their womanhood . I know we were teenagers , so at times you weren \u2019 t , but it always seemed like Lindsey was 100 percent confident in her body , and comfortable with her sexuality at a really young age , in a way that I was not at all . Lindsey really taught me that is not something to be ashamed of . Your body is your body ; it is really powerful and amazing , and we should be able to show it off or cover it up however we want , whenever we want . She has definitely made me more comfortable wearing things that I feel really good in , that I feel really sexy in . She was like , No , I am fucking powerful in the way that I look .",
