    "content": "The American public may soon learn more about the medical records of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , with both campaigns saying they 'll release more information in days ahead .\nThe news comes amid increased scrutiny over Clinton 's health after the Democratic nominee nearly collapsed at a 9/11 memorial ceremony Sunday .\nAfter taking refuge at her daughter Chelsea 's Manhattan apartment , she later emerged , telling reporters , `` I 'm feeling great . It 's a beautiful day in New York . ''\nAfter that health scare , her campaign has revealed a pneumonia diagnosis that Clinton apparently received last Friday . Clinton told CNN Monday night that she did n't disclose the news sooner because she did n't think it was going to be that big a deal .\nBut it quickly turned into a very big deal , raising questions about a lack of transparency . Even Democratic allies , like former Obama adviser David Axelrod , are criticizing the campaign , tweeting about an `` unhealthy penchant for privacy . ''\nWith Clinton critics wondering if there 's more to her health problems than she 's revealing , the campaign has promised to release more medical records this week .\nAccording to an informal survey by the non-partisan , but politically conservative Association of American Physicians and Surgeons , more than 70 percent of doctors polled say concerns about Clinton 's health are `` serious -- could be disqualifying for the position of president of the U.S . ''\nAround 20 percent of the 250 physicians surveyed said concerns were `` likely overblown , but should be addressed as with full release of medical records . ''\nThe survey also showed more than 78 percent of the doctors polled said there was `` not enough emphasis '' on her health on the part of the media . More than 11 percent said the coverage was `` about right , '' and nearly 3 percent said the media had given the issue `` too much emphasis . ''\n`` I think it 's pretty surprising that anybody felt there was 'too much emphasis , ' '' Dr. Jane Orient , executive director of AAPS , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News . `` In fact there was hardly any emphasis at all until we sent out a poll of these physicians , and then , the response was not , 'Well , these other physicians disagree with you . ' It was , 'Well , you must just be a bunch of conspiracy theorists . There 's nothing there . ' ''\n`` But I 'm afraid that those people had a little bit of enlightening on this weekend , '' she continued .\nOrient said a candidate 's health is not just a matter of a president making it through the term , but whether that person can do the job .\nShe cited Clinton aide Huma Abedin 's email sent in 2013 in which she states Clinton is `` often confused . '' According to The Hill , that email was sent soon after Clinton was treated for a blood clot in her head found after she suffered a concussion weeks before .\nOrient also claims Clinton told the FBI she could not remember some security briefings because of her concussion .\nAn FBI report reads , `` ... in December of 2012 , Clinton suffered a concussion and then around the New Year had a blood clot . Based on her doctor 's advice , she could only work at State for a few hours a day and could not recall every briefing she received . ''\nAccording to both The Washington Post and The Hill , it 's not clear in that report if Clinton actually told the FBI the concussion was the reason why she could not remember certain briefings .\nMeanwhile , Trump told ABC he will release more of his medical history as well . Right now , however , his campaign 's laser focus is on comments Clinton made Friday night about supporters of the GOP nominee .\n`` You know , to just be grossly generalist about it , you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call 'the basket of deplorables , ' '' she said . `` Racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamaphobic , you name it . ''\nTrump now has a TV ad denouncing that comment , and he 's playing it up on the campaign trail .\n`` She divides people into baskets as though they were objects , not human beings -- carpenters and welders , the young and the old and millions of working-class families who just want a better future , '' Trump told supporters at a campaign rally .\nAt a North Carolina rally , he invited his supporters to offer their own replies to her as well .\n`` Do I look deplorable ? '' one Trump supporter said . `` No ! I am a wife , mother . I work full time . ''\nAs the race tightens , Clinton 's health issues and `` deplorable '' comments may be detrimental to her campaign .
