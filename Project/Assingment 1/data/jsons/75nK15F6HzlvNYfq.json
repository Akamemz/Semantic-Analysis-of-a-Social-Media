    "content": "Judge Jane Kelly , now being vetted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a potential Supreme Court nominee , has emerged as a leading contender to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia .\nKelly may have the best chance of any nominee : she was confirmed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2013 by a 96-0 vote ; she is from Iowa , home state of Republican Charles Grassley , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chair ; and Grassley himself has praised her effusively in the past . All that may make it harder for Grassley to honor his pledge not to hold hearings on a potential Supreme Court Justice , in defiance of custom and constitutional law .\nThere \u2019 s not much to go on . Prior to becoming a judge , Jane Kelly served as a public defender for 17 years , which afforded few opportunities for making public statements on the finer points of jurisprudence .\nBut she has been an appellate court judge for the past three years , and during that time has written 82 opinions for the court . Over the past week , I have read and reviewed all of them . And what emerges is , as her reputation suggests , a moderate , thoughtful jurist without ideological biases , though with a slight tilt to the conservative side of some issues .\nNow , a word of caution : These opinions only give hints . In 80 of the 82 cases , Judge Kelly was writing for a unanimous three-judge panel , not simply for herself . Often , such opinions represent a consensus view more than an individual one : The rhetoric and scope of opinions are often adjusted to gain the assent of colleagues .\nMoreover , about half of the 82 cases are garden variety criminal appeals , contract disputes , insurance claims , and the other mundane cases that make up the bulk of an appellate court \u2019 s workload . ( There \u2019 s a rent dispute involving Smuckers , a former salesman suing Farmers Insurance . ) Most of this has nothing to do with the contentious issues to which Supreme Court watchers pay attention\u2014indeed , that \u2019 s even true of the Supreme Court itself .\nFirst , the overwhelming majority of criminal appeals that Judge Kelly wrote the opinions for were rejected . This does not necessarily mean Judge Kelly is \u201c tough on crime. \u201d The national reversal rate for criminal appeals is only 7 percent , which makes sense , given the heightened standards of review at the appellate level . It does suggest that Judge Kelly is not disproportionately disposed toward criminal defendants as a result of having been a career public defender .\nStill , there were some close cases that did suggest a \u201c tough on crime \u201d perspective . For example , in U.S. v. Axsom , the Eighth Circuit affirmed a 15-year-jail sentence for a child pornography conviction stemming solely from 15 images traded on Limewire ( a peer-to-peer technology where batches of files may be shared without an individual \u2019 s knowledge of what \u2019 s inside ) .\nIn another child porn case , the court affirmed conviction even though the state showed five minutes \u2019 worth of images to the jury , an act which had no evidentiary value but likely disgusted and prejudiced the jurors . It \u2019 s easy to imagine these two cases going the other way under a more liberal judge .\nWhen it comes to police conduct , Judge Kelly again appears to be a centrist . Most of her Fourth Amendment opinions ( US v. Meidel , Fagnan v. Lino Lakes , Greenman v. Jessen , US v. Guevara , Yang v. Roy , US v. Thompson ) find for the police and against defendants complaining of unconstitutional search or seizure . Again , that is usually the case .\nIn Peterson v. Kopp , Judge Kelly wrote an opinion granting immunity to an arresting officer for most of his actions , but not for pepper-spraying a defendant who asked to see his badge . That , Judge Kelly wrote , was a First Amendment violation . And in Ziesmer v. Hagen , the appeals court overturned a lower court opinion and allowed a police officer to be sued for injuring someone pulled over at a roadside stop , in an arrest that led to no criminal charges . In these cases , one might imagine a more conservative judge siding with police .\nWhen it comes to hot-button issues that would come up in nomination hearings , Judge Kelly \u2019 s record is also right up the middle .\nIn Jackson v. Nixon , Judge Kelly wrote a 2-1 opinion upholding an atheist prisoner \u2019 s claim that being effectively forced to participate in an Alcoholics Anonymous-like substance abuse program violated his First Amendment rights to be free from religious coercion . ( A similar appeal from a Native American objecting to a 12-step program was rejected , but mostly on procedural grounds . )\nThis could be read in several ways . Though the petitioner is an atheist , this is actually a conservative-style , pro-religious-liberty holding , not unlike the recent Supreme Court case of Holt v. Hobbs , which required an Arkansas prison to let a Muslim prisoner grow a half-inch-long beard . In terms of the current debates over religious liberty and civil rights laws , Jackson is on the side of individual religious liberty ( here , to be free of religious coercion ) over a particular public policy ( in this case , the rehab program ) .\nOn the other hand , affirming an atheist \u2019 s First Amendment rights to be free from the relatively anodyne spirituality of 12-step programs could also be read as extremely liberal . Is the program \u2019 s suggestion to substitute \u201c Good Orderly Direction \u201d for the word \u201c God \u201d really religious coercion ? Whether Jackson is a conservative or liberal opinion depends on how you look at it .\nOn another hot-button issue , immigration , Judge Kelly wrote eight opinions on deportation appeals , affirming seven of them . While , again , standards of review favor upholding the decisions of immigration officials , no one could argue that Judge Kelly is soft on illegal immigration . She affirmed the deportation of a former child slave from Mexico , a Chinese woman fearing reprisal for having three children , and a victim of gang violence ( PDF ) .\nOf the eight deportation appeals , the only one Judge Kelly wrote to remand was from an individual who had the help of a fraudulent assistant ( PDF ) . Here , Judge Kelly wrote , the entire application should not have been dismissed simply because the preparer was a liar .\nFinally , Judge Kelly wrote a contentious 2-1 opinion in the case of US v. Fast Horse ( the Eighth Circuit has jurisdiction over several Native American lands ) . In that case , Judge Kelly reversed a conviction for sexual assault , because the defendant may not have known that his victim couldn \u2019 t consent . Judge Steven Colloton filed an angry dissent .\nEven here , however , the tea leaves can be read in opposing ways . On the one hand , this is an opinion that makes it harder for women to prevail against sexual predators , which might anger some liberals . On the other hand , it sides with a criminal defendant over the state , which might anger some conservatives .\nPerhaps most notably , Fast Horse relied on a particular ( and controversial ) Eighth Circuit precedent regarding the intent necessary to prove a rape claim : that the defendant must know the victim did not , or could not , consent . ( The dissent attacked this court for \u201c vacat [ ing ] yet another conviction of a sexual aggressor who engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman who was passed out or asleep. \u201d ) This is interesting because judicial nominees often use pat phrases like \u201c I would follow Supreme Court precedent \u201d to avoid answering questions about abortion . Here , however , is an appellate judge actually doing it : applying a precedent which some might find dubious , because it is the controlling law in the case .\nNow , that could apply to Roe v. Wade but also to Citizens United . Which , finally , is the point . Over the course of 82 opinions , Judge Kelly emerges as a thoughtful centrist who would disappoint ideologues on the left and the right . There is no consistent bias in her opinions , and the fact that they may be read in multiple ways attests ( for better or for worse ) to their centrism .\nContrary to Ted Cruz \u2019 s outrageous statement at last night \u2019 s GOP debate that anyone Harry Reid supports must be a constitutional liberal , Judge Kelly \u2019 s record , to the extent it can be interpreted , suggests judicial moderation .
