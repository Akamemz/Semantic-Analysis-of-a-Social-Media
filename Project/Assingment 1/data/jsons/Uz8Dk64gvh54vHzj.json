The Saturday rally , with a roughly 60 percent white crowd , opened with a performance from a local youth gospel choir and marching band .

Mr. Biden and his wife , Jill , are set to attend a private fund-raiser in Columbia on Saturday evening , and a church service in West Columbia on Sunday morning .\nMissing from his speech were two high-profile elements in Mr. Biden \u2019 s career that are sure to follow him throughout the campaign and that could complicate his cozy relationship with black voters . This year Mr. Biden expressed regret for the crime and criminal justice legislation he championed in the early 1990s , saying it resulted in unequal sentencing and burdened black communities .
