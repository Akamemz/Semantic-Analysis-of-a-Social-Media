    "content": "National Security Adviser-designate John Bolton \u2019 s long record of tough talk could give President Trump some much-needed rhetorical back-up in difficult upcoming negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , some security policy watchers say , even as critics warn Mr. Bolton \u2019 s appointment could undermine the delicate , multilateral diplomacy needed to strike a deal with Pyongyang .\nWhile outgoing White House national security chief H.R . McMaster was widely seen as a brake on Mr. Trump \u2019 s policies and rhetoric in confronting the North \u2019 s nuclear weapons build-up , the hawkish Mr. Bolton will likely reinforce Mr. Trump \u2019 s own inclinations to present a tough face to Mr. Kim .\n\u201c John Bolton is a brilliant iconoclast thinker who intuitively understands how to deal with dictators , including Chairman Kim , \u201d said Michael Pillsbury , the Mandarin-speaking conservative intellectual who advised Mr. Trump \u2019 s transition team and has worked with nearly every U.S. administration since Richard Nixon .\nMr. Pillsbury , a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington , said that if Mr. Kim \u2019 s recent offer to halt nuclear weapons and missile testing while direct talks with South Korea and the U.S. turns out to be legitimate , it would represent a \u201c stunning victory \u201d for hardliners like Mr. Bolton , who as recently as February argued pre-emptive airstrikes were justified if the U.S. faced an imminent threat from North Korea \u2019 s military programs .\n\u201c Like President Trump , John Bolton excels at negotiating successfully , as he revealed in his best selling book , \u2018 Surrender is not an Option , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Pillsbury said .\nFrank Gaffney , president of the conservative Center for Security Policy , praised Mr. Bolton \u2019 s selection as much more than a \u201c changing of the guard . \u201d\n\u201c It is a sea change , one that holds promise of allowing Mr. Trump to accomplish his national security and foreign policy objectives , rather than endlessly contend with them being sabotaged by his own insubordinate subordinates . \u201d\nAlong with the proposed replacement of the cautious Rex Tillerson at the State Department by CIA Director Mike Pompeo , Mr. Trump \u201c will have actual adults [ in his administration ] who actually want him to succeed . Hallelujah , \u201d Mr Gaffney said in a statement .\nBut others are far less optimistic about the transition from Gen. McMaster to Mr. Bolton , set to become official April 9 .\nWhile Mr. Bolton , currently a senior fellow with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute , has long enjoyed the support of GOP hawks by advocating aggressively for Washington to clarify who its enemies are and to be on a war footing against nations like North Korea and Iran , his positions are a source of deep unease for the left \u2014 and for many libertarians .\n\u201c Americans who voted for Donald Trump believing he would be disinclined to start new wars should be puzzled by his decision to tap John Bolton as his third national security adviser , \u201d says Christopher A. Preble , the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute .\n\u201c The rest of us should be concerned , \u201d Mr. Preble wrote in a blog posted Friday on the Institute \u2019 s website , adding that \u201c Bolton has been one of the most reliably hawkish voices in American politics in recent memory . \u201d\n\u201c His faith in the utility of force , and his general disdain for diplomacy , is legendary \u2014 and apparently hasn \u2019 t been shaken by the wars of the recent past , \u201d wrote Mr. Preble , noting that \u201c most Americans \u2014 67 percent in a recent poll \u2014 believe that the Iraq war failed to advance \u2014 or , worse , undermined \u2014 American security . \u201d\nMr. Bolton , who years ago advocated in favor of the sacking Baghdad , \u201c appears to agree with the mere 22 percent of Americans who think that that war made things better , \u201d Mr. Preble wrote .\nWithin hours of Thursday \u2019 s announcement of Mr. Bolton \u2019 s pick , The New York Times published an editorial suggesting the development will derail the fragile chance of diplomacy with North Korea , highlighted by Mr.Trump \u2019 s surprise decision earlier this month to meet Mr. Kim face-to-face before the end of May .\n\u201c Bringing on the fiery Mr. Bolton now , at a delicate moment with North Korea , is a terrible decision , \u201d the editorial argued . \u201c While Mr. Trump has often threatened North Korea with military action , he accepted Mr. Kim \u2019 s invitation to a summit , brokered by South Korea \u2019 s president , who is eager for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis . \u201d\n\u201c Mr . Bolton , by contrast , told Fox News earlier this month that talks would be worthless and has called South Korean leaders \u2018 putty in North Korea \u2019 s hands . \u2019 \u201d\nThe paper added that Mr. Bolton \u201c has argued for attacking North Korea to neutralize the threat of its nuclear weapons , which could set off a horrific war costing thousands of lives . \u201d\nBut one former high-level American intelligence official , who spoke on condition of anonymity with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 recently , argued that Mr. Kim very likely perceives Mr. Bolton to have influence in Washington at the moment , and saw him \u2014 even prior to Thursday \u2019 s development \u2014 as someone who could seriously impact Trump administration policy toward Pyongyang .\nThe former official went so far as to say they believed Mr. Bolton \u2019 s recent advocacy for a pre-emptive U.S. military strike against North Korea directly contributed to motivating Mr. Kim \u2019 s reported offer in early March to halt all nuclear and missile tests in pursuit of diplomacy with Washington .\nAt issue is a February 28 op-ed published by The Wall Street Journal , in which Mr. Bolton argued that despite North Korea \u2019 s \u201c propaganda \u201d around recent diplomacy with South Korea , the nuclear threat emanating from Pyongyang remains \u201c imminent \u201d and that Washington should be seriously weighing a strike against North Korean nuclear facilities .\n\u201c In contemporary times , Israel has already twice struck nuclear-weapons programs in hostile states : destroying the Osirak reactor outside Baghdad in 1981 and a Syrian reactor being built by North Koreans in 2007 , \u201d Mr. Bolton wrote . \u201c This is how we should think today about the threat of nuclear warheads delivered by ballistic missiles . \u2026 It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018 necessity \u2019 posed by North Korea \u2019 s nuclear weapons by striking first . \u201d\n\u201c Given the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea , we should not wait until the very last minute , \u201d he wrote . \u201c That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons , a much more dangerous situation . \u201d\nWhat remains to be seen is whether he plans to further that argument once inside the White House .\nHaving served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006 in the George W. Bush administration , and as undersecretary of state for arms control and international security from 2001 to 2005 , Mr. Bolton is no rookie to the kinds of internal fights that go on in an administration . Earlier in his career , he worked in under President Reagan as a policy official at USAID .\nBut how he goes about the pursuit of such ideas as pre-emptive military strikes is likely to make or break his effectiveness as Mr. Trump \u2019 s national security advisor , according to some former officials .\n\u201c Bolton may not be effective in the role if he reverts to the aggressive and ideological approaches that made him the darling of the right and the President in the first place , \u201d says Michael Green , senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .\nMr. Green was a director for Asian affairs on President Bush \u2019 s national security council during the early 2000s when Mr. Bolton was working on arms control at the State Department . \u201c Bolton is always a smart and unrelenting advocate for his own position , but at the State Department he developed a reputation for bomb-throwing and not consensus-building . This will not work at the NSC , \u201d Mr. Green wrote in a blog published Friday by the Lowy Institute , a Sydney , Australia-based think tank .\n\u201c [ He ] will also find the White House Situation Room a very different setting than the Fox News studio when it comes to advocating military strikes on North Korea or immediate cancellation of the Iran nuclear deal , particularly when he has two combat-experienced Marines \u2014 Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford \u2014 sitting to his immediate right , \u201d Mr. Green wrote .\nAs for those who support for Mr. Bolton , Mr. Pillsbury told The Times : \u201c I first met him in the Reagan Administration in 1981 when he revolutionized our foreign aid program while a senior official at USAID because he required foreign aid recipients to expand free markets and the private sector . \u201d",
