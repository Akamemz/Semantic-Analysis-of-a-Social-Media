    "content": "President Donald Trump has terminated his long-troubled voter fraud commission .\nOn Wednesday , the White House released a statement saying that Trump had \u201c signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission , \u201d tasking the Department of Homeland Security \u201c to review these issues and determine next courses of action . \u201d\nStates \u2019 resistance to the commission appeared to force its demise . The White House said that \u201c many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry. \u201d So the White House backed off , arguing that it was better than the alternative of \u201c endless legal battles at taxpayer expense . \u201d\nIn June , the commission sent requests to states asking for all voters \u2019 names , party IDs , addresses , and even the last four digits of their Social Security numbers , among other information . The request was so sweeping that more than 40 states , led by Democrats and Republicans , at the time partly or fully rejected it as federal overreach .\nThen , in July , the commission also posted the full emails that critics , including private citizens , had sent the commission , leaving sensitive personal information uncensored \u2014 such as names , phone numbers , and addresses . That led to more criticisms , including from Democratic senators .\nActivists had long worried that the White House commission would use concerns about supposed voter fraud to propose new measures making it more difficult to vote . Citing voter fraud , Republicans at the state level have enacted new restrictions , such as strict photo ID rules , that disproportionately hinder minority and Democratic voters \u2014 which critics characterize as voter suppression .\nThe commission was headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach , the latter of whom has a particularly prominent history of advocating for new restrictions on voting .\nThe White House claimed in its latest statement that there is \u201c substantial evidence of voter fraud , \u201d even though it has provided no such evidence . Trump similarly claimed on Twitter , without any evidence whatsoever , that \u201c millions \u201d of people voting illegally had cost him the popular vote in the 2016 election .\nHere \u2019 s the thing : There is absolutely zero evidence for anything Trump has claimed .\nTrump \u2019 s main source for his claims is an old Pew report , whose authors have repeatedly said that it does not support Trump \u2019 s claim at all . That report doesn \u2019 t even look at voter fraud , but rather at America \u2019 s lackluster technology for registering voters .\nMore broadly , respected research on voter fraud has found again and again that it \u2019 s extremely rare in the US . At most , there might be a few hundred fraudulent votes in national elections \u2014 in which well over 100 million people can vote .\n\u201c The claim that there were millions of illegal voters in this past election is false and unsupported by any credible evidence , \u201d Rick Hasen , a professor of law and political science at the University of California Irvine , previously wrote . \u201c The National Association of Secretaries of State , made up of the chief election officers of all 50 states , just issued a statement saying so . \u201d\nThe research is clear : Voter fraud is rare to nonexistent\nThere have been multiple investigations \u2014 by academics , journalists , and nonpartisan think tanks \u2014 into voter fraud . None have found evidence of anything close to millions of people voting illegally , as Trump has alleged .\nLoyola Law School professor Justin Levitt studied voter impersonation , the type of fraud that strict voter ID laws ( which Trump supports ) aim to curtail . Levitt found 35 total credible accusations between 2000 and 2014 , constituting a few hundred ballots at most . During this 15-year period , more than 800 million ballots were cast in national general elections and hundreds of millions more were cast in primary , municipal , special , and other elections .\nA 2012 investigation by the News21 journalism project looked at all kinds of voter fraud nationwide , including voter impersonation , people voting twice , vote buying , absentee fraud , and voter intimidation . It confirmed that voter impersonation was extremely rare , with just 10 credible cases .\nBut the other types of fraud weren \u2019 t common either : In total , the project uncovered 2,068 alleged election fraud cases from 2000 through part of 2012 , covering a time span when more than 620 million votes were cast in national general elections alone . That represents about 0.000003 alleged cases of fraud for every vote cast , and 344 fraud cases per national general election , in each of which between 80 million and 135 million people voted . The number of fraudulent votes was a drop in the bucket .\nWhat \u2019 s more , not all \u2014 maybe not even half \u2014 of these alleged fraud cases were credible , News21 found : \u201c Of reported election-fraud allegations in the database whose resolution could be determined , 46 percent resulted in acquittals , dropped charges or decisions not to bring charges . \u201d\nAnother , more recent investigation in North Carolina by the State Board of Elections similarly found just one \u2014 out of nearly 4.8 million total votes in 2016 \u2014 credible case of in-person voter fraud . That amounts to just 0.00002 percent of all votes . Other types of fraud were very rare as well : Although there were more than 500 ineligible votes , the State Board of Election found that almost all of these were due to people negligently voting when they genuinely thought they were allowed to vote but legally weren \u2019 t . It was simply not the case that there were a lot of people trying to rig the election .\nTrump \u2019 s evidence for voter fraud is not actually evidence for voter fraud\nTrump and his team , in his defense , have cited a 2012 report from the Pew Center on the States as evidence for their claim . But the report didn \u2019 t even focus on voter fraud . Instead , it looked the technical aspects of voter registration systems , and how America could save money by upgrading how it registers voters .\nAs part of that , the Pew report found that more than 1.8 million registered voters were actually dead , while 2.75 million had registrations in more than one state . This is where Trump apparently got his \u201c millions \u201d figure .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean that even one of these registrations was used for illegal votes . America has a multi-step system for voting : You register , then vote . The report only shows that people registered and were never taken off the rolls . They didn \u2019 t even have to register for the latest election \u2014 some of them registered for the 2008 election , then died or moved , and states just didn \u2019 t take them off their rolls . So someone could have registered in Ohio in 2008 , moved to Pennsylvania by 2012 , and simply forgotten to notify Ohio \u2019 s elections system that he had moved \u2014 even though he never had any intention of voting in Ohio again .\nFor example , Steve Bannon , Trump \u2019 s former chief strategist , reportedly voted for Trump in New York . But it turns out that he was also still registered to vote in Florida in 2016 , because he never officially deregistered in the Sunshine State , even though he didn \u2019 t vote there .\nAnd David Becker , who worked on the 2012 Pew report , unequivocally said that the report found \u201c zero evidence of fraud . \u201d\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean voter fraud has never happened and never had an impact . The New York Times , for instance , reported on a 1997 case in which it was revealed that Miami Mayor Xavier Su\u00e1rez clinched his electoral victory \u201c with the help of hundreds of absentee ballots bearing the names of dead people , felons and other ineligible voters. \u201d While Su\u00e1rez was never charged , he was eventually forced to step down from office after an appellate court threw out the absentee ballots .\nBut this type of situation , the empirical evidence and experts suggest , is likely far too rare to swing much bigger elections . When debating whether to do something about voter fraud , then , it \u2019 s important to consider whether the potential downsides \u2014 such as making it harder for people of color to vote or sowing doubt in US elections \u2014 are worth the upside of stopping a tiny number of fraudulent votes . Otherwise , you might get prominent politicians like Trump casting doubt on the entire electoral process .\nThe voter fraud myth has been used repeatedly to suppress voters\nIt would be one thing if this were just a ridiculous myth that the president was shouting into Twitter or a powerless commission was chasing down . But this exact myth of widespread voter fraud has repeatedly led to actual changes in law and policy .\nNotably , Trump isn \u2019 t the first Republican , or even Republican presidential candidate , to raise concerns about supposed voter fraud .\nIn 2008 , many Republicans and conservative media outlets like Fox News promoted fears that ACORN , a community organization that focused in part on registering African-American voters , was engaging in mass-scale election fraud . At the time , Republican nominee John McCain warned that ACORN \u201c is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. \u201d ( Again , there was zero evidence of this , and it did not happen . )\nAnd the myth that undocumented immigrants in particular are voting illegally has been promoted for years by right-wing conspiracy websites like Infowars \u2014 citing a highly criticized 2014 report , even though one of its authors has said it didn \u2019 t find proof of widespread voter fraud .\nTouting these kinds of concerns , 23 states have enacted new voting restrictions \u2014 from strict photo ID requirements to new limits on early voting \u2014 since the end of 2010 , according to the Brennan Center for Justice .\nRepublican leaders have also embraced other tactics that limit people \u2019 s ability to vote , including purging voter rolls , going after voter registration groups , and closing down polling places . These efforts were all emboldened by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that weakened the Voting Rights Act , which banned discrimination at the voting booth , by limiting federal oversight of changes certain states make to their voting laws .\nStates \u2019 measures typically target voter impersonation . They require a certain kind of ID to vote ; Texas , for example , allows government-issued IDs ( including concealed gun permits ) but not student IDs . This , obviously , makes it much harder for someone to impersonate another voter , although it can also make it much harder for someone to vote if they don \u2019 t have the time or resources to obtain a proper ID .\nBut states \u2019 voting restrictions can also take other steps that don \u2019 t seem to target fraud so much as make voting more difficult . North Carolina \u2019 s law , for example , also eliminated some early voting days , ended same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting , and stopped the preregistration of 16- and 17-year-olds in the state . ( North Carolina \u2019 s law was ultimately struck down by courts . )\nRepublicans , who tend to push for these laws at the state level , nonetheless insist that their goal is to limit voter fraud . And for years , they have echoed rhetoric like McCain \u2019 s and Trump \u2019 s to convince people that voter fraud really is a big problem that requires burdensome laws to fix .\nA previous report by the US Department of Justice captured the sentiment among many Republicans : Rep.\ufeff Sue Burmeister , a lead sponsor of Georgia \u2019 s voter restriction law , told the Justice Department that \u201c if there are fewer black voters because of this bill , it will only be because there is less opportunity for fraud . [ Burmeister ] said that when black voters in her black precincts are not paid to vote , they do not go to the polls. \u201d Other Republicans , such as former North Carolina Gov . Pat McCrory and Iowa Rep. Steve King , have similarly warned about the dangers of voter fraud .\nSo as much as Trump is a political aberration in many respects , he really isn \u2019 t out of line with the typical Republican rhetoric on voter fraud . Still , that doesn \u2019 t diminish the very real consequences of his rhetoric .\nNot only did Trump \u2019 s words cast doubt on the entire electoral system in the US \u2014 a system that relies largely on people believing that it \u2019 s fair \u2014 but critics long worried that Trump could use his claims and commission to justify a crackdown .\nAn investigation could have done some good . Hasen noted that if it , like past investigations into election issues in 2000 , 2004 , and 2008 , took a nonpartisan approach with a commission of election experts from both political parties , it could have helped get to the bottom of all of these issues and finally put them to rest . But he cautioned that \u201c there is no reason to believe that any investigation Trump orders would be fair and a search for the truth . \u201d\nLevitt of Loyola Law School agreed , arguing that Trump \u2019 s investigation seemed more about looking for facts that prove his argument rather than getting to the truth of the matter . \u201c Normally I have more confidence in the integrity of an investigation that doesn \u2019 t announce the conclusion before the investigation starts , \u201d he previously told me . \u201c It sure looks like there \u2019 s an answer that there \u2019 s now to be an investigation to find the facts for . \u201d\nFor example , if the commission had found , as the 2012 Pew report did , that there are millions of outdated voter registrations , Trump and Republicans could have stretched that finding to justify a national voter ID law or mass purge of the voter rolls .\nWhen states have done the latter , it \u2019 s led to many legitimate voters losing access to the ballot without any notification , simply because they didn \u2019 t update their addresses or didn \u2019 t read their mail , or officials used faulty databases for their purges .\nAnd if Trump wanted to pursue a massive voter purge , he could , citing his fear of undocumented immigrants voting , use an existing federal database for it : the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database ( SAVE ) , which is used to identify immigrants eligible for social services .\nStates like Colorado , Florida , Iowa , and North Carolina have tried to use SAVE in the past for voter purges . But the Obama administration warned that the database wasn \u2019 t designed for it and could mistakenly flag immigrants who \u2019 d since become US citizens \u2014 which is exactly what happened . The result : Potentially thousands of people were wrongly removed from the voter rolls . Many more could be wrongly removed if Trump took a similar path .\nThis was the kind of problem that advocacy groups were worried about .\n\u201c The President swore to uphold the Constitution just five days ago . That includes the right to vote . That is what the highest officials in the land should preserve , protect , and defend . The stakes for democracy couldn \u2019 t be higher , \u201d Brennan Center for Justice president Michael Waldman previously said in a statement . \u201c There is no evidence of massive voter fraud \u2014 none . The notion that millions of people voted illegally two months ago , and nobody noticed , is preposterous on its face . Election officials , leaders of the President \u2019 s own party , and every academic and journalistic investigation confirm this . \u201d\nAnd based on the evidence , minority voters \u2014 who are , conveniently for Trump , more likely to vote Democrat \u2014 would very likely suffer the worst of these consequences .\nRepublican-backed voting restrictions don \u2019 t affect everyone equally . Time and time again , the evidence has shown that they tend to keep eligible minority voters in particular from casting a ballot \u2014 and Republicans have at times admitted that this was their intent .\nSome studies suggest voter ID laws make it particularly harder for black and brown Americans to vote . One widely cited 2006 study by the Brennan Center found voter ID laws , for instance , disproportionately impacted eligible black voters : 25 percent of black voting-age citizens did not have a government-issued photo ID , compared with 8 percent of white voting-age citizens . And a study for the Black Youth Project , which analyzed 2012 voting data for people ages 18 to 29 , found 72.9 percent of young black voters and 60.8 percent of young Hispanic voters were asked for IDs to vote , compared with 50.8 percent of young white voters .\nOne reason for these kinds of numbers is disparate enforcement \u2014 polling officials , perhaps driven by racial biases , appear more likely to ask minority voters for an ID .\nBut minority voters are also generally hit harder by voter ID laws and other restrictions on voting . For example , since minority Americans are less likely to have flexible work hours or own cars , they might have a harder time affording a voter ID or getting to the right place ( typically a DMV or BMV office ) to obtain a voter ID , rely more on early voting opportunities to cast a ballot , or require a nearby voting place instead of one that \u2019 s a drive , instead of a walk , away from home or work .\nSimilar issues could apply to voter purges . Vanita Gupta , president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights , previously explained : \u201c Here \u2019 s how the government will use voters \u2019 data . It will create a national database to try to find things like double-voters . But the commission won \u2019 t be able to tell two people with the same name and birthday apart . Such errors will hit communities of color the hardest . Census data shows that minorities are overrepresented in 85 of the 100 most common last names . \u201d\nFor civil rights groups , the new restrictions and efforts call back to the days of poll taxes , literacy tests , and other rules that were imposed to block minorities from voting until the Voting Rights Act effectively banned such laws . Like modern voting restrictions , the old laws didn \u2019 t appear to racially discriminate at face value . But due to selective enforcement and socioeconomic disparities , they disproportionately kept out black voters .\nAgain , minority voters tend to lean Democratic . So Republicans are also effectively making it harder for the opposition party \u2019 s voters to vote .\nSome Republicans have even admitted that this is the goal of the new wave of voting restrictions . As William Wan reported for the Washington Post :\nLongtime Republican consultant Carter Wrenn , a fixture in North Carolina politics , said the GOP \u2019 s voter fraud argument is nothing more than an excuse . `` Of course it \u2019 s political . Why else would you do it ? '' he said , explaining that Republicans , like any political party , want to protect their majority . While GOP lawmakers might have passed the law to suppress some voters , Wrenn said , that does not mean it was racist . `` Look , if African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican , they would have kept early voting right where it was , '' Wrenn said . `` It wasn \u2019 t about discriminating against African Americans . They just ended up in the middle of it because they vote Democrat . ''\nThe US Department of Justice is supposed to act as a check on these kinds of voter suppression efforts . But under Republican administrations , the agency has approached voting rights cases with a lack of serious interest \u2014 with the Bush administration in particular known for effectively treating civil rights enforcement as a joke .\nWith Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who has opposed key parts of the Voting Rights Act throughout his career , the Trump administration looks poised to take a careless approach . In fact , it might even set aside resources toward supporting states \u2019 voter suppression efforts by dedicating time and money to investigating and cracking down on supposed voter fraud .\nOne silver lining is that the research shows that voter ID laws and other voting restrictions have a fairly small overall impact on elections , at most reducing turnout by a percentage point or two .\nBut even if voting restrictions don \u2019 t have a big effect on the ultimate outcome of elections , they still appear to disproportionately keep minority voters from exercising their most basic democratic right \u2014 a problem no matter how you slice it . And it \u2019 s a problem that \u2019 s perpetuated through a total myth : a false claim that there \u2019 s a lot of voter fraud in America when the evidence simply shows otherwise .",

None have found evidence of anything close to millions of people voting illegally, as Trump has alleged.\n\nLoyola Law School professor Justin Levitt studied voter impersonation, the type of fraud that strict voter ID laws (which Trump supports) aim to curtail. Levitt found 35 total credible accusations between 2000 and 2014, constituting a few hundred ballots at most. During this 15-year period, more than 800 million ballots were cast in national general elections and hundreds of millions more were cast in primary, municipal, special, and other elections.\n\nA 2012 investigation by the News21 journalism project looked at all kinds of voter fraud nationwide, including voter impersonation, people voting twice, vote buying, absentee fraud, and voter intimidation. It confirmed that voter impersonation was extremely rare, with just 10 credible cases.\n\nBut the other types of fraud weren\u2019t common either: In total, the project uncovered 2,068 alleged election fraud cases from 2000 through part of 2012, covering a time span when more than 620 million votes were cast in national general elections alone. That represents about 0.000003 alleged cases of fraud for every vote cast, and 344 fraud cases per national general election, in each of which between 80 million and 135 million people voted. The number of fraudulent votes was a drop in the bucket.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, not all \u2014 maybe not even half \u2014 of these alleged fraud cases were credible, News21 found: \u201cOf reported election-fraud allegations in the database whose resolution could be determined, 46 percent resulted in acquittals, dropped charges or decisions not to bring charges.\u201d\n\nAnother, more recent investigation in North Carolina by the State Board of Elections similarly found just one \u2014 out of nearly 4.8 million total votes in 2016 \u2014 credible case of in-person voter fraud. That amounts to just 0.00002 percent of all votes. Other types of fraud were very rare as well: Although there were more than 500 ineligible votes, the State Board of Election found that almost all of these were due to people negligently voting when they genuinely thought they were allowed to vote but legally weren\u2019t. It was simply not the case that there were a lot of people trying to rig the election.\n\nTrump\u2019s evidence for voter fraud is not actually evidence for voter fraud\n\nTrump and his team, in his defense, have cited a 2012 report from the Pew Center on the States as evidence for their claim.

Otherwise, you might get prominent politicians like Trump casting doubt on the entire electoral process.\n\nThe voter fraud myth has been used repeatedly to suppress voters\n\nIt would be one thing if this were just a ridiculous myth that the president was shouting into Twitter or a powerless commission was chasing down. But this exact myth of widespread voter fraud has repeatedly led to actual changes in law and policy.\n\nNotably, Trump isn\u2019t the first Republican, or even Republican presidential candidate, to raise concerns about supposed voter fraud.\n\nIn 2008, many Republicans and conservative media outlets like Fox News promoted fears that ACORN, a community organization that focused in part on registering African-American voters, was engaging in mass-scale election fraud. At the time, Republican nominee John McCain warned that ACORN \u201cis now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.\u201d (Again, there was zero evidence of this, and it did not happen.)\n\nAnd the myth that undocumented immigrants in particular are voting illegally has been promoted for years by right-wing conspiracy websites like Infowars \u2014 citing a highly criticized 2014 report, even though one of its authors has said it didn\u2019t find proof of widespread voter fraud.\n\nTouting these kinds of concerns, 23 states have enacted new voting restrictions \u2014 from strict photo ID requirements to new limits on early voting \u2014 since the end of 2010, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nRepublican leaders have also embraced other tactics that limit people\u2019s ability to vote, including purging voter rolls, going after voter registration groups, and closing down polling places.

They require a certain kind of ID to vote; Texas, for example, allows government-issued IDs (including concealed gun permits) but not student IDs. This, obviously, makes it much harder for someone to impersonate another voter, although it can also make it much harder for someone to vote if they don\u2019t have the time or resources to obtain a proper ID.\n\nBut states\u2019 voting restrictions can also take other steps that don\u2019t seem to target fraud so much as make voting more difficult. North Carolina\u2019s law, for example, also eliminated some early voting days, ended same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting, and stopped the preregistration of 16- and 17-year-olds in the state. (North Carolina\u2019s law was ultimately struck down by courts.)\n\nRepublicans, who tend to push for these laws at the state level, nonetheless insist that their goal is to limit voter fraud.

Pat McCrory and Iowa Rep. Steve King, have similarly warned about the dangers of voter fraud.\n\nSo as much as Trump is a political aberration in many respects, he really isn\u2019t out of line with the typical Republican rhetoric on voter fraud. Still, that doesn\u2019t diminish the very real consequences of his rhetoric.\n\nTrump\u2019s investigation could have enabled national voting restrictions\n\nNot only did Trump\u2019s words cast doubt on the entire electoral system in the US \u2014 a system that relies largely on people believing that it\u2019s fair \u2014 but critics long worried that Trump could use his claims and commission to justify a crackdown.\n\nAn investigation could have done some good. Hasen noted that if it, like past investigations into election issues in 2000, 2004, and 2008, took a nonpartisan approach with a commission of election experts from both political parties, it could have helped get to the bottom of all of these issues and finally put them to rest. But he cautioned that \u201cthere is no reason to believe that any investigation Trump orders would be fair and a search for the truth.\u201d\n\nLevitt of Loyola Law School agreed, arguing that Trump\u2019s investigation seemed more about looking for facts that prove his argument rather than getting to the truth of the matter. \u201cNormally I have more confidence in the integrity of an investigation that doesn\u2019t announce the conclusion before the investigation starts,\u201d he previously told me. \u201cIt sure looks like there\u2019s an answer that there\u2019s now to be an investigation to find the facts for.\u201d\n\nFor example, if the commission had found, as the 2012 Pew report did, that there are millions of outdated voter registrations, Trump and Republicans could have stretched that finding to justify a national voter ID law or mass purge of the voter rolls.\n\nWhen states have done the latter, it\u2019s led to many legitimate voters losing access to the ballot without any notification, simply because they didn\u2019t update their addresses or didn\u2019t read their mail, or officials used faulty databases for their purges.\n\nAnd if Trump wanted to pursue a massive voter purge, he could, citing his fear of undocumented immigrants voting, use an existing federal database for it: the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database (SAVE), which is used to identify immigrants eligible for social services.\n\nStates like Colorado, Florida, Iowa, and North Carolina have tried to use SAVE in the past for voter purges. But the Obama administration warned that the database wasn\u2019t designed for it and could mistakenly flag immigrants who\u2019d since become US citizens \u2014 which is exactly what happened. The result: Potentially thousands of people were wrongly removed from the voter rolls. Many more could be wrongly removed if Trump took a similar path.\n\nThis was the kind of problem that advocacy groups were worried about.\n\n\u201cThe President swore to uphold the Constitution just five days ago. That includes the right to vote. That is what the highest officials in the land should preserve, protect, and defend. The stakes for democracy couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Brennan Center for Justice president Michael Waldman previously said in a statement. \u201cThere is no evidence of massive voter fraud \u2014 none. The notion that millions of people voted illegally two months ago, and nobody noticed, is preposterous on its face. Election officials, leaders of the President\u2019s own party, and every academic and journalistic investigation confirm this.\u201d\n\nAnd based on the evidence, minority voters \u2014 who are, conveniently for Trump, more likely to vote Democrat \u2014 would very likely suffer the worst of these consequences.\n\nVoter fraud fears can lead to racist consequences\n\nRepublican-backed voting restrictions don\u2019t affect everyone equally. Time and time again, the evidence has shown that they tend to keep eligible minority voters in particular from casting a ballot \u2014 and Republicans have at times admitted that this was their intent.\n\nSome studies suggest voter ID laws make it particularly harder for black and brown Americans to vote. One widely cited 2006 study by the Brennan Center found voter ID laws, for instance, disproportionately impacted eligible black voters: 25 percent of black voting-age citizens did not have a government-issued photo ID, compared with 8 percent of white voting-age citizens. And a study for the Black Youth Project, which analyzed 2012 voting data for people ages 18 to 29, found 72.9 percent of young black voters and 60.8 percent of young Hispanic voters were asked for IDs to vote, compared with 50.8 percent of young white voters.\n\nOne reason for these kinds of numbers is disparate enforcement \u2014 polling officials, perhaps driven by racial biases, appear more likely to ask minority voters for an ID.\n\nBut minority voters are also generally hit harder by voter ID laws and other restrictions on voting. For example, since minority Americans are less likely to have flexible work hours or own cars, they might have a harder time affording a voter ID or getting to the right place (typically a DMV or BMV office) to obtain a voter ID, rely more on early voting opportunities to cast a ballot, or require a nearby voting place instead of one that\u2019s a drive, instead of a walk, away from home or work.\n\nSimilar issues could apply to voter purges. Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, previously explained: \u201cHere\u2019s how the government will use voters\u2019 data. It will create a national database to try to find things like double-voters. But the commission won\u2019t be able to tell two people with the same name and birthday apart. Such errors will hit communities of color the hardest. Census data shows that minorities are overrepresented in 85 of the 100 most common last names.\u201d\n\nFor civil rights groups, the new restrictions and efforts call back to the days of poll taxes, literacy tests, and other rules that were imposed to block minorities from voting until the Voting Rights Act effectively banned such laws. Like modern voting restrictions, the old laws didn\u2019t appear to racially discriminate at face value. But due to selective enforcement and socioeconomic disparities, they disproportionately kept out black voters.\n\nAgain, minority voters tend to lean Democratic. So Republicans are also effectively making it harder for the opposition party\u2019s voters to vote.\n\nSome Republicans have even admitted that this is the goal of the new wave of voting restrictions. As William Wan reported for the Washington Post:\n\nLongtime Republican consultant Carter Wrenn, a fixture in North Carolina politics, said the GOP\u2019s voter fraud argument is nothing more than an excuse. \"Of course it\u2019s political. Why else would you do it?\" he said, explaining that Republicans, like any political party, want to protect their majority. While GOP lawmakers might have passed the law to suppress some voters, Wrenn said, that does not mean it was racist. \"Look, if African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican, they would have kept early voting right where it was,\" Wrenn said. \"It wasn\u2019t about discriminating against African Americans. They just ended up in the middle of it because they vote Democrat.\"\n\nThe US Department of Justice is supposed to act as a check on these kinds of voter suppression efforts. But under Republican administrations, the agency has approached voting rights cases with a lack of serious interest \u2014 with the Bush administration in particular known for effectively treating civil rights enforcement as a joke.\n\nWith Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has opposed key parts of the Voting Rights Act throughout his career, the Trump administration looks poised to take a careless approach. In fact, it might even set aside resources toward supporting states\u2019 voter suppression efforts by dedicating time and money to investigating and cracking down on supposed voter fraud.\n\nOne silver lining is that the research shows that voter ID laws and other voting restrictions have a fairly small overall impact on elections, at most reducing turnout by a percentage point or two.\n\nBut even if voting restrictions don\u2019t have a big effect on the ultimate outcome of elections, they still appear to disproportionately keep minority voters from exercising their most basic democratic right \u2014 a problem no matter how you slice it. And it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s perpetuated through a total myth: a false claim that there\u2019s a lot of voter fraud in America when the evidence simply shows otherwise.",
