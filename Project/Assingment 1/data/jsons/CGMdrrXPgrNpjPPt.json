    "content": "On the 50th anniversary of his assassination , we look back at the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr .\nOn November 17 , 1957 , Martin Luther King , Jr. preached a sermon called `` Love Your Enemies '' at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery , Alabama . `` Love has within it a redemptive power . And there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals . That 's why Jesus says , 'Love your enemies . ' Because if you hate your enemies , you have no way to redeem and to transform your enemies . But if you love your enemies , you will discover that at the very root of love is the power of redemption , '' King preached .\nHis message was more than a spirited sermon . It was a belief that defined his leadership and became the crux of the civil rights movement .\nRev . Jesse Douglas , a civil rights leader , and King 's friend said , `` This person who was from the American Nazi Party called his [ MLK 's ] name . And when he turned around , he punched him in the face . The guys that were there \u2013 they were going to do him in . And Dr. King said , 'No , brethren , wait a minute , wait , wait \u2013 do n't harm him . He is the victim of the indoctrination of hate . ' ''\nAt the time , a reporter asked if King would press charges against the attacker .\n`` He felt that hate can not overpower hate . That only love can . If you 're going to fight hate with hate , you 're fighting a losing battle , '' Douglas said .\nDr. King 's example inspired peaceful protests across the country . It also exposed decades of social injustice , bringing blacks and whites together for a common cause .\n`` When America began to see racism , America , good-hearted people , began to say 'no , I do n't think so . This is not right . This is not good , ' '' said Alveda King , Martin Luther King 's niece .\n`` I just could n't understand why this was happening to the African American community , '' said Peggy Wallace Kennedy .\nPeggy had a unique view of racial prejudice . Her father was George Wallace \u2013 the man who won his bid for governor of Alabama on one promise : `` I say , 'Segregation now . Segregation tomorrow . Segregation forever . ' ''\nShe was 12 when her father , flanked by state troopers , blocked Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama . It was in direct defiance of President John F. Kennedy 's executive order to integrate schools and colleges .\n`` I loved my daddy more than anything in the world , '' Peggy said . `` I did not want him to stand in the schoolhouse door , but he did . I just thought it was wrong . I wanted to go up to these people and say , 'You deserve to be here . You should be here . ' But I could n't . ''\nThe standoff ended without incident when President Kennedy called in the National Guard . but the next time Governor Wallace tried to intervene , it did n't end so peacefully .\nOn March 7 , 1965 , 600 men and women started out on foot from Selma , Alabama to the state capitol in Montgomery to protest voter discrimination . On the far side of the Edmund Pettis Bridge , they were met and assaulted by state and local police .\nThe clash , known as Bloody Sunday , left one dead and dozens wounded . Wallace , who had ordered law enforcement to Selma , had to answer for the violence .\n`` Now , I 'm against violence , and I 'm just as sorry that anybody got hurt , '' Wallace said after the clash . `` My orders have always been to use a minimum amount of force . ''\n`` I would like to think that my father said , 'Do not attack the marchers . ' That 's what I would love to think , '' Peggy said .\nTwo weeks later , Martin Luther King , Jr. , along with other civil rights leaders and 25,000 protestors , made the 47-mile trek from Selma to Montgomery . The following August , President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into Law .\nOn April 4 , 1968 , Dr. Martin Luther King was shot to death on a hotel balcony in Memphis , Tennessee .\n`` I ca n't stand to talk about it . That 's how hurt I was , '' Rev . Jesse Douglas told us .\n`` I remember saying to my dad , ' I just hate white people ; they killed Uncle ML , ' '' Alveda King said . `` He said , 'wait a minute , wait a minute . White people did n't kill your uncle . ' He said , 'white people prayed with us , white people marched with us . White people go to jail with us , white people die with us . The devil killed your uncle . ' And I remember him saying that we have to love , we have to forgive , we have to love , we have to forgive . ''\n`` He did n't hate anyone , '' Douglas added . `` He saw this as a part of God 's plan because he knew his life might be snuffed out at any time . And he was ready for that . We were determined to give ourselves to helping to fulfill the dream . ''\nDr. King 's daughter , Bernice , who was only five years old when he was murdered , found herself struggling with anger as she entered her teen years .\n`` I remember distinctly in my heart feeling very angry . I was angry at white people because I felt they were responsible , '' Bernice King said . `` I was angry at black people because I felt like we had n't done enough to continue the work . I was angry at God because I felt He could have stopped it . My anger did turn to rage and bitterness and hate . I literally ended up hating all white people especially white men . ''\nBut as Bernice dealt with her own pain , Dr. King 's message of love and forgiveness would prevail \u2013 even in the hearts of those who were once his enemies .\nWhile campaigning for the presidency in May 1972 , George Wallace was shot four times at close range by a volunteer . The wounds left him permanently bound to a wheelchair . But that was n't the only change Peggy saw in her father in the years that followed .\n`` He realized , with his suffering and pain , how much suffering and pain he must have caused the African American community . He 'd talk about segregation , and he 'd talk about how wrong he was . He just wanted forgiveness , '' Peggy said .\n`` One Sunday , he asked his bodyguards , he said , ' I want you to take me to Dexter Avenue Church ' They took him down there unannounced . And they rolled his wheelchair down that middle aisle , and he sat there and asked that congregation to forgive him . And they did . It showed me what love and forgiveness are about . It filled my heart up . This was a very healing moment for him , '' she said .\nMeanwhile , Bernice 's heart was also changing . Ever since her father was killed , her mother , Coretta Scott King , had refused to give in to hatred .\n`` The Bible says , 'Do good to them that hate you . Bless them that curse you ' '' Bernice recalled . `` I saw her bless those that cursed her . Do good to those that hate her . And when she would say , ' I do n't hold grudges , ' I watched when people did very painful things to her that she just did n't hold it . She still loved them . It was just a powerful embodiment of Christ 's spirit in our home . ''\nHowever , it was n't until an interview on the James Robison Show in 2000 that Bernice 's healing finally began .\n`` In the middle of it , [ Robison ] said , 'Can I give you a hug ? ' Now internally I 'm like 'no ! ' . But my mother taught me better . So , I said 'sure ' and he gave me a hug and \u2013 it was one of the most genuine hugs I 've ever received . And that sounds , probably for most people , so simple and trite but it was very powerful because it began my healing process , '' Bernice said .\nThen , in 2013 , part of her father 's dream was fulfilled . Bernice King and Peggy Wallace Kennedy stood side-by-side as hundreds of thousands gathered to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King , Jr. 's iconic `` I Have a Dream '' speech .\n`` Being able to join as sister-to-sister with Peggy Wallace years later was like a moment of redemption , '' said Bernice .\n`` I hugged her and I said , ' I love you , Bernice . ' And she said , ' I love you , Peggy , ' '' Peggy remembered . `` And I thought at that moment about that line that Dr. King spoke about 'One day down in Alabama , I hope that little white girls and little black girls can hold hands like sisters down in Alabama . ' And I thought Dr. King and my father must be up there going 'How would we know that it would be our daughters that held hands as sisters down in Alabama ? ' ''\nMuch has been accomplished through the work and sacrifices of so many people . While there is more to be done , the solution is always the same .\n`` Only love can develop sensitivity in another person 's mind and heart , '' Jesse Douglas declared .\n`` It will never be legislating morality to such a point that people will do what is right unless you change the heart of the human being . '' Alveda King added . `` The human heart , once it confronts genuine love , forgiveness , repentance , it can change . And when that heart is genuinely surrendered to God , then we can learn and find what my uncle called : 'the strength to love . ' ''\n`` It 's who we are and how we live and lead our lives that causes true transformation , '' Bernice concluded . `` Dr. King changed people not just by his words . He did n't preach stuff that he did n't live , he lived it . We have to learn to hear the truth of God 's message and live it and embody it because that 's the light that the world desperately needs right now . It needs the spirit of Christ . People know the name of Jesus . They do n't know His spirit . And we must become His spirit . ''",
