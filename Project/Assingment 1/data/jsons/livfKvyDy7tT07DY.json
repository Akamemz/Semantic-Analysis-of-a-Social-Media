Neighbors had not provided any tips , he added .\nPolice had visited the home twice , authorities said Tuesday , once after Castro called about a fight in the street and another time to investigate Castro on an unrelated incident involving a child who had been left on a school bus .\nThe 2004 incident was the first of four exhibitions of `` bad judgment '' that led to Castro 's November firing by Cleveland 's school district , according to records released Tuesday night .\n`` He previously had been suspended for 60 days for leaving a child on a bus ; 60 days for making an illegal U-turn in rush hour traffic with a bus load of students , and last school year for using the bus to do his grocery shopping , '' the letter recommending his dismissal states . His firing came after he had left his bus unattended outside a school after his preschool routes had been canceled , without notifying his dispatcher or depot .\nTito DeJesus , a bandmate of Castro 's , said he had been inside the bass player 's home once , about two years ago , to help deliver a washer and dryer he 'd sold to the suspect and saw `` a normal environment .

Ryan , CEO of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children .\n`` To us at the National Center , this is not something that we find shocking any more , '' he said . `` The fact is , we have seen more and more long-term missing cases end up in the victim being rescued many years after their original abduction . ''\nThe most widely reported such incident in recent years was that of Jaycee Dugard , who was freed in 2009 after 18 years of captivity behind the home of a California couple .\nIn another case , Ryan said last year a 43-year-old man was found and reunited with his mother after being abducted at the age of 2 .\nMore than anything , the three victims need privacy and time with family members , said Elizabeth Smart , who was in the headlines in 2002 when she was kidnapped from her Utah home at age 14 and held captive for nine months .\n`` I want them to know that nothing that has happened to them will ever diminish their value and it should never hold them back from doing what they want to do , '' Smart told CNN 's `` The Situation Room . ''\nThe women should not feel pressure to speak publicly about their ordeal , Smart said , adding that time will help them heal . `` It 's just incredible they are walking away from this horrendous nightmare , alive and safe today , '' she said .\nInvestigators had previously speculated that the disappearances of Berry , DeJesus and another girl , 14-year-old Ashley Summers , may have been connected .

Eakin is now a case manager at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children , which in 2008 held a comprehensive review of the cases with the FBI and Cleveland police .\nNow the Summers family is hoping that the Cleveland investigation will yield information about Ashley , her aunt , Debra Summers , said .\nAnderson , the spokeswoman for the Cleveland FBI office , said investigators will question the three women found Monday in the hope that they know something about Summers ' disappearance .\nOf the three brothers arrested , Ariel Castro was the only one to live at the home where the three women were apparently held , police said . The others lived elsewhere in the city .\nTheir uncle , Julio Castro , told CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 '' on Monday that his family had grown up in the same west Cleveland neighborhood and knew the Georgina DeJesus family .\nJulio Castro told CNN 's Martin Savidge on Tuesday that family members were `` surprised '' over the developments .\n`` Shame on you , '' Julio Castro said , when asked what he would say to his nephews .",
