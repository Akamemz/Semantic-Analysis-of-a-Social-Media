Today she 's getting fish , green beans and spinach , along with a chicken sandwich , fruit , salad , juice and a bagel .\nYowell , 82 , says the service is a lifeline , especially after she had spinal surgery last August . Without the help , she says , `` I would n't be back in my house . I 'd be in assisted living , and I do n't think I would last very long in a place like that . ''\nThat 's the case for many of the millions of seniors who are served by Meals on Wheels nationwide . Jill Feasley , who runs the Takoma Park program , says most of her clients are homebound and alone . They need both food and someone to check in on them .\nBut if automatic spending cuts go into effect this Friday , the Obama administration warns , seniors could get 4 million fewer meals this year alone .\nStill , Feasley says her program `` would n't feel the cuts immediately . '' Federal funds cover only about one-quarter of her costs , she says , so she has a little flexibility .\n`` I can dance a lot of dances , '' Feasley says . `` I can try and raise more money from private donations . I can try and serve more hamburger . '' Anything , she says , to avoid cutting actual meals .\nFeasley does worry what the budget impasse will mean for her ability to raise funds in this Washington , D.C. , suburb . Many of her donors are government workers and are facing potential furloughs if the sequester kicks in .\nEllie Hollander , president and CEO of the Meals on Wheels Association of America , says the sequester would be `` devastating .

Hollander thinks as many as 19 million meals could be lost .\n`` I can tell you , people are feeling it now , '' Hollander says . `` And a lot of that is just because of the uncertainty . And , you know , uncertainty leads to fear . ''\nAnd fear is what many groups serving the poor are reporting . For everything from Head Start and low-income housing to child care subsidies , advocates say across-the-board spending cuts mean that hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose benefits they need to get by .\nBut Republicans and others say these dire predictions are overblown and that they 're really an effort to generate public pressure on them to raise taxes and avert the sequester .\n`` We 're hearing that this is going to be massive , savage cuts , '' says Michael Tanner , a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute . `` We 're not even talking about actual cuts in spending .
